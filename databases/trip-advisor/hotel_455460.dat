<Content>Not regrets about being different Possibly the best validation of the high marks I have seen written about the Luxe Manor by previous clients on tripadvisor.com, was the praise of my boutique-hotel-weary wife.Most likely to gravitate to the larger hotels and known names in hospitality, she was really pleasantly surprised by the overall package; from the courteous and resourceful staff, to the great location, and everything in between.We made our booking through wotif.com, after discovering the other major websites were priced within HKD20 per night. We regularly use wotif.com, and have so far had satisfactory results with no screw-ups.We stayed at the LM for six nights. On arrival, we were upgraded from a Superior (240 sq feet) room to a Deluxe (320 sq feet) room (on the 6th floor)! This was an outstanding introduction, but meant we missed the opportunity to check out the smallest room in the hotel for when we inevitably return under less grand circumstances (read: not honeymoon).I am a breakfast type of guy and my wife is more of a late-starter. However, we rolled into the Aspasia restaurant (set out as a buffet for breakfast) at 10am most mornings, and never felt rushed by the staff to leave at 10:30 (breakfast closing time). In fact, food kept on being replenished the whole time, unlike other hotels that make closing time palpable, by loudly setting-down 30 minutes before closing. For me, a self-confessed continental breakfast afficianado, the range was about a 6 out of 10. There is a half-decent espresso machine, that is regularly emptied of spent pellets and cleaned, lovely bircher muesli, nice yoghurts, fresh tropical fruit salad, whole fruits (apples, pears, kiwi), juices and breads. Bacon, eggs, grilled vegetables and pastries also feature for people that enjoy a cooked breakfast. On Saturday morning, the restaurant was packed, so we shared a table with two other couples. No matter, it added to the fun, and the staff where meticulously mannered, as always.We dined at the LM's Italian-themed Aspasia restaurant on our second evening. It is apparently headed by a Michelin-starred chef. Three courses and HKD1200 later, we both left feeling quite unimpressed. I won't go into detail, but save your money and visit the restaurant strip which runs directly behind the LM., inhabitated by Italian, Thai, Modern Chinese, Indian, (etc, etc) restaurants of good quality.Sitting at HKG airport, I realise that I need to check in for the flight back to Sydney. If I get a chance to add to these comments soon, I will. I'm not normally one to bother commenting on something as commoditised as accommodation, but such was the impression made by the LM

<Content>Overall is good Exellent Location, only few steps away from Nathan road. Tsim Tsa Tsui metro station is about 300 m. but there is no view at all.. Although our room was premier it was tiny with a tiny double bed. We changed room to twin beds which was bigger. Our room was at 4th floor and the noise was unbearable at the night. Hotel and rooms are stylish and different. Cable Internet connection s 100 HKD per night.Staff is excellent. Hotel has a very good Italian restautrant. Breakfast has many choises. But If I go to HK again I'll choose a room with view and bigger rooms.

<Content>A good option I visit Hong Kong 3 or 4 times a year for business  normally stay over at the Hyatt, but decided to try The Luxe Manor after hearing some good things about the hotel.In terms of location, The Luxe Manor sits just off Nathan Road  is a short walk to the Tsim Sha Tsui MTR station. Kimberley Rd itself is safe  the neighbourhood has a great selection of restaurants  bars, particularly in the Knutsford Steps precinct behind the hotel.The hotel is compact, like everything in HK, but offers great decor which adds Dali-esque touches to its contemporary boutique aesthetic. The staff are accommodating  helpful as are the room keys which auto-select your room floor when you enter the elevator. The rooms are again fairly compact so my suggestion would be to go for the largest that the budget will accommodate. The superior rooms I saw looked like a single person option with very limited floor space, so maybe bear that in mind if you're a couple with plans for shopping. My (studio) room was clean, had great decor  an excellent bathroom with rain shower. The hotel offers complimentary breakfast  a nightly delivery of home-made sweets as part of the turn-down service, which is a nice touch. There is a (tiny) gym onsite, but a better option is the nearby Fitness First.If you're looking for something with more imagination  flair than your regular hotel, The Luxe Manor certainly delivers.

<Content>A great hotel! A great little hotel located about 10 mins walk from TST MRT station. I loved the kitsch dog lamps and big bureau housing the mini bar! The rooms are a little small, but are fine and make the most of the space with a flat screen tv and shower rooms without baths. The shower was excellent after a day wandering around in the heat of Hong Kong! We stayed for two weeks and always enjoyed coming back to the hotel about a long day of sightseeing! Breakfast can be a bit repetitive after two weeks but the food is always fresh and kept stocked. Staff at breakfast are polite and efficient, almost a little too efficient at the clearing away of plates! One of the best things about the hotel is the fact that it is quiet despite its location and its lack of package tour customers. Reception was generally quiet and breakfast did not turn into a scrum for the food. I would definitely stay here again if I were to go back to HK!

<Content>Brilliant hotel, shame there's no pool though. The easiest way to the hotel from the airport would be to take the free shuttle from Kowloon station. Unfortunately this shuttle is infrequent and doesn't run during late hours, so we took a taxi which whisked us there within 10 minutes.This hotel looks fabulous on the outside as well as on the inside. Located along the busy cafe-filled Kimberly Road and directly beneath trendy Knutsford Terrace, the hotel is in a comfortable in-between if you're looking for a weekend away without busting the bank to stay on Hong Kong island.The service here is good, proven especially by the restaurant staff who still served us despite being in the midst of shutting down the breakfast counter. The breakfast itself was average, but came inclusive with the rooms - I only stayed for 3 days so it wasn't quite enough time to get sick of the food.The rooms are very clean and perfect for maximum of 2 people (if more than 2 make sure you book one of the deluxe rooms!). The bathrooms are teeny but very well decorated. Absolutely love the shower's sparkly floors and the rain showerhead! View was nothing to speak of but if you really wanted view you'd have to pay a bomb at the intercontinental.Proximity to TST MTR is good which makes travelling anywhere easy!All in all a great place to stay apart from the lack of a pool - but on a weekend trip who has time to swim anyway?

<Content>Fantastic little hotel-recommended!!! My boyfriend and I spent New Years in Hong Kong and booked 6 nights at The Luxe. I had read good reviews on the tripadvisor website so was keen to see if it would meet my expectations.I have to say this boutique hotel is fabulous and overall exceeded my expectations (apart from a slight hiccup at the start!). Upon arrival we were presented with a standard room and although we were delighted with the funky decor-the room had a strong stench of smoke. Disappointed, I immediately went down to reception to complain that we had requested a NON smoking room and that this was not acceptable. The man at reception responded immediately apologising  and said he would find us a more suitable room and to wait at the room and he would return shortly. Within 5 mins he was back and said he had another standard room to show us. This room was on a higher floor with a better view and was much cleaner and fresher. We happily accepted the roomI!!I honestly can say this was the beginning of the exceptional service we recieved from the staff at The Luxe. Honestly they went out of there way to bring a smile to our face. Whenever we asked for room service, directions, restaurant recommnedations etc they were more than helpful to accomodate our requests. Once I accidently locked the room safe and couldnt remember the code. They had to get someone in to reset it and I was sure we would be charged extra, but they just laughed and said not to worry that it happens all the time-easily fixed!!We got the standard room and it was big enough for both of us and our luggage and we loved the little ornamantal lamps in the room, the plasma TV, and overall decor. Very funky  different. The rain shower in the bathroom was a delight! We also enjoyed the little afternoon snacks they would leave in our room. The location of the hotel is perfect and we found it central to everything in Kowloon. We were able to walk to all the sights. And there are plenty of great restuarants and bars around the hotel.Breakfast was ample and had a good selection. I liked being able to have my eggs freshly cooked the way I like them. There was not much other hot food but a plentiful selection of salmon, cheese, cold meats, cereals and fruit  yogurt. For us it was great and food was always fresh and regularly replenished. You must try the muesli-its delicious!!! The waiters were most helpful and recognised us each morning and saved our favourite table for us!In all we loved the Luxe Manor  Hong Kong and the 6 days we spent there. From the beginning the staff were so helpful and we felt like kings in our little funky posh pad!! If I had one minor complaint it would be that occasionally our swipe card would not work and had to be fixed at reception, but that was only a minor inconvenience. Other than that everything was wonderful.I would highly recommend this hotel experience.

<Content>Something different Stayed here for 3 nights on a stopover as we fancied something different to your usual large hotel.We had a deluxe room which was a good size. The room decoration was fun and kooky with great attention to detail.The staff were friendly but struggled a bit with english. We had some problems connecting to the hotel's Wifi, but they sent someone to sort it out very quickly. Fantastic location in Kowloon and nice breakfast.Tip - catch the free shuttle bus from the Airport Express train to get to the hotel.

<Content>Hotel is okay BUT there were hassles.. The hotel is nice, new and very modern. I was impressed with the interiors and the look of the hotel. Unfortunately, I found that the front desk staff were a little snobbish and not warm (compared to the other hotels) The just looked at us and waited for us to bring ourselves to the desk for assisstance. The door man/bell person did not even smile - AT ALL!! re: the luggage - I had to ask them how it will be brought up! They did not even ask us which lugages were ours! Tsk.. Tsk..I hated the fact that our room keys were not working! We had to go to the front desk every day at least 3x a day to have the keys validated/updated/scanned. There was one time on of the staff did not believe that the keys were not working!One thing I liked was the staff at the 1/F restaurant during breakfast - they were so friendly and helpful!! They were very attentive and so willing to help!!The location is alright. Could be better. But alright I guess. There are nearby shops (that are bridal shops!) traffic on the road where this hotel sits is quite heavy.

<Content>Not quite Saint Martin Lane London This hotel is about as far from a quality boutique hotel as you can get. You arrive and it all looks ok and then you meet the staff. Unfortunately, they think they own the place. A blank stare greets you. I don't know about you but I'm ready to slap any front of house staff that takes that tone. Don't arrive early because you will be promptly told to go for a walk until a room is available. Ok I understand that the rooms may not be available when you arrive at around 12.00 noon but normally you're politely asked to take a seat and relax until the room is ready. Why do these new boutique hotel always allow photo shoots to happen in their lobby when paying guest are arriving and would like to use the seating provided. The film crew had taken over the whole lobby and there was no where to sit. The rooms have nothing to do with S.Dali. He would roll over and die again if he knew his name was attached to this place. Dali's art was clever and resolved. The room we stayed in was silly and had been decorated by a uni student who liked the idea of creating some crazy. The restaurant operator is obviously not attached to the hotel. The breakfast was quite good. Yes the muesli is excellent. They should clean the domestic espresso machine though because the coffee become incredibly bitter if they are not pulled apart and washed thoroughly often. I've got the same one at home and if don't do this the coffee is terrible which was the case at the Luxe. Stick to the English Tea. We booked for 2 nights and got the hell out of there after one night.

<Content>Outstanding service Was so impressed by this hotel I wanted to make sure I wrote a review. After 12 hours on a plane from Europe we arrived before check-in only to have the staff try and find us a room early so we could freshen up. Outstanding. During our short stay I was constantly surprised by the level of service. Adaptors for appliances, no problem. Ironing board, no problem. Reservations and bookings, no problem. Wonderful. The decor as mentioned by others is certainly different. Not my cup of tea, but appreciated the individuality. Not sure what other reviewers were saying about the room size. I booked a Premier room (second smallest available) and it was more than ample. Definitely spacious enough for two people. Breakfast was also great. Lots of healthy selections as well as some hot offerings! Great location and for the price I would definitely stay there again. Book this hotel. You won't be disappointed.

<Content>Good Location My partner and I stayed at the Luxe Manor for 4 nights. The best thing about it is its location. Right smack in Kowloon, along Kimberly Road which is walking distance from malls, small street shops, and restaurants. The service was efficient, but was a bit disappointed when they couldnt really help me when I asked assistance for a birthday cake. The room was clean, decor was funky, but was a wee bit too tiny for us. My partner and I hardly fit in the small/soft double bed and our feet was always dangling...mind you, we are not big people. We couldnt even use the bathroom together without bumping into each other or without bumping into a corner. But it just made us laugh, we had comic moments. The breakfast was very simple, paper napkins, and food that didnt really require cooking skills..nothing fancy at all. They are also renovating, so the hammering and drilling woke us up every morning at 930am which wasnt too bad..it served as an alternate alarm clock since the alarm clock they gave us in the room wasnt working. Over all its a good hotel. I wasnt too disappointed. But its not what we expected from an SLH property.

<Content>Fantastic Service and Location My boyfriend and I stayed for 10 nights at the Luxe Manor and it was fantastic. The bus from the Airport Express stops directly outside and porters were extremely efficient. Check in was easy and we were shown directly to our room. The rooms look exactly like the pictures on the website but started to feel a bit small and cluttered once my shopping bags started collecting. The decor is whimsical and amusing and helped me remember I wasn't on a business trip. Although the amenities in this hotel would be great if I were.The room was clean and housekeeping were very good. The bathroom was well set up and looks great. just enough room for 2 people at once.Breakfasts were nice, served in a gorgeous room and great service. The breads and pastries were great and I enjoyed the smoked salmon and scrambled eggs each day. The staff were friendly and helpful, providing information for us and booking great tables at popular restaurants on busy nights.Fantastic Hotel with spectacular service.

<Content>Fabulous! On arrival at Hong Kong Airport I took the train to Kowloon Station and then the shuttle bus from there. Very easy.The Luxe Manor is in a very convenient location in Kowloon. Close to all the shopping and the subway. Staff were welcoming and efficient. I wish more hotels would take the Luxe's lead and include internet availability as an amenity not an extra.My first reaction on seeing the room was the designer had been on drugs. Very strong drugs!It may not be everyone's taste but it is great to see something different and I liked it. The room was small but very well designed, clean and efficient. I loved the bathroom.I used the gym. It's not for Arnold Schwarzenegger but it was enough for me.I thought breakfast was great and don't know what other reviewers were complaining about.I also had dinner at Aspasia. Expensive but outstanding service and one of the most delicious meals I've enjoyed in a long time. I can't wait to go back to the Luxe and highly recommend it.

<Content>Loved the Luxe Manor My sister and I stayed at the Luxe Manor in February - she stayed for 5 nights and I stayed for 2 before we moved to the Island. We have been to Hong Kong every year for about the last 20 years and nearly always split the trip between Kowloon and the Island side. We love both sides equally so this saves a lot of trips back and forwards.This was our first stay at the Luxe Manor and we both really loved it. Quirky is a good desciption. Compact rooms but we rarely spend a lot of time in the hotel rooms anyway. The location could not be faulted and the service was terrific. The breakfast room is lovely and whilst the selection is not huge we were more than satisfied each day. There is no view but that is why it is so reasonable. A very good value hotel unlike some of the other hotels we have stayed in previously. We do love 5 star but the value just isn't there when you spend all day out shopping and every evening at restaurants eating the amazing food. Knutsford Terrace with a good selection of restaurants is very close (although doesn't quite compare to Lan Kwai Fong on the island).

<Content>Great Value and Clean!!! This was a wonderful experience in a very busy city. The hotel is almost new. The decor is really out there and not my style, (i.e. ultra modern and artistic as decribed on thier web site) but immaculate and comfortable. We had a superior room that for Hong Kong (Kowloon) was a terrific buy at $173 per night. It included a very nice breakfast and wi fi. Location is superb for shopping and sightseeing. We also opted for the HK$550 limo service that they offered (@$USD70). It was only about $15 more than a taxi and they picked us up in a brand new Mercedes S class car, loaded our luggage from the airport to the car and put it in the lobby of the hotel for us to check in. After 15 hours of flying, it was a welcome experience and well worth the money. We thought is was a good enough value that we opted to do the same on the return. There is also a high speed train that is very reasonable, but we had 4 good size pieces of luggage so that was out for us. The hotel is wonderful, the personel are most helpful and speak English very well and the restaurant is top qualitiy, but not a great value. I recommed this hotel.

<Content>Great Location and good product The room was a bit on the small side, as mentioned in previous reviews, but fine in comparison to other big cities. We had a superior room and the design was quirky, good bathroom  shower and overall good facilities. Breakfast was good too, can't understand previous reviews, unless you expect a 'full English' fry up in Hong Kong. Nice scrambled eggs and smoked salmon, fresh juices, fresh yogurts and variety of cheeses. Excellent muesli choice too.Overall good experience and great location.

<Content>Great Location We have never been to Asia before and so didn't know what to expect. The Luxe Manor hotel is small, friendly, clean, comfortable, and located in a good spot for tourists. When we arrived we were told we had been upgraded to a larger room. The bedroom/storage was quaint and adequate, the bathroom/shower great. I wouldn't have liked to have been in a smaller room though, as there was not a great deal of space as it was. However, we soon got used to it and settled in (as you do after the first night!). Breakfast was limited but of high standard and fresh. The staff are all eager to please, and will offer good advice when planning your days activities. There is no bar if you like a nightcap. Always the mini-bar I suppose.Hong Kong is fab. There are lots of interesting things to do and places to visit. Just being there was exciting for us. Getting your bearings and getting to know how best to move around (MTR underground, cheap, reliable, quick, clean and busy) is fun. As with all cities the money you spend will depend on the choices you make. We ate in a couple of cheap chinese restaurants which were a little disappoining, but had great food elsewhere. There are so many places to eat in this vast city. Overall we had a fantastic stay. 5 nights was just enough.

<Content>unique! this hotel is indeed unique in decoration, very excellent in location (in between TST and Jordan station), and very clean.Overall, we were not dissapointed, except for one issue: we stayed there for 3 nights, enjoyed the service and desearts they provided every evening...except for the last night--there was no desert on the table, when we returned to the hotel at 10pm, and no complimentary bottle water. The staff were helpful, water was sent within 5 minutes. The same thing happened to our children's room that evening. Wonder what the problem was.But it is really a unique hotel, the decoration were eye opening, and breakfast was ok (tho' limited in choices).We would recommend this hotel to anyone that is fed up with the usual decoration of big chain hotel, which is always dull...

<Content>Great hotel!!! This hotel is really great.... unique style (a little bit like Versace style), great location for shopping (located directly in Kowloon where your credit card starts to glow), the rooms are new, very modern and absolutely perfect! Hotel staff does not speak English very well, but when I became ill (terrible influenza) they recommend a health center across the street as this only charges EUR 30 i/o EUR 300 if the hotel calls a doctor. This was really a great recommendation and 1 staff even accompanied us to the doctor.The little minus is the breakfast as the choice is quite poor, but they refill all plates very quickly. Great value for money!

<Content>Love the treats twice a day! The hotel decor is what attracted me to this hotel and the fact that they included breakfast in the price. I loved the hotel room and I found all the staff to be friendly and helpful.The treats left in the room were such a nice touch and very tasty.The shower was also really good.I thought the location was excellent. You could walk to nathan Road and Knutsford terrace had some really good restaurants and bars.Anyone going to Hong Kong should pick up the 3 day Octopus card at the airport as it is a must for travelling on the subway and getting on the airport express.

<Content>A perfect little hotel I have just returned from a stay at the Luxe Manor and wanted to let everyone know what a treat it was to stay at this boutique hotel. The individual touch was apparent and attention to detail was consistent from the unique design, the cleanliness and room service through to all interactions with the staff. It is apparent that the staff is well trained and very professional.The premier rooms are on the small side. Book the deluxe if you are two people with a lot of lugguge. If you have minimal luggage the premier would be fine. The Breakfast room was lovely and there was always a variety of food available. The location of the Hotel was great...easy walk to the MTR and to the waterfront, Star Ferry etc. I have tried to think of a criticism for this hotel and really could not find one.

<Content>The Luxe Manor - Unique Boutique Hotel Luxe Manor Hotel Kowloon9th to 16th November 2007We stayed in a Deluxe room which included breakfast, couldn't have asked for better service and friendliness from the staff. The decor of the hotel was unusual and interesting, the room was lovely, loved the 'rain' shower in the bathroom, very different. This hotel is very close to Nathan Road and also Knutsford Terrace which has a good selection of restaurants, it is also within walking distance of the harbour. The hotel only has 14 floors so if you don't like heights this hotel could be for you - highly recommend it. A trip to the Peak is a must, fantastic views, try to go both day and night you wont regret it.

<Content>Lovely! Great location, loved the decor and the little treats each daysent to the room were so nice! Would stay here again.Location was on Kimberly Road so all taxi driver's understoodwhere we needed to go if we said Kimberly Hotel...whichis right across the street. The street behind the hotel wasrestaurant row and we ate there several times. A Japaneserestaurant was close as well and food was great there too.

<Content>Luxe Manor fails to deliver MB Sydney, Australia We stumbled across the Luxe Manor and after reading the positive reviews decided to give it a try at the expense of the Grand Hyatt where we would normally stay whilst in HK. We payed for the top room- the Deluxe, in order to gain a bit more space and make the trip just that little more special. We checked in via the stuffy staff at reception and were taken to our room, a 3rd floor of 14 floors room which overlooked the aircon towers and the neighbouring building. I contacted reception prior to unpacking our bags thinking there must be some sort of mix up- we will try and sort something out sir was the response. To cut a long stort short, we did not hear from them again until we checked out and aside from breakfast which we rated as reasonable the place is lame. There is no Deluxe room, just a deluxe pricetag for a room which is no different to the others in the hotel. The service is average, the follow up non existent although the decor is somewhat funky and well done.If you want boutique that is done well ie/ Cote Cours hotels then you will sadly be disappointed with this Kowloon joke! 2 out of 10 and never again!

<Content>Fabulous Boutique Hotel Googling 'Boutique hotels' in Hong Kong I came across this gem and happily they had a 3 night special - the exact length of time I planned to stay. I'd always hoped to stay in one of the new style of modern 'designer' hotels and thought it beyond my reach - but this place is exceptional value. It has awesome decor (which admittedly will be very dated in 5 years' time - but right now, it's hot!) It is a true sanctuary, superbly located just a walk from the Star Ferry/ MTR etc. Stepping in off the busy street is such a relief. The staff - from the manager to the cleaners - are without fail polite, helpful and friendly. The rooms are funky, comfortable and spotless. Breakfast could be a little better, but that's about the only thing I could fault - the Luxe Manor is fantastic and a bargain - I won't be staying anywhere else in Hong Kong that is for sure.

<Content>A Feast in the Eye - The Luxe Manor Hotel HK Be impressed with the hotel's lobby - from the bell-adorned huge doors to the artsy mosaic floor, the unusual chandeliers and surreal sofas. The room decor and furnishing is funky, you will not mind the size of the room. Flat screen TV framed like a painting is creative and the faux fireplace is so cool. Bed linens are of high count to ensure sweet dreams. Bathroom design  fixtures are modern with clean, fluffy towels. Room amenities are complete - wifi internet connection, wireless phone - you can't ask more. Turn in service can't be more pleasing: it includes bite-size cookies and cakes for midnight cravings. The Aspasia restausrant is tastefully decorated and the food and service is superb. Just behind the hotel is Knutsford Terrace where you can find a variety of good restaurants and bars. Conveniently located, the Kowloon park (where you can go swimming in the public pools) is just a walking distance. So is the the TST MRT station, China Ferry terminal, star ferry terminal and the world of shopping. Best of all, it is moderately priced. This boutiqe hotel sure provides the best value! The interactive TV is not very user-friendly. No CNN, MTV or HBP/movie channel. It takes time for you to get used to security elevators wherein you have to swipe/flash you room card before you can take the lift. Very minor setbacks.I am recommending this boutique hotel to everyone who's wary of the usual, standard hotels in Hongkong. For a change, this hotel stirs up some excitement! Even their website is unique. Check it out!
