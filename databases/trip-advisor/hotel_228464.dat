<Content>good value hotel, but a 3-star rather than a 4-star in general Location wise, it's close to the metro, but it takes about 20 mins to or from the centre at least. Sometimes, we just didn't want to travel for this long because we were quite tired. If you want to get food quick, there's an underground supermarket just in the opposite side of the road in the residential estate, which is rather convenient. There is not anything else worth seeing around. They are mainly residential buildings and an open-spaced car park around the hotel.First impression of the hotel wasn't bad from the outside. Interior was not too bad for a cheap four-star hotel, but it was rather simple/cheap and basic for a normal four-star. I'd say it is really a 3-star hotel. Our experience with the staff for the whole stay was good. The most disappointed thing about the hotel was the facility provided in the room. The mini-bar only had a mini-fridge and 2 glasses. There was no kettle at all. Even the 3-star hotels I stayed in before had kettles!! I asked for a kettle, but they didn't understand this, so I didn't bother asking for one at the end. My husband and I did not really like the hard and thin pillow they provided. We didn't get good sleep the first 2 nights because it was so hard and thin. I felt like I was just sleeping on a few stack-up towels!Seeing these 2 important aspects that were not good in providing a basic, enjoying stay, I feel the toiletries they provided were a bit excessive. A sponge for shinning shoes and one other thing that I couldn't even remember that I didn't even find them in other 4-star hotels. Another thing that we were not too bothered about, but it would be good to have was the telly. We had telly in the room, but it couldn't receive any channels. We bought an Internet access card for 45 mins usage for 8 Euro. The computer desk and chairs were rather simple. It was in a cornor in the lounge area on the ground floor and there was only 1 computer and a printer (for all the guests usage?) We tried to print something but the printer only rolled and didn't print. There was probably no ink...?At some point, I did feel this hotel was a practice hotel for Barcelona University hotel management graduates, where their campus was just located opposite to the hotel courtyard. Although the campus does have its own entrance on the opposite side of the block for students but because the courtyard are connecting the hotel lounge and the back of the campus, and the reception for the exhibition was in the hotel lounge, some visitors who were going to an exhibition in the campus did have to go through the lounge area in the hotel first.Generally, the hotel room space  interior were OK, not bad staff service, but some important in-room facility was not good. For the price we paid, it was fair - we stayed for 3 nights and our third night was free because of promotion. The price we paid were only for room though. They charged about 13 euro each for a buffet breakfast. I couldn't make any comments on their breakfast because we didn't want to pay that much for it.However, we would not come back and stay in this hotel if we visit Barcelona again.

<Content>Excellent  We stay here for 4 nights at the end of October as I got a very good deal on lastminute.com. We were happy to sacifice not staying right in the city centre, to stay in a 4* hotel. I think we must have gotten the best room in the hotel (901) as it was on the top floor, on a corner, with only 1 other room sharing a hallway. The bed  bedroom was huge  the bathroom was too. The staff were very friendly  spoke excellent English. Always very helpful too. We usually broke our days into 2, leaving the hotel in the late morning or early afternoon, coming back for a rest then going out again at night. The room was a nice place to spend time in. Go to the supermarket down the road for yummy breads, cheeses etc for breakfast/snacks. We also purchased pay TV movie,  we were able to access the Pay TV for 24hrs+ afterwards so that was a good deal! I would not consider staying anywhere else in Barcelona if I ever go back there. The Alimara was tops!

<Content>exactly what we needed I took my partner to Barcelona for his birthday and booked flights and accomodation all through the same website and got a pretty good deal. We got the metro from the airport to the hotel which was really straight forward when you get hold of an undergound map. Just need to get the green line L3 to Mundet and the hotel is a about 100 yards away from here. There isn't any shops from what i could see surrounding the hotel but to be fair we didn't really look as it was so easy to jump straight on the metro and a few stops down you have restaurants, shops everything you need. The hotel staff were very friendly and spoke very good english. They were happy to help when we were looking for places to go and gave us a map to take away. The rooms were very clean and beds and towels changed daily. We didn't eat at the hotel as breakfast was 17 euros. Overall we were very happy staying at the hotel and would stay here again.

<Content>loved stay a bit out of the way Went to the Alimara hotel for 5 nights and had a lovely clean, big room, not exactly 4 * standard maybe 3* is more accurate. The main problem we faced was the total lack of food places near the hotel. After a long hot flight and travelling we went on search for food, to find out there is only 1 restaurant, which looks more like a run down shack. And one tiny shop which closes at like 7, which we just managed to get to. The metro stop is a 3 min walk which is perfect and 12 mins into las ramblas. The metro is fab, and v cheap. Good hotel for price we paid, no pool which was kinda sad.

<Content>On balance, good but not 4* As said elsewhere, the hotel is a bit out of the centre but easily accessible using the brilliant Metro. The staff do lighten up after a gag of two but initially seem a little surely. The hotel is owned by the University and attached to the school of turism running hotel managment / toursit degrees (tsk, don't they do real degrees in university anymore). I assume the staff are undergraduates getting experiernce. Our grumbles: Breakfast was closed at 9.30 on the dot, in fact 9:29 and 37 seconds. Don't be late or go hungary and don't try to gain access after this time or you will be shot or worse as an example to other would be have-a-go hero guests. You can get breakfasst around the corner but the area is residential / stundent accomadation so no cosy cafe's. It was a little difficult getting a cab at peak times. mini-bar was not exactly overflowing with bottles. On arrival, midnight from Girona airport, we had to share a beer as there was only one in the fridge. No pool.Likes: good size room, clean, felt safe and location near the metro station made it easy.It's a good functional and clean 3* rather than luxury 4*

<Content>Some of their front desk staff might ruin your holiday mood Even until the last date of our stay(We reserved 2 rooms month ago and they only gave us one room when checking in), none of the hotel staff talked to us directly / made an apology. They originally promised to refund the room they didn't give us for the first night (this is confirmed by several staff and they also offered breakfast and room upgrade as an apology for sqeezing 4 of us into one room). After we went back home, they said the breakfast and room upgrade they offered should be more than enough to compensate the room charge! We were trying not to let this incident ruin our mood, but they just kept irritating us (except one staff called Alberto who was friendly and responsive). When we talked to the front desk supervisor in our last date for the refund, we felt like a group of beggers causing troble and asking for money. Below please find the email I sent to their GM at 2am in the first night. Subject: To GENERAL MANAGER of ALIMARA Hotel - SERIOUS COMPLAIN FROMHOTEL GUESTDear Sir/Madam,I'm your existing hotel guest staying in room 129 and I'm furious and disappointed by your poor service and disaster recovery.We reserved and confirmed 2 double-bed rooms from May 2 - 6th nearly a month ago, and I can't believe that this is what I have got:1. Your first front desk staff only offered one room (number 419) and told us the hotel is full when we checked in at 10:30pm on May 2nd;2. Your front desk supervisor made an excuse (electricity problem in one of our rooms which the first front desk staff never mentioned) and asked another couple of our group to take the taxi and stay in another place. Even after we kept saying that we were really tired and would really want to stay only in this hotel, the supervisor still wanted the another couple to move;3. 4 of us had no choice but demanded an additional bed to stay together in one room. And surprisingly, your front desk asked us to stay in another room (room 129) so as to set up the bed. Is this a joke? because they have 2 rooms indeed and only assigned us in either one room!!!!4. The extra bed was delivered only 40 mins after we got in by your SECURITY GUARD and no one made the bed sheets. So your staff were expecting us to set up the extra bed at 11:15pm on our own in this so-called 4 star hotel?I could't sleep until now because of the poor arrangement from your hotel and I really don't think we deserve this from our holiday.Yours sincerely,

<Content>Excellent Hotel a little far out 12 of us stayed here for a long weekend. We bought 4 day passes on the subway for 18 euro and hopped on and off the tube. The local station ( Mundet) is just round the corner from where you can be on the Ramblas in 15 minutes.A taxi from downtown is around 25 euro. The hotel itself is clean and friendly. The rooms spacious and light. Giveit a go!

<Content>Excellent Hotel! Very spacious room with a great view (we were on the 9th/top floor). Clean and modern. There was some slight traffic noise, but not bad enough to interfere with sleeping. Check-in/check-out went very smoothly, employees spoke perfect English. There were two English TV channels - BBC and CNN.The hotel is very easy to access from the airport, but it takes approximately 45 minutes using public transport. Take the train from the airport to Sants station (the stop is labled Barcelona on the train's display), it will take about 20 minutes. There are 2 trains an hour leaving at :00 and :30. Then take the Metro green line #3 (direction Canyelles) to Mundet metro stop. Walk left out of the station, then turn right and walk to the end of the block. It takes just a couple minutes to reach Hotel Alimara from the metro station.As another reviewer mentioned, the Consum Supermarket is very close by. Turn left after leaving the hotel, cross the street and go down the stairs, go straight and then down more stairs. We purchased breakfast items from here and kept them in our fridge (after removing all the minibar items).

<Content>You may encounter issues with this hotel When my SO and I saw the tempting offer of a one free night for this hotel, I automatically checked the reviews on TripAdvisor in order to make our minds up. And the majority of the positive reviews convinced us. We noticed thought that almost 3 years ago, there were some people not happy with their stay... So hear now what we have to say about our stay here.First of all, this so called 4 star hotel is badly located. It's in the north of the city, right to the circular highway surrounding the city. What does this means? Yes, it's quite noisy, so if you still want to go, be sure to ask for the room to be furthest possible from the highway (on the right side as you face the hotel). But don't bet your money that they will provide you with the room you asked for (we asked for a double room, got a twin one instead (it has happened, by the way, in all the hotels we had stayed before); however, the rest of the hotels gave us a double room when we had politely pointed out that this was our initial request; Alimara was the only hotel that refused that request, claiming that no other double rooms were available).It is true however that the hotel is quite close (less then 5 mins waling) from the Mundet subway station on the 3rd line) which allows you to get quickly downtown. I recommend using the subway: even if tempted to walk, you'll soon find out that your plan didn't indicate that in order to get to the city center you'll have to cross the hill where the Guell park is located, and the streets are quite steep.Getting back to the hotel, the reception was quite glacial when I refused to provide them with the credit card details. They claimed that this way they were trying to insure we were going to pay the extras (like minibar and Pay TV). I insisted that we did not intend to consume anything from the minibar or to wath Pay per view. To this, they claimed that this was the standard procedure across Spain (fact denied by local Spanish relatives I asked). Finally, they gave up this request.As I've already said, breakfast is not included, but I won't recommend to pay 11 鈧?/ person / breakfast. Instead, wake up at 9, go out from the hotel, go left, cross the street, then take the stairs down, go underneath the building and you're in a space with residences around. There underneath you'll see the entrance to a Consum supermarket, where you'll find what you'll need for quite a fine and cheap breakfast (and lunch and dinner, also).The rooms are spacious though, but then you'll have the same thing I've seen in quite all the hotels I've been to: you need your unlocking card to be plugged in in order to have electrical power (however the air conditioned and the minibar seem to have their own circuit (we found the air conditioning running after room cleaning ladies passed and the things we left in the minibar were cold).About the Pay TV, there seemed be a bug in their system, and if you played a little with the remote you may be able to access directly the channels where the movies play (normally not directly accessible) without having to pass through the outrageous expensive Pay per view channels (10.70 鈧?/ movie). (They claim that in order to have Pay TV disabled in your room, all you have to do is to ask the receptionist; I did, but of course, he did nothing, even if he claimed the contrary).When checking out, we once again had a hard time explaining we didn't want to be in their computerized guest database, that we didn't want to receive any offer from their part. One of the receptionist said well, if you want to be removed, just call us, to which I said what's the point into calling you later, I'm telling you to remove my information NOW! The lady didn't seem to get it, so he asked another male coworker (who by the way had trouble to explain to a German couple that were checkouting too, and were about to discover that their advertised price was without VAT) and he assured me that any information about me was going to be removed (and sure, he was going to do that, just like his other colleague disabled the Pay TV).All in all, we had quite an unpleasant experience, and we don't recommend this hotel, who definitely doesn't deserve its 4 stars.

<Content>Comfortable, out of center, yet accessable hotel Alimara was an excellent choice for a week-long stay in Barcelona where one has enough time to explore the city and does not need to be staying right in the very center of town. The hotel is out of the city center in a mixed residential and business area, adjacent a busy motorway. The center is easily accessable by the metro, through the Mundet station just some 30 meters from the hotel. The metro takes you straight to the centar at Catalunya square in about 15 minutes ride. Try to avoid having a room overlooking the motorway as it can be quite loud if you keep the window open, oterwise with the A/C on, you can reduce the noise quite a lot by keeping it closed. The rooms very quite large and nice. Hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. Definitelly a nice hotel for stays in Barcelone longer than a couple of days for a great price (we payed 50 Euros for a double room, breakfast excluded).

<Content>Great hotel, Great value! We stayed at this hotel in June for 2 nights. This was by far the best hotel and best value we had on our 3 week trip through Europe! I was surprised because it was only 70 euros a night, so I was expecting something horrible, but it was great! It was very nice looking from the walk-up. We arrived after midnight and the reception area was still open and helpful. The staff spoke multiple languages. The bedroom had 2 twins pushed together with seperate covers. The TV had CNN in English. The internet cost 7.80 euros for 45 minutes, so we did not use it. The bathroom was big. It had a shower with a tub (the first one of these we saw in Europe)! The room was very clean and very nice. There was a minibar and room service. The breakfast buffet was 11 euros, so we did not try it either. Very nice room, great hotel, great deal. The metro was very close to the hotel. It was very nice and clean. It looked like most of the trams were new. The stations were listed on the tram and would light up as you got to the station, so it was very easy to use. It would indicate with a solid light where it had been and a blinking light indicated that was the next stop. The stations were all pretty clean too. We liked using the metro.

<Content>Roomy peaceful hotel near Metro station My wife and I just returned from Barcelona in June 2007. Had tried to source for a good and cheap(er) hotel in the city but nothing decent was within budget.That said, we were a bit apprehensive with the booking, as it was quite far from the city centre. However, the short 2-minute leisure walk from Mundet metro station, which is on the green L3 line, made up for it.We actually asked for a double bedroom non-smoking, but got a twin room instead. We called to change and after a while, they gave us a smoking floor. There wasn't that lingering smoke smell, so we decided to take it. The rooms were very spacious, and some even had access to the balcony (for smokers). We stayed on the 5th floor, which was a little noisy (but bearable) from the Highway traffic. Pillows were very longish and flat (weird), so had to ask for 2 more pillows. But the bed was comfortable. Bathroom was huge and I do feel that they could have made better use with the space to afford a bigger toilet area. It was difficult closing the door with the bidet blocking access.Didn't have breakfast with the hotel, or try their restaurant, so I cannot comment. Overall, the hotel is conveniently located close to the metro, and on a L3 line which is directly accessible to city centre. It's about 15 minutes to Catalunya  Passeig de Gracia. The area surrounding the hotel is a quiet residential area, with a school and university (toursim) building. No other hotels around though. It's not the type of hotel to laze around in, the beach would be better for that.Price should be about EUR 120, without breakfast. Only problem is you have to watch what time the metro trains end, or you'll have to catch a cab back, which is not entirely cheap.I would definitely return to use the hotel, if they don't jack up their prices, unless I want to explore a different part of Barcelona. If you are the sort that would party way past midnight, I would suggest somewhere more central, so you get back easily.

<Content>Nice Hotel Had a good time at this hotel which is very easy to commute to the central Barcelona via the Metro (Mundet Station on the Green Line 3). My room was on the 9th floor (the top floor) which was good as there is a busy (noisy) motorway next to the hotel. The bed and bathroom were both good (very important) and there was an electric safe in the room. My only problem was that the water in our bathroom sink would drain fast enough but I did not report this to housekeeping as it wasn't a major worry and I was hardly in the room.

<Content>Good value Pleasant stay. Staff mainly young who trained students from the local tourist university, CETT. Room very clean with good views. Hotel is situated in the north of the city. Travel to port/ gothic quarter no problem cos of very frequent metro trains ( every 3 mins.) Make sure you buy a T10 ticket. We booked breakfast which was fine. Local internet cafe and hotel is close to Tibidado.

<Content>Brilliant truly 4-star Me and my girlfriend spent 4 nights over Christmas, which is also my gf's birthday at Alimara. I booked a birthday cake and special request for the room before hand and the staff arranged perfectly for me. We stayed on top floor in a king-size room, which is spacious and clean. The hotel's breakfast was brilliant, with loads of fruit and meet choices. In terms of the transport, the easy accessable metro made no difficulties at all for us to enjoy the Barcelona city life. All in all, great 4-star hotel, which I am sure you cant get at the town centre. Strongly recommend!

<Content>Peaceful... The Alimara is a quiet hotel. It is sort of isolated from the city centre and therefore quite peaceful without the bustle or crowds of the city. The good thing is there is a Metro Station (Mundet) just next to the hotel which easily leads you to most attractions and the city centre. The metro is very regular and takes less than 20 minutes into the city centre. Just remember the last train is at 12 am Sunday to Thursday but on Friday and Saturday the last train is 2 am.The rooms were adequate in size. The bathrooms were clean and had good showers. We too had problems with the air conditioning but we simply left the windows open overnight and had no trouble sleeping. The rooms were cleaned everyday. There was an electronic safe in the room which was very handy. The TV in the room only has news channels in English (CNN and BBC World). There was no tea/coffee provided in the room.The breakfast buffet was a simple average continental spread. Our breakfast was included in the price of the room and had no problems with the bill. There was plenty of space at breakfast and we had no problems with coffee or tea with the waiters.The staff at the hotel could generally understand simple English and we had no trouble or hassle with any of them.The hotel claims to be 4 star but I would generally rate this as a 3 star hotel. There was nothing extra or spectacular about it. Overall we had a hassle free stay at the Alimara. We were always out and only used the hotel at the end of the night and for that purpose it served us well. I would easily stay there again

<Content>Nice, comfortable hotel for a great price! We stayed at the Alimara for a total of 4 nights on two separate occasions at the end of October. After determining that the Barcelona hotels were fairly expensive, especially near the city centre and for 3 people in a room, we decided to try the Alimara after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor and we were not disappointed.The rooms were fairly large and spacious as were the bathrooms and the hotel was very accomodating in adding a third bed for our teenage daughter. We did not eat at the restaurants, but we did purchase croissants and coffee at the bar in the morning and I wouldn't say it was overly expensive. As most of the reviews say, the hotel is located in a fairly residential neighborhood and I didn't see any other restaurants or stores nearby so that was a downside. However the subway is only a 1/2 block away and very convenient to most city locations and the tickets are pretty inexpensive.Overall, it was a very nice hotel and I would definitely stay here again. It was a great hotel for the price.

<Content>Keep the windows shut This is a very nice hotel in what appears to be a residential suburb of Barcelona. The room was reasonably sized with a TV, mini-bar, electronic safe and a nice en-suite bathroom. The decor wouldn't be to my taste but that's a minor quibble. However, if you are thinking of staying here, bear in mind that it's located right beside a busy motorway which is never quiet. Make sure to keep your windows shut at night if you want a good night's sleep! Also, it's quite far out from the center of the city so you will be spending a lot of time on buses and the subway. It's right beside the Mundet metro station (L3) and takes about 15 minutes to get to Catalunya Square.If you want to stay in a relatively cheap, nice hotel, I'd recommend this one.

<Content>Very good hotel We were in Alimara hotel for one week in December of 2003. I'm spanish and I have to tell prices of the hotels in Spain have increased a lot, and it's not very easy to find in Barcelona or Madrid a four stars hotel for this price (when we were, 50 euros double without breakfast). Very big room, very clean, marvelous bathroom, with two separated parts. The only problem is the area, in the north of the city, so you have to take underground to go to the center but there is a station very close to the hotel and it only takes you ten minutes go by train to the most important monuments.

<Content>Alimara was a plesant surprise Stayed in alimara for 3 nights. Booked 2 double rooms for 拢84 a room for the duration of stay through expedia, no breakfast.Good Links: 3 minute walk from Mundet (which is 20 minutes direct from catalunya and in zone 1), 1 minute walk from a Supersol supermarketNearby: No attractions within walking distance but the metro is cheap if you use daycards or the T-10 card. We used the T-10, which works out to be 66 cents a single journeyRooms: Large and spacious, decor a little drab but not my concern! Bathroom has a shower and a bath, pedestal and bidet. Toiletries provided, but no tea-making facilitiesStaff: Friendly and speaks excellent english. Luggage could be kept in a locked room with no fuss. Food: did not eat there, but the menu looked fairly priced.Verdict: would definitely stay there again, and rank high on value.
