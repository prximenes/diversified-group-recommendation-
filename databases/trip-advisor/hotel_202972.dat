<Content>Best in Italy In August we spent two weeks in Italy: Rome, Florence and Venice. The Hotel De La Ville was absolutely excellant when compared to the Sheraton Roma and the Hotel Danielli. The staff is friendly, helpful and courteous. Marco at the front desk a pleasure and is always available to help. Fredrico, the bartender, is charming and very friendly. The breakfast is great and the staff is very efficient. The location is perfect, everything seems to be 10 minutes away. The room is nicely appointed, including a heated towel rack in the large bathroom. My wife and I highly recommend this hotel.Rick  Margaret - California

<Content>A Piece of Heaven We are currently staying at the Hotel De La Ville (aka Hotel Amazing) and I wanted to express my extreme enjoyment for this hotel. * First, we have been staying at 4 and 5 star hotels throughout Italy, and the service we have received at this hotel has finally exceeded expectations. With comparison, this hotel blew away our Rome and Sorrento 5 star hotels that were much more expensive.With the euro being out of control, we take service and hospitality quite seriously. With that said, this hotel has treated us like royalty and I will undoubtedly recommend our stay to everyone we know upon our arrival back in the states. The hotel is ideally located, steps away from everything from Gucci to the Duomo to Alfredos Gilatto. The bathroom in our room, is nearly larger than our entire room in Rome, look as if it was created by the hands of Michaelangelo. If there was a hall of fame for bathrooms, this bathroom would be a first ballot hall of famer. Not to mention, the breakfast is an actual breakfast - not a croissant and yogurt.Enjoy your stay and thank us later. Prego!Disclaimer: * We are New Yorkers and understand the luxury hotel business. You can trust our opinion.

<Content>Fabulous Hotel  All staff were very friendly and helpful. Enjoyed happy hour each evening in bar, great food and service. Staff friendly and helpful, with great recommendations for dinner. Room was superior in quality and size, as was the bath. We found the room to be very quite, unlike some of the other reviews noted. Breakfast was incredible, you could not leave wanting anything else to eat, the selection and variety was A+. Located within walking distance or short taxi ride to anywhere you wanted to go in Florence. The front desk simply pushes a button when you request a taxi, and taxi arrives promptly. We only spent 2 nights in Florence, we wish we had planned for more time here--and definitely will next trip!

<Content>Great location but noisy sleeping The staff was very helpful for restaurants . The room was a nice size but we had to keep the windows closed because the hotel is on a very busy street and it was very noisy. Adding insult to injury, the air conditioning was quite weak. It is very convenient to all major sights.

<Content>Nice Hotel, great location We stayed at the Hotel de la Ville for 3 nights at the beginning of November. It is a very nice comfortable hotel and the location is excellent for getting around Florence! The breakfast was wonderful and we really enjoyed the happy hour every evening in the bar! They had some very good appetizers and the bartender was delightful!The blonde young lady that works the desk is wonderful-very helpful and kind, helping us with dinner reservations and directions! The gentleman that works there was not as friendly, but, oh well! Overall we enjoyed our stay here!

<Content>Great Location, so-so staff We stayed for four nights, it's a great location but the staff were a bit stuffy, probably because it's in the upmarket shopping strip  my husband hadn't shaved for 3 weeks so he looked a bit scruffy - but that said, the room was spotlessly clean, if a bit noisy, and the bathroom was a great size and also very clean. I would stay there again if I could afford it!

<Content>Great hotel, good location We've just returned from a long weekend in Florence staying at the Hotel de la Ville and loved it. The hotel is a 5 min walk from the railway station (where the airport buses stop) and 5 minutes from the Duomo and other attractions. Rooms are a good standard, very clean, nicely decorated. The bar/lounge is lovely - we spent most evenings during happy hour chilling out in the bar with a chianti building up our strength to face another night out!. The concierge recommended some great restaurants. Eat at the La Decima Musa - 5 minute walk and the best meal I've ever had and very reasonably priced.Florence is a great place for a weekend. Fantastic history, great art and loads of shopping (OK, only 1 downside!)

<Content>Great location, Nice Hotel I stayed at this hotel last month for a week. I had a standard double which was very clean, well decorated, comfortable bed and had a spacious bathroom. If I was to stay again I would upgrade to get a bit more room in the bedroom and a window that got some light. All the public areas were well decorated and looked recently updated, although their taste in paintings left a lot to be desired.The staff were all friendly, and it was nice to spend a November evening beside the fire with a cocktail. The food in the snack bar is limited, and all prepared by hand by the bar staff; well the barman opened the packed and put it in the microwave. Not the worst food I've had, but hardly Florence standards.All in all I would recomend this hotel for a relaxing stay close to all the main sites.

<Content>Very lovely hotel Stayed at the de la Ville in late March for 7 nights. Room was a double for single use and nicely furnished and the bathroom and amenities were amazing. Breakfast is one of the best in Europe and the bar and happy hour are terrific. Unfortunately the front desk staff are not the most pleasant and helpful for a hotel that offers so much and is in such a wonderful location. They need to learn to smile and treat guests as valued customers. If the staff improved, I would say excellent instead of above average.

<Content>Great Location - that's all I echo the comments of some other reviewers in saying the only redeeming trait of the de la Ville is its wonderful location. Florence is a great city.We stayed 4 nights in October, during a two week trip throughout Italy. Our room and most of the hotel smelled terrible - a combination of feet and smoke. Room AC barely worked so the room was extremely stuffy - just stagnant, stale air. If you decided to open the windows - you could hear people outside until late in the evening. Hotel rooms and decor need a major renovation (see pic).Staff was OK - rarely friendly and completely stand-offish most of the time. Bartender was overworked, especially during the happy hour. Night manager was completely incompetent.The hotel offers a happy hour but dont expect your typical US experience. Drinks are expensive (not free or discounted) and they serve a small selection of meats, cheeses, croutons and Doritos (no kidding).We had an outstanding rate - so the terrible conditions were tolerable. There are many other options in the city, so look around.Outstanding restaurant right down the street - called Cantinetta Antinori. Try the duck - outstanding.

<Content>A charming hotel This is a very lovely hotel. The only problem that we had was that we were put in a room that smelled horribly of cigarette smoke. We opened the windows wide and asked for fresh down pillows instead of the foam ones that had been there. That seemed to help. My husband did not want to change rooms, since we already had our things there. That was the only drawback to this hotel.The rooms were very nice and so were the bathrooms. All was very clean. Beds and linens were comfortable and of a nice quality. we did not like the fact that they charged for access to the computer in the lobby. The breakfast was very good. It gave us a good start on the day. They have a happy hour everyday from 6-7. It cost us 16 Euros plus tip to have snacks that weren't all that good. The next two nights we passed on the happy hour.People at the front desk were always very helpful and courteous. Never were we treated rudely or with any type of disrespect. The location was great. We could walk to many things since it was so centrally located.

<Content>excellent hotel, great location We stayed 4 nightsand had a very nice experience. The location is an easy 5-10 minutes walk to most of the famous sights of Florence and within 30 minutes walk of almost any place you'd wish to visit in the historic center of the city. This is the fashion street of Florence with good people watching. There are many good restaurants nearby and the hotel staff will assist you in choosing among them and make reservations for you. Unlike other reviewers, we found the staff very friendly, helpful and good humored. Our room was generous in size, not huge but more than adequate, nice bath, two sinks, amenities etc.Our rate included breakfast, buffet style with eggs, ham, cheese, many fruits and juices, breads and pastries and lots of good coffee. It carried us through most of the day! In the evening there was happy hour with complementary goodies.We had a good rate for our stay and felt we had good value for it.

<Content>Stuffy Staff The hotel is in a great location, very centralized in Florence. Easy to get to and from the train station. The staff is very uptight and stuffy. Not very friendly or accomodating. We upgraded our room after we saw the room they had planned for us to stay in. It was so small with oversized furniture, the view was of the center of the hote- no view. The room we moved to had hardly any air conditioning, we were so hot in the middle of July. This room was nice, clean and big though. Just very dark. I would only recommend the hotel for its location.

<Content>Beautiful hotel The Hotel De La Ville is one of my favorite hotels in Italy. The lobby was bright and beautiful, with Murano glass chandeliers. The rooms were mid-sized but very clean and nicely appointed. The breakfast the next morning was very good and the staff was very friendly. The location is wonderful, in the heart of the city. You can leave your car at the hotel and walk anywhere. I will absolutely be going back! Florence is fantastic.

<Author>CherylBerkshire
<Content>An honest opinion I'm just back from Florence and into the thick of work but the memories linger. This is a review of the Hotel de la Ville and Florence and is just plain honest - that's all I know. Reading the reviews before I departed for Florence - they were virtually spot on. Yes, the buffet breakfast was very good and the variety offered was extremely pleasant. The review about the bedrooms (double classic in our case) was true. The bedroom was long and narrow and from the hotel photo it did look narrow with hardly any room either side of the bed to get in. The small double bed was too stuck in an alcove, making you feel hemmed in. The bed itself could have been more comfortable, firm but not lumpy thank goodness and the air conditioning was gentle. The biggest drawback was the non existence of any personal coffee making facilities - that would have been a nice touch, but obviously not encouraged. The maid service was excellent and they even had a turn down, slippers by the bed and next day's weather forecast on a card on the bed waiting for you. Personally, this wasn't necessary for me - I like some privacy! The bathroom was adequate but not as vast as some earlier reviews had made out to be - not in the double room anyway. Quiet atmosphere as we were on the side of the building. The bar and lounge area were very comfortable though drinks pricey. I had read about the helpful barman Carmine and he was very friendly and a pleasant and amusing character altogether - I wish him well with his English lessons. It was a pity that the front desk gentleman wasn't as helpful but instead gave the air of being a guest instead of someone providing service. The ladies on reception were friendlier and more helpful although I have to make one point here. On the afternoon we were due to leave for the airport, unbeknown to us there was a taxi strike and it was only through the other barman that we discovered this. We had told reception the previous afternoon that we would require a taxi and they must have known about the taxi strike even in the morning of the day we were leaving but failed to alert us to this and to make arrangements earlier. I know they have a lot of people through their hands every day but a little touch of remembering our needs and helping us more than they did would have gone a long way. Instead of leaving the hotel with a ciao. wave and a thanks, we left feeling let down and as if we were leaving some back street little pensione instead of a swanky hotel so shame on them for this. So, we found ourselves lugging two large suitcases and several bags two blocks to the main taxi rank. After some persuasion, one taxi driver agreed to take us to the airport. The reception at the hotel had failed to help us with this and to inform us of the strike. Luckily we had returned from shopping to the hotel early and only thanks to the barman did we discover our predicament. This is not what to expect from a luxury 4 star hotel. Smiles should go hand in hand with efficiency to make a perfect match. The decor pales when service is lacking.Florence itself was hot and packed but thanks to prebooking our Uffizi tickets before we left we avoided the long, long queues. Please prebook - it's a must and easy - we used the Virtual Uffizi site. Ladies - bring two or three pairs of thong sandals or any flat comfortable shoes. Even kitten heels in the heat our killers. If looking for a leather handbag; it took me 4 days to track down the perfect one for me and it was worth it. This particular shop was always closed when I passed by but on virtually our last day in Florence, it was open and I knew my bag was in there. It's a designer shop on a side street which leads to the Ponte Vecchio bridge and the jewellery shops on it. It's on the left hand side called Mandani. They design their own bags and the leather is wonderful, and a discount will be offered too I'm sure. The lady in there is very chic but friendly and helpful and you can take your time.The shops around the De la Ville are the original Versace, Dior, Hermes etc wonderful but obviously the top end prices. All around are wonderful shops and restaurants nestled in this wonderland of Renaissance architecture. Do take a trip out to Sienna  San Giminano and the hotel will organise this for you for about 49 euros each. San Giminano is small but do try a wonderful bar/coffee/cake restaurant. I asked for a pistachio milkshake and they made it from pistachio iceream which was wonderful - I even bought the frappe mug which they served it in. The pastries and fruit sponges were gorgeous.I'm a rare steak fan but if you are going to attempt the vast T bone bistecca, ask for it medium rare - believe me! Also, try their fish dishes; the sauces are wonderful. I mostly gave the pizzas and pastas a miss and went for different local dishes which are great if you find a family restaurant for locals. The Chianti Classico red wine was a bit powerful for us in the heat - try the rose instead. Iced tea was very refreshing.I have to be honest and say that if I revisited Florence I wouldn't choose the De La Ville. I would choose a hotel with a garden and not such a business orientated hotel - too starchy. However, all in all I loved Florence as I had loved Rome a couple of years ago and now my mind is on the Italian Lakes.Lastly, wasn't a bad flight on Meridiana the scheduled Italian airline.I hope all this helps you to enjoy Florence but try and go in May or even early June or September - July has been more than a scorcher even at 11 at night.CIAO or BFNCherylBerkshire

<Content>Great location, but some rooms are too small We just returned from a trip to Florence where we stayed at the Hotel DeLaVille for 6 nights. My hysband and I got a superior room, and it was very spacious and nice. But my daughters got a regular room, and it was really really small. They had two single beds pushed together and there was almost no room to walk around. Bathrooms were nice in both, however.The location of the De La Ville is just about perfect: close to everything, and on a great street. I suspect that one pays a premium for the great location. Downside was the indifferent service from the front desk. They often acted like they could not be bothered with our requests. Also, breakfast was just ok, in my view. Really flimsy bacon and suspect eggs.On our last night we had to stay at the Grand Hotel Minerva, because a convention was coming to DeLaVille. Minerva rooms were larger, breakfast was better, staff was nicer. It was a couple of blocks further from the action, but still close to the city center. Bottom line: DeLaVille is in great location but you can probably find a better place if you are willing to be further off the beaten path.

<Content>Great location! De la Ville is well located; an easy walk to the station too. The happy hour is definitely fun. Carmine is a gracious, thoughtful bartender! The complimentary food makes a full supper unnecessary. There's a piazza about 3 blocks away where people gather for music in the evening. I was disappointed that one of the desk personnel told us to take a taxi to get to Fiesole. Fortunately I pursued this further and easily located the #7 bus at the station. The ride costs only 1 Euro! Fiesole is a great place to get away from crowds and enjoy an amazing view of Florence.

<Content>Excellent Hotel -- Nice staff Stayed 3 nights. The hotel didn't have our reservation but we had our voucher from Central Holidays. Our two singles were upgraded to two adjacent doubles. The desk person was kind enough to call ahead and confirm that our Venice hotel did have our reservation. Everything was very plush. Breakfast was especially good with eggs and hot breakfast meats in addition to the very complete continental spread. Lots of cut fruits and other extras. It was served in a really pretty room with doting service. The public areas were especially fancy. The staff was very helpful with our requests for directions and such. The Cathedral and other downtown sights were a short walk. One for two on restaurant reservations. A restaurant called Trattoria Cava Mario was especially good, another recommended place pretty bad. Overall a wonderful experience.

<Content>Excellent Hotel Just back from a 6 night stay at Hotel de la Ville in Central Florence. We had a junior suite facing the street (Suite 301). Excellent size with pull out couch, and enormous bathroom. The ceilings are very high and lovely windows which are very well insulated to the noise of the street below. The other reports on this site about the breakfasts are true .... the were just excellent! The staff of the hotel were exceptional and nothing was too much for them at all. The did arrange for tickets to Uffizi gallery and this was at a premium, so be warned they do make money booking things for you. The cocktail hour in the hotel bar was a good deal with a selection of sandwiches and nuts to accompany your drink. The house Chianti is a very good choice. As for a tip on an excellent restaurant try Trattoria Magione on via della Spada 27r (turn right out of the hotel and walk down via Tournaboli until you get to via della Spada and then turn right again and it is about 50 metres on the left hand side). This is an excellent local restaurant packed all the time with local and tourists. The ribolita soup is excellent and are the steaks and pork chops served with excellent roasted vegatables. You will be coming back again and again!!Overall Hotel de la Ville is a nice comfortable, service driven 4 -5 star hotel and is a great base from which to explore Florence. Ciao

<Content>You can do better I stayed in the De La Ville in April of 2005 with my 73 year old Aunt.I booked the hotel through my travel agent and honestly expected more.First, the hotel is nice enough, although the lobby is a bit dated.It looks as though it hasn't been upgraded since the '70's.The breakfast room was very nice and there was a great selection of food.The Breakfast room staff was very nice and offered good service.We were told that we were upgraded when we got to the hotel. I can't imagine how small the rooms we were supposed to be in were because the ones we got were pretty small. There was just enough room around the bed to walk. The rooms also looked into a 10 foot wide alley.The furnishings were very average. There was nothing redeeming about the rooms themselves.However the bathroom was nice, not a bad size.The rooms were clean and the bathroom amenities were nice.My biggest probelm with the hotel was the service, or lack of service we recieved from the concierege's. I think the first probelm is that they are all around desk people who work alone and don't really have time.however their attitude is that they really can't be bothered.the worst experience I had was with one in particular.On our last night I asked her to recommend a restaurant in the San Lorenzo area. She took my map out of my hand and drew a circle around several blocks and then wrote Zsa Zsa on the map.She never gave me an address or offered to make a reservation.I left the hotel with my aunt and set out to find the restaurant. We circled the area and The square and were never able to find the restaurant.as i said before my Aunt is 73. And while she is in great shape, walking especially after a day of it was a chore.We eventually found a restaurant but were disapointed. Since it was our last night we wanted to have dinner in a nice restaurant .In general the desk staff really can't be bothered and they made it very clear.

<Content>Service makes the differance This was the best of the three hotels we stayed at in Italy. It was a tremendous value. The room was very large by European standards, and was clean enough even for my very fussy wife. The morning breakfast was a veritable feast, with something for everyone. They also have a very nice happy hour, with discounted drinks and some free snacks. The hotel staff could not have been better. The staff at the front desk were always very friendly, and would handle any requests quickly and efficiently. Bellboys, waiters, maids, everyone there could not have been better. The location of the hotel was perfect. It is a five minute walk from the train station, and easy enough to find to make it impossible to get lost on your way back from your evenings festivities. Florence is a great city for those who enjoy seeing the sights by walking. You can literally walk anywhere in the city from this hotel, and find your way back without having to leave a trail of breadcrumbs. For a wonderfull experience in Florence, I heartly reccomend the De La Ville hotel.

<Content>nice hotel, rude staff hotel was very clean and nicely decorated, however the staff was a nightmare. The conceirge was so rude. My husband asked for dinner recomendations and was told that he did not have any. We then booked a day tour to Pisa and I asked if the bus would pick us up at the hotel and was told yes. Well, we waited in the lobby at the scheduled time and no one came. A different person was working the conceirge desk and she told us that we were supposed to go to the train station to pick up the tour, and that we missed it. When I told her that I was told diffently she gave me a hard time about giving my money back. They just did not seem to want to bother with people at all. When traveling to a foreign country, you relay on your hotel staff to guide you, that was not the case here. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Great breakfast! Classy business-style hotel, easy walking distance to most of the major tourist destinations and the train station. Wonderful breakfast buffet, not your average continental breakfast. Not particularly quaint or anything, but very comfortable. Restful place to stay! I really wanted to eat at the wine bar in the Palazzo Antinori, next door, which my guidebooks say is great, but never got around to it.

<Content>Nice hotel and location, mixed impression of staff We were given a beautiful spacious room for our honeymoon that we absolutely loved. It was tastefully decorated and very clean. One of the largest room we've ever stayed in actually, which was surpising. The breakfast was very good and generous- scrambled eggs, sausage, breads, cereals, fresh fruit, yogurt, ha, cheeses, pastries and juice. The only problem we had was that although many of the staff (barista, restaurant staff) were kind and helpful, some, especially the ones acting as 'concierge' were not. One lady (I wish I had gotten her name) was actually very rude and short with people. She had a very loud voice and a manner of speaking that was very... 'unfriendly' to say the least. She recommended a restaurant called Buca Mario, when my husband asked for a place with good 'bisteca fiorentina'. We were looking for a place that was quiet and romantic, but she wouldn't let my husband explain to her what he was looking for. She cut him off short, gave him the name of the restaurant and ended the phone call before he could explain. Thus, we ended up at Buca Mario, a very large and loud restaurant with menus on copy paper and average food. If you stay here, don't rely on their concierge. Otherwise, I would stay here again.

<Content>Nice hotel, unfriendly staff The hotel location was great and the rooms were nice and clean. I also stayed in this hotel in 2001 and thought that the staff was not very friendly then but figured four years later it would probably be different. The staff is still unfriendly and not very helpful when inquiring about typical concierge-like requests.

<Content>Love the Hotel De La Ville! My husband and I just returned from a trip to Florence. We spent 3 nights at the Hotel De La Ville after checking out of a hotel that we were unhappy with (Hotel Giglio). The hotel is wonderful. The rooms are spacious and light, and the bathrooms are wonderful with fluffy towels, nice toiletries and a marbled double vanity. The breakfast (included with our room) was fantastic and the staff was very friendly and helpful. We toured Florence for 2 days and then spent 2 days with a driver, Alessandro Cammilli. We discovered him on this website and were extremely pleased with his services. His car is spacious and clean and nice to ride around in. The first day, he took us to Pisa (we wanted to climb the tower) and then to Cinque Terre. On our way back to Florence, we stopped by Viareggio. The second day, he took us through the Chianti region and then on to Siena. He also drove me to the Prada and Gucci outlets on our way back into Florence because I was dying to go! He is friendly and has lived his whole life in Florence...he is very knowledgable about Florence and the surrounding areas. We will hire him again when we return to Florence!

<Content>Wonderful Hotel!! We stayed here for 4 nights in February and loved the hotel. The location is perfect; right next to the Antinori winery and upscale shopping. The Duomo is only a few blocks away. The rooms were clean and well appointed with pretty comfortable beds. This was by far the nicest of the 5 hotels we visited in Italy.

<Content>Our favorite! Two weeks in Italy, 3 hotels and one villa rental, and Hotel de la Ville in Florence is still our favorite. Ranked as a 4* hotel, the de la Ville is certainly a 4+ *. Located on via de Tornabuoni, Florence's best shopping street, this gem is easy walking to many of the major piazzas, the Ponte Vecchio, shopping and restaurants. We were upgraded to a junior suite on check-in, and enjoyed a sumptiously decorated abode, large modern marble bath, and wonderful airconditioning, even though it was already October (October 7-9, 2004). Smooth, professional service sets you up for a luxurious stay. The breakfast buffet, included in the price, is more than generous, and for a 5 Euro service charge, can be delivered to your room. A large comfortable bar area serves a happy hour hor d'ouerve buffet from 6:00 - 7:00 PM when drinks are half-price. Otherwise, drinks are on the expensive side, 10-12 Euros each.
