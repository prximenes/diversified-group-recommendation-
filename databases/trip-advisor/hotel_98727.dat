<Content>This is a Warwick?? I stayed here with a couple friends and we were not particularly impressed. The service was fine, but the building just didn't feel like it was up to the luxury standards you would expect from the Warwick chain.There was a tacky red sticker on the inside of the elevator that said watch your step. The light fixtures in the hallways were like cheap 15.99 units out of a cookie-cutter entry level home.The wallpaper, carpet, and overall look of the place was just very homey, for lack of a better word. I know it's a historic hotel but I have stayed in many and it's not hard to decorate in a way that is modern while recognizing the history of the building.The sheets were VERY rough and scratchy--more motel 6 than Warwick. It's a great looking building on the outside, and the location in the Oak Lawn/Turtle Creek area is good, but that doesn't save it for me.If I hadn't stayed at a discounted rate through the Historic Hotels of America employee trade program, I would have really been upset. This luxury wannabe is not worth the full price.

<Content>Get-Away In Dallas I had always heard about the Warwick Melrose Hotel, as it is a Dallas classic, but had never stayed there. I live in Arlington, but have family in Dallas, and decided it would be fun to get away for a night and see them. I booked a room and my family and I planned to start out at the Library Bar, as I had just read about its renovations, and have a few drinks. Well one look at the food menu there, and we decided we didn鈥檛 need to move anywhere else. The bar staff was very nice and the live piano music made the atmosphere relaxing and very enjoyable. The room we stayed in was very nice as well, and spacious enough for myself, two daughters and sister. Everyone else that worked at the hotel was just as nice as the bar staff, from the valet guys, to the front desk, to management who made it a point to ask about my stay. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a great place in Dallas.

<Content>Corporate parent in trouble? I desperately wanted to like this hotel. I like old historic properties and hope to encourage others to stay in them. This place does indeed have a grand lobby. The bar in the lobby is an attractive clubby space, but expect to drop $6-$7 for a domestic longneck. There really is no excuse for that, anywhere (although it has become commonplace). The room was plenty big for one person, and the bed and linens were comfortable. There was a ceiling fan, which was a nice touch.Unfortunately, said ceiling fan had not been serviced since its installation in 1985, and it creaked and moaned. Also, the room had recently been painted. And it smelled like it. And the windows had been painted shut. All of the foregoing was a recipe for a persistent headache.The final straw was the minibar. Minibars are a ripoff, we all know this. This one, however, set a new low for me. There was a service charge of 15 percent on items from the minibar. Items which are already marked up considerably . . . items which you serve yourself. That's just needless piling on, and it makes me wonder how badly the parent company is in need of revenue.

<Content>Pretty nice We just stayed here one night. It is our habit to try and stay in unique yet reasonably-priced hotels and this one fit the bill. The lobby is lovely and you really should schedule in time to spend an hour or so in The Library Bar. Our room was recently renovated although the carpet was already stained and one of the chair cushions had a chair. But the room was quite large and well-laid out. The bed was only moderately firm and comfortable and felt like it was time for a new mattress and boxspring. Some rooms near us were being renovated and we could smell the sawdust and paint from our room...which is probably why we got the low rate that we did! I ordered a hamburger from the restaurant for in-room dining. That was the worst-tasting most overcooked $30 hamburger I've ever had (I wanted the ahi tuna sandwich but they were out of tuna and offered me halibut instead...?). We could go back but I would request a room away from any construction and not order in-room dining again.

<Content>An "honest" Gem of a jewel Grand old historical hotel............ very comfortable, pleasant.Staff was exceptional. Many hotels have employees that just answer questions, but this staff went the extra distance and offered help. Splendid.Valet parking: I left my billforld in the car, and then 2 minutes after arriving in my room, the wonderful employee delivered the billfold to me. Thank you again, Warwick Melrose.

<Content>Good value, great service, noisy halls The lobby of the hotel is lovely, and the service from the front desk and the bell staff was very good. The location is great - near good restaurants and shopping. The room was nice - comfortable bed. Unfortunately, for two of the three nights there was a significant amount of noise from other guests, late at night, in the hall. The hotel handled the complaint well, offering one night free.

<Content>Less than expected! I wished I had read the review from wanderer888 (June 13) to know what to expect. However, I have to say that I pretty much had no other choice as much as my stay, since this hotel was picked based on its location for the meeting that I was attending. This is an old building which is a historic landmark. The hotel staff is very friendly and professional. The room decor is okay. The lighting is good. The beds are reasonably comfortable. The the room size is larger than average. However, there are some issues. The heating system in the room is so loud that you have to pick a choice between sleeping or ambient temperature.They have a major moisture problem in the room. This is most likely due to combination of lack of ventilation/fan in the bathroom and all the sealed single pane windows where moisture condenses and drips onto the frame, panel and drips off from the wall. I had alot of respiratory difficulties throughtout my stay in the room as I have very bad seasonal/mold allergies. Also, I had requested a wake-up call which I never received. I had also ordered room service for 6:15 as I had to be at my meeting at 6:55. The food did not arrive until 6:32 after an inquiry call was made. For a 4 diamond hotel and 18% gratuity, I expected a timely service.

<Content>romantic getaway in dallas NO complaints about this older hotel: our suite was larger than one of our properties in Cali. The staff were attentive and the amenities were just right to make this a very romantic get away.Although some of the facilities were dated, it added to the charm of the venue. We used the gym, hung out in the library bar, and enjoyed the food from room service. Can NOT believe that people complain about the location -- it is one of the jewels of Dallas.This is one you will want to book -- especially if you have to be in Dallas. LOL.

<Content>Great location, good value Booked a suite for the Halloween party/parade weekend. Fantastically spacious. Four poster bed was a great touch. Close to great restaurants and bars. (Wouldn't stay here if you don't want to see gay couples because there are PLENTY of them about.)Will definitely book here again. I think I like it better than the Crescent Court!

<Content>Best Neighborhood in Dallas My wife and I stayed at the Melrose last November and loved it. Our first night we went down to the Library Bar but were dissapointed in the Martini selection and the no smoking policy. We took a stroll down the street and found this great gay section. We sat in a club called JoEllens and had drinks and smoked the night away. Around 11PM I went back to the room which is only a block away and my wife stayed to dance with the girls. She actually came back to the room about an hour later with one of her friends. A first for me.It is not a bad drive from the Melrose to the Stockyards in Ft. Worth. I would recommend a trip there. My only complaint about the hotel was a wedding party below our room one night with a disco beat going well after midnight.Enjoy your stay and be sure to check out the clubs on the backside.

<Content>A gracious step back in time. We recently had a to find a hotel fast due to a family illness in Dallas. We needed somewhere convenient to the hospital and family and remembered the Melrose. My grandparents had stayed there years ago when they made a trip to the City (Dallas) and I always remembered hearing about it. It has been lovingly restored and if you are trying to get away from the current cookie cutter luxury hotel formula, the Melrose is the place for you. It was also an outstanding value for such a gracious and elegant hotel. The lobby and Library Bar were just beautiful -- elegant and understated. And I cannot rave enough about every one on the staff. They learned our names immediately and were always so attentive and considerate. Mind you, there were some minor complaints with the accommodations -- there is something to be said for new in some cases, but nothing that would cause me not to recommend the hotel. The only real complaint we had was that we could hear the activity in the adjoining room, probably through the connecting door, and next time I would ask for a room without one. We were on the back side of the hotel, so the street noise was at a minimum. Overall, we were very pleased despite the unpleasant circumstances necessitating our visit, and would stay there again.

<Author>wanderer888
<Content>So disappointing!! Based on the rave reviews from tripadvisor we booked a suite in the Melrose Hotel to celebrate a significant event. It was very disappointing to say the least. Yes, the service was impeccable, the bathroom amenities were upscale, and the piano bar was quite nice but the room was in desperate need of a serious overhaul. I felt like I was staying at an old great aunt's slightly smelly, threadbare house. I tend to like old hotels with a lot of character and have never had trouble before but the suite at the Melrose was tired and run down. The sofa and arm chairs were faded, frayed, and shabby looking. The mattress was soft and the bedspread and decorative pillows in need of replacement. Most unpleasant was the very noticeable musty smell in the room that would not go away. If you have allergies to mold I would think twice about staying here. To be honest I am surprised at the high marks given by the tripadvisor reviewers. I wouldn't call the hotel a dump but if you want upscale luxury that sparkles choose somewhere else. It just may not be worth the money.

<Content>Nice Older Hotel Stayed here for 4 days while in Dallas for business. Check in was very efficient. Valet parking was also fast and efficient.Room was very nice.....big bathroom with vanity, excvellent water pressure in shower. Bed was very comfortable.Room service was okay. Breakfast was good, but extremely overpriced. They add in a delivery fee, which is to be expected, but they also add in a 18.5% gratuity! Be careful not to miss that, as I did the first time and added in an additional tip. Dinner was just okay. Don't order the crab cakes. They are horrible! Ate one night at the Library Bar. The Landmark Restaurant was closed (on a Sunday....very odd). Food was okay, menu very limited.High speed internet worked fine. I was in a room on the 3rd floor and could hear every note from the piano bar downstairs, which went on until well after midnight on Saturday. During the week the music ends at 11:00.

<Content>Would recommend it I had a good experience at the Melrose and found the staff very accomodating and helpful. The front desk staff gave me excellent recommendations for nearby restaurants. The lobby was beautifully decorated for Christmas and hot chocolate was available in the lobby. The rooms were large and quiet, and the bed was very comfortable. Because of business I wasn't able to get out to see much of Dallas, but I would recommend the Melrose to friends coming to Dallas.

<Content>Perfect place for the Cedar Springs Halloween Block Party One of the biggest events during Halloween is the Cedar Springs Block Party. It takes place just outside of the Melrose. My wife and I chose to get a room at the Melrose, which worked out perfectly for the party. The staff was extremely friendly, and the room was clean and well-decorated. The views of the Oak Lawn area were great from our 6th floor suite. I will surely stay here every year for the Halloween party!

<Content>Great City Getaway The Melrose is a Dallas institution and after years of benign neglect has veen brought to it's former glory. After an overseas asssignment, I had a reunion with my oldest friend at the Melrose. Couldn't have been better. The Melrose is like a trip back in time. The rooms are spacious, the amenitieos are noteworthy, and the service is excellent. I managed to forget my passport, but they found it and had it back to me by courier in a day. Located close to Love Field and the Oak Lawn night life, it is a hotel for all lifestyles. Really worth it!

<Content>Very Impressed Unfortunately we were only in Dallas for one night but we loved our stay at the Melrose. Everyone we encountered were friendly and helpful. The hotel is beautiful and the rooms are huge and very clean.  The valet was very helpful with directions and we had a short ride to the West End with it's shops and restaurants. This is also where the Kennedy assassination occured. The Art's District was a short ride from there. We were lucky enough to be there when a festival was in progress with artists showing their works, food stands and live music. We also found the Deep Ullum district ( not sure of the spelling ) but had tired by that point and didn't get out to wander. It was 103 degrees. Only two minor annoyances. The first was with the Library bar. My daughter had read on line that they featured 100 different martinis. When we looked at the menu it listed maybe 6 or 7. The bartender named a couple more she could make when we asked. Still didn't equal 100. Not a big deal but if you don't do it, don't advertise it. Secondly, I don't understand why you can get free internet service at a Motel 6 but a place like the Melrose has to charge $11.00. Overall we enjoyed our stay and would not hesitate to return.

<Content>WE LOVE THIS HOTEL! The most charming, delightful, perfectly relaxing stay in a hotel we've ever had was at the beautiful Melrose Hotel in Dallas, TX recently. Our room was wonderful and a great weekend get-a-way - romantic - fantastic service from the time you drive up to Valet - check in at the front desk and get to your room - and the Library Bar and Landmark Restaurant - well, this really is a Four Diamond experience - impeccable service in every area of this hotel. We were totally pampered and will most certainly come back. Thank you Melrose Staff!

<Content>Have Dinner at the Landmark Restaurant The Landmark Restaurant in the Melrose Hotel truly is one of Dallas' Best Kept Secrets! Wanting a quiet, elegant atmosphere to celebrate my husband's birthday, my family and I were impressed with the classic setting in this beautifully restored luxury hotel. We began to see how the restaurant earned its four-star plus rating when our server, Jennifer, greeted us and described each dish from the amazing menu. When each course arrived, we were delighted! Our dinners exceeded our expectations, and the quality attention from Jennifer and Charlie was outstanding. I highly recommend The Landmark Restaurant for special occasion dining, which might be just dinner for two, entertaining clients or evenings out with friends. You'll want to tell everyone--but then, the Landmark wouldn't be a secret anymore!

<Content>Customer Service - Above and Beyond After comparing hotels in Dallas, I reserved a room at the Melrose for my husband and I's 5th Anniversary. This turned out to be a great decision. I had corresponded with Edward Searle prior to our arrival. I asked if I could send some digital pictures from our wedding and if they could put them in the room for when we arrived. Edward said 'not a problem'. I sent the pictures electronically and he had them printed out and framed for when we walked into the living area of our room! My husband was so surprised - it was GREAT! Plus, we had a corner room - and it was magnificent! All in all, I have never encountered the customer service that Edward provided - and for that, I was greatly appreciative. The Melrose is a great place to stay in Dallas. We will definitely go again.

<Content>disappointed My wife and I visited the Melrose in Dallas over memorial day weekend. We were disappointed. It is a fine looking hotel but old. We tend to judge a hotel by the quality of the rooms and there is where the problems are. The room was very noisy and we could here traffic going up and down the streets all night. The air conditioning, though adequate, is also noisy. the bathroom door was so caked with paint and crooked in its jamb that it wouldn't close. The shower has adequate water pressure but there are no shelves to place all of your soaps and such. There is no swimming pool, no quality restaurants within reasonable summertime walking distance and they charge for you to park your car. Overall, we were very disappointed in this hotel given its price range.

<Content>A Fantastic Stay At The Melrose April 2006:-My wife and I had the most fabulous stay last month in Dallas Texas while staying at The Melrose Hotel, Dallas. This historic hotel not only met our expectations, but I would go as far as to say that it exceeded them too. We were very impressed with the quality of service from the minute we arrived. The doormen were very welcoming and most accommodating and we found that the bellmen and reception staff were most cordial and friendly and maintained a level of friendliness that is sometimes hard to find these days in hotels of this level. We had several great dining experiences in their hotel dining room, The Landmark Restaurant. The menu offered a variety of dishes that met our somewhat picky dietary needs, but the service is what I was so impressed with: the staff was never to busy to tend to our needs in a friendly and polite manner. Overall it was a great weekend get-away for my wife and I, and I highly recommend it!

<Content>5 Star treatment with gorgeous rooms, lobby and lounge!!! I can't believe that I waited so long to give this jewel of a property a try. I stay in Dallas about 4 to 8 nights a month and have stayed at all of the so called 4 and 5 diamond properties. None of them in this area (Dallas/Ft. Worth) can touch the service, the ambience or the location of this property. Trust me when I say to all that this is a must try. Once you stay there, I believe you will be hooked. Not only did I feel like a star when I entered the lobby, but I actually saw several current movie and TV stars having a drink in their wonderful lounge. The Melrose Hotel has given me a bunch more reasons to stay in Dallas as much as I can. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you for the wonderful experience!!!!!!!

<Content>So-So Stay at the Melrose Hotel I was in town for a week long conference and all the downtown hotels were already booked. I was trying to decide between Melrose and Renaissance Market Center. Based on reviews here, I booked this hotel. The positives: The staff is friendly and attentive. I have no complaints, superior service A++++. I forgot my tootbrush and they promptly brought one to my room, room service is VERY fast. The rooms are HUGE compared to a standard room. The bathroom is very big. Order the Belgium waffles for breakfast as they are fantastic. Across from a Walgreens which is convenient if you need some necessities. Free wireless access in the lobby, but $10 a day in your room.The negatives or neutrals: The hotel is not really near anything. They advertise that they are near the upscale Turtle Creek neighborhood, which is really nothing spectacular. In fact, I did not feel safe walking around the corner. There is very limited food selection for room service and it is a bit more expensive than some other hotels I have stayed. So you have to go and eat. As I do not rent a car, I have to eat close by. There are no good places to eat in walking distance. There is a cool little vegetarian place called the Cosmic Cafe around the corner that's about it. Also the West Village shopping center 5 minutes away is nothing great. Though I did get great Tirmasu at an Italian place there. Pay the extra cabfare and go to the Galleria Mall or if you want upscale shopping go to Highland ParkI am always leery of cleanliness in older hotels. The bathroom tub really needed a good scrubbing with comet. And there was this glob of what probably looked like soap on the bathroom floor. I kept meaning to complain about this but did not have time. And yet the tub never got cleaner and the mystery glob stayed on the bathroom floor the 5 days I was there.The work desk area is poorly lit. There needs to be a light behnd you to illuminate this area more. So at night it is difficult to work at the desk. Fairly limited number of TV stations compared to other hotels. And the workout area consists of the typical hotel equipment, meaning a few cardio machines. Nothing extraordinary.Some members of the room service staff have trouble speaking/understanding English. Twice when I have called they needed someone to call me back who understood me. But to be fair, I was called back right away.The library bar is cool, but drinks are over priced. The Landmark restaurant is very pricey also, and since I did not eat there I cannot comment on the food.I wouldn't say not to stay at this hotel as my stay certainly was not a negative one, however, I would not necessarily recommend it either. If you are looking for things to do, stay at downtown hotel. I had colleagues who stayed at the downtown Hyatt and the Hilton Anatole who said they were fantastic. I will say Trip Advisor is usually on the money with reviews and I am suprised this hotel is rated in the top 5 in Dallas.

<Content>Bonus Points with the Boss I have become so addicted to Tripadvisor that I always check first before making reservations be it for business or leisure.I've not been home 24 hours but I had to write about the Melrose hotel which I decided on after reading other reviews; I was not disapointed. The hotel is beautiful and the staff was out of this world.I taveled to the Dallas to give a presentation, and we decided to get a conf. room at the hotel to have our meeting. The staff went out of their way to help us, impressed our clients and impressed my boss. Honestly- I've never seen such service and I travel all over the place, all the time.Amazing- if I go back to Dallas, I'm staying there.

<Content>Fantastic Evening at the Melrose My husband and I stayed at The Melrose Hotel in Dallas, Texas for the evening and had the most relaxing, wonderful time! The great experience began when we checked into our beautiful room. The decor of the room was lovely and welcoming (and could not have been any cleaner!). The fitness center was great with new exercise equipment. The highlight of the stay had to be the wonderful service at The Library Bar and The Landmark Restaurant, both located in the hotel. The drinks and food were the best we have had. The entire stay makes us want to go back as often as we possibly can! We have already told many friends about our fantastic date-night we had at The Melrose.

<Content>Best of Dallas This was my second stay at the wonderful Melrose. A former frequent guest of the Crescent Court, the Melrose has it all over them for service, warmth, and the true definition of hospitality. From the moment you enter, you feel as though you are home. The Bar is fabulous, the food excellent, and the Front Desk staff is second to none, especially Michael. And..for the business traveler, the location is fantastic and you can actually walk places. Thanks again to all and see you soon!

<Content>Wonderful Melrose Hotel - Dallas Texas - Stay Wow!!! That is all I can say about the wonderful stay I had at the Melrose Hotel Dallas Texas. The place is beautiful, the staff are attentive, the food was excellent, and the service was great. I used Trip Advisor to decide between the Melrose Hotel and another one. Based on the recommendations I read, I went with the Melrose Hotel. The time I spent reading reviews was well worth the effort. I couldn't have been more satisfied. The bathroom itself was huge and had a very spa like feel!!!! The room was very clean. The room service breakfast was fantastic. You also have to try the Library (bar) and must experience the Landmark Restaurant. In addition, there is a shuttle service that runs in the very immediate area (like a mile or two radius)to any location and will also pick up in the same radius. The drivers were very pleasant and courteous. I highly recommend this hotel!!!

<Content>Anniversary Trip Nice, clean, historic hotel. Friendly staff. Did not have a chance to try the LandMark restaurant for dinner but the breakfast was very good. Since it was our first time to Dallas, we chose to take a taxi to the Opera (Music Hall) and a Dallas Cowboys game. It was the best decision since traffic was quite heavy during the weekend. Hotel is walking distance to several shops and restaurants. If you are sensitive to noises, choose a room away from the street Cedar Springs. The street is home to a local fire department station.

<Content>Terrific Stay at The Melrose What a terrific property!! This was my first stay at The Melrose and you can bet I'll be back. I'm often times a bit leary of older properties, but The Melrose lived up to my expectations of a first class hotel in every possible way.The staff (from the doorman to the front desk personnel) were excellent and very friendly.I had a large corner room that was super clean, as well as a very comfortable bed. The only draw back was the rather small bathroom...not really anyplace for one's toliletries. The only other small complaint was very slow running elevators. A number of people mentioned to me that they ended up taking the stairs because the wait had been so long. I did not utilize the bar or restaurant but they looked great.I will be back!

<Content>5 Star Hotel! I stayed at this classic hotel for our anniversary. The service was 5 star from start to finish. I do not know how they found out that it was my anniversary, but a personal welcome amenity and suite upgrade was unexpected and very thoughtful. The Landmark Restaurant was superb and after dinner drinks listening to live entertainment at the Library bar was relaxing. I have stayed at several 5 star hotels in the United States, and the service level at the Melrose was an unexpected suprise. The valet/bellman/front desk staff never failed to greet us by name! I have stayed at the Mansion on Turtle Creek several times (around the corner from the Melrose) and while a great stay, I never recieved the personal attention this small gem provided.I will be back!

<Content>Nickled and dimed at a shabby Melrose My husband and I selected the Melrose hotel for our recent weekend stay in Dallas based on user reviews at Tripadvisor, and the hotel's bargain rate of $129 available on their website. We drove, thus adding a hefty $16 a day for parking, another $10.95 to gain internet access (either wireless or wired in the room), and then endured a tired and shabby room, with a poor location on the backside of the hotel, when clearly the hotel was nearly empty. Here's what we didn't like about the room condition: stained and tired furniture and bedcoverings; a weird halo of darker stained stone flooring adjacent to the toilet (ahem....), wood surfaces on furniture water damaged and scratched, broken coffee pot, leaky faucet in the shower/bathtub, and the worst: delighted to find a pot of lip balm in a hotel, only to open and discover the swirl of someone else's fingerprint -- gross! There were some perks: housekeeping was gracious in bringing an extra pillow and towel, the desk clerk and valet parking folks were friendly and efficient, the lobby is gorgeous and Sunday champagne brunch in the Landmark restaurant for $32 is elegant and tasty. We also enjoyed the dressing table in the bathroom and the mouthwash! Would we go back? No. The Melrose feels tired, lacks amenities like internet access (no heavenly bed here...), or something a little more for guests in the morning than coffee in the lobby.

<Content>Comfortable stay - but bring your earplugs... We recently stayed at the Melrose and also attended a wedding there. The wedding was beautiful with great food and a very nice bar. Our room was quite comfortable with a large bathroom for such an old hotel. The only issue I discovered was how paper-thin the walls are! We could hear almost every word of our neighbor's conversation through all hours of the night. So, word to the wise - bring your earplugs if you plan on getting any sleep at the Melrose Hotel!

<Content>pretty good Just returned with my wife from the Melrose. We flew to Dallas for business and to pick up our new puppy from a breeder. We had arranged to stay at the Cooper Clinic Guest Lodge and then found out they were not pet-friendly and had to change hotels at the last minute. We booked The Melrose because for a $50 fee you can have a pet there. When we arrived Valet was friendly and convenient. We were given a great rate that included breakfast and valet parking. Less than $200. Upon check-in we were upgraded to a corner king suite for no charge. The staff was friendly and the lobby nice. This is definitely a smaller boutique-type hotel. The location is not bad. However, there is a very large alternative lifestyle community right around the corner if that bothers you. If you drive down the Oak Lawn a ways you end up at a beautiful neighborhood with a great outdoor shopping mall. The best thing about the hotel was the restaurant and bar. The food was just rated 5 stars and we definitely would agree. Every meal was excellent. I would recommend the frozen lemon souffle for dessert. The one negative was the room was just OKAY. The comforter had some stains and the furniture looked worn. I was glad they upgraded us. Inspite of the just okay room, we would consider staying again because of the very friendly staff, location, and excellent food!! Last year we stayed at the four seasons and it would have to be ranked higher than the Melrose. However, it is hard to compete with the four seasons, especially when you are comparing it to a boutique hotel with no pool and very few amenities.
