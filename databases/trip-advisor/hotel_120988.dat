<Content>Excellent location I booked this hotel via lastminute.com and it was good value for money at 拢74 for a king sized bedroom. Choose this hotel as we only had two days to see Boston and were flying out on the second day back to the UK. Staying at the airport meant that we didn't have to drag our bags in and out of the city on public transport. We did go in and out of the city to sightsee using the T subway system. Either walking to Terminal A from the Hotel through the Skytunnel (covered walkway - 5 mins) and then getting on the Silverline bus which is part of the Boston T Subway and Bus system (tickets can be purchased just inside the Terminal by the bus stop, or taking the hotel free shuttle bus to the Airport T station on the Blueline to catch the Subway train. The Silverline takes you to the habour area and the Blueline into the city centre (both areas are worth checking out. Very comfortable room and all amenties were good. we didn't dine in the hotel, but grabbed a Starbucks and Bagel in the lobby coffee shop (open 5.30am - 12.30pm only).

<Content>Excellent airport hotel We stayed one night before an early morning flight. Room was modern, clean with a very comfortable bed.I am a light sleeper but wasn't disturbed at all by aircraft noise.Good shuttle service to the airport which departs every 15 minutes.Wish we had spent our entire stay in Boston at The Hilton!

<Content>Combined with the "T", it worked for me. Got it for $68 on Priceline for a conference in Cambridge. Room was immaculate, very comfortable beds, nice HD LCD TV, nice bathroom setup, no noise issues whatsoever either airport or neighbors.Parking ridiculous at $35/night so I stashed the car in Cambridge and took the Silver Line T from Terminal A which is about a 10 minute walk via the Skybridge from the second floor of the hotel. The T ran every 10 minutes and the trip to downtown took maybe 15. Switched over to the Red Line for another 15 minute ride up to Cambridge. I did this round trip about 10 times over 3 days and never had a problem - couldn't have been nicer.T pricing was $9.00 for a 24 hour ticket which included free rides for my 11 year old. And it goes everywhere you need to go.Didn't partake of hotel food but pricing seemed high to me. $15 for internet access also too much for me.

<Content>Not a Hilton ! Not up to hilton level - Lack of choice of on site food  beverage outlets. impossible to get a decent expresso coffee after 11 am. It seems management is reducing the costs by reducing service quality.

<Content>Pricy but good airport hotel I had to attend a large tradeshow in Boston in September 2008. The only option I had for the dates I was attending was the Hilton. I don't normally stay in airport hotels because I find them overexpensive and usually underdeliver service. I was glad that this hotel, although really expensive (likely due to the tradeshow), was a decent hotel.You cannot beat the convenience of the hotel. You don't ever have to step outside Logan Airport if you arrive in Terminal A. I walked from the plane directly over to the hotel via a skybridge in less than 10 minutes. The skybridge dumps you off by the conference area of the hotel. A little extra signage would have been helpful, but I managed to find the lobby to check in without too much hassle.Check in was quick and the staff helped me with understanding the bus routes for the tradeshow. My room was on a lower floor with the most dreadful view of roofs, pipes, and a slice of road. Fortunately, the noise from the airport was minimal, although you could hear the occasional jet taking off.The room is done in a minimalist style, very cool and gray. It was pretty masculine looking, but the bed was comfortable. The desk was useful for getting work done but the chair was a bit difficult to sit in for long periods of time. The hotel pub restaurant is a good option for those staying here. I was hesitant to eat there, because you really are a captive audience. But the portions were huge, prices were reasonable and the service was really good. I ended up eating there twice during my stay and the waiter remembered me on my second visit. I really liked the convenience of the hotel. If I absolutely had to choose between one of the Logan hotels for a future visit, I would want to return to the Hilton, as long as the price was not too outrageous.

<Content>Comfort at the airport Hilton Even though located at the airport, it was easy to get to transportation to take you downtown. The front desk people were very nice and personable. Even though I am only a Silver Hilton Honors member, I got upgraded to a club floor. All I had to do was ask. That meant a free breakfast and internet access which was a nice way to end a great visit to Boston.The rooms were on the small side but clean. The bed and linens were very nice along with the bathroom and toiletries.The hotel gym was very nice. Had a steam room and lap pool in addition to plenty of machines and weight options. It appeared to be a gym that airport employees also used. More of a club than a hotel gym in teh basement. Topnotch equipment also.Room service was good and prompt and all the employees we encountered were very nice. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Shame about the food Stayed here at the start of an excellent Caravan tour of New England. The hotel is attached to the airport by a walkway but since the airport is pretty large you will probably use the free hotel shuttle which takes just a few minutes. The hotel is quite new with very nice bedrooms. Our one gripe was the restaurant which seems to no longer serve dinner. Their only other option is the hotel's pub which stank of stale pizza which we found totally offputting. This forced us to take the shuttle to the nearest station where a very helpful worker suggested we take the train one stop away from Boston to her own neighbourhood. Here we found a number of wonderful Italian restaurants and had a great meal at non-tourist prices. So the Hilton's loss was our gain, excellent!

<Content>Nice Hotel Spent our last 3 nights here after a 16 day holiday in New England. Hotel was very nice and, as we had read in some other reviews, there was no aircraft noise to be heard. I'm sure most people spend only a night here, so thought we might have been given a room with a view of Boston, but we weren't. I know breakfast is not normally included in American hotels, but it would be nice for the price you are paying. Coffee in the room consisted of 2 packets of ordinary and decaffeinated with 2 creams! My husband phoned the front desk to ask for more to be told some would be sent up, but wasn't. The next day I phoned housekeeping and more was sent up immediately. There is a good shuttle service to the subway as well all parts of the airport.

<Content>TERRIFIC We chose this hotel because of location and the fact that the airlines kept switching our reservations and we couldn't finish our trip without an overnight stay somewhere. After being rescued by the wonderful people who represent the parking structure at Logan Airport, we exprienced a restful evening at theHilton. Rescued because we chose to cut across the parkiing structure and wandered around lost. (There should be more signs to the hotel.) Once we registered, we were treated to one of the best nights of rest! Tired, we ordered Room Service and tasted the most incredible Clam Chowder! The room was lovely, and the beds just invited sleep. Yes, this hotel is definitely on our Return To List, only the next time, we'll take the airport shuttle. :-D

<Content>great for a weary traveller! Stayed at the Hilton Logan International with my family - after a long flight from the UK. Was seduced by the promise of a 'covered walkway' so we didn't have to venture outside the airport feeling exhausted from the flight. We had a very good experience at this hotel. The room was comfortable and clean and we had a fabulous view of the airport and highway. The kind of view that made us think - YAY we're in America! Breakfast was great and the staff very welcoming.

<Content>Very nice Airport Hotel A nice stay for one night at this hotel. A full service Hilton with a walkway and shuttle service to the airport (walkway to Delta). The room was very up-to-date and clean. I was upgraded to an executive level. Unlike other Hilton ex rooms this one lacked the little things like slippers, and upgraded bathroom amenities. The lounge was ok, typical for US hotel. The breakfast was nice, but no hot foods. The walls in the rooms were a bit thin. There was some noise from other guest. Over all not a bad place for the night before or after a flight. Staff was nice and helpful

<Content>Overall Good Experience Hilton Hotel was very nice...beds very comfy, shuttle service was on time and wonderful to get to the T walls are very thin at 3 am in the morning I woke up to the people next door chit chatting...that was frustrating...it was difficult to get back to sleep...make sure you get the side of the hotel with the view of the water and Boston...much better than the highway view...One thing I wish the hotel had was a conceige desk in the lobby...especially for questions as to what restaurants to go to, or directions somewhere...they have you ask the bellman but he is too busy with people coming and going that it seemed like he didn't want to be bothered with answering those kind of questions...most hotels have a separate stand for a conceige...Overall, it was a nice expereince...rooms are clean...

<Content>Didnt want Logan area but it turned out OK anyway. I went on Priceline at the last minute and figured if I could snag a room cheap I would stay over, if not, I would do the drive home. I forgot to uncheck Logan as a search area and put in my very low price for a 4 star hotel within Boston. Yep, as soon as it said Congrats I knew at 79 it had to be something near Logan.. UGH!. It's way out of the way if your kicking around downtown and want to stay around the sights. But all in all, it turned out to be a nice place to stay the night. The staff at check in were great, very friendly. The front desk agent seeing my 7 year old boy asked if we wanted a Boston view, or one of the airport. My 7 year old yelled, airport so we had a lovely view of runway 44 LOL... . My kids liked the lap pool but I could tell that there were some serious swimmers waiting for the kids to get out so they can do their workout. To get to the pool you have to go through this narrow gym with people doing all of these stretches on the floor and your walking over them pretty much... strange culture those health clubs.. But, in the end, if your staying downtown and your doing the swan boats, etc., this place by the location only isnt where you want to be. However, if you are flying out in the early a.m., it's ideal.

<Content>Great Hotel, Helpful Staff, Great Location This hotel is right next to Logan Airport and has a frequent shuttle service. They are good at adapting to schedule changes, flight issues, and emergencies. Good food in the restaurants (there really isn't another option for eating close by). ROoms are clean and quiet. Well appointed.

<Content>Very reasonable place I only stayed in this hotel for a night before flying out to San Francisco the next day. The flight was early so decided to stay here instead of staying in downtown.Had driven from Albany and returned the car to the Avis rental place without a hassle. Room was very large, with comfortable beds and a nice old Boston map which added a bit of class to the room. Internet came at a cost and this was disappointing for a hotel that catered quite heavily to business travellers.The shuttle bus to the T station was very convenient, made travelling into downtown, and particularly the waterfront very easy.

<Content>Great Hotel for Minimal Stay Overall this hotel is wonderful if you're planning to only stay a few days in Boston. I say this because it is not ideal for long vacations due to the lack of places to eat other than the hotel's restaurant, and no small fridge or microwave. The hotel is connected (Yes, you're free to walk back and forth) to the Boston Logan Airport. You may think that there are places to eat within the airport but they are beyond the security gates unless you're fine with Dunkin Donuts. And despite being next to an airport, it is soundproof with a lovely view of the airport and a piece of Boston.As mentioned, the hotel is connected to the airport but it is isolated from Boston. However, there are many ways to get into Boston without a car. The hotel provides a complimentary shuttle service that goes around all of the terminals of the airport and its final destination is a blue T-line that you can take. In addition, there is a Silver line from South Station that you can take to the hotel and vice versa.The hotel is well designed and is a good attraction itself. The lobby is extremely large and contains many of the hotel's services (restaurant, pool, fitness center, gift shop, etc.). On the second floor is where the walkway from the hotel to the airport is. Also on the second floor is where all of the celebrations and events take place. If there is an event going on, you're going to have to walk through it to get to the walkway.The rooms are generally clean and presentable. The only problem we had was that there was a bottle cork and a tampon wrapper laying on the floor when we got into our room. Not really disgusting but keep an eye out. The room service then on redeemed itself.I would recommend this hotel mainly for business professions, individuals catching a flight from Boston Logan and elderly persons. This hotel can be romantic if you get the right side of the hotel that has the view of Boston. Enjoy your time there as it will be completely memorable.

<Content>Very Good Hotel A trip to Boston for the 4th July fireworks meant a chance to spend a night in one of my most frequented hotels, the Hilton at Boston Logan Airport.For convenience this hotel is hard to beat. Whilst not in the downtown area, for business travellers, or those with early or late flights, you cannot beat the location. Physically connected to Terminals A and E, the hotel also offers a courtesy shuttle, which also drops and picks up at the T subway station for the city.I used Hilton's online check in system so I knew I had an upgraded room. Arriving at check in there was a lengthy line, but the Hhonors line was clear so I joined that, only to be consistently ignored by staff and barged out of the way by non-Hhonors members. I got zero benefit from using online check in or the Hhonors priority line, so I have to ask what the benefit of these services are if a hotel ignores them...But that was the only flaw with the stay. The rooms in the Hilton are nice. All have views, some of the airport which is surprisingly interesting, and on this occasion for, a view across the airport to the city sklyine. A great vantage point for the firework display, enhanced by the presence of the Queen Mary 2 in the harbour.Rooms are clean, bathrooms good, and the new flatscreen TV's are very good. My only criticism with the room is that they appear to have removed the mini-bars. Wifi internet access is available, and seems quick and stable. The exec lounge is good, offers a reasonable conteninental breakfast and again has superb views over the harbour.Check out was painless, the bill accurate and every member of staff I met courteous and polite. I would have rated at 5 stars if not for the check in experience.

<Content>Perfect for gentle start to a trip I needed to stay in Boston the night before flying to California and the Hilton was great. Very comfortable room, very friendly staff, no problems, everything comfortable. Used the shuttle to get to the T to go downtown and meet some friends for dinner and that worked great. The hotel is a shlep from the terminal through acres of parking garage, but the shuttle serves the terminals. I liked being able to walk though.

<Content>Rat! I stayed there in the middle of June, one night before a flight home. I had stayed there in March and had a fairly good stay at that time. I checked in at about 3 PM. As I walked to my room,which was the very last unit on the fourth floor, the hall way was lined with at least two dozen used room service trays from the night before. I got into my room and sat on the bed for a while watching TV. Out of the corner of my eye I saw movement. I looked over at the air conditioning vent, which is on the lower part of the wall against the window, just in time to see the back half of a rat crawl out of my room and into the vent! Folks, I grew up on the corner of a farm and I assure you that I know the difference between a rat and a mouse. Mice don't have long tails and they are not the size of a hamster. Surely all the dishes I saw out in the hall were the rat buffet. I called the front desk, and they changed my room, but they were not very much more accommodating then just giving me a pass to the executive club for the day. While the front desk guy was appologetic, what he didn't seem was suprized!

<Author>who_we_talkin_about
<Content>Reasonably priced for downtown boston--not a bad place to stay The Hilton at Logan Airport is a very reasonably priced 4 star property in down town Boston. The hotel shuttles did a great job dropping us off and picking us up from the subway station so we didn't need a car. The pool was small, but nice for the kids. Room service was good, but VERY pricey (and the hotel restaurant would not serve any meals to go). I was a little surprised there were no refrigerators in the rooms for a hotel of this quality. Rooms were very nice, and we stayed on the Executive Floor which included a nice complimentary continental breakfast. No complaints, but for a 4 star property they didn't blow us away. Given the price of lodging in Boston, it was a great value for the price. Would recommend.

<Content>Nice Hotel, Convenient to Airport, More coffee please We were treating our mother to a cruise and decided to stay here pre-cruise as it was convenient to the airport. A little expensive for my taste, but this was vacation and for the hotel class and convenience not badly priced - $220 for 3 people. Very, very comfortable beds and pillows, excellent linens. Clean modern room though a bit small. Safe and secure premises. Free airport shuttle, even at midnight. Friendly efficient staff.Did not like: paying for internet, too little coffee in the room, no continental breakfast.

<Content>Nice location We stayed here for a two day visit to Boston, before flying from the airport. The airport is only 3 miles from the city and the hotel runs a free shuttle to the subway, so access was easy. We stayed in a high room (9th floor) and had fabulous views from the room. We booked and were given an early check in. The hotel bar was OK for food and you get the usual Hilton standards, so we were perfectly happy with the stay.

<Content>Hotel Nightmare There was a dog barking near my room--on my floor--on and off from before 11pm until well past midnight. Repeated calls the the front desk and management did no good. It seems they sent someone to check, who stuck their head off the elevator and went back downstairs. All they had to do was stick around for 10 minutes but no, that was asking too much. And I did ask--repeatedly. With an early morning flight, this was most unwelcome. To add insult to injury, when I complained to the manager in the morning he suggested I made the whole thing up to get a discount on my bill. Yeah, right. Even it it was my nickel (it was my employer's) I'd much rather get some sleep than get a discount. This was not the first time a Hilton family hotel has demonstrated a complete disregard for customers' sleep, BTW; it seems to run in the family.

<Content>If only other hotels were this good! When we checked in, the guy at the front desk greeted me by name, noted my Hilton diamond status... VERY professional... if only other hotels could be half this professional... We went to our excellent room (1057) which has a great view of the airport (although you can't hear a sound) and Boston Harbor beyond...Then we made a trip to the concierge lounge... excellent... the lounge, the drinks... the food... excellent!!All-in-all, this is a great hotel... as for airport Hiltons... this is by far the best so far!!!

<Content>Hilton Boston Logan Got a great rate on Hotwire of $84/night. Paid dearly for parking (rape) at $35/day valet or $30/day self-park, which is the most I think I've EVER paid for parking at a hotel, including downtown hotels around the country. Internet was overpriced by $5 at $14.95/24 hours. A little tricky to get to because of it's location on Logan's grounds, and a long walk from the terminals, or you can wait for the shuttles. The coffee bar in the lobby is only open until 12:30pm, boo! There is a Starbucks about 3-4 miles from the hotel that is easy to find in the Target just down the road and a Wendy's in teh same lot. The staff was very friendly and helpful in giving directions, if you have a car.The room was very clean, nicely decorated and had a 32-37 LCD TV that had a true Hi-Definition signal. This was nice feature since most of the hotels I've been in tout their 32-42 plasma and LCD TVs and then have standard signals and stretch them to boot, yuck.Even though I booked through Hotwire, they were nice enough to upgrade me to the Executive Level because I'm HHonors Gold. I had to ask for it, but they otherwise wouldn't have known about my status because Hotwire doesn't tell them, or ask.All staff was very friendly and helpful during my 2 night stay.

<Content>Excellent The room, at $179, was a great value considering this is a full service hotel.Unfortunately for me the hotel was not in the most convenient location, but most other locations were booked up already due to the marathon.Everyone was very friendly and helpful and with a shuttle service to the subway station, I did not personally need a car.There is also an enclosed walkway that directly connects the hotel to the airport.The only problem I had was that my room had neither microwave nor a refrigerator. I don't stay in full service hotels very often, so maybe this is just their way of trying to get you to eat their overpriced food.

<Content>Nice Place So I booked this through Priceline for a Friday night stay (got a great rate - 1/3 of rack rate). I was doing a one night overnight stay in Boston for a Daddy / Daughter Day so in reality we just needed a safe nice place to stay. We checked in pretty early (11:45am) and our room was ready. Got to the room and it was pretty nice. 2 double beds, a flat screen TV, a little chaise lounge type thingy. The bathroom was OK, a little dingy on the bathtub grout, but besides that OK. The view was nothing great (but did I mention I got a great rate?) but I never heard any airplanes (so it was pretty soundproof). I didn't like that the pool was off the lobby (I prefer them on an upper floor so I don't look like a fool going by the front desk) and the pool seemed to be in the spa / fitness area (not really a family type pool / more of a business type pool - but then again it's a business hotel). We took the shuttle to the T (never had to wait - it was even there when we were coming back to the hotel). Staff was very friendly. Parking was expensive, but it's Boston - all parking is expensive.

<Content>Good Airport Hotel, Don't Count on the Shuttle I've stayed here several times-it's extremely convenient to Logan, with covered walkways to the terminals. Good rooms, nice staff, good pool and fitness center. On the other hand, the Shuttle is slow, erratic and disorganized, which is THE MOST IMPORTANT service in an airport hotel! Several times it has taken 30-45 min from lobby to destination. So, guests, use the walkways if you can. Management, please fix-have the shuttles leave on time, every 15 minutes, on a fixed route!

<Content>Great hotel! We were very, very pleased with our one night stay here. We booked through priceline and got a price of $149 per night. We were given and unexpected upgrade at the front desk to an executive level room. The room was spacious and comfy, with a great flat panel tv! The bed was super comfortable, and the bathroom was very large. We had a great view of the harbour!I have to comment on the cleanliness - This room was spotless. I have never stayed in a cleaner hotel room before. We ordered room service for dinner. The food was good, and the prices reasonable for room service. The executive floor also has a lounge with light snacks at dinnertime. The night we were there they offered cheese and crackers, fruit, chicken skewers, samosas, cake bites, and free sodas and coffee. We also had the breakfast buffet in the morning, which was the standard Hilton breakfast, and it was great as always.My only complaint is that parking is very expensive - It should be free to guests.

<Content>Great Hotel for Travel This hotel served our needs very well for an overnight and early morning departure from Logan. The hotel is connected via sky bridge to Logan which is great for Delta flights. However, we were flying American and although a bit of a walk , we were able to get to any terminal using the airport sky bridges. We never had to go outside and didn't use the free airport shuttle. We were able to leave our room at 4 am and be in our terminal well ahead of time for our 530 am departure. The hotel met our needs perfectly. I enrolled for Hhonors points but really don't expect to be treated like the King of New England because I have them. Check in was easy and the front desk clerk was very friendly and helpful. The room was super modern and nice. We used a park and fly rate for 4 nights and then the hotel only charged us 23.00 for each extra night, making it actually cheaper then staying in Logan central parking area. They give you a special card to swipe when leaving. There really is not an option for food other than eating at the hotel which is very overpriced and only very average food. The workout room and pool looked very nice but didn't get a chance to use them. It was great returning after a 5 night vacation and departing the plane, grabbing your luggage and heading back to the hotel via sky bridge to obtain the car. All in all a great hotel for travel.

<Content>Ugggh! I am an Hhonors Diamond member, and get great treatment from Hilton properties. Not here! I got a little room across from the ice machine, no drinks in the Executive Lounge, $14.95 a day wi-fi connection fee (cellular modem doesn't work in this hotel), and to top it off, I asked for a breakfast coupon, since none were enclosed in our envelope. I was told if I wanted breakfast, I had better pay for it! As a courtesy after raising a fuss, I was given a coupon for one day, and told that was it! Breakfast was awful! I love Hilton properties, but will make sure I never stay here again!

<Content>Very nice airport hotel We stayed here on a Friday night in late March, two couples in two rooms. Thanks to its direct bridge connection to the airport, this Hilton is an excellent location for an overnight stay near the airport -- and with the free shuttle to the airport subway station, it's also conveniently located for sightseeing trips into the city. We got a very good price the night we stayed, and thought about staying here again the following weekend but the price had more than doubled; it's an excellent $150 hotel but not worth $350!The rooms are modern, well furnished and clean, and those on the city side have a nice view of downtown. All of the staff were very friendly and helpful. On-site food choices are somewhat limited and a bit pricey, but the bar is quite nice and you can get morning coffee and pastries in the lobby.

<Content>Very good hotel I got a good deal ($100 per night) on this hotel via on-line booking. It was clean and comfortable. The staff was helpful. It is within easy walking distance from many airport terminals even if you have a moderate amount of luggage and saved me from having to get up early and then grab a cab to the airport. I would highly recommend it.

<Content>Excellent airport hotel! We stayed here for one night on friday february 29, 2008. We had an early flight out of Boston. We made parking reservations at thrifty. they refused to honor our reservation and we asked the hotel if they had the park and fly package available. They were full..but they did give us a list of parking lots where we could park and gave us a good recommendation. We asked for two rooms on a high floor...they gave us floor 8. we were rooms 830 and 831. The hallways were nicely appointed. The rooms were your standard business class 4 star hotel, which was nice. It had a nice plasma tv in it and the beds were comfortable. the shower was nice, good toiletries...nice furniture...rooms were a bit small but that was okay. the staff was fine too. we awoke in the morning to snow and feared the worst but everything was fine except for a small delay out of boston due to deicing the plane. the shuttle came promptly to take us to terminal B (American Airlines). When we arrived there was a huge line..but the bus driver got us a luggage cart and pushed our luggage to the very front of the line, where some of us could wait for it while the remaining people in our party stood in line. that was very nice not to have t o wheel 12 bags around through a line. Overall the hilton is an excellent hotel...we will use it again.....there is also a pool and a gym and a hot tub.

<Author>GoodCompany2000
<Content>Convenient, clean and comfortable Last minute booking with no problems. The hotel is right at the Boston Logan Airport and can be accessed from the gates by walkway. I came into Terminal B and it was about a 10 minute walk, all indoors through walkways and through Terminal A, and it was not difficult to find. It appears to be new. Although it is it at the airport, I did not hear a single jet take off or land, which I was concerned about when I booked.Check in was quick and easy (I came in at 11:00 and there were only a couple people waiting at the check in desk) and the assistant at the front desk was pleasant. The room was a good size, very clean and very comfortable. I particularly appreciated the HD television and HD Channels. I also liked the night light in the bathroom, of which I had not seen a similar one before. It was its own outlet and gave off a very low blue glow when the light was turned off - not bright enough to be seen in the bedroom, and just light enough to let you see the floor as you walked into the bathroom in the middle of the night, so that you could easily find the light switch without banging a toe, or worse.My view was of the road coming into the airport, but I wasn't looking for a good view given my limited time there. It looked like there were potential for some nice views of the harbor from other rooms. The lobby is large and well appointed, and we used a conference room that was clean, well appointed and had convenient power plug ins for computers located within the tables and out of the way.The only negative I have about the hotel is that you have to pay for the wireless internet connection. I personally believe that today all hotels, and particularly hotels catering to business people, should not only have wireless internect connection, but it should free (at least build it into the cost of the room).One last positive. I had to cancel my second night stay and check out about 15 minutes after noon. The hotel did not charge me for the second night or charge a late cancellation fee without me asking. I really do appreciate that and I consider that good service.

<Content>Wonderful send off It really doesn't get any more convenient that this. With an early morning flight we decided to treat ourselves to an over night at the Hilton - I'm delighted we did. The rooms were wonderful and the bed was one of the most comfortable I've ever slept in. We were particularly impressed with the staff who seemed interested and happy - a refreshing change to many transit hotels where the employees seem jaded. I'd certainly recommend the Hilton.

<Content>Great Airport Hotel The night before taking a flight out of Logan, my partner and I stayed at the conveniently located Logan Airport Hilton, which I would have to rate as one of the best airport hotels anywhere. It is adjacent to the terminals and has an enclosed bridge that takes you to the central parking lot. From there, you can walk or take airport's parking lot shuttle (the drivers are not allowed to accept tips, btw) to any of the terminals. There is also a Hilton shuttle from the hotel to each terminal. While overnight parking is available at the hotel, the central garage is enclosed, important in the winter, and cheaper ($24 vs. $30 a night at the Hilton), and I'm sure long-term parking is even less. So, we parked our car in the central garage for the five days we were away. We saved some money and the car was right outside the door to the terminal.The lobby is grand and check-in was efficient. The very pleasant desk clerk invited us to use the concierge-level lounge for snacks that evening and for a continental breakfast the following morning. There is no alcohol served in that lounge. Breakfast was very good -- fruit, cereal, coffee/tea, juice, bagels, muffins -- enough to get you going before your flight.Our room was a good size and very quiet. Beds are comfy and the bathroom, stocked with Crabtree and Evelyn toiletries, was spotless, as was the main part of the room. The shower had great water pressure. There was a coffee maker in the room. We did not use the workout area or the spa, which offered a variety of treatments. Check-out was a breeze and the clerk on in the morning was as pleasant as the one the night before.Two things keep me from giving the excellent rating -- a charge for Internet service, which should be free, considering many businesspeople use this hotel, and some knocking noises that were hard to determine as to origin, and lasted for about five minutes.I've also stayed at the Hyatt, the equivalent of a few blocks away but still on airport property. While I liked the Hyatt, I would probably choose the Hilton instead, especially since it offered a lower rate and was much more conveniently located.

<Content>Nice Consolation After Flight Cancellation After a frustrating day of late arrivals, missed connections and a flight cancellation, US Air rewarded me with a night at the Hilton - and it was (almost) worth the delay. This is a beautiful and surprisingly quiet hotel located on the airport property. I enjoyed a nice meal downstairs before retiring in a well appointed, clean and comfortable room. The hotel shuttled me back to the gate in time for my 7 a.m. flight. I would consider staying here again - even without the flight delays.

Reasonable size room with all you need (including large flat screen TV) except for in room safe. Good variety of choice at breakfast. Not the cheapest but value for money.Regular courtesy bus to all parts of airport including car hire depots and transport stops. Pedestrian bridge connecting hotel to terminals.Recommended.

<Content>Best "in airport" hotel. Once again, our layover got extended so we walked over to the Hilton and got a room. (Long walk, but it's covered.) This is about the third time I've got stuck in Boston at this hotel. But if you're going to get stuck, this is the hotel to do it at. Great sfaff and good property. This would not be, however, a good hotel to stay at for extended stays in Boston for the fact that getting to and from the city - albeit close - would get expensive. Between the taxi fare, the add-ons, and the tolls, about $25 each way.

<Content>Airport hotels are rubbish.... don't believe it - this one was excellent!!!! I really enjoyed my stay here. It was a business trip and I was a bit worried about being out of it by the airport but the combination of the excellent accommodation, shuttles to the subway and excellent subway infrastructure made this a superb stay. There is a good Irish bar within the hotel, a good gym and pool, good rooms and overall a very nice hotel. If I went back to Boston I would stay there.

<Content>Spectacular My Minneapolis flight came in very late and I booked a stay instead of driving over an hour home at midnight.What a beautiful hotel. It is easy to find through a catwalk at the airport. They also provde a shuttle if you dont want to walk.In the lobby there is a nice pub and all business amenities.The room is absolutely beautiful, new furniture, updated, with a pretty view of the airport and water.In the morning, I went to the health club. There are towels, a locker room, a lap pool and updated equipment. TV's were everywhere to offer distraction and individual TV's on each machine.I am a Silver Hilton member and I was immediately offered services of the members lounge, even though its usually for Gold or Platinum members. there was complimentary breakfast, newspapers, magazines, concierge and another business center. Beautiful setting.The staff were all excellent and to be commended for their attention to detail.I have been in many Hiltons due to business and this was absolutely the best. I will definitely go back, and my thanks for a wonderful stay.

<Content>The Good, The Bad, and The Dusty The hotel rooms looked nice and everyone really liked the toiletries (Crabtree and Evelyn). Everyone enjoyed the shuttle service and the pub downstairs. Front desk staff was nice. Bell hops, valet, and shuttle drivers are the BEST! Any AV service is priced over the moon and has to be checked daily to ensure it works.The banquet menu is limited, but tasty.Everyone in my group of 30 complained that they heard someone having sex in the next room. That is not a good thing to hear when you are purposely staying at a classy hotel. I doubt 30 people were making up stories, when in fact I heard it next to my room too. This appears to be a hook-up hotel as there were even people in the bar downstairs who should have had a room. I even had one gentleman come up to me whilst I was going to my room and ask me if I wanted to hook up!!!!!! Evidently the guests at this Hilton hotel take after Paris.Some in my group even complained about bed bugs and asked for room changes. The carpets were so dusty on the 2nd floor, the gentlemen in my group had to keep on lint rolling their trousers every hour.Room service was edible, but nothing to write home about. My company recently did an event at this hotel and spent some good money at the Hilton. We did not feel as if our Company was important. RUSH RUSH RUSH..In and out. It was as if it was all about money and not building relationships for future business. Everything was the fault of the customer. Be sure to include time for set up/tear down on your event or else they will start tearing it apart for you. They don't schedule events properly so if you are trying to do a training, suddenly you can't hear what is going on due to the fact that there is a band outside your door. Communication could have been better with the entire banquet staff. I really felt at times that my banquet manager was overwhelmed with events and could not give us her full attention, or was not allowed to.I personally thought that lower star hotels have offered better customer service, value and flexibility. Check everything twice! At one point my cleaning lady cleaned my mugs in my room by taking them to the bathroom and rinsing them (which I already did) vs. replacing them. Surely this isn't sanitary? Oddly enough, I have a cold this week.

<Content>Go for the Exec Level... This is an above average airport hotel however we used it for a city break to Boston - 4 nights. We booked an Exec Level room (10th floor) for $199 plus various taxes. The 10th floor has certainly had a re-fit with new furniture and decorations. Overall the scheme is very pleasing. With the exec level you get access to the lounge with free continental breakfast and hot snacks in the evening. Note: there are no free alcoholic drinks due to Massachusetts state law.Pros: its an easy 5 min walk to termial A to catch the silver line downtown (about a 10 min journey) and a 10 min walk to terminal E. The shuttle runs fequently if you cannot be bothered to walk or if you want to go to the blue line subway.Cons: We've stayed at this hotel about 5 times and it is a very nice hotel but we felt this experience was a little disappointing. Check in wasn't until 4.00pm and although we'd arrived after an international flight (at 2pm) not one room was ready...even the baggage man was surprised that we had to wait when we checked our bags for the wait. I think this is something they could address quite easily but no one on reception was bothered. When we did check in there was no apology for the lengthy wait (3 hours).The rooms are spacious and comfortable - no complaints. There is no noise from the airport and our neighbours were quiet so no disturbing noise from them either. Housekeeping was a bit hit and miss - dust was clearly visible when we arrived but it gradually disappeared dueing the stay. Bedding and towels changed everyday. The bed is VERY comfortable...The exec lounge is a nice facility but the breakfast NEVER changes - cereals, fruit, bagels/muffins/pastries and cold boiled eggs. Is it really too much to expect a little variation? It wouldn't cost THAT much to put some hot eggs and bacon on the menu - even a Hilton Hampton Inn can manage that. That said, its fresh and good quality so if you are only staying 1 or 2 nights then you'll be OK. Anything longer will send you out looking for alternatives.Staff are polite but a little remote - no complaints. Overall it's worth the money given the accommodations and facilities compared to downtown Boston prices and it's easy to get downtown if you want to go there. For a little bit of investment it could be outstanding...

<Content>Very Good but not Excellent Firstly, this is a hilton connected to the airport with a good shuttle service so it is what you expect from a Hilton so of course it is very good....however it is not excellent and i will tell you why..Firstly, the walls are paper thin so if the hotel is busy and the room next to you is occupied then you will hear the TV, i booked and pre-paid breakfast in advance but the hotel had no record and depsite showing written proof they still wanted to charge me $20 and then refund me when they contact the travel agent. Now, customer service should indicate that they as a gesture of goodwill take the temporary $20 hit...If you get this hotel for under $200 then its worth booking but if you pay more then you won't get value for money...

<Content>Nice resting spot We have stayed at the Hilton at Boston Logan Airport every year during our annual trip to the Carribean. The skywalk is a great alternative to the hotel shuttle however the shuttle does run every 10-15 minutes. Check in was easy and pleasant. We ordered room service which was VERY good, it arrived on time and hot. We had a very early flight out the next morning and the ZIP CHECKOUT made our departure all the easier. One call to an automated line and we were on our way. I was a tad concerned when we returned as our flight was delayed and we didnt get in until 1:00 a.m. I had not requested a late check and was concerned that perhaps they didn't hold our room. No need to worry, they did. Even at 1:00 a.m. they had plenty of front desk staff to attend to us as well as other travelers. Room service was even available at that hour and again the food arrived on time and hot. The Hilton is a nice resting spot in between flights and we will stay there again in the future.

<Content>Very comfortable place; ideal if you have an early a.m. flight I am staying here for 1 night at this hotel because I have an early morning flight. It is about a 7-10 minute walk from Terminal A to the hotel lobby (signs are everywhere so you don't get lost). If you have heavy bags, just be aware it is a little bit of a walk. Front desk was very courteous--no offer to help with bags, but then again, I like that (less I have to tip), and I'm sure they would have helped if I asked. Executive level floor has nice rooms, free bottled water, coffee maker, and flat panel TV. My room looks out to Terminal A, it's neat watching the planes take off and land. Quality bath products (crabtree and evelyn), and the robe is a nice touch. Room service was prompt--good food for a hotel restaurant. I don't know why hotels of this quality make you pay for Internet (and for the money you pay), that's my only complaint.

<Content>Relaxation at Boston Logan Generally I approach airport hotels with low expectations as they always seem to be disappointing in at least one regard, however my recent stay at the Hilton Boston Logan Airport was thankfully disappointment free!In terms of getting to the Hotel, if you've got a lot of luggage I would suggest getting the courtesy shuttle to the hotel as the walk (through two or three skywalks) is fairly lengthy - easily 10 minutes at a brisk pace. When approaching from the airport skywalks you arrive on an upper level which houses a number of meeting rooms and looks out over the main lobby area. Although there was nothing going on in the meeting rooms, I noticed a couple of hotel maintenance staff cleaning the area.When I got to the checkin desk there was a line of 3 people ahead of me. There were three staff on the checkin desk and one member of staff greeting people in the line and apologising for the delay...a delay which lasted about 2-3 minutes! During the checkin process I was given a choice of rooms (which I thought was a nice touch) and informed about the hotel facilities.I opted for a room overlooking the airport. The room was comfortable, spotlessly clean and very well appointed, with a High Def LCD TV to top it all off. Noise from the airport could not be heard in the room and the general ambiance of the accommodations led to a relaxing and enjoyable evening.As I felt drained after my flight into Boston, I opted to use the room service menu for dinner. This is not something that I usually do, but the menu on offer seemed very reasonable (possibly due to the $ to 拢 exchange rate) and the food choices appealing. The room service was delivered promptly and the quality of the food excellent.Overall this is one of the best airport hotels I have stayed in. I will certainly go back again should my travels take me to Boston. The Hilton Boston Logan airport hotel is certainly somewhere to consider if you've got an overnight stopover at Boston and don't want to head into the city.

<Content>Nice airport hotel This is a nice Hilton connected by a walkway to Boston Logan. I found this to be a great convenience. The restaurant was all right. The beds were very good (I spent two separate nights in this hotel -- therefore, I stayed in two different rooms -- when I was arriving in the evening in Boston from a long flight and another night when arriving back in Boston in preparation for an air departure the following AM out of Logan.) The only problem is you are isolated there, nothing to do or walk to, except the airport.

<Content>Great hotel at Logan - and so convenient ... This is a great place to stay if you have an early flight: just walk to your terminal in under five minutes. Comfortable room, with superb view across the water to the city; good buffet breakfast; very tasty meal from room service ... what's not to like?

<Content>Great Hotel I was provided a corner room with a view of Boston from one window and a view of the Delta terminal from the other window.The room was clean and comfortable with typical Hilton Le Source bath products. My only disappointment was that there was no bottled water in the room. Not a bad problem to have if that is the only one.The fitness center was upgraded to all Precor equipment. I got to spend an hour on one of the ellipticals while I was there.The meeting rooms were comfortable and the food was very good.Transportation to/from the airport was quick and painless.I will definitely stay at this hotel again if I'm in the Boston area.

<Content>Hotels should deliver what they confirm The Hilton is very convenient for the airport and we chose it for that reason. Arriving from the UK very late in the evening we were not pleased that the room that we had booked months in advance was not available unless we took the type specially reserved for the disabled. All other rooms except twin bedded had been allocated. Why? Also the televison did not work at all-but after a trans atlanic journey you do not want an engineer in your room at night at 11pm.All in all, a lot needs to be done at this hotel to give the customer what they have asked for and paid for. Unfortunately, we spent a month in various hotels in the US and it does seem to be a common fault. Service is no longer a priority in the US.

<Content>Solid airport hotel--exceptional for the price I had a very early flight from Boston and had been looking for a good hotel near Logan. Everything was up in the $300 range so I decided to try Priceline and was shocked that I got the Hilton for $90!!! This is an above-average Hilton. The lobby is airy and immediately inviting. Check-in (and check-out) was quick and friendly. I was given room 360-- a smoking room as I'd requested. I understand the anti-smoking issues, but I admire Hilton for still accommodating those of us who can't quite kick the habit. The room was large, sleek, clean and had a nice view of Boston. The tv was brand new, flat-panel with great resolution, although the choice of channels was a bit limited (about 25) when compared to some other hotels. I couldn't quite master the a/c system which I set at 68 but kept bouncing back to 74. It didn't matter much because the glass captured the cold outside, but on a hot day, I would've called maintenance.I ordered room service, chicken quesadilla and a turkey panini with fries. The food was good quality, especially the fries which tasted fresh-cut. It wasn't a culinary extravaganza, but it did the job.As for the walkway to the airport, it's really only useful if you're flying in/out of terminal A (Delta). Otherwise, use the hotel shuttle which runs 24 hours.Highly recommended hotel for travelers needing to stay near Logan.

The rooms were spacious with good beds and nice furnishings.I would stay here again, but would avoid the restaurant....it wasn't so great.

<Content>Excellent value; Excellent Hotel Our family of 4 spent the night of Aug 16th. at the Hotel before our early day flight back to London.It was excellent. The service was great. The room was particularly good with a HDTV.The shuttle was full at 6am so within 30 seconds the second shuttle was in place to take us promptly to the terminal.The only negative was that the onscreen departure info was not working on the TV so we could check that our flight was on time, (and thus get up at 5.35am!). The front desk quickly searched this on the internet when I phoned them.We could not get the hotel at any discount on Priceline only for my wife to get it via our airline BA (British Airways) for just 拢90 (US $179), so it is worth giving BA a call or booking it via their website as we stayed at the height of the holiday season.I regularly get a day flight back to London form NY, Boston and Chicago and this is the best hotel I have used at JFK, Newark, BOS or O`Hare for the night before. Highly recommended at that price.Patrick

<Content>Great anniversary night! We were able to check in early (probably as it was a slow day - the Saturday of a three day weekend) and the desk clerk, when entering our Hilton rewards card number, found out it was our 32nd anniversary. She upgraded us to a fabulour corner room, facing the harbor and gave us complimentary access to the executive suite hospitality room. The staff were all very nice, from the bell man who gave us tips on how to get into Boston and what to do once we got there, to the desk clerk, to the health club attendant, to the shuttle bus drivers. Would stay there again in a heart beat! Was only sad it was a one night stand at the end of our vacation!

<Content>Dependable Hilton This was a business trip to Boston, 4 days 3 nights. Staff was friendly and courteous. Helped me find where I needed to go for my meetings as well as dinners. A lot of activities (an out of state high school band staying there, a different high school prom, etc) going on in the hotel, yet it was quite and restful. Food at the bar/restaurant was above average. They gift shop attendant was very helpful and informative. Overall above average stay.

The room service took forever, they accidentally charged us for the services we never received, and I had my clothes stolen in the gym locker room and they have taken no action. I would not recommend it to my friends or family.

<Content>excellent Stayed with family on holiday for 5 nights, booked solely for convenience to avoid a long trek with bags into Town following a long flight. Superb hotel, totally insulated from sound of airport, excellent rooms, comfortable beds, plasma HD TV in rooms. Staff all competent and friendly. Executive lounge on 10th floor great for views and free snacks am and pm. Shuttles regular and reliable, never had to wait more than a minute. Pool was a bit cold, but otherwise highly recommended, and not too expensive when booked direct.

<Content>Handy Walkway from the Airport a bit Misleading Stopped for one night having arrived in to Boston just before midnight on a late flight. The handy link walkway to the hotel is misleading although it does have one if you happen to be in the rightterminal. We probably dragged our suitcases a couple of miles around the airport and car park. It would have been easier to just get a taxi outside the terminal to the front door of the hotel.Then to find that the room we had booked had been given out because we had arrived late...........no suprise there we told them on our booking request, we just felt that the staff didnt care whether we stopped or not.A handy stop over but I could'nt recommend it for anything more than an evening.

<Content>They Do It Right Great. Beautifully appointed room, courteous staff, and they made it easy to return our rental car after checking in -- sent the shuttle to Avis to get my husband. Despite its being located at the airport, it was quiet. The art in hallways, common areas and rooms is a cut above the average hotel blah. And even though we were Priceline guests, we did not get the room by the elevator with the dripping window unit air conditioner, rusty sink bowl, and off-kilter ceiling tiles.

<Content>Nice place to stay I enjoyed this hotel. The only real problem is that it is not in one of the neigborhoods that allows you to see Boston. However, the cab ride into Boston city is less than 20 dollars - which isn't too bad at all. The rooms were spacious and nice quality and the food and service was good. The menu could have been a little more extensive.

<Content>Solid airport hotel I have stayed at the Hilton Logan three times over the last two years. It is a solid hotel with comfortable, clean rooms, completely insulated from the noise of the airport. Its weekend rates can be quite reasonable, especially for Boston. Room service and the restaurants are very, very pricey (presumably since most people who stay there are on expense accounts), and if you arrive at night, there is nowhere else you can go. The breakfast buffet is unexceptional (scrambled eggs, oatmeal, fresh fruit, cereals, sandwich breads and bagels) but decent.The airport shuttle is irregular; if you call from baggage claim, be sure to go out immediately, since it won't wait around for you. Be aware, however, that you may end up waiting anywhere from two to forty minutes. This hotel could use an extra shuttle since there are times that the wait at the terminal can be very long for a hotel that is right on airport premises.That said, I would recommend this hotel to anyone who needs to overnight at the airport, particularly if you can get a price that's $150-200 range. And remember to eat before you arrive.

<Content>Great Stay @ the Hilton Logan We enjoyed our brief one night stay at the Hilton Logan. Based on earlier reviews I requested a room overlooking the airport. We didn't hear a thing and my twin 5 year olds LOVED watching the planes coming and going. The room was as you would expect of an airport hotel, clean but not extremely spacious. Overall it serves its purpose. We had returned our rental car so we availed ourselves of the hotel shuttle to eat at Legal Seafoood's airport location for dinner. We will be back to this hotel next time we have an early morning flight out of Logan!!

<Content>Awesome for the price and convenience We stayed here in order to facilitate an overnight (15 hour or so) layover. The convenience is great (right in the terminal of the airport) and I could not believe how luxurious the hotel was for the price. We had a wonderful time, and the restaurant food was good (though a little pricey).

<Content>Terrific hotel This was a repeat visit to this hotel for our family. We got a great rate by pre-paying for the night through our AAA office. This is a great hotel if you have an early flight out of Logan. Room was clean and well appointed. Health spa is really quite nice with excellent equipment. Staff is friendly. You can walk to Logan through a skyway system. We took the shuttle to the T and had dinner in Boston that night. All very easy and probably half the price of a downtown hotel.

<Content>NIce hotel We stayed here on the first night of our honeymoon since we had an early flight the next morning. We arrived very late that evening and check in was fast and easy. They had even chilled a bottle of Champaign since we were on our honeymoon. We had breakfast very early the next morning and that was a very nice start to the long day of traveling. The hotel is not as close to the airport as it appears. You can walk over but you are probably better off asking for a ride over to the airport instead of trying to navigate through all the parking lots to the actual terminals.

<Content>nice stay We stayed Jun 22 for one night. Got this hotel at a bargain of $85 a night on Priceline. Room was nice and clean and the decor was nice, not Motel 6 cheesy.Ate at the Pub downstairs. Disappointed on their seating policy--they don't have a hostess that seats you. You are supposed to walk in and seat yourself. The night we went, flights had been cancelled so the restaurant was full and at least 20 people circling like vultures for an open table. I found the manager and advised to get a waiting list because it was soon going to get ugly. Food was okay for a hotel. Kids loved the indoor heated pool. Would definately stay again.

<Content>The Hilton was Average Our family was one of two families traveling together with teens. The hotel itself was attractive and clean, both the lobby and room. The room was a tad on the small side, specifically the beds. I believe they were full beds, not queens. Had I known that, we might it have opted for two adjoining rooms. Check-in was quick and efficient. Once reaching the room, we did have a few minor issues, but ones that I wouldn't have expected when staying at a four star hotel. The television didn't work for starters and it took two calls to housekeeping to get it fixed. Within about 2 hours, the toilet was clogged, and again, it took two calls to housekeeping to get them up to fix it. While fixing the toilet, the guy splashed water all over the floor, and left it there for me to clean up. Not something I wanted to do, but did anyway. Both times, we waited about 30 minutes before making the second call. We also had to call down to get a key for the mini-bar... ours was missing. After spending the afternoon in Boston, the shuttle picked us up at the train station (very timely here) and the adults in our party decided to go down to the lounge for a drink. I wanted to order a take out salad for one of my children, but it was against hotel policy, so we were stuck ordering room service instead. Room service was fairly quick. We ordered the fruit plate (the fruit was very good), but the cup of yogurt had a huge hole poked through the top of it, and it looked like someone had already eaten out of it! We called about that, and they brought rasberry sorbet instead. Most of these issues are small, I agree, but when given the choice of staying at a 3 or 4 star hotel, in my mind, these things are what seperate the two. Overall, nice place, a bit pricey, but not in-step with other 4-stars I have stayed at in the past.

<Content>The best at Boston Logan We stayed at the Boston Logan Hilton earlier this month (June) prior to flying back to the west coast. In a nutshell, this Hilton-franchised property may be on the spendy side, but on balance it's worth the price paid.This Hilton has recently undergone a change in ownership, and as a result the hotel has undergone some cosmetic improvements including new bedding, new carpeting in the rooms and common areas, and new tile and fixtures in the bath. The result is that the hotel is in almost new shape and is exceptionally clean and well-maintained. Our room was on the 10th (highest) floor; rooms at the ends of the hallways are quite a walk from the centrally located elevators. This Hilton does have a lounge on the 10th floor. HVAC worked well, bedding was exceptionally comfortable, and linens and towels were spotlessly clean. The hotel recently equipped its rooms with large, LCD flat-panel hi-definition televisions with digital sound. The hotel has the best location at Boston Logan and two recently-opened sky bridges connect the hotel directly to the International Terminal and to Delta Airline's new terminal. We have stayed at this property a number of times over the past few years, both on business trips and vacations. When on business we actually prefer staying at this Hilton property, either using a cab or the nearby water taxi to get into the downtown core. We were pleased to find a number of bell and front desk staff still at the hotel since our last visit in October. The staff is generally very, very helpful and eager to please. As an example, my wife and I had a number of perishable items that had to be kept cooled/frozen. Aside from a mini-bar, the rooms do not have mini-fridges. to our amazement, within five minutes of calling the guest services line, a mini-fridge was delivered and set up in our room at no charge. Additional added-value touches include that the hotel's shuttle van will deliver you to or pick you up from any of the nearby car rental centers, again at no cost. This level of service is extraordinary in our view.Others have mentioned here that the hotel imposes many charges on guests. It's true that parking can run $35 per night and that internet access runs about $10 a day. Food - especially room service - is similarly very expensive. We didn't havea car to park, we used the business center internet-equipped computers that can be rented on an hourly basis, and frankly the food we ordered was delicious (especially the clam chowder!!).Our stay at the Boston Logan Hilton was great from the painless and rapid check-in to the ease of checking out and the helpfulness of the shuttle driver. We highly recommend the Hilton Boston Logan.

<Content>Fantastic, far beyond expectations Wow! We got a room here via Priceline for about $100 and were blown away by the quality of accommodations here, from the bellhop to the restaurant to the room itself. Spacious, sparkling clean room and bathroom, nice Crabtree  Evelyn products, comfy bed, HD television in the room. Although there was construction going on in one of the hotel restaurants, we were quickly seated in the other one and received great service and surprisingly good food. This is a great value and I would even consider staying there during a regular Boston visit (not just to catch an early flight!)

<Content>Great Hotel This is a great hotel. I got stuck in Boston due to a flight cancel and picked this hotel because it is at the airport. I didn't care if it was nice or not, but I was pleasantly surprised. Here are the pros/cons:Pros:1. Everything about this place is nice and new! It has a beautiful, huge lobby and at the end of the hallway on each floor are two chairs/table that you can sit and look out into the Boston Harbor - very nice.2. The furnishings and decor in the rooms are top-notch. There is even a huge LCD HDTV in the room - and you get HD programming.3. If you want to be by the airport, you're there! There is a shuttle that can take you from the airport to your terminal, which is what I did. I think you can walk from the hotel to the airport, but the agent told me to take the shuttle and it was very convenient/quick.4. Since my flight was cancelled and I had a rental car, I had no way to get to the hotel from the rental car place. I called the hotel and they picked me up in 5 mins!5. The food/service in the restaurant was great and not over-priced.Cons:1. Half the channels on the huge LCD HDTV I mentioned above didn't work.2. The sound insulation in the rooms is not good - I could hear people coughing in the room next door and could hear people in the hallway outside my room very clearly.3. Again, the location is great if you want to be by the airport, which I did. If you want to walk the freedom trail, go to a game at fenway or eat in the North End, you are not in the city and you won't be able to walk to them. It's a short cab ride, but it's not like you're staying in the heart of the city.Overall, this is a very, very nice hotel and I think I'll stay there the next time I go to Boston.

<Content>Decent on Airport Hotel Decent hotel, with good comfortable beds and very quiet bearing in mind it is right by the airport.It quite a walk from the terminal - involves going up and down floors.Food prices in the bar are pretty poor value for money.Service from staff excellent.Starbucks in the lobby in the morning.Couldn't rate the leisure facilities as they were shut.

<Content>Great Hotel Stayed at the Hilton Boston Logan Aiport in Mid-May, 2007. The property is centrally located to the airport (shuttle took 5-minutes to gate) and to the downtown/financial districts. The property is well appointed, staff was extremely friendly, and my room was exceptionally clean and modern. I would recommend room 774 - it provides an EXCELLENT view of the Boston skyline and harbor.I did have two meals in the hotel's restaurant/pub. Again, staff was exceptional and the food was above average for hotel food. I will have to admit, their claim chowder is some of the best I have had.If there is a downside to the hotel, it would be the cost of parking -it will cost you $26.00/day to park your vehicle!! Nevertheless, if your travels take you to Boston, I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel.

<Content>Maybe the Best Hilton Ever I stay at hotels in Hilton family hotels about 40 times each year throughout the country. I am almost never dissappointed with the service that I receive. Having extensive experience with the Hilton chain, I must report that I think the Boston Logan Airport Hilton might be one of the best.I stay there frequently when I'm catching an early morning flight, I live two hours away from Boston. I am always impressed with the service and the facility. It isn't an inexpensive place to stay but then there are no inexpensive hotels in Boston.Most recently, I stayed at this Hilton and then caught a flight to Anchorage where I stayed in the Hilton there. It was just a reminder of how much I like the Hilton Logan Airport in Boston.

<Content>Another decent stay! I'd stayed here before, back in July but had another early flight out of Boston and following my previous stay it was an easy choice for me!We walked from Terminal B through Terminal A and over the bridge. We had a couple of suitcases and had no problems but for most I'm sure just dealing with the shuttle would be preferable. Checking in was easy and as a Hilton HHonors Gold I was given a nice room on the corner of the hotel looking over the city. The only problem is being the hotel is quite spread out and the ends of the hotel are a good couple of minutes walk from the elevators! You can't have everything though! After some confusion regarding access to the Executive Lounge we went to the room itself, nice and spacious, billed as a Deluxe Room it was quite a bit bigger than the room I'd previously had on the Executive Floor. The view was great too! Room had a flatscreen HDTV which made watching some late night TV a bit more pleasurable too.We spent the rest of the evening itself in the Executive Lounge (open to all HH Golds  Diamonds plus Exec Floor folks regardless of booking method). We'd just missed the evening hors d'oeuvres but watched a couple of shows with some drinks, enjoying the views of the city. The staff came over to have a word with my wife and I and were very friendly, informing us of the weather tomorrow, inviting us to check-in for our flight using the computers etc etc. For those of you contemplating paying for an Exec Floor room do it! This is one of the best Exec Lounges in any Hilton I've come across. In terms of facilities it is comparable to a half decent airline lounge.We slept very well, as I do with all Hilton beds and breakfast the following morning in the Exec Lounge was quitre sufficient to tie me over with an early bite to eat before getting breakfast on our flight. I'd say unless you aren't fussy about what you eat you'll struggle to get a decent breakfast on the top floor lounge and getting breakfast downstairs must be better. That said I've had early flights both times when staying here so can't comment on it.Overall still one of my favourite hotels in the Hilton Family and excellent for an airport hotel. The staff seem very friendly, the rooms are great and the facilities decent.

<Content>Fantastic remodel After a long trip from Jordan to Boston, via London, I was ready for a good nights sleep before heading to San Francisco the next day.  I arrived at Logan airport around 8pm, very tired. The Hilton is the closest hotel, located on the airport grounds. I located the hotel board near the exit and called to see if they had any rooms at the Hilton. Thankfully they did. A van was there to pick me up in 10 minutes. Check in was smooth and I was soon off to my room for a much needed rest and shower.When I entered my room, I thought I was placed on the executive floor. (I wasn't) My room had just been remodeled. It is the most modern hotel room I've stayed in, the furnishings, design, pictures, large flat screen HD TV, coffee maker, large king pillow top bed, even the trash container and ice bucket were modern stainless..... the soaps, etc in the bathroom were boutique, actually, the entire room felt as if I was in a boutique hotel, not the usual Hilton. The only problem was I had to leave early the next morning! I wanted to stay in this comfortable, beautiful room longer!

<Content>Noise insulation excellent from airport, not good from neighbours The hotel is very convenient for the airport but it is quicker to walk than to use the hotel shuttle. Bed was really comfortable and clean. Sound insulation from the airport is excellent but non-existent from next room: from the sound point of view there was no wall between the rooms. The price to pay for the sound insulation from the airport is that the windows do not open and the air conditioning in the room is quite crude: if it is on, the bed is in a draft.

<Content>Good Hotel That Could be Great Got into Beantown really late after some major delays on a flight outta Chicago. Man was I glad that I had booked a room at the Hilton and didn't have to drive that night.Pick-up was quick after I called. Waited all of maybe 5 minutes for the shuttle. Check in was fast. No rooms available on the executive level even though I'm a HH Gold.Room was great - looked brand new and the bed awesome after a very long day. I really appreciated the new LCD (or was it a plasma) TV. That was nice - just like being at home.That was the good.....What I didn't appreciate was the housekeeping staff knocking quite loudly on all of the doors adjacent to my room and announcing HOUSEKEEPING way too loud at 7:30 the next morning (5 hours after going to sleep). They were so loud that they woke me up - and they didn't even knock on my door. The icing on the cake was that one of the housekeepers decided to have a chat with one of the maintenance guys right outside my room. Wide awake and mad. I got up, showered and checked out. So much for sleeping in....I hope that the lady at checkout did speak with the manager about this. This is an easy problem to solve and once they get it solved, it will be an excellent hotel and not just above average.

<Content>No complaints here! From the second we pulled up to the second we left, this hotel did not disappoint. Exterior/Lobby: It has a very attractive and sleek exterior, and the lobby area was clean and welcoming. the bellhop/doorman greeted us when we arrived (tried to get us to pay for valet, but we kindly declined), at about 1am. we chose to self park and retired to our rooms. Rooms:we requested 2 adjoining rooms(there were 7 of us), each with 2 double beds, and thats exaclty what we got. the rooms were clean and cozy, and bathrooms were nice as well. I forgot to bring a toothbrush, so i called guest services, and one was brought up for me in a few minutes. being physically located AT the airport, one would be concerned with the noise, but that proved to not be an issue. the only noise was from the HVAC. the negatives included an HVAC system that needed to work better. it was hard keeping the room at a constant temp level, it would consistently go from too warm, to too cold, and could be a bit noisy. the rooms were a tad on the smaller side, but was not really a problem. we had a nice view of the airport from the room, and plenty of sunlight through the full floor to ceiling window. ammenities/services:shuttle service - after reading a couple reviews on how it was unreliable...i was a bit hesitant. but we used it to get to the T and at no time did we have to wait more than 5 min (either going to or coming back) for the shuttle to arrive. in fact, on 2 occasions (4 total trips), the shuttle was actually waiting for us. heck, we even used it after we checked out! =) pool/fitness center - the gym was very clean and had sufficient equipment. even each treadmill had individual monitors for you to watch as you worked out. we were offered lockers (for FREE), so we used it. towels were plentiful (i used 5 myself), for the pool and gym. the pool was nice, not too large or small. and the area was again, very clean. the hot tub was a TAD too hot, but not a big deal. locker rooms were nice and clean, and the showers were stocked with body wash and shampoo. Connely's pub - we grabbed some late nite appetizers and drinks at the hotel pub, and it was just great. i was very impressed with the wings and the prices were reasonable. service was fine and it had a great atmosphere.OK, the only REAL negative about this hotel, was the price for parking. we parked for 2 nites, 2 cars, it was $52 per car. $26/ nite to park, so we paid a total of $104 just for parking, which is a little over the top in my book. oh yea, and housekeeping did not empty out the ice bucket for us, and didnt restock the coffee supply. again, not a big deal.Overall - this place is almost perfect. from the rooms to service to the ammenities, all the bells and whistles, made this stay just wonderful. this was my first trip with a group of friends in a while, and this hotel made it a lot of fun for all of us. HIGHLY recommended!

<Author>Flying_Lawyer
<Content>An experience designed to suck your wallet dry My wife and I are Hilton Diamond HHonors members; we've stayed at this property both in its former life and as a purpose-built new Hilton. As it's right on the airport, the property has one huge advantage: location.Making our reservation was a snap on Hilton's website. Check-in was even easier as we checked in and received our room assignment on-line; from the time we walked through the front door to crossing the threshold of our room, not more than five minutes passed. Rooms - even rooms at the end of hallways/corner rooms are fairly small, more in line with what one would find in a newer European Hilton. Rooms are well furnished and our king bed had a wonderful duvet. On the negative side, the room HVAC air-flow is minimal and cooling the room took longer than expected.Our problem with this property is that aside from the fairly steep room rates, everything at this hotel is designed to extract additional fees and costs from guests. Let's start with overnight parking: US$30 (plus tips every time to arrive/depart). Want to have internet access? That will be at least US$10. You've paid the additional cost of upgrading to the Executive Floor so you will have access to the lounge. In Europe, breakfasts, snacks, and evening treats are all complimentary together with beer, wine, and all spirits. Free. No cost. Included in the cost of paying for a room on the Executive Floor. Oh, no. But not at this Hilton. My wife was billed for more than US$10 for a single (small) glass of a routine Merlot. I could go on and on, but by now you have the idea. I suppose it's all about yield-management and enhancing the bottom line, but frankly there is a limit on what we will tolerate by way of being nickle and dimed. So, before we commit to another stay here, we are going to evaluate our other nearby Hilton family option here at Boston Logan: the close-by Embassy Suites.If you choose to stay here, fine, it's a nice property. But watch your wallet.

<Content>Wish I could have stayed longer! My husband and I were impressed with this hotel - our flight arrived 3 hours late, and we hadn't eaten in hours. Therefore, we now know that the 2 AM room service was fast, accomodating and fresh. Bed was very comfortable, shower was nice, it was everything we ever wanted. We were driving up to Maine that afternoon, so we didn't get to stay long, but will definately stay here again next time into Logan.

<Content>Great place for a between-flight rest I stayed at the Hilton 2 nights this past month...once en route to Rome from Seattle and then again on the way back. Both rooms were comfortable, quiet and equipped with everything I wanted for a restful night. It was easy to get to the hotel via their shuttles, and the 5-minute distance to the terminals can't be beat. I spent some time in the health club and steam room...a nice bonus after a long trip...and had some mixed results from Room Service and Berkshires restaurants. All in all, a perfectly good place to rest before, after or between flights.

<Content>Liked it a lot Got this hotel for $100/night through Hotwire. Worth the $$ for the stay, but not if you pay full price. There is a shuttle that takes you from the hotel to the airport and to the T. The front desk service was slow, and I was disappointed that they did not have any aspirin when I asked for some. The room we stayed in Corner Deluxe King was WONDERFUL. Great view and TOTALLY quiet.

<Content>dirty room Great location if you are taking an early morning flight as we were. Of course it helps if you get your 5.30 wake up call which we did not. (we had a cell phone call as a back up).Main problem was how dirty the room was. It appeared to have been used by someone else to some extent. bits of food on the chair. note pad and pen used. Toilet seat up. In particular the floor was littered and it hadnt been vacuumed at all. This was the most expensive hotel on the trip and the only one which was dirty!

<Content>Great service - good hotel I stayed at the Boston Hilton Logan for a week to attend a conference. It's a great location for the conference center. The staff were great and a complimentry shuttle bus will drop/pick you up from the airport T stop (Blue and Silver line) and any airport terminal.The gym was ok - the pool a little small but the room was pleasant and clean. The choice of resturants was good - the option of a resturant or pub/sports bar. Don't be put off by it's location you can't hear any planes and we didn't even see any through out our stay. If you can't stay down town this is a great option for the conference centre.

<Content>Low water pressure, irregular water temperature My husband and I are well traveled, and stay in high-end hotels all over the U.S. and internationally. We usually choose Marriott because of the consistency of cleanliness and comfort. We needed to stay close to the airport, and the closest Marriott was in town. I read very positive reviews on TripAdvisor for this airport hotel, so we booked the Hilton @ $199/nite (regular room, 2 dbls) for 3 nites. Upon entering the room, which faced the Boston skyline and harbor, I did not find it to be a large room, but rather standard. This was probably due to 2 dbl beds in the room, which, by the way, were small for doubles. I was informed all rooms were the same size, unless you booked a suite. I did not find it to be very clean. I had to wipe down the light switches, as they were filthy with caked-on dirt and finger prints. Carpets were dirty, and furniture was dusty. Once cleaned, it would be ok, but the real bothersome part of our stay was the low water pressure in the shower and the very old showerhead. Also, the water would go from warm to cold to scalding hot. Terrible.

<Content>very convenient Reserved rooms for two visits through BOS May and June 2006.It was very convenient to the car rentals and the flights. Bar open late for real food.Staff very helpful. But the price was higher than the better Hyatt. The staff wanted me to use the rental car van to drop me at the hotel and the rental car van wanted the hotel van to pick me up. We were upgraded to use the club lounge for a quick breakfast at 6am. But there was a grey line of dust around the brown carpet.

<Content>Almost Pleasant Experience Stayed 5/26-5/28, Memorial Day Weekend. I was attending a game at Fenway and venturing in to the city. Choose airport for cheaper rate. The Good:-Comfy bed and linens-Well apportioned, spacious rooms-Shuttle Service-prompt and friendly drivers. I never waited more than 10 minutes for a ride-Cheap Price-Used Priceline for 65/night-Computer and printer free for use in Executive Lounge and Lobby to check e-mail and print boarding pass. -Able to check in early (1:00) and out late (4:00) for no additional charge-Quiet Room, not a peep heard from outside or other guestThe Bad:-Horrible water pressure-Problem with Toilet, stopped up several times-Restaurant service very slow-I left a sheet protector with my travel information and fenway tickets either at front desk or bell captain station. When I realized after nap and called down 2 hrs later the front desk said they did not have. I went down to the front desk and was informed she never checked in the back, they had a prom and were busy. No luck. At Bell Captain station the gentlemen informed me they would have thrown something like that away. Thrown something away that had my name all over?!? I was able to reprint Fenway tickets using computer however I was upset at the lack of concern that my travel information was missing.

<Content>Great Hotel Although I had never stayed at an airport hotel previously I did so on the basis of reports on TripAdvisor.I was not disappointed.It really is a very nice hotel and the staff were extremely helpful.I stayed for 4 nights and it has certainly changed my view about airport hotels.On the day I checked out my flight was not until 8pm in the evening and after a busy day sightseeing I asked if I could use the facilities in the hotel spa to freshen up. There was no difficulty at all and the staff were very accommodating. I asked for a room with a view of Boston and was given one without any difficulty.The room was well appointed and the bed was very comfortable.I made use of the pc in the hotel lobby to surf the net which was for a small nominal charge.The only problem being there is only one pc so you have to wait sometimes. The shuttle service to the 'T' station is excellent.I would highly recommend this hotel

<Content>Beautiful hotel! I stayed at the Hilton at Logan Airport while on a business trip with a colleague. We walked to the hotel from the airport in terminal C, which was not as easy to walk as Terminal A is, but was a pleasant walk nonetheless. The skyways all have moving walkways, which makes the trip a lot quicker than it might otherwise seem. We were able to check into our rooms at 10:30 in the morning and then took the hotel shuttle (which runs every 10-15 minutes) to the Silver Line stop to go downtown. It took us about 30 minutes to get from the hotel to downtown and only cost $1.25 each, which was great! The rooms were wonderful and the beds were incredibly comfortable. It was obviously not in the most scenic part of Boston, so if I were traveling for pleasure and sightseeing, I might not stay there, but it really was a great hotel, and I would definitely stay there again!

<Content>Wonderful Hilton Hotel! This Hilton was probably one of the nicest Hilton properties that I've stayed in. The hotel is very well kept and has a comfortable and upscale feeling to it. The lobby area is very spacious and everything is close by. I walked to the hotel from the A terminal and it was very easy to get to. I arrived earlier in the day however they had a room available to check in to. The room was very spacious and had all the necessary amenities. There was a work desk, two chairs, king size bed, coffee maker, and good bathroom amenities. The bed was extremely comfortable, as it is there new serenity bed. The view was of the airport, but they also have rooms facing downtown. The healthclub was small, yet it was a nice touch. The pool was nice, and they also had a hot tub and seperate locker rooms with steam rooms and a sauna. I had a drink at the pub which was a nice place to go relax for a little. I would highly recommend this place to anyone needing to stay near the airport. It would also be good place for tourists, as getting to public transportation is very easy, via the hilton shuttle or walking to the terminals.

<Content>Good for an Early AM Flight My girlfriend and I recently stayed here before an early morning flight to Florida. Check-in was easy and the lady was nice, but not very personable. We requested a room on a high floor and given one of the 8th floor with a GREAT view of the city and the harbor. I read one comment on the view, if you request a room between _60-_80 the views are AWESOME! I was impressed with the room and the bed was comfortable. The only thing I didnt like is the lack of vending machines on the floors. $3 for a Coke, No Thanks.We ate dinner at the Irish Pub and the service was HORRIBLE!!!! There were no signs that said you needed to seat yourself and we were eventually told by some guests to seat ourselves. We only ordered sandwiches and we were there for over an hour. A severe lack of help.Check-out and Shuttle staff was great, especially for 5AM!Overall, if flying out, I would stay here again. The service is much better than the Hyatt Harborside and more reliable shuttle service.HINT: If parking your car, park in Economy Lot and take the shuttle to Terminal A and take the skybridge to the hotel.

<Content>Great one night stay Stayed here with my son for one last night in Boston. Used priceline trying to get the hyatt harborside, but got this instead. All in all, nice stay. Self parking was nice and close and slightly cheaper than valet parking ($26 vs $30) for a 24 hour stay (plus I saved on the tip!). We had a great view of the Boston skyline. We were in the right wing of the hotel (as you look at the hotel from the outside) which faces the skyline instead of the airport. Just opened up the curtains and enjoyed the view as I lay down to sleep...best part of the stay. The pool was nice, with maybe a bit too much chlorine.Staff was friendly, although our interaction was limited. Using the T from this hotel was very easy. I would definately recommend, especially if coming/going from Boston Logan.

<Content>Great hotel for an overnight stay I stayed here for the night before an early morning flight. The beds were very comfortable, bathroom clean with granite counters. Shuttle service ran very early in the morning and the shuttle bus drivers very helpful (even helping me find a place that sold live lobsters late at night)

<Content>Excellent Choice We stayed at the Airport Hilton one night to avoid late night driving in an unfamiliar territory. It was an excellent choice and a very nice stay. The room was good size, the furnishing attractive and comfortable, the service was excellent and most important, the hotel was quiet even with the busy airport traffic. Recommend using the hotel shuttle from the airport as it is only a 5-10 minute wait. The only negative was outdoor parking but, since we didn't have a car yet, it didn't bother us. Many airport hotels can be recommended only because of their location. This is an exception.

<Content>TravelAgent Review Well, my flight got cancelled on Monday so company checked us into the Hilton for only 1 night. This hotel (although an airport hotel) was FABULOUS, the amenities included (serenity bed, steamroom, sauna, lappool) were all fabulous. The resteraunts within the hotel were VERY good for an airport hotels food. The manager was excellent and very much cared about his job and choosen careerpath. I traveled with a group of travel agents and we all agreed this was the best airport hotel we have ever stayed. Check it out, for even more than 1 night you will NOT be dissapointed.

<Content>Nice view of Boston This hotel is in a great location. It is not downtown but you can walk to all airport terminals via covered bridges and from there take a free shuttle bus to the Boston subway station and be downtown in minutes. Rooms that face Boston have a great view of the city skyline, harbour and surrounding areas. The pool was a small but well staffed. The hotel bar was average. Justin Magro, Halifax, Nova Scotia.

<Content>Our first trip to Boston My husband and I stayed at the hotel while attending an IT Conference at the Hynes Convention Center. Boy where we surprised when we found out there were TWO convention centers in Boston and unlike the online listing, shuttle service was NOT provided to this particular convention center. Even though this was one of the benefits that they emphasized to our companies. The hotel seemed overly booked with not enough staff to service customers at the front desk, or the 'pub'. Sometimes finding a clean table took upwards of 30-40 minutes and food took as long or longer to receive. The room was fairly spacious, although typical fare and had a wonderful view of the parking lot and the airport (yes, if you cranned your neck just enough you could see a little bit of the harbor). The most disappointing thing about the room to us was that there was no inroom safe and the safe's offered at the front desk weren't large enough to accomodate a laptop. Rather unusual for a 'business' hotel, wouldn't you say? Also, even though we stayed for a week and asked repeatedly if/when the shuttle went into south Boston, it wasn't until we were leaving that the doorman finally told us they go into Fanneuil Hall every evening for one drop off and one pickup. Would have been nice to know so that we didn't always have to take the 'T' and walk all the way back to our hotel. However, several of the personnel were very nice and gracious. Construction was also a nuisance. Room cleanliness depended on the cleaning staff of the day, with Wednesday's cleaning being the best (5 stars for that day!). Water was also at a premium and made a very loud whiney/gurgley noise when running...not just our room but several others as well as we kept getting woken at weird times when people were showering or bathing. If you expect just the basics you won't be disappointed, but if you expect something a lot nicer you should look somewhere else. Just remember you get what you pay for.

<Content>great for an airport hotel, convinient for the flight check in. Door staff and parking attendant extremenly helpful and freindly, and gave a good first impression. Rooms very clean and comfortable, with no airport noise. Airport check-in was within walking distance via a corridor link, but no trolleys provided, so this was a chore, and would expect better of this class of hotel. Bar food was ok, but maybe could have been better, as could have been the gym, with sauna / steam rooms not working properly. Pool was relaxing, with good jacuzzi, but you had to trudge through the gym in your swim gear to reach it. Overall, convenient if you are leaving the airport at an early hour, otherwise stay in Boston itself.

<Content>No Problems, Nice Hotel I too am surprised by the number of bad reviews for this hotel. My husband and I stayed at the Boston Logan Airport Hilton during the last weekend of October, 2005, and had a lovely time. Our purpose in Boston was recreational -- it was Parent's Weekend at our son's college.First off, since it was a weekend, we received a terrific rate from the hilton website. We prepaid our entire visit to receive the special rate. I have a Hilton Honors card, so I believe we received a bit of an upgrade. We had a very large, clean, king room with a wonderful view of both the airport and the harbor (upper-level floor).The staff was courteous and accomodating. We enjoyed one dinner in the pub (okay) and one breakfast at the restaurant buffet (very good).The health club was very nice and the pool area was fine. I always have a problem with hotel pools being too cold, but this one was actually comfortable. There was a problem with some locals having a party in the pool area (many unsupervised children and intoxicated adults), but management solved the problem when it was brought to their attention. Aside from that small issue, my husband was able to book a last minute massage and was very happy about that.We loved the location...our son lives just north of Boston and we were able to use a combination of the hotel shuttle and public transportation to get where we needed to be. In 1 1/2 years we've become fairly familiar with the Boston T system -- it's probably one of the most accessible public transportation systems in the US. This is the only airport hotel connected to the Logan terminals. The shuttle drivers are wonderful. We were able to hitch a ride with them into Boston Saturday night, instead of using the T. We had planned to use the T, so this was a nice treat.

<Content>Expensive, but nice First of all, this hotel has mostly non-refundable rates, so, not wanting to waste money, we stayed here. I stayed here with my wife. We came up from Sarasota, FL and we were continuing on to montreal. This was a last second trip so, to get a good deal, we chose a flight with a overnight stop. We spent one night here and payed 300.00 For 300 dollars for 1 night I'd expect almost the Ritz. I was, however, a typical Hilton. Staff was nice. Good restaurants. And, most important, nice rooms. We got one king bed in a standard room. We got a view of the airport which really didn't matter to us. Room was clean and plenty of space. I would definently say this hotel is made for buisness travelers. There had to be at least 10 good sized confernece centers. Big work out facility and pool. And for us, extremely convenient to the airport. We were in terminal A so we could walk there. Walkway for terminal E as well. If in terminal B-D, there is a bus. I would not stay here again for so much money. At max, this hotel should be 250.00 a night. Hotel istelf: Great Value  Price: A bit below average

<Content>Positive all around I was surprised to see so many negative reviews of this hotel. We stayed here unexpectedly (on Oct 30/05) after our flight was cancelled and found it excellent.The hotel opened in 1999 but looks like it was yesterday. The lobby is large and bright. Front desk staff were competent and checked us in quickly. When I didn't have a room service menu in our room, they sent one up immediately. The room (a standard king) was exceptionally large, nicely decorated in reds and taupe, with desk and chair, fridge and two padded armchairs. The bedlinens were of high quality. Everything looked brand new. Bathroom is equally large with a granite counter. My only complaint was the toilet is beside the tub, which is annoying because there is no where to put your clothes when you get out of the shower. The towels were small and thin. Nice Crabtree and Eveyln soaps and shampoos.I made a one-minute long distance call to my home in Toronto which they charged me $13.00 - did not appreciate the obvious gouging.One point worth mentioning is that we were on the shuttle bus to the airport with an Air Canada crew and they commented on how this hotel has the best shuttle service of any Boston airport hotel - fast and frequent.I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Bring your cleaning supplies! After arriving on a long cross country flight, I did not expect to find a dirty bathroom and have my room service order be incorrect. All this for $310.The lobby was beautiful, clean...that's about it. My bathroom had spit in the sink and a bowel movement left in the unflushed, obviously uncleaned toilet. I complained to the front desk but no one came. I ordered a pizza from room service. The order was incorrect, correct pizza came 20 minutes later and was told the whole order would be complimentary. I was exhausted at 2:00 a.m. after flying all day, and just went to get to bed so I ate my pizze, flushed the toilet and rinsed out the sink myself.Upon checkout, I mentioned the dirty bathroom. The front desk clerk jotted something down, but did not apologize or even look up. When I mention the room service on the bill, no effort was made to comp the order. How dissapointing for $275 a night. I will definately think again about staying at any Hilton. Yuk.

<Content>Want a harbor view? Stay at the Hyatt We had a long day of travelling from the westcoast and were eager to essentially step off the aircraft and into the suite. After claiming our baggage, we wandered aimlessly in the parkade looking for the hotel entrance...I recommend simply take the shuttle and avoid the confusion of milling around the parkade looking like we forgot where we parked the car. Check-in was fast, but I was a bit puzzled as to why the desk clerk smirked as he read our file (I advised in advance that we may be an early check-in and also requested an airside view of the runway, though harbor would have been a great option...perhaps this is considered high maintenance?). Our airside view overlooked the gastly parkade and off in the distance is a partial view of the airport...hardly the airside view I envisioned. Our room was standard hotel fare; something easily forgettable. Staying the Hilton also meant dealing with Aer Lingus grumpy passengers, whose flight was cancelled. The pub was understaffed, the food in both restaurants was not overly nutricious, the gym was OK, but staff had the I wish I was elsewhere expression on their face(the treadmills look into the parking lot...hard to view for an hour). On positive notes, the door people were excellent, informed and efficient, the shuttle to the T made for a great but brief visit to Boston and the shuttle apperantly had greater frequency than the Hyatt. Hyatt clearly has the better view of the harbor...forget airside view at both of these hotels and go for the harborview. I suspect we wouldn't stay here again.

<Content>Beware of the Staff! We booked to stay one night here as we had an early flight out in the morning and needed to be close to the airport. The rooms and facilities were the usual Hilton standard and it is really only the staff that let this hotel down. The Reception staff did not bother to offer any greeting and were monosyllabic throughout our transaction. We were advised that the room only had a shower and when I asked politely whether there were any other rooms available, I was told that we had to take what was offered because we had booked a 'cut price' rate through a 3rd party (surely everyone does that these days?!). It felt like we were labelled second class citizens for being sensible! We were not provided with directions to the elevator or to our room and when we asked about luggage assistance she simply rang a bell and waved her hand to dismiss us - no one came to assist. The room was clean and well fitted as always, but the promised shower was extremely weak and ineffectual and the bathroom floor was basically dirty. We tried to use the offered by-phone check out service, but although my first try was answered I was then dumped on hold for five minutes and eventually hung up and tried again following which there was no answer. We then picked up the bill and went to the front desk where again the reception was monosyllabic and extremely unhelpful - in the end I asked if there was anything else needed as we were trying to catch the waiting shuttle to the airport and I have to say we walked away. A direct complaint will be made!

<Content>Not the Hilton we're accustomed to... My husband and I stayed at the Hilton-BOS for one night before flying to Oregon. We always stay at the Hilton Executive Towers in Portland, OR and have always had AMAZING service, etc. Much to our dissappointment, we had a much difference experience here.Upon checking in the front desk clerk was very unpleasant and didn't bother to ask if we needed help with our bags, or even bother to point us towards the elevator nor did she wish us a pleasant stay. We felt this was rude seeing as how she asked the 'business' looking man who checked in before us if he needed help with his bags and wished him a pleasant stay....hmmm...we got a great rate on priceline ($60!!!) but this doesn't excuse the attitude!Upon arriving in our room mini bar key in hand we were eager to raid it seeing as how we had just traveled four hours (2hrs by boat, 2hrs driving) from Nantucket. No such luck, the mini bar was empty! We called guest services and they explained that the fourth floor is where flight crews generally stay so they don't stock the mini bars there. Funny, you would think the front desk clerk would be aware of that and not have given us the key or even perhaps asked if that was acceptable!? From there things went from bad to worse. When calling guest services you have a 50-50 chance of getting someone who has even a remote interest in your needs. Later my husband went down to get take-out menus from the bell boy who didn't bother to say a word to him but rather threw the menus on the desk and continued socializing with his co-workers! Now here's where things get interesting....on his way back up to our room in the elevator a man asked him if he knew of any prostitutes around or would like to go find some!!! Ok, my husband is a quiet, polite man and was dressed in a polo and slacks!!! Needless to say we stayed in our room and prayed that we could complete our stay without having to see, contact, or deal with the lousy attitude of the staff again! The one and ONLY advantage I can see to staying here is that you don't have to wait for a shuttle to arrive (BTW, the Hilton shuttle is ALWAYS very crowded) and can take the sky bridge which connects to the airport very easily and it even has moving walkways! A great walk to get those restless legs moving after getting off a long flight but not a short trek for anyone unable to walk a distance or someone with a ton of baggage (young kids included!). I wouldn't recommend staying here, check out the Hyatt Harborside which has good service, free shuttle, nice rooms, and a beautiful view of the harbor and you can also watch the planes approach the runways and not hear a thing!!! There is also a really lovely paved walking path along the water that is great for evening walks as the sun sets!!!!

<Content>Perfect place to transition in/out of Boston We stayed at the Logan Hilton the night before returning to Denver from a week in Nantucket and couldn't have been happier. Used the self-service kiosk to check into room (convenient and easy), had a great meal in the pub, checked in and printed our boarding pass from the convenient computer in the hotel lobby and enjoyed a restful evening in a quiet, clean and comfortable room. The next morning, we could sleep in knowing we were only a short walk to our gate. There is not a better place to stay in Boston if you have a late arrival or early departure at Logan. We will definitely be back.

<Content>the way a hotel should be Picked up at the airport by the hotel shuttle near the baggage claim area in the evening. Alternately, the hotel is attached by skybridge to Terminal E - other terminals require a short walk.Lobby sits in the rear of a spacious atrium - check-in went smoothly. There is 24 hour room service and two restaurants in the lobby area that cover most of the daytime hours. The breakfast restaurant gives you the option of buffet-style or order-from-menu. Food is good and plentiful.The health club is spacious and contains workout appartus, locker rooms, television sets, a indoor heated lap pool (about 15 yards long) and a large jacuzzi. Service in the bedrooms is prompt and excellent. There is a coffee maker and a newspaper is delivered to your room each weekday morning. On weekends you can go to the gift shop in the lobby (after 7am) to buy a newspaper. The hotel shuttle will take you to the local subway (Airport) station - called the 'T' in Boston. For $18 you get a three day pass good on all city transport services. If you don't mind walking you can take the skybridge to Terminal E - go down to the surface level and catch an airport bus to the 'T'. The buses run all day and are free.

<Content>What a lovely place! I stayed here overnight because my flight was arriving at midnight and I have a 2+ hour drive home from Logan. I got the room through Priceline for $69 and was still treated with full respect by everyone. Check-in and check-out were very efficient. The room was gorgeous and cozy. I haven't slept that deeply in a long time. It's an easy walk to Terminal A (Delta), but I'd recommend using their courtesy shuttle to/from the other terminals. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat.

<Content>Impersonal but convenient Stayed in August 2005 before early morning flight to London. Disliked over-attentive valet system and impersonal large hotel ambience but this hotel most convienient of the airport hotels as, in addition to normal shuttle bus, you can walk via a footbridge to the terminals. We collected an airport trolley which we took to our room and then pushed directly to check-in desk. Unless you are parked at the airport, trolleys are not easy to find and we were envied by others as we pushed all our luggage along in the inevitable check-in queue shuffle. Checked out via room television inter-active service so by-passed hotel reception area altogether and left by 2nd floor footbridge. Got good hotel rate by booking with expedia.

<Content>an oasis for a weary traveller returning home After a busy two week family vacation in Maine sleeping in camp beds, tents and the like, my husband and I had an early morning flight out of Logan and decided to spend the night before at the airport. We were very pleaseantly surprised! We were ready for some pampering and felt the Logan Hilton to be a definite cut above our expectation for airport hotels. Our room was average size but well-appointed with a heavenly bed and linens. We found the spa/fitness center to be clean, very well equipped with a nice pool and whirlpool to relax in. The staff was friendly, responsive and courteous- we were not on the executive level but they brought us very comfy robes to lounge in at our request. After returning from the spa we ordered room service and a movie- the food was excellent (I had the scrod which was really delightful and my husband had the chicken florentine). All at very reasonable prices. I would do this again!

<Content>Restaurant staff let it down! Just come back from a trip to New England, after travelling around for 2 weeks we thought we would give our children a treat by staying at the Hilton Logan airport before flying home, most of the hotel is okay but it lets it's self down in it's catering departments the staff at breakfast made it clear that as we were on a bed and breakfast deal we were only entitled to the buffet which was average at best and so the staff were inattentive we had to clear our dishes ourselves I think they were only interested in the business customers as they probably tip better! It's a shame as our children were really excited about it.Also the coffee shop closes at lunch time so you could not get a hot drink unless you made it in your room.On the possitive side the spa staff were great with the kids and the shuttle bus to the T was hassle free.

<Content>Very nice hotel and exceptional for an 'airport' hotel Since our weekend trip to Boston involved an arrival late in the evening and an early morning departure, we opted for the Hilton Boston Logan Airport on our two-night weekend stay. In addition to being a very nice hotel, there was a substantial savings, compared to staying right in the city. This is a fair trade-off for the need to take a taxi, water taxi (you can figure about $20 for two people on either of those two option as a ballpark estimate) -- or the T into town. A nice feature of the hotel is that in addition to the hotel's courtesy shuttle, visitors have the option of walking over on a skybridge that connects the Hilton to the terminal (we flew on Northwest, using Terminal E, but there are connections to other terminals, too.) The hotel itself is impressively appointed, with a large lobby, well-maintained common areas, a pub that serves a decent menu (including room service). There is also a more formal full-service restaurant on the property. The 10th floor executive level has a nice lounge area with long hours (5:30 a.m. until 11 p.m. on weekdays). In addition to the usual morning continental breakfast items and before dinner snacks, we made use of a single computer that is available for the complimentary use of lounge guests, (though it obviously gets plenty of activity and it is a first-come, first-served type of thing.) There is a first floor fitness center with a good selection of weights and equipment, as well as a swimming pool and hot tub. All are kept in great condition and the hotel itself is immaculate. There were no traffic jams at the elevators during our stay at any time. We never heard an aircraft during our stay, so the building is obviously well sound-proofed.Size-wise, we would put the guest rooms on the average to even slightly smaller than average size, but they are well-furnished and maintained. Beds get well above average marks from us for comfort. Towels were plush and robes were provided on the executive level, too. The bathroom was plenty roomy enough and immaculate. Overall, we have no problem giving the Hilton Logan Airport an excellent rating and we highly recommend it for those situations where an airport hotel makes sense.

<Content>Sleeping on a clould My wife and I always talked about going to Boston for a fresh lobster dinner. So this June we made it happen. We wanted to stay close to the airport so we chose the Hilton at the airport. What a great choice. It had to be one of the cleanest hotel we ever stayed in, and the bed was so elegant and unbelievable. We arrived early so we could go to Quincy Market fot the day. We came back after dinner to shower and relax before we would go out for some late night cocktails. Well we laid on the bed to watch television to unwind from the day of shopping. We both fell asleep in a very short time, and needless to say never made the latenight cocktails. We did get a great night sleep and felt very refreshed for the next morning.

<Content>Highly Enjoyable Stay at This Hilton Our first trip to Boston was made even better with our stay at the Hilton Boston Logan Airport. The hotel is not only very beautiful but the employees were friendly, helpful and made us feel very comfortable during our stay. The rooms were very nicely decorated with extra pillows on the bed and an oversheet on the blankets. The mattress had a comfy cover and we slept like babies. We visited the hotel gym/pool and spa and were very impressed. The indoor pool had large windows and skylights and was extremely clean. The jacuzzi was also large and very clean. The equipment in the gym was top of the line, varied and nicely laid out with televison viewing. Massage was available. The locker room was equal to that of a memebership gym. They had a steam room and showers and attendants checking it often. We ate at Connollys Pub and had great food and drinks at a reasonable price. You can even take a catwalk from the hotel to the airport for convenience or use their shuttle. The walk for us was a little far considering where our airline was located. We would definately return and plan to do so in the next week.

<Content>beautiful, but.... We stayed here before flying back home on an early morning flight, and I chose it like most others, for convenience. It is a beautiful hotel, we never heard a single plane, and our dinner was very good. We were, however, given a handicap room upon check-in, which we Ok'd. If you are given this option, don't take it! The shower flooded the bathroom unless you shored it up with towels. When we called maintenance, they implied that it does it all the time due to flaws in design. They didn't mind bringing us the half dozen towels we requested, though! Other than that, we were very pleased with our stay.

<Content>Most comfortable beds ever We just stayed at the Hilton airport hotel in Boston on June 26 for 1 night before our early morning flight home. My husband, myself and our children were very comfortable at this hotel. We got a great rate through their website but didn't expect much since it was an airport hotel. We stayed here for the convenience of being able to walk to the airport in the morning without a shuttle, etc. Well, I heard on Tripadvisor that they had comfortable beds at this hotel. They were the most comfortable beds I've ever slept on. Check in was a breeze with their ATM style check in machine. Our room was ready when we got there and room service was fantastic. Great pool and exercise facility. Wonderful toiletries!! We never heard an airplane the entire stay! I never would have guessed we were in the airport! The rooms were a bit small, but as I said before, the location and convenience and did I mention the comfortable BEDS make this a must stay for a late night/early morning flight into Boston, MA!

<Content>Easy, easy, easy access Beautiful hotel, very comfortable beds, easy airport access, easy T access, free gym pool and spa. Frequent shuttles to the T and Quincy Market is the second stop. If you're not right downtown, this is as good as it gets. Only issue is the T closes midnight (or is it 1:00), so if you want to go drinking, you'll have to take a cab back. I was in town for a conference at a rate of $156 a night - got the same room on a very well advertised discount website for $100 a night (weekend). Enjoy!

<Content>Too tired to overlook... many little mishaps: self check-in was down. The front desk person checked me in forgetting to give me the key card. I asked for quiet location and was given a room right by the elavator. Found hair in the bathtub.. The flush in the toilet was broken; however, the maintenance person fixed it very promptly late in the evening. I found a completed guest survey of the previous guest in the room with her name, address, telephone, etc... Also, I tried to use computer in the lobby to check email. It was very slow and nonresponsive. The front desk person was not helpful at all. And I was charged on the room for using it without actually being able to get into my email and have to complain twice to have this charge removed. Breakfast was pretty average but here is the funny thing: I was on my way from Europe and had all those wonderful breads and pastries in my memory. I grabbed one best looking from the breakfast buffet... it was a fake one! I had to settle for a lame collosal bagel which didn't fit in the toaster...

<Content>Pathetic Hotel I used to stay here for my business visits. The treatment went from good, worse to worst. Started getting handicap room, smoking room with double bed et al when I clearly booked for King non-smoking. They overbook the hotel  give rooms of their choice. Customer service at front desk is Zero. Dont plan on staying longer or frequently. Its a OK hotel for just one nights stay. Also, I am not white, felt that I was discriminated.

<Content>Will definitely stay again! I stayed at the Hilton Boston Logan Hotel over Memorial Day Weekend and had a wonderful experience. Finding the hotel was a little difficult at first but that was mostly my fault because I didn't bother to read the directions on Hilton's website. It's a quick walk across the SkyBridge at Terminal E, or if you have a lot of luggage, you can always take the Hilton Shuttle. Check-in was quick and easy and my room was pleasant. Getting to and from the city for sightseeing was a breeze also. You simply take the Hilton Shuttle to the Airport T (subway) stop and you're on your way. To get back to the hotel from the T you can either wait for the Hilton shuttle (every 15 minutes), call Hilton and tell them you need pick up service, or you can take one of the Logan Airport shuttles to Terminal E and walk across the SkyBridge. All in all, if you're looking for a nice, convenient hotel with easy access to the airport for your return flight, I highly recommend the Hilton Boston Logan Airport.

<Content>Traumatic experience I attended the Boston gift Show and stayed at the Hilton from March 31 to april 5, 2005. It was one of my worst night mares when someone actually unlocked my door at 10:20 p.m. on the night of Saturday 2nd. It took 48 hours to get a response and to date no one has called me to report what actually happened that night. I checkjed out on April 5 and then again nothing was said to me. I am not amused after the trauma I went through that night. Luckily the security latch was on the door and the intruder could not enter.

<Content>Very nice airport hotel Stayed at the Hilton at Logan Aiport on 3/21/05 since we had an early morning flight. We arrived at 10:30pm, check-in was quick and easy and the room was beautiful. I've stayed at a couple Hiltons, and historically I have not been impressed. But this Hilton was very nice. Everything in the room was new, clean, and upscale. Also, I was pelased that it was quiet. I didn't hear any noise from the airport, and only minimal noise from the room below us (which had a young infant). The restaurant was still open when we arrived and the staff was friendly. I am definitely planning on staying there again the next time I need to fly out of Logan early in the morning.

<Content>Disappointing Second Stay My boyfriend and I had stayed at this hotel previously, since it's convenient to stay over when catching an early flight, or crashing there after a dismal flight finally gets in. I had reserved a room with a king-size bed, non-smoking. It was a guaranteed late-arrival, but when we arrived at 1:00A.M. after a LONG flight from Vegas, the reservationist had evidently given our room away. We were sent to a room that REEKED of cigarette smoke and contained two twin beds masquerading as double beds. *Note to Hilton management: throwing two pillows on a twin bed does not therefore make it a double bed.* I was disappointed, but also very tired, and so didn't make a fuss. But I really didn't expect such a shoddy downgrade at a hotel of this type. And, I might add, I was charged the rate for the original reservation. A very classy move from the Hilton Empire!!I also have to add that the waitstaff at the pub located in the lobby was downright rude. Our waitress ignored us the entire time and only smiled when she handed us the check. There was no obvious reason for her ignoring us--we were dressed appropriately and acting civilized--and it was a PUB!! If I go into a Boston bar, I expect a waitress similar to Carla on Cheers, but I'm also paying Cheers prices. When I go into a HILTON hotel, I expect polite service, since I'm PAYING Hilton prices.

<Content>Nice hotel I only spent one night at this hotel after landing at Boston airport. I slept in a standard room and I think this hotel is not bad at all and within the usual Hilton standard. Well, of course it is not very close to downtown Boston, but there is a great service of courtesy shuttle busses connecting the hotel with the terminals and the tube station. You can reach the tube station in 10 minutes and catch a train to downtown Boston in no time. This hotel is not expensive either! Anyway if you are travelling to Boston with children or if you are planning to stay out late at night, hotels downtown are certainly a better choice.

<Content>Excellent Business/Airport Hotel This is a clean and well kept business hotel that is excellent for late arrivals or early departures. The rooms are remarkably quiet for an airport property. The room is appointed comfortably with quality linens and exceptionally soft towels. The exercise area is far above average for a business style property. A good assortment of free weights, machines and cardio equipment are available.

<Content>Nice hotel! We Stayed here our first night in Boston. It's a nice hotel with very polite staff. Our biggest help was the nice gentleman at the front door ( Neal , I Believe) He gave us great info on Boston. The only ridiculous thing is the 20 dollar parking you pay to park at the hotel after paying a pretty penny for your room.

<Content>Avergae Hilotn Nice hotel - poor location (unless you're departing early or have a short lay-over). The Hilton is a typical Hilton. Standard rooms and services are offered. The bar and restaurant service leaves much to be desired - poorly staffed (long waits to be served and average service). Unless you have a car, or like to spend $40 for cab fare, you are a hostage to this property. You can walk to no other restaurants, hotels, or shops. This place is smack-dab in the middle of Logan Airport.

Rooms OK but the hotel staff lacked attention to detail, and in a premium location at a premium price, it should be better.Check-in gave us incorrect info about cost of car parking, meaning we returned our hire car too early. We should have had breakfast vouchers, and didn't-hence go back and line up again to get them. We had no minibar key, even though we paid by credit card. We had no regular coffee in our room. The sink plug didn't seal. Breakfast buffet at 0540 was at best luke-warm, at worst cold.We'd not stay there again - there's better.

<Content>Great hotel but very thin walls!!!!!!!!!! My daughter and I stayed Sept. 4th-6th at the Hilton hotel. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because of the thin walls, so thin that you could hear your neighbor snore!!!! We also heard word for word conversations as well as when they were on the phone. If you are a light sleeper, look elsewhere. On the bright side, we did not hear any planes at all. You wouldn't even know you were near the airport. The hotel itself was very neat and clean as well as the rooms. The bed was extremely comfortable, room was spacious with up-to-date furnishings, and bathroom huge with fluffy towels and great water pressure, also a minibar (at cost)and expensive so get your nik naks at the gift shop. The Hilton featured an Irish Pub that I really enjoyed and a cafe that served starbucks coffee. Berkshire is the upscale restaurant but we did not eat there. Hilton also offer shuttle service that was awesome!!! The best I've yet to experience at a hotel. We took the shuttle to the Maverick which took us to the T and was downtown in 5 minutes. The T is $1.75 for adults, .60 for children ages 6-13, and free for ages 5 and under. Make sure you have exact change so you don't have to wait in the long lines for a token. Do visit Legal Seafood you won't regret it. There is one next to the Marriott Long Wharf Hotel that's the best, great ambiance. Last but not least, please tip the wonderful shuttle drivers. Although it's not required, they do handle your luggage and the shuttle is free so give a couple bucks!!!!!! We will definitely stay again but only if a non-joining room is a guarantee!!!!! Go and have fun!!!!!!!!!

<Content>good place My trip had been horrible until this point, but the room was a great oasis from a day of delays. The Bar downstairs also had good food although the service was not quite as up to par, pretty slow for the small amount of people that were there. The shuttle bus was the key- they run all night!

<Content>Very nice hotel, good food, wheelchair friendly We stayed here to be near the airport for an early flight and also to mitigate wheelchair transfer problems for my wife. What a great find! Our rooms were large, quiet and with views of the planes and the Boston skyline. My son loved watching the activity. Staff was very courteous and helpful. The Irish Pub downstairs had great food and drink for reasonable (non-hotel) prices. We slept great. The accessible room was perfect. The shuttles ran all the time, and they even had one with a wheelchair lift, so we didn't have to walk on the skybridge to the terminal. I plan to stay here next time.

<Content>Great Airport Hotel We stayed at the Hilton Logan Airport the night before our honeymoon and the night we returned from our honeymoon. We had early flights so staying at the Hilton was a no-brainer. The service we received upon check-in was friendly and quick. Checkout was a breeze. We did it by phone and left the keys in the room upon departure. I had heard conflicting reports of the hotel being noisy, but it most definitely was not. We slept very well both nights and did not hear any planes or people, for that matter. The courtesy shuttle was quick to pick us up in front of the hotel and the driver was very helpful. We would not hesitate to stay at the Hilton again if we had an early flight departing from Logan the next morning.

<Content>Great Hotel My partner and I stayed at the Boston Logan Hiton July 10. What a great hotel. We were so surprised...the service was first class, the food at the lobby restaurant and room service was very good. The room was large, comfortable, and clean. The spa/workout area was perfect after a long flight. Since the hotel is connected to the terminals, it was very easy to get to our flight early that next morning. We would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Good Access to Downtown The second Monday in June, I arrived at the Hilton at 9:00 am. After a bit of trial and error, I was booked into a comfy and clean room, nicely appointed. I needed to convince the front desk that the room they originally assigned was not smoke free. They were helpful in the process considering the limited number of available rooms in the morning. The Starbuck's in the lobby was a nice addition, but what I appreciated was the convenience to both Logan and downtown Boston. The hotel is connected to Terminal 3 (international and some domestic airlines-Northwest was mine). The shuttle to the other terminals is always at the front door. The same shuttle took me to the MBTA stop. I enjoyed a lovely day downtown and came back to rest for my early morning flight. I have to agree that the rooms are not sound proof from one another. What new hotel is in this day and age? One of my main gripes about newer construction. I did not hear plane traffic though. This hotel was very reasonable compared to my other options. I booked online at the Hilton web site.

<Content>Mainly for business Spent two nights here having arrived in Logan from Ireland. Ideally located as a stop gap to recover before picking up car rental and also to get a quick look at the city. (Take the Boston duck tour). Problems with check-in. Had to wait about 30 minutes due to computer problems. Then the key did not work! Concierge and Bell Boy not interested or helpful. Proposed that we bring our own bags to our room? Have never experienced this in the US before. However, room was large and comfortable. Good restaurant. Hotel mainly caters for business travellers, conference and airline staff.Excellent courtesy bus from airport to hotel, to car rental, to subway. City centre only four stops away. If you are looking for a sightseeing base probably worth staying a little closer to town.

<Content>Excellent Hilton Hotel I stayed 4 nigths in this hotel and the experince was a positive one. I'M really impressed with the quality services in all departments; front desk, housekeeping, Berkshire's restaurant and the hotel shuttle. It was excellent.The room was comfortably as well as the pillows. It was very clean and feel like a brand new room. Good soundproof window system.We got to the airport station to take the T using the hotel shuttle service provided. It was a pretty good and quickly service. From there you go to downtown in approximately 10 minutes.Congratulations hilton for this great location and keep the quality services as your # 1 priority for the traveler.
