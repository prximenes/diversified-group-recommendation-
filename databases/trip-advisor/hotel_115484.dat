<Content>Below expectations The resort layout is lovely and the grass well attended to. However, the room is rather worn and out-dated. I stayed there for a week during a conference and had a room in one of the smaller buildings facing a pool. The view was lovely, but the room was not nice, the bed pillows looked unclean, the furniture worn, the carpet had dirty spots all over it, plus the walls were very thin, I could hear what was going on next door, e.g., when the TV was on, when they spoke on the phone, or when the cleaning ladies were cleaning the room and chatting loudly. The resort is in the middle of nowhere, so unless you are there for golf/swim, there was not much else to do. It certainly did not live up to the Biltmore reputation.

<Content>What Happened??? The rooms are a mess. Cheap coffee makers??? Bathrooms totally outdated. Even the security lock on our door fell off. And we were in a suite! I was an event planner and did an annual event at the Biltmore, before it was bought by Hilton. It was my favorite hotel due to its beauty and originality. Now the rooms are shabby and worn down. The overall feeling of the grand dame it used to have only can apply to the grounds now. The outside is still well manicured and a pleasure to walk around.The room service menu used to be great, now it's simply average; the chairs in Wright's Bar have NO character and used to be really special. The carpet on the first floor screams hotel chain. PS. - Security really should monitor hotel guest鈥檚 behavior at the pools and stop people from bringing in cases of beer which they drink openly at the pool and on the terraces! It feels like a Motel 6 with spring breakers.

<Content>Not worth the price Date of stay: November 16-19, 2008My family arrived at the hotel for a conference during the dates listed above. When we arrived, we decided not to valet our car and parked in the self-parking lot. We knew that it would be a long walk, but the self parking lot was a good 10-15 minute walk from our hotel room. At night the lot was extremely dark and confusing to manage due to the odd layout of the hotel. Most concerning was the lack of security in the parking lot. The lot was merely an open, first come, first serve lot which overnight guests had to share with temporary visitors. There is no way that the hotel could discern who parked there. Despite the safety and distance issues, the hotel still charged $10.00 for self-parking.Once we arrived, we were upgraded to a cottage room but little did we know that would be a mistake. When we arrived the cottage room was decidely underwhelming for a room of that cost. The room was small and badly renovated. The bath was smaller than expected for this caliber of hotel. The heating did not work (deserts can be cold at night) and the hot water ran out after 10 minutes. Ten minutes is fine for one person but not for a family.The check-in attendant (upon upgrading our room) stated that we had a semi-private room overlooking the main part of the grounds. Well, if semi-private means hearing the honeymoon couple next door and all the drunken noises from the bar, then the attendant was right. The windows are very old, which means there is no double glazing to keep in heat and keep out sound. There was no view of the grounds because the hedges are grown so that you can't see anything while sitting on the patio furniture. You have to stand up to see anything. (I noticed this problem with a lot of the cottages.)The reason the hedges are grown high is because many of the amenities are right next to cottage rooms. The chess and putt-putt amenities touted are immediately next to the cottage rooms. This means that when little Johnny misses his putting shot, it's coming into your room.Houseekeping was pretty decent but made weird choices. One day we were given washcloths. The next day the cloths were removed and replaced by a bath mat. The mat was then removed as well.One day during our trip, we decided to drop the kids off at the kids korral touted as a baby sitting option. When we arrived, we noticed that the entrance to the korral could only be reached by the back access road for commerical deliveries. The playground was also dierctly accross the korral separated by the construction access road. Avoiding the truck was a pain, however more disconcerting was the back door to the korral (room) was open to the access road with no direct supervision. The korral attendant was seated immediately outside of the korral room. However, one precocous child trying to get to the playground through a construction access area equals disaster. Oh, and I forgot to mention that the basketball court next to the playground was open with lots of power construction tools plugged in and laying around.The hotel's costs are usually arbitrary. The chocolate cookie charged in the Cafe was $5. The same cookie at the pool was $3.50. We used the bottled water in our room listed for $6. When we checked out the same water was $7.99. The miniscule amunts for the food paled in comparison to the overpriced food. Both the Cafe and restaraunt were wildy overpriced for the quality. Also, the cafe did not serve lost of child-friendly  breakfast foods , so we were forced to order takeout from the restaruant. When we ordered oatmeal to go, it was given to us in a starbucks coffee cup.The last day of our stay was the last straw. Our family got up early to pack for our trip home. I'm glad that we did because the head housekeeper opened the door to our room at 8:50 am to inquire when we were leaving (despite the hotel's policy of a 12 noon checkout time ). Besides being completely unprofessional entering our room without permission, the housekeeper actually gave us attitude for not leaving earlier! No apologies, just attitude. On the way out of the property we saw several contractors from the Hotel condo construction project fishing in the aqueduct near the property. These contractors were actually taking up self-parking spots for the clientele for fishing. It seems that management has focused so much time on obtaining conferences and selling condos that they have forgotten the basics of customer service.

<Content>worst service ever!!!!!!!! This has to be the worst experience I have had in a very long time. The front desk staff was rude and disrepectful. We had to wait over three hours for our room to be readied and then had to move our own bags.this is definitely NOT a five star resort. and NOT the place to stay in Phoenix!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Content>Just One Night But We Enjoyed While we stayed just one night during a work-related event, we were very pleased with our stay.We stayed in a first floor Valley Wing room with a small patio and it was very nice...right near a pool, quiet, nice bath...we would have enjoyed staying longer.We did not eat in a hotel restaurant but had a late night dessert which was nice but expensive; unfortunately, our breakfast order, placed the night before via telephone, was lost so that is our main complaint. The staff is friendly, accessible, and willing to go all out for you.The resort itself is beautiful - an oasis in the big city. Great pools, gardens, outside cafe/bar...if you can get a good rate, stay at the Biltmore and we'd suggest asking for the Valley Wing (since that's all we know and we had absolutely no complaints). Having a car is essential as restaurants and shopping are nearby but at least a 1 mile walk to the Biltmore shopping and dining area.

<Content>Bed Bugs at the Biltmore My husband and I stayed at the Biltmore for a few nights in the beginning of October. We ended up with well over 100 bed bug bites and actually saw the bugs in the bed very early in the morning (4:45am) the day that we were leaving. It has been an absolute nightmare trying to make sure that we didn't bring the bugs home with us, not to mention the problems we've had with the actual bites (terribly itchy, scars, etc.). Horrible experience. The hotel has been completely unresponsive, but its insurance company has been accommodating.

<Content>Another relaxing trip to the AZ Biltmore We had not been to the Biltmore in about 5 years, and were very happy to be back. We were only there for four nights, but it was a very relaxing visit. Our room in the Arizona wing was fine, and very quiet. The grounds were as spectacular as ever, although under Hilton management I don't think the rooms were as pristine as they were when the hotel was independent. We had nothing really wrong, but it just wasn't pristine. I'd rate the room a 4 and the hotel property and main pool a 5 (or even a 6!). For some reason we did not get hit with either the resort fee or parking fee, both of which we were told we'd be charged. Needless to say we kept quiet about that!

<Content>Plan to spend out of pocket for everything The grounds were lovely and the room was adequate. Many of the pools and hot tubs are open 24 hours which is very nice, especially when the days are so hot.The two unexpected disappointments were 1) despite the fact that the resort tacks a $25/day resort fee onto your room, many of the listed amenities are somehow not covered by this fee. Want to play tennis on one of the seven courts? Plan on shelling out $20/hour and buying a can of tennis balls for $5 from the tennis booth. Planning on bringing your own car? (I would recommend it since there is nothing within walking distance of the resort for shopping/dining/movies, etc.) Valet parking costs $25/day and self parking costs $10/day. Do those poolside tent cabanas look like a fun place to hang out? They range in price from $300 - $500!2) one of the three restaurants was, unbeknownst to us, closed for remodelling which severely limited the dining options. That left guests to chose from room service (very expensive with gratuities tacked onto the already way overpriced food), Wright's fine dining (good, very expensive, very decadent food, not a good place for a light meal in the heat of the day and not enough vareity on the menu when it is the only full-service restaurant on property right now) or The Cafe which is really a small deli where one has a very limited selection of pastries and sandwiches for anywhere between twice and five times the price they would be off the resort property. If you don't have a car (which we didn't) you are stuck with the limited food options and the highly overpriced dining options.That said, the pools, landscaping and staff were terrific. We enjoyed massages in the spa (the steam room and one of the showers in the spa men's locker room were broken and the locker room/spa area could have been much cleaner) and the run of the property but we found that we kept asking staff how much does this cost?

<Content>Not worth the price! Free scorpion with room tho To attach the esteemed 鈥淲aldorf-Astoria Biltmore鈥?tag to this supposed resort and spa is shameful. My husband and I spent 5 days there for a conference he was attending (Sept. 9-14, 2008). Even though his company was paying for it and money wasn鈥檛 coming out of our pockets, we were still disgusted. The first night鈥檚 hotel room was large, but the bathroom had a weird layout with a shower stall showing age, mold, and cracks in molding. The carpet stains were disgusting and plentiful-yuck. There was a huge, very noticeable tear in the desk lamp. The decorative pillow was scungy and old with fabric balls all over it. The biggest surprise for me was the scorpion that crawled out from under the bed across the floor to the window drapes while I was alone in the room!!!!! Nowhere in the literature do they mention watch out for scorpions. The front desk wasn鈥檛 fazed. The maint. man who came to remove it wasn鈥檛 fazed. When my husband called the front desk after hearing about my ordeal, he got the sarcastic reply from Mark Lambert, 鈥渨ell, we ARE in a desert.鈥?No, we鈥檙e at the BILTMORE and not camping on the desert floor. BTW Mark should not be in a customer facing job鈥揾e鈥檚 way too arrogant. They comp鈥檇 us the room and we moved to cottage K, which they 鈥榮aid鈥?they sprayed for bugs/scorpions. Cottage is about 90 yrs old and shows it. Dingy. No safety runner or handles in the marble floored, small, dark shower stall 鈥?what a safety hazard and lawsuit waiting to happen. Dark lighting everywhere. Dead bugs lying in the ceiling light covers. (hey, but no scorpions, aren鈥檛 we lucky!) A/C that barely spit out cold air, except after 9pm at night. No storage space for clothing. 1 of 3 small drawers was dedicated to mini bar liquor and snacks (overpriced) and the fridge was loaded with beverages and booze鈥搉o room for a water bottle. One restaurant was closed for remodeling and the Wright restaurant had a severly limited menu of choices that were overpriced. We went out a few nights just to get decent food choices. The Starbucks Caf茅 was another place to get food, but you paid dearly for items, such as coffee and bagel with cream cheese, and options limited. I know we鈥檙e on a resort but do we have to feel like prisoners? Give us food choices, vending machines and soda machines too for heaven鈥檚 sake. This place is sooooo overpriced and not worth the $200/night. The one day the housekeeper left our patio door WIDE open. Thank God our computer and valuables weren鈥檛 stolen! I went to the salon to get a champagne pedicure, $80. It was nothing special nor what you鈥檇 expect from a famous 鈥渞esort and spa.鈥?Very average service. I get more at my local salons, even a mimosa or glass of cheap champagne 鈥?nothing at the Biltmore spa though 鈥?just some iced tea. They may think the name will make people shell out tons of cash, but they鈥檙e wrong. We鈥檝e been to the nicest places here and abroad and to the not so nice places, so we come with some experiences and knowledge. The AZ Biltmore is a loser鈥揹on鈥檛 bother staying there. Sure the grounds are lovely and many staff members are great, but you need more than those two pluses for the price.

<Content>The Bilt-MOLD Resort and Spa..... Bleh!....for what we paid (and there were 7 of us) not an experience worth repeating. We all have multiple mystery charges on our bills. Left a message for their accounting dept to get back to me on that one. This hotel was booked for us to attend a conference and we were scattered in different buildings with varying levels of upkeep (some ok...others molding...or in my case slightly roach infested). The AC does not work well but that is a minor detail.Room service is very prompt...and they should be given what they charge you for ordering anything.Housekeeping in my experience was good but I know one co-worker had one day where they didn't show up.I would not recommend or stay at this hotel again. In my opinion its very pricey for what it actually provides and certainly not worth it.

<Content>Don't Bother - Service is Horrible You've got to be kidding. We have stayed in the best and worst of hotels/motels through the years. We've stayed here 3 times prior to this, but this particular visit was worst I've ever seen in my life. Upon check-in the fellow who was checking our car, was rude beyond belief....we had to literally beg for a cart for our luggage. Two days later we rented a pool-side cabana, and then we're in the pool, look up and see three people (security people) advancing on our cabana and entering the area...all other guests eyes are on us at this point....we had brought a bottle of McCallum Scotch because the waitress said they did not have it available at pool-side. Mind you, this bottle was tucked in the cabana, not anywhere near the pool itself. No posting about the bad Karma this would bring us....we were practically under arrest partiucularily by the head of security - a pistol packing mamma. Rude...beyond belief. The customer serive at the Biltmore is sad, sad, sad, sad. We spent over $3,000.00 for 3 days of bull from every end of the spectrum. Our advise - stay the heck away from this place. There are other beaufiful places to stay....this isn't it.

<Content>Handicap Access Perspective I recently spent 2 nights at the Biltmore as part of a speaking role at a conference. I was restricted to a wheelchair due to multiple foot fractures. Good: The bell staff were excellent and timely whenever needed to push the wheelchair over the very large hotel campus. The architecture and history of the hotel were significant. Bad: The campus is not readily handicap friendly. It is not enough to have a sign on a restroom door when the door doesn't allow access. The construction of the campus with steep inclines forced a bellman to be called whenever you wanted to go somewhere. The restaurant for dinner was very expensive. A hamburger, tomato soup, Iced Tea for $35 (including tip). Plus, I have better burgers and fries at fast food joints. Also, the layout of the campus caused a lot of money to be spent on bellmen tips (even though I was already paying $12 a night- which I found out about upon checkout). Not reviewed: Due to the access issues, I was not able to visit the pool or other hotel amenities. Thanks for reading.

<Content>What a let down Stayed as part of a conference in August - thank god I didn't pay for this experience. On check in my room wasn't ready and although they promised to call me, they never did.- I ended up calling back at 6pm. It took me 20 minutes to find my room in the Catalina section, the signs kept pointing different directions. When I finally got to my room, a dirty tray was waiting at my door. I ordered room service that evening and they picked up the dirty tray but never came back for mine. It stayed outside my door for 2 DAYS until I rang and complained. Other annoying things: The shampoo/conditioner tray had a film of shampoo on the bottom of it. When I used the shampoo I found out it had been watered down and didn't foam at all.I called for a golf cart to help me bring heavy items to my room from the conference center and it never came, I ended up carrying boxes in the heat.The lobby smells and in places linens were ripped. Place needs a complete overhaul and service in general is mediocre.Not many good remarks to share except the bed and pillows were very comfortable and the Catalina and main pool were really well maintained.

<Content>Probably the best staff I've ever had at a hotel My wife was lucky enough to have a conference at the hotel and we got an incredible rate (of course it was incredibly hot in August -;). I am a Gold with HHonors and my wife asked about an upgrade upon checkin (I arrived a day later). The front desk clerk told her we could have a 1 br villa at an extra $399. After chatting with the clerk for a couple minutes, she gave us the upgrade for free! This room was amazing...out the back porch was a small pool shared by the other villas.We had a small problem with one of our meals on Friday and the manager comped us a poolside cabana on Saturday. It was the largest cabana on the property!Food on site was fantastic, staff bent over backwards to help and the had some great family activities.Even in the heat of the summer, they built a little fire and had smores on Friday night! It was great! They had a nice little buffet spread set up with all the smores necesseties, plus popcorn, hot chocolate, water, iced tea, and milk.Saturday night, they set up a big screen by the pool for a 'dive in movie.'Overall, an excellent experience! Good food, but most importantly, the staff was simply incredible. They didn't know the meaning of the word 'no.

<Content>Never Again We were there early and told the room was not ready, they would call us when it was. We went to the pool and called hours later for them to tell us oh, your's is the last room to be cleaned, it's not ready yet. We went to our spa treatments (good) and finally got in our room about 5:00. We should have looked closer that night - disgusting - mold on the bathroom ceiling, sinks cracked and chipped, lamp shades had holes in them. We did complain the next day and received some compensation. Food way over priced - $13.95 for a wrap! Good thing we had a car - went to Denny's for breakfast instead of paying $6 for toast at the resort. Only found about 5 of the 8 pools but that was OK. Bars closed way to early - 110 out and you close the pool bar at 6:00!!! Spa treatments were good but beware if you get Esther - she will try to sell you everything. In summary - way over priced for a dirty, boring resort.

<Content>A disappointing experience!! We just returned from a LONG week at the Biltmore. Never again! My husband and I had a conference to attend at the hotel so we decided to take our two teens, each with a friend and put them up in a separate villa. There was trouble from the beginning. Upon booking (for four) we were given a price of $319.00 nightly (conference rate) After talking to a colleague, who was quoted a price of $299.00 I called back to be told that the villa could not accommodate 4 after all due to fire regulations not allowing for two cots in the living room. We had already booked flights etc. so after much back and forth we were told they could relax the rules. We arrived, went to the villa. No cots. We were told two could sleep on the pull out couch. (The couch and chairs were full of stains) Went to get into bed after a long day of travel. No bedding provided and took over an hour to arrive. After three nights of toughing it out the kids (who are not whiners) were exhausted from the inability to sleep on the unbelievably low quality sofa bed. They brought in the two cots. We had got in food supplies the first night . Went to cook breakfast, no pots and pans, no dishes etc. Went to do the dishes, no clothes, dishtowels, scrubby. Every single kitchen detail has to be requested. There was no mention of the need to do this upon check in. In fact there was no orientation at all. Third night in, the air conditioning broke. In 104 F, not so great for sleeping.Be prepared for extra costs at every single turn and expect to pay 2-3 times regular prices for anything from tylenol to coffee.I could go on but it would all be in the same tone. Do check your bill at the end of your stay. There was about $100.00 in mistaken charges that they were very prompt in reversing. This hotel has had better days.

<Content>The worst! The was one of the worst hotel experiences of my life. The moment my wife and walked in I knew there was trouble. The carpet was filthy and had an odor in the lobby. We switched our first room because of the odor and the next room we got had gum stains in the carpet, not to mention stains on the bed spread.Simply Horrible!

<Content>Fun Girls weekend My girlfriends and i did extensive research before our spa weekend in Arizona. after much debate we chose the Arizona Biltmore. we were very excited about the historic element as well as the amazing architecture. all of our research was done online using traveladvisor.com and arizonaspagirls.com. when we arrived at the property we were in awe, the grounds are just beautiful. the grass was so plush we kicked off our sandals and walked through the front lawn : ) our room was great. far larger than a regular hotel room and the best were really comfy. we did not overlook anything special but their gardens are beutiful all over the property and we did have a view of one of the lawns. we had appointments booked at their spa in advance which was very helpful because it was busy! their spa is smaller than some of the others that we visited but it allowed for more personal attention and we really enjoyed it. in the mornings we used the gym facilities which were adequate. since we were on Chicago time we got down there at 5:30 a.m. and it was about 50% full (only about 12 treadmills, ellipticals, stairclimbers and bikes) by 6:30 it was packed! and people were waiting for machines. The 2 negative experiences that i encountered were #1 NO PARKING!! since this resort was built so long ago they did not account for the number of cars that would be visiting in 2008. i am sure back in the 30's there was ample parking. #2 The price of food!! at lunch they were service a chicken wrap for $15.95! and for breakfast i had a vegetable frittata (fancy omelette) for $21.95. needless to say, we left the resort most of the time.

<Content>Amazing Arcitecture This is the forth and last resort that I stayed in on a long trip from Vegas to Phoenix. It was by far the best. This is a resort frequented by politicians and celebrities, so expect to pay for what you get. I stayed here in the off season so I probably would not afford it during the peak season. There is a fee for parkng (both self and valet). We opted for self (when you do this make sure you don't get lost going to your room at night!) The resort is very large and we were in the back building so we did get lost once.When we checked in, the lobby was beautiful and the staff was very helpfull. I am a fan of Frank Lloyd Wright and could see his influence throughout the resort. The prices in the shops are high (almost 20.00 for sunscreen). So make sure you do not forget anything.The walk back to our room, showed us how lovely the grouds where. The statues were beautiful. When we got to the terrace building the pool was being refurbished. This would have upset me if There were not so many pools and if I was paying for off season.The room was amazing. We asked for two beds but the were all booked (they were refurbishing rooms as well). We instead got a large king bed in a room that fit a roll away for our daughter comfortably. The bathroom was huge! Separate bath and shower with a great showerhead. the minibar was also high priced but I usually eat so much on vacation that I do not need late night snacks.We went to the main pool once. Most of the chairs are taken up by cabanas. It is so hot in Pheonix that the cabanas are popular. The second time we went to the main pool there were no chairs available. It too was undergoing refurbishing and the slide was closed. This is one thing that I wish I knew beforehand for my daughter's sake. We found chairs at the next pool over that was just as nice. There are waiters to order lunch and always cool water on hand to drink (no charge). When it was time to check out you could do it by phone or over the television system. I had a staff member print my boarding passes for me and I knew that I was going to miss this place. The only way to make it better is to take it out of Phoenix and move it to Sedona.

<Content>Terrible Started off bad. Room was booked in advanced [way] . The 4 of us showed up to check in - room not ready ! They told us they would call us when one was ready. 2 hours later I called them and low and behold they had one ready. - Not - My son had to sleep on a sleeper sofa ! They didnt say anything about 75% of the pools not working or the slide being repaired. Or even that the main pool water temp was above 80 degrees ! Beware of the extra extravagant charges for the stuff in the fridge.. We stayed in one of the cottages which is a little bit of a walk to the parking lot . The cottage was ok . Nothing fancy about it. The a.c. in the cottage wasnt great. Were from the midwest so we know what heat is. I found out from a GROUNDSKEEPER that we could call house keeping and have a coffee maker brought to the room. Food was good, house keeping was good. If they would have been informative when we first checked in things might have been better. Will stay somewhere else next time.. Then the bill was wroung.....

<Content>Grand Old Lady needs some TLC We arrived from Anchorage Alaska in 113 degree heat. Our room was not ready untill one hour after check in time. The grounds are beautiful but directions to our room were vauge and we wandered around untill we found it. The shower door was broken and nobody ever did come to repair it. Resort fee? What did I get for this, ice water at the pool. Nine pools? As far as I could tell only 2 were usable by anyone. TV was pathetic 27. Even Best Western has flat panels. Hotel and grounds were top notch. By the end of our stay I really fell in love with the place, but am glad I only paid off season prices. It was a great experience to stay in a clasic resort, but I will not be returning. The room was nothing as pictured and we had the best available other than a cottage. Staff was great. Its sad that this place may fold if not updated and competitivly priced.

<Content>Nice Grounds but Pathetic Service Standards Perspective from a very frequent business traveler who is also a member of the highest tier in this hotel chain's frequent stay program.GOOD:The grounds are nicely manicured and the original Frank Lloyd Wright buildings are iconic. Service at The Biltmore Grill is good. Upgraded king room is spacious.BAD:The pathetic service starts upon arrival. The Valet/Bell Desk will not offer to help with your luggage. The Front Desk will give you keys that don't work, causing you to return to get keys that do. It'll be a 5 minute walk to your room in the summer 100+ degree temperatures. The clock radio will be broken. The coffee maker you request (there are none in the room) will be delivered with a used filter and coffee grounds in it. Housekeeping will wake you by banging on your door at 7:00 am and will call twice when you don't answer. The fitness center will start turning off the lights and the TVs 30 minutes before closing (8:30) even though you're working out. You'll be told there are no umbrellas to borrow when the lightning storm comes. Upgraded king room bathroom is shabby and the shower very small. Food at The Biltmore Grill is over priced for the small portions. In room safe is not large enough for a small laptop. RECOMMENDATION: If you want to experience the Arizona Biltmore, just visit for a meal or a drink, but stay at any of the following: Royal Palms, The Phoenician, Fairmont Scottsdale Princess, Sanctuary on Camelback, The Boulders, Westin Kierland, Ritz-Carlton or Four Seasons Scottsdale.

<Content>A great setting, great architecture, failing on some details The hotel's claim to fame is its鈥?architecture, being done in the prairie style of Frank Lloyd Wright, and the hotel remains true to that vision. If you like Wright's work (and I do) there is plenty of eye candy for you to look atCheck in: Easy, went well, no issueParking: We used the valet...tho they did charge $25/day for parking which I thought was rough.Food Bar: I did not eat at the hotel. The bar was good, staff friendly and of course, the drinks were overpriced.Room: Neat, well kept, clean, and remained true to the theme of the the hotel. I also liked the showers.Now for the complaint; the resort has several pools...the main pool was, in a word, filthy. The water was so cloudy that one could not see the bottom of the pool. There were several contributing factors to this. First, it had rained, and I was told by the hotel staff, rain water tends to overwhelm the pool's sanitation system. Secondly, there is a swim up bar which serves food, not a great idea if you want to keep your pool clean, and finally, the pool was really crowded.Aside from the cloudy water, I noted some refuse in the pool as well.Aside from the pool problem (which I am sure could be fixed with a little attention) the place is great. Good setting, nice staff, etc.Oh! One more thing, the concierge service was fantastic; helpful, nice people who really seemed to care.

<Content>Unique I stayed here for one night at the end of a ten day road tip through Arizona, Utah and Nevada and it made for a perfect ending to a great holiday.The design and architecture of the building is beautiful and made the Biltmore, in my experience, something very unique and very special. The grounds too are beautifully laid out the pool is incredible. I loved the style, furniture and character of the room. This was large with a decent sized balcony, two very large and comfortable beds and a very large bathroom.We ate in the hotel and both the service and the food were good. I found this reasonably good value. We had breakfast from the coffee shop and again this was fine. The outside bar area is a lovely atmospheric spot to relax at any time of the day, but especially the evening when fires will lit which helped create some atmosphere.Hotel staff were not outstanding but were efficient and courteous.The Biltmore is a very special place being truly redolent of a by-gone age and has managed to its credit, to maintain its unique and special atmosphere. It鈥檚 not cheap but I thought it worth every cent and would return to Phoenix solely to stay here again.

<Content>Blah and more Blah Stayed here for a conference. Horrible wait staff at meals. Food is overly expensive and not very good. Pool is drab and the rooms are downright boring. You'd think for the price that you pay to stay there that the rooms would at least have nice beds and duvets...but oh no...they don't.I'd never go back.

<Content>Perfect Hotel if your boss pays for the stay! I spent four days at this hotel due to a business trip so I heard many comments from all my colleagues. I personaly had a room with balcony, kitchen, two floors and two queen size beds. The room was big, plasma TV, nice pillows and towels and a comfortable bed. The shower had no pressure and one morning I noticed water falling hard from the ceiling from the room above. it did get fixed however other colleagues mentioned AC and shower problems. One smart colleague asked to see rooms in each wing until she found one she liked so if you have time, do just that or try to stay away from the old wings of this hotel. The bar is nice and the drinks are great but (yes another but) service is lousy because they only have two servers around the bar and drinks are expensive ($16). The grounds are beautiful, the pools are very nice and friendly to the kids and the golf course is just ok. All in all a great stay but if I had to pay for it I would choose another destination.

<Content>Watch for the hidden fees At the time of booking, I was told that there would be a $25 per day resort charge added to the room fee. However, I was not told about numerous other automatic fees that would be added to my bill including: a $12 per day bellman gratuity (even though I didn't use the bell services); a $10 per day parking charge (even though there is a large, open parking lot where you park yourself); and a $3 per day housekeeping charge. I was very disappointed that a hotel in this price range would nickel and dime their guests with additional, undisclosed fees. Hotel accomodations and grounds were nicely appointed and well kept. However, the rooms were merely average compared to other properties at this price level. In addition, this property is very spread out, so be prepared to do a lot of walking between your room and the facilities. Similarly, the hotel is quite isolated, requiring a car to visit any attractions, restaurants, etc.

<Content>The perfect place for a relaxing babymoon After reading the reviews on this website, I was very skeptical. My husband and I decided that we would rather spend a little more money for only a few days if it was luxurious rather than a week for so-so. I visited tripadvisor and got worried. This hotel was perfect for what we wanted. It was super relaxing, the staff and service was 5-star and it was the perfect size and atmosphere. I'm glad it wasn't one of those large chains where there are 500+ rooms in one building. This was very cozy. We were upgraded to a better room upon our arrival. Yes, the food was pricey and tasted so-so but I didn't go for the food. Plus, we didn't do the fancy dining. We just wanted to relax by the pool which we did. We rented a cabana for two days which was perfect and the third day we just grabbed some chairs by the pool. Considering it was Memorial Day weekend, there was a lot of families and kids around. I was worried that it would be noisy and chaotic but it wasn't at all. I took several naps by pool in fact. The hotel covers a lot of space but unless you are planning to golf or check out every pool and restaurant, you don't have to do a lot of walking. I'm seven months pregnant so I was very happy about that.

<Content>Eh. I honestly just don't understand all the fuss about this hotel. We booked a room with a king bed but they still had to scrounge for one when we arrived. The grounds are nice I suppose, but everything is quite pricey and it's much more sensible to leave the property. But, Phoenix is a city that really requires a car in order to get around, yet parking at the hotel is hard to come by. Many of the conveniences of upscale hotels are lacking, such as coffee in the room (you have to either go find some on your own or order it from room service). The room itself was fine but I could have gotten a similar one at any mainstream chain hotel. I admittedly did not take advantage of the spa facilities, but as for the hotel itself, I don't see what makes it so great. It's an average hotel for an exorbitant price.

<Content>A++ Staff, A++ Pools, D- Room Service! We stayed at the Biltmore for four days during a corporate event. Rooms: They had initially put us in a room in the Village area. The room, decorated with mission style furniture, overlooked a garden and was spacious and clean, with a dresser, desk, two comfy chairs, side table, king bed, and flat screen tv. Our friends had rooms with a balcony and I love sitting outside reading so I requested a change to a room with a balcony. The staff were extremely accommodating about making the change. We packed our bags and they moved them for us. When we came back in the afternoon we had been given a room with a balcony, again overlooking the garden, in the Paradise section. Again the room was clean and had a flat screen tv and king bed. It had the balcony I had asked for but it was MUCH smaller! It didn't have room for the dresser and while it was a reasonable size, it felt cramped compared to the other room. To tell the truth, I wish I'd kept the larger room! So take your pick: smaller room + balcony, larger room + no balcony. Staff: Professional, helpful, polite, accommodating. Everyone we came in contact with, from Reception to the Pool staff, was top notch.The Grounds: You will walk. A lot. This isn't necessarily a bad thing but if you are mobility restricted it can be an issue. The Resort is large and sprawling so be warned, if you are in a room in one of the farther buildings and you are attending an event in the McArthur Ballroom, it's right on the other side of the property and is a bit of a hike. Lots of fountains, gardens, swimming pools, and everything is meticulously tended. btw: If anyone from the Resort reads this I'd have a small suggestion, on the way from the lobby to the Paradise building there is a concrete Japanese Temple on a rock. It doesn't look right just plopped there like an afterthought. It's an anomaly in a place as carefully planned as the Biltmore. The Buildings: The Resort itself is beautiful and it was a pleasure to stay in a place that had been designed with such style. We noticed that as sometimes happens in Wright's work, style occasionally triumphs over function, but it is lovely nonetheless. And ignore the picky people who complain about the carpets, plastic toilets in the rooms or whatever. Some people can never be satisfied. It's a beautiful and extremely well maintained Resort, and it's a pleasure to visit. And finally, I must mention the room service. If you have any choice, don't. We had to order in one evening because my husband was feeling ill. I love french onion soup and was eager to have some because I was sure that in a place as prestigious as the Biltmore, it would be real french onion soup. Can I tell you how disappointed I was to taste the same nasty oversalted beef soup base I can get in any restaurant? I sent the first bowl back because it was so salty it was inedible. The second bowl seemed almost as bad as the first but I was starving by the time it came and ate it anyway. The gruy猫re cheese on top was correct and lovely, but the overall it was very disappointing. One bowl french onion, one bowl chicken noodle, one grilled cheese, one small milk, one cr猫me br没l茅e = $50. Expensive and disappointing. Overall the Biltmore was a treat.

<Content>Very Relaxing We stayed here for 3 nights. Rooms were OK-nice-nothing fancy but plenty spacious. Bed was very, very comfortable!! Grounds are beautiful. Spa was great! Fitness Center was definitely adequate. It was a very relaxing place. Staff was incredibly helpful. I highly recommend the 7am mountain hike-AWESOME! Breakfast at the Biltmore Grill was very good. Sunday Brunch at the Wrights was INCREDIBLE-highly recommend it. Other than that id say skip dinner at Wrights-kind of overrated. We ate there and had pretty bad service. I highly highly recommend dinner at Tomaso's. It was an awesome italian restaurant nearby. They have complimentary car service where they will pick you up at the hotel and drop you off. The BEST authentic homestyle italian food!! Food on the property is so overpriced. For lunch at the pool we had 2 pina coladas, shrimp salad and grilled chicken salad-$66. So be aware of that before you go.All in all we had a very nice trip-very very relaxing. But I dont think we would stay here again.

<Content>Scratching by on its reputation from decades past If you generally stay at places like the Four Seasons, the Arizona Biltmore will prove very disappointing. My family continues to grow, so I was seeking a two bedroom suite. On the face of it, the Biltmore provided a much more attractive proposition that the Four Seasons. Our suite cost $1000 per night approx (Feb. 2008 rates), vs almost double that for the Four Seasons.It was on the qualitative front that this hotel fell short. The lobby is shabby, the reception desk people unengaging. The room was tired and worn. Old, dirty looking carpets and furniture throughout. The TVs (three) were CRTs as opposed to the advertised flat screens. The cappuccino machine used by room service was on the fritz for three days! Three days to get a cappuccino maker serviced! Pools were dirty. The list is endless. We finally checked out and I wrote a letter of complaint to the client service manager and never even received a reply. That sums up the approach to client service in a nutshell. To sum up. Fine if you are looking for a bargain five star hotel but do not expect a five star experience. This is a property in absolute and relative decline.

<Content>Beautiful Hotel! We decided to splurge and stay at the Biltmore for a long weekend (Easter weekend). The hotel grounds are beautiful as are the building exteriors. We stayed in the Valley Wing on the ground level facing the pool. Our room was nice and we enjoyed sitting on the patio at the end of each day.Two things: (1) the noise of running water from the room next door. Someone decided to take a shower early one morning (3:00 a.m.) and the sound of the running water woke up my husband; (2) maybe because it was Easter weekend but there were a lot of families staying there. My husband and I are in our 40s without any children so we prefer to stay in places that do not cater to families with young children. We chose the Biltmore because of its history; I think if we found ourselves in Phoenix again we might choose to stay elsewhere.

<Content>Look out for hiden costs The property of this hotel is beautiful and is worth the staying here. The issue I have with my last stay is the following: When I checked out I noticed that the hotel had charged a resort fee of $20, maid fee per day and bellman fee. They need to have this on their web site when you are booking a room so you know exactly how much you cost is going to be and should be explained to you in detail when you check-in. Ideally they would hand you a piece of paper explaining exactly what these fees are for, so you could review them in your room. I ended up tipping people during my stay not knowing that in general this was being charged on a daily basis during my stay.

<Content>A Quick Expensive Getaway My wife and I had some Delta tickets that were parked that we had to use or lose and so at the last minute we made a quick trip Thurs - Sun to the Arizona Biltmore. We live on the east coast so this was a nice getaway leaving the colder weather behind. To get a good overview of the history I would suggest you look at the overview at Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. We booked our trip using AMEX i.e. their Preferred Resort Program and the room rate we choose was $500 a night for a Mountain View but at check in we were upgraded at no charge to a Villa Suite which starts at around $1200! The suite we got is literally this suite you see on the Biltmore website under the link for accommodations. The picture is room 7200 and it looks exactly like this. Needless to say my wife and I were happy with the accommodations. The bed was heavenly, the closet space was huge. The bathroom was large with two sinks but the shower door is very flimsy. Also the bathroom has a deep tub but it was not a Jacuzzi. . As you can see by the picture on the website this room has a wonderful sitting area with a prefect view of the mountain and a full kitchen and dinning room table area. The outside patio is also very large with two lounge chairs and a separate table with chairs as well. All this overlooks the outside area where guests play lawn chess and checkers and of course an unobstructed view of the mountain. For lunch one day we ate a hamburgers around the pool i.e. the Cabana Club which was around forty dollars and luckily, our package had one lunch and three breakfast certificates included to use at The Biltmore Grill or The Caf茅 all I think were thirty-two dollars in value each. For dinner at the resort we ate at Wright's i.e. high gourmet, meaning very expensive and not much food. We also stopped by the The Caf茅 for two oversized cookies setting us back seven dollars. One evening we sat out near the fire pits over looking the fountain which was beautiful and had two gingerales also costing seven dollars. We also ate off property one night at Donovan's. They are ranked #2 in The Prime Time Top 10 USDA Prime Steakhouse in the United States. This was absolutely excellent! The steaks, Australian lobster tail, crab cakes are all outstanding and you can't go wrong. You can even call and they will schedule to pick you up and take you back to the hotel for free which is a nice touch when you don't have a car. The last night both my wife and I had the 80 minute Dream Makers Spa treatment i.e. two hundred thirty dollars each without the tip each. The treatment was good and they have over forty massage therapist on staff. However, the spa dressing/sauna area itself was in bad need of renovation, the carpet was dirty, small half lockers, three showers, even one of the two bathrooms was out of order. It was very small and a huge disappointment after reading the brochure stating 22,000 square feet , which must be their fitness center versus a spa area. Also, to wait for your treatment, wearing only your robe and slippers, you sat in a cramped communal gathering area. For the money it is not worth it until they upgrade their spa facility to be a real spa. We also choose to eat room service for dinner which was over one hundred twenty five dollars. The room service menu was inadequate and left you scratching your head trying to pick something good to eat that would be filling but not just a hamburger. All in all however we had a wonderful, very expensive trip but I knew that going in and it is nice to be able to splurge on yourself every now and then.

<Content>a wonderful stay I just returned from a 3 day, 3 night stay at the Biltmore (Wed - Sat) and I think there were tears in my eyes when I pulled away last evening! It was truly a pleasure from the moment I checked in until I left. I paid in advance for a deluxe resort room in the Valley wing which was large with a lovely balcony overlooking Camel Mountain to the left and the large lawn and a glimpse of the Paradise Pool to the right.I was travelling alone (woman, mid 30s) and the staff made extra sure I was comfortable regardless of what I was doing. They remembered me from the front desk, to the restaurant, to the pool. Normally when I travel, I use the hotel for sleeping only, this was not the case for this vacation. The only time I left the resort was when I went shopping on Friday at the Biltmore Fashion Park (free shuttle service) and the Fashion Square (5 miles down on Camelback Rd).Two of the evenings I ate on the outdoor patio of Wright's Bar and was able to order food from the Grille. I also spent 2 full days in a cabana by the pool where the staff were attentive and lovely and I also had a terrific, relaxing massage at the spa one of the early evenings.Because I was there mid-week through the weekend, I noticed a huge difference in clientele. Mostly business men and women Wed-Fri and then families on the weekend. The pool was much livelier on Saturday and I recommend splurging for the cabana to escape from the noise and sun if necessary. I loved my stay here and would recommend it to single travellers or families. I hope to return for many more vacations.

<Content>Terrific Family Getaway in the Sun We just returned from a 5 night trip to the Biltmore. I was travelling with my husband and 2 year old daughter. We love historic properties with interesting touches (in other words we were boutique hotel fans in our pre-baby days); after a bit of research looking at other high end hotels in the area, we chose the Biltmore because it seemed to have the right balance of character with kid-friendly amenities. We were very happy with our decision.If you look on the Biltmore's website, there are a number of different kinds of rooms you can book. They range from the classic to resort rooms to suites, with a range of prices. In light of having a rambunctious 2 year old we ponied up for a resort room. The room was $470 per night (about $120 per night more than a standard classic room), but it was huge, located right off the paradise pool, and featured a large walk-out patio that was surrounded by hedges and was very private. It was definitely worth the premium. The layout of the hotel is several buildings, most only 2-3 stories tall, so unlike a lot of high rise McMansion type resorts, there is no waiting for the elevator. The grounds are spacious, immaculately kept, and teeming with interesting touches like tiny fountains and waterfalls that are nestled into every nook and cranny. Perfect for a tiny rock collector, our daughter spent lots of time outdoors inspecting the various scenery. My only complaint was that housekeeping was quite late in the day (between 2 and 4pm most days). We liked that the hotel had separate offerings for adults and families. There are pools, restaurants, and public areas specifically for adults, and ones specifically for families. There was a large, canopy-covered playground we took our daughter to each morning, and we spent each afternoon at the paradise pool (one of 3 pools specifically for families). We loved the water slide and the art deco details in the pool area. I would have preferred a zero entry pool, but in light of the age of the pool and hotel I was OK with it. It was a very shallow, wide stepped entrance and my daughter could sit and splash for hours. We ate poolside most days and food was good and reasonably priced ($5.25 for a gourmet PBJ with fries, $12 for a shrimp salad). The cocktails were good and strong, too. We ordered room service several times, and found it to be a good option--not the most delicious food I've ever eaten--but again it was reasonably priced and quite good (imagine similar fare to the California Pizza Kitchen). One night we did go off property to a local Cuban restaurant, Cafe Havana on Camelback road, which was delicious with a huge menu of options. I had a pedicure and hot stone massage at the spa, and the services were good, in line with other high end hotels I've stayed in. In summary, we had a terrific time at the Biltmore and plan to return next year. I would recommend it highly to families that enjoy staying in unique, historic properties.

<Content>This Grande Dame is holding up beautifully! I had to spend a couple of nights here for meetings, making this the 4th time I've stayed at this resort. I've always been struck by the contrast of the stark Frank Lloyd Wright architecture against the sumptuous landscaping of its grounds. I had a resort deluxe room in the Paradise wing overlooking one of the many pools.The room was impeccibly maintained, with workdesk (free wired internet), 2 sitting chairs and dresser-mounted high-definition LCD television. I found the bed to be very comfortable. Closet space was large, but dresser space was somewhat limited. The marble bathroom included 2 sinks and a combo tub shower with curtain.Service at the hotel was always friendly and prompt, and I was always greeted with a smile and a 'hello'.Given the nature of my stay, I wasn't able to sample either the spa or the golf, nor was I able to try any of the restaurants other than the casual Biltmore Grill, which was an excellent choice for lunch, both in terms of menu and service.A word about the parking: this resort was not designed with cars in mind, so self-parking is located on the perimeter and can be quite a ways from the guestroom. Valet parking is available, but can be pricey.That being said, I would still recommend this hotel as one that compete with any of the large deluxe resorts in Scottsdale - yet it is more convenient to downtown Phoenix and the airport.

<Content>Huge Disapointment! Not a luxury hotel. This was the biggest hotel disapointment that I have ever had! My wife and I scheduled a long weekend in Phoenix and wanted to try the Biltmore for something different than our usual stays at the Phoenecian or Royal Palms. There is no comparison....the Biltmore is very dated, has horrible service in the restaurants, and is somewhat depressing inside. Even in a suite, you almost feel as though you are in a dungeon. We joked that it was somewhat similar to the tower of terror ride at Disneyland. The worst part about it is that we were woken up early 2 out of the 3 mornings by the groundscrew and their leaf blowers outside of our room. We ended up checking out early and spending out last night at the Royal Palms...and were happy we did!

<Content>Beautiful escape from the snow, however.... Positives: the property is beautiful - lawns well manicured, beautiful scenery, quiet and relaxing (amazing when you take into account the number of pools on the property - all beautiful and well designed). Beds were very comfortable with housekeeping just adequate. The outdoor fire pit seating arrangements at the bar are heavenly! There is also a paved  gravel walk/bike trail that extends for miles both east and west of the property - well travelled and a nice change from the indoor gym. Hourly transfer to nearby mall - very nice shops. Negatives: added charges - surprising in light of the already high daily rate, restaurants on property are fair - also with very high prices. Housekeeping service very late in the day. The outdoor grille area is very nice, but cold on a Feb evening with limited heaters available. Kudos to: Scott the Assistant Front Desk Manager who went out of his way to address any needs and make our stay as enjoyable as possible; Frank the bellman who was on top of everything! Recommendations: Enjoy the lovely outdoor seating before going off property to dine. Walk/bike on the trails. Get acquainted with Scott and Frank - they'll remember your name and make you feel like an honored guest - just what you expect for a property of this rating.

<Content>Biltmore has the Wright stuff! Attended an event in Phoenix that took place at Biltmore. I was initially apprehensive booking at this Hilton-Waldorf Astoria Collection Hotel. I usually prefer the Four Seaons option in Scottsdale. But I was pleasantly surprised!Checkin was personalized, efficient. Our room comfortable and spacious. Large screen HDTV was a surprise. Extra large closets were not expected. Our valley wing room 3425 was a value for the money- large balcony, spacious bath and amenities. The on site shops were friendly and well priced. The casual restaurant was fine- not exceptional dining, but great breakfast and lunch choices. The lobby bar was stylish and the place to be at night- although the lobby temp is frigid!!! This is a standard observation of all who have visited! Bellmen and car valets are top notch as are the spa attendants. The spa is top notch although the locker rooms/ communal areas could use some updating.We actually booked a return visit later this year!

<Content>Alright, but not spectacular. Having stayed - in the last year - at the Sanctuary and the Montage, I expected the Biltmore to be of the same caliber, given that it was in the same price range. Don't get me wrong - it was good, but not that good. Sure, the unique architecture of the old building, both inside and out, is remarkable. The service is impeccable. However, the inside of the new buildings was not up to my expectations. I stayed in the Arizona building, built long after the original building, but a long time ago. The hallways reminded me of a run-of-the-mill Marriott. The half-moon lights down the hallway doubled as dead bug receptacles. The room was spacious and the furniture and appointments okay, but not plush. It really reminded me of an apartment I lived in 20 years ago: hard plastic sink and bathtub, '80's style light switches, and double-mirrored closet doors that won't stay on their tracks. The carpet had stains as did some of the chairs. And the sliding glass door to the outside (no balcony, just iron bars), had a shabby afterthought night lock that looked like Uncle Bob slapped up. In this era of Spa Resorts, it seems like the emphasis is more on the spas and not so much on the facilities. (I had a similar impression of the Phoenician also.) Next time I go to Phoenix, I'll try the Ritz or Four Seasons (if they have locations in Phoenix).

<Content>Best Customer Service Have stayed here many times, and the customer service maintains its super high level. This is true across all types of employees from bellman to front desk to housekeepers. Food at the Biltmore is also quite good for a hotel...The grounds are kept up very well. Now they just need to freshen up the rooms a bit to match the grounds. Plastic sinks and shower inserts is kind of a surprise at such a high level resort. The prices for such a high level resort are surprisingly low as well.

<Content>Spectacularly at Peace at Arizona Biltmore Attended a 4-day conference here at the end of November. Gorgeous grounds, wonderful conference halls, very good conference food catered by the Biltmore, and a spectacular room! Have seen comments here that the rooms seem quite outdated so perhaps I was lucky, but my room was very up-to-date, very large (with a very nice, and very large, bathroom--separate tub and shower), and had a full balcony (third floor) with a beautiful view of the Biltmore grounds (and absolutely lovely view of the fall Arizona sunsets). None of my conference companions had any complaints about their rooms either (although none of them had as big of a room with a full balcony). Huge LCD TV with a large number of channels, including 2 HD channels (HBO and Showtime if I remember correctly), very comfortable bed. My only complaint about the resort is the exorbitant cost of eating there---even breakfast is outlandishly priced---and the main dining room, ridiculous. And the Resort is not really near any other places to eat (although, during the day, there is a free shuttle to a shopping mall with several semi-decent, not fancy places to eat---think the shuttle goes until 6 p.m.). But really, had one of the most relaxing times in a very long time and at one of the most beautiful venues I've ever stayed at. And the staff was very good and very competent----based on other reviews, that is apparently not always the case.

<Content>Beautiful weather, beautiful grounds, but... We arrived Tuesday of Thanksgiving weekend. Our room in the Paradise wing was adequate but nothing special. There was a communal balcony and the bathroom lacked counter space and certain amenities. Breakfast the first day was served cold. We spoke to the front desk about these dificiencies.I must say that on Wednesday, service improved even though the hotel became quite full. The grounds are magnificent, as well as the activities available. The pool was well kept and was enjoyed by many families and children.

<Content>A resort, get your wallet RECOMMENDED. An expensive resort, so fundamentally it was nice. I was there for a conf with 600 people with all food being provided. Service was nice throughout. Banquet food was a bit iffy, not bad, just not outstanding. Some food selections were just downright bad, which isn't acceptable, remove them from the menu if you can't do them well. Free internet access throughout was a bonus but it was slow slow slow. Purchasing food/spirits was very expensive. Rooms were well maintained and a service request was promptly handled. Bathroom well illuminated but small (I was in main building). While close to shopping, it's not walking distance, though a shuttle runs regularly. Like most resorts, you're landlocked. For a conference there were multiple buildings and it was a bit confusing. Overall, nothing bad, just there may be better choices for your own convention in the Phoenix area.

<Content>Special Place in Phoenix Stayed here with my wife for four days, for business and pleasure. This was my second time. Stayed on the 3rd storey of the Arizona Wing which was an improvement (lighter) on the ground floor of the Paradise Valley Wing where I stayed last time.Excellent service throughout our visit, nothing was too much trouble for the staff.The various swimming pools were great for my wife while I was away at work and the outside bar facing the lawn overlooking Sqaw Peek was a superb to meet for drinks later.We got a fall deal, paying $199/night + $25 resort charge which is excellent, but Mon-Thurs the price rises substantially, so plan your visit accordingly!Other 5 star resort options are The Phoenician (too big and too many Over-Achiever Conferences for our liking) and the Royal Palms (beautiful boutique resort, but big dollars). The Biltmore is somewhere in between the two in terms of size, but much better value than the others.Slight qualms: More cocktail waitresses would mean fewer delays for the martini parched in the early evening.Do not use the hotel phones for international calls! I made 5 or 6 on a previous trip and got billed a small fortune!! They graciously reduced the bill when I pointed out it would have been cheaper forme to buy a new cell phone for each 5 minute call. Highly recommended.

<Content>Charming This is a charming historic property with all the modern amenities. The rooms are quite spacious. The dining selections are wonderful with excellent service. Charming gardens surround the buildings and include a croquet lawn and large lawn-chess set. The hotel has an interesting history, of which they are very proud. The setting has a resort feel but is only minutes from many fine dining and shopping options.

<Content>Nice hotel with average rooms The hotel grounds are excellent but I was disappointed by the quality of the rooms. Although the room was large, it had little or no ambience and was in a wing of a hotel that seemed to be built as a significant afterthought in an effort to create more space to generate more rooms for conferences held nearby. Generally not impressed for a hotel of this calibre/price range.

<Content>Horrible place This hotel is overprice!!! To be honest is not worth spending the money. the food and all the is overprice and is not good. There is no coffee pot, the water cost 5 dollars for a little bottle. A glass of milk is 4 dollars. the staff is very rude and they don't know anything. the rooms are very small with no views. the pools are always closed when you want to go, or there is no towels. The only people who are helpful are the hispanics that work there.

<Content>Don't Stay Here- Too Many Mosquitos First off, Check in is a nightmare, then once I got to my room it had no view. OK so I went to the pool. It was closed. They have other pools FAR AWAY.I went their NO Towels. and then i got bit by 10 mosquitos. They said they do have a mosquito problem. IF you go to the pool you will be eaten up. They allow smoking by the pool which is also disgusting. it is managed by Hilton and that is exactly what you will expect. I would recommend the Hotel valley Ho, where i moved to a lot more. That hotel is very reasonably priced and no mosquitos

<Content>A desert classic! We (me, wife, 6-year old daughter) stayed at the Biltmore the nights of July 6-7. I grew up in Phoenix and have always known the Biltmore by reputation; however, my only experience with the facility had been several nice meals at the restaurant at the Biltmore's golf courses.I booked the room through Hilton's web site and got a $116 per night rate (plus resort fee and tax). We got to Phoenix quite early and called ahead to get an early check-in (11:30 when check-in time isn't until 4:00). The front desk emplooyee who answered the phone was extremely courteous and accomodating. When we got to the hotel the valet staff was courteous and helpful (although we self-parked).At the front desk I was told that I had requested a king bed (this is in my HiltonHHonors profile). When I pointed out that I was traveling with my daughter the front desk person immediately looked for a different room. She quickly found one for me. I further pointed out that I planned to self-park, then she said the room she had was far from self-parking so she would try again. She then said, I have a very nice room for you but it only has one king bed. She made it very clear that it was an exceptional room and that I would like it. I took her advice.I stayed in the Saguaro Villas - what an nice room. This is a full-blown suite: 20-foot ceiling, enormous patio, floor to ceiling windows looking north to the mountains, fireplace in the living room, full kitchen, large bedroom, walk-in closet, etc. The VIllas are owned by other people and Hilton manages them when they are in the rental pool. The Saguaro villas have a small, but beautiful, pool if you don't want to be in the large pool area.My only complaint with the room (and this is minor) is that it is dated and needs to be refurbished. The maid service was very efficient.Spending time at a Phoenix-area resort in the summer is quite popular with the locals and the Biltmore is no exception. By 9:00 a.m. all of the shady spots (with umbrellas) had already been claimed at the big pool. Of course, there were no people at these spots - just their stuff. During the day the large pool was a giant party. A wide variety of people having their own fun - singles, couples, families, young and old. The swim-up bar is nice and the prices are in-line with what you should expect at a resort (and actually cheaper than what you'll pay at many of them).The resort fee entitles you to use the spa, which is a nice use of the $25. At most resorts the fee lets you use the gym but the spa is an extra charge (or completely off-limits unless you purchase a treatment). I worked out both mornings and it was nice to finish the session in the spa lounge with some fresh fruit and fresh-squeezed orange juice.My gripes with the Biltmore are minor. First, I think the hotel needs to do a better job of embracing the desert. There is way too much grass on the property - this is irresponsible from a water usage perspective and in the summer the brown areas look horrible. Second, the decorative brick with the distinctive art-deco design is in need of repair. Throughout the exterior of the hotel the brick is cracking or has fallen off the wall and been poorly replaced. We had breakfast the first morning in the restaurant and found it to be incredibly mediocre. The pancakes were as dry as the desert.Will I be going back? Probably not. Why not? Because the Phoenix area has so many wonderful places to stay and I want to try them all! But I highly recommend the Biltmore!

<Content>Scorpion in room, rude staff Overall our stay was great until the last night when we found a scorpion in our room. Hotel sent an exterminator who harassed us about making such a big deal out of the scorpion. Next morning at the checkout desk I overheard the maintenance man, manager and 2 other employees making fun of the incident and our reaction. Not the type of service you would expect from a resort hotel such as this.

<Content>Not for individuals I stayed as a last minute decision over New Year's Eve. It is a great resort hotel, set in wonderful grounds. However it is very much a group hotel and not for individual travellers. The resort certainly has a lot of choice, with good restaurants, bars, health/spa, shops etc... The trouble is that everywhere you go, you encounter large groupings of people - so queuing is the norm.The rooms are spacious and well planned - bathrooms have a seperate shower, which is a plus. The staff are friendly and efficient.I would thoroughly recommend for conventions, associations, reunions, incentives etc.... Individuals will get lost in the crowd and should avoid at all costs.

<Content>Lovely hotel, Perfect for a corporate retreat I stayed at the Biltmore in December for a business conference. I think most of these trip advisor reviews are very accurate... it is a beautiful hotel with fabulous grounds and architecture, but the rooms need a renovation. My room was a very nice size (overlooking the pool) but the furnishings/decorations were generic and a little outdated. The hotel restaurant was excellent, and I enjoyed sitting around the pool area. For a spa destination like Phoenix/Scottsdale, the fitness center and spa amenities were not impressive. There are many business travelers who stay at this hotel, and it is the perfect place for a conference; however, I wouldn't want to use my own money to vacation here unless I found a great rate or if they renovate the rooms.

<Content>A great getaway in Phoenix! I was planning a big 30th birthday party and wanted to go to a spa resort in Phoenix. My mom wanted to go to the Arizona Biltmore, as she had been there a few times before and loved it. I booked the hotel and got a pretty good rate with my AAA membership. I was apprehensive about going to the hotel after reading the bad reviews here, but my friends, family and I had a great time! First of all, I don't know why people are saying the rooms where bad. We stayed in a resort King, and it was really nice. Nice bed, big bathroom and everything was clean and comfortable. It didn't seem outdated to me at all. My family's rooms where even better than mine! The hotel is divided into cottages and different room buildings, and our building had its own little pool which was quiet and nice. The hotel was pretty crazy, as we went Memorial Day Weekend and there were two or more weddings taking place, but I thought it was really fun. The large pool is a mob scene and people come and stake out pool chairs at around 7 am! If you come after 8 am, forget about finding pool chairs. It's a fun pool with a swim up bar and a water slide. My friends and family and I decided to hang out at another pool- the Arizona pool- on our first day. It was smaller and more mellow, but it had a bar next to it and was quite nice. They even had a barbeque going and we all had great burgers, chicken  fish. When my husband picked up the tab, we were amazed at how cheap it was! The total bill for our lunch for eight was under $80.The hotel also has a lot of fun activities for kids, and great extras that make it fun for all ages. On Friday night we went and had s'mores by the fire pit. They had an amazing setup of s'more stuff, lemonade, cider, and popcorn, and even had a cowboy come and sing some songs for the kids. This was a totally free event, and really fun. There is also a movie night by the pool, which we missed, and croquet, a putting green, and a large checkers/chess board by the pool.All eight of us also went to the spa for massages and hot stone pedicures and one facial. We all tried different types of massage, and everyone had a good experience. It's not the fanciest spa and in a town of great spas I'm sure it's not the best one, but it was clean, there were great drinks and snacks, and all of us enjoyed our experience there.The other issue that someone mentioned is parking. There are two self parking lots when you pull up to the hotel. One is to the right, and closer to the lobby, and the other is a parking garage that is a bit farther to the left. We found parking in the close lot a few times, despite it being a busy weekend, and the other times we parked in the garage. Yes, it was a little farther away, but certainly not a mile, and not a big deal.I think my only complaint would be about the resort charges which are $20-$25 per day, but other than that I had a great time at this hotel, and I would certainly go there again!

<Content>Hated the place The Arizona Biltmore was extremely disappointing. The rooms were old, probably last upgraded in the 1980s. The furniture was broken, and didn't look very different from a low-end motel. Second gripe was on the billing -- they charged me for valet parking ($24 per day) when I self parked ($8) with a mile long walk, charged me for minibar expenses which I never used, charged me fictitious expenses at the gift shop. After I called and got the charges revoked, they charged me $10 for delivering the revised bill. Go figure !!!!The hotel conceirge packed us off to a restaurant which was closed, so we had to return to the hotel for food. The menu listed the pasta as angel hair with fresh roma tomatoes, parsley, olive oil and garlic. It was the worst thing on earth -- boiled pasta with some sun dried tomatoes thrown in. The burger we ordered came without fries  without ketchup. Absolute yuk for $60.Never understood the exorbitant fees they tagged on for everything. All in all, the romantic weekend with 2 breakfasts  1 lunch cost $1000. I would say it was worth a third of that.Yeah, the hotel grounds are pretty, but just about everything else sucked. Honestly, if I could give this place 0 stars I would.

<Content>Service Is Lacking I was disappointed with the service at this hotel that holds itself out as the favorite of celebrities and US Presidents. I got to the hotel at 3:00 pm and it took 45 minutes for my room to be prepared by housekeeping. The only offer the front desk staff made to get me into a room immediately was a room of lower value, but not to one of upgraded status. When I did get to my room, I placed an order with room service at 3:55 pm. I was told that my order could not be placed until 4 pm since I was ordering items off the dinner portion of the room service menu. I told the guy that 4 pm was 5 minutes away, and he told me there was nothing he could do. For a hotel holding itself out as an elite destination, they did not provide an elite level of service. One additional caveat, the rooms are small (I was in a deluxe king room in the main building), and at night I could clearly hear conversations in the next room as well as outside on the patio two stories below. I have stayed at the Royal Palms and the Phoenician, I would recommend them over this location.

<Content>Beautiful Architecture  but that's all I am a conference planner and recently held a conference for over 1,000 people at the Arizona Biltmore. My experiences, and that of my attendees was not wonderful.Service is lacking in all areas. The waits to get served at restaurants is not acceptable, the food is mediocore, and incredibly overpriced. It's obvious that they are understaffed and the staff that is working is not well trained.Hotel check-in was spotty. My largest problem was incorrect information being given to my attendees. When attendees tried to resolve problems with their bills at the front desk, the staff was unwilling to assist. The rooms are not nice. They look like something from the 80s -- and a true five star resort would have updated them twice since then. Even if they can't afford to update everything, it wouldn't hurt to update the soft goods.The spa was incredibly average and overpriced. The ambiance was nothing special -- certainly not I what would expect for the price of the services. Other problems -- missed and late wake-up calls and broken equipment in rooms.

<Content>Beautiful architecture  Like many landmarks, the Biltmore is an experience you should enjoy once, then decide whether it merits a return stay.The main buildings are 鈥淔rank Lloyd Wright influenced鈥?designs (built in the late 20's, but Wright is not the architect of record - although he was associated with the project), the grounds are stunning and maintained meticulously, and the surrounding views are spectacular.I found desk, concierge, restaurant and poolside service alternately harried and aloof. My sense was that line staff were too few and lacked proper training, while managers were generally indifferent to routine operations and most interested in cashing in on added-charge, personalized service opportunities.Event and guest self-parking (traveler beware - this is an extra charge NOT noted when reservations are made!) is atrocious - long distances to lobby, meeting and lodging areas. The shuttle is too infrequent for the territory it has to cover. Vehicular traffic in the lobby and meeting areas is heavy at times, and pedestrian areas are not well marked nor protected. I chose not to entrust my vehicle to the valets after watching another guest's car being used to bulldoze speed bumps and potholes en route to the (very conveniently located) valet lot.Standard rooms are smallish for a resort setting and furnishings (also FLW-type craftsman designs) look dated, with visible wear and neglect. Ditto the bath plumbing and appointments - the sense is high-dollar, but aging. Beds were comfortable, with proper pillows and comforters, but the luxury effect was ruined by cheap, thin sheets.In-room dining is Holiday Inn standard, not resort-style by any means, with standard plastic trays littering the corridors. Our family ordered pizzas; they were expensive, soggy and delivered in the standard cardboard box. Used service items were not removed promptly (actually, not removed at all prior to our departure)!We settled our account at checkout, then were surprised with a late charge to our credit card for mini-fridge items we did not use. It took three phone calls to reach someone in the accounts department with authority to remove the charge - and this was done grudgingly and with implied disbelief.This is a beautiful, elegant but aging resort property trading on location, its 鈥漌right-influenced鈥?architecture, and a reputation for service it may have deserved at one time, but does not merit now. While the facades and public facilities may be timeless, time has passed the Biltmore by in terms of service and amenities.

<Content>Beautiful grounds, so-so room We truly enjoyed our stay at the Biltmore. The main hotel building is beautiful, and the grounds were breath-taking (literally, too, as they were scented with orange blossoms). The main pools did get very crowded during the day, but the two smaller pools weren't bad, and all were deserted by 6pm. We had a private soak in the hot tub and the giant pool entirely to ourselves at 9pm. (and it was in the 90s that week, so it can't have been the weather!) Food and drink are very pricey, but no more so than at other resorts of this caliber.The only bad thing we could say was that our room itself was dated and not up to the rest of the grounds. It was spacious and very clean--we probably wouldn't have even thought it so-so if the rest of the hotel weren't so magnificent!

<Content>Really Disappointed The resort grounds are really beautiful, the rooms were spacious, and the weather was gorgeous during our stay, but that's about the best thing I can say about our experience at the Biltmore. For a hotel property of this caliber and at this price point, I really had much higher expectations for the service that we would receive. The hotel seemed to be extremely understaffed as we noticed the same servers working full shifts at the pool and then also at the property's restaurants and lounges at night. Service was terribly slow at all of the restaurants, we waited more than 30 minutes for our waiter to bring us our check one night. On another occassion, our server brought us our drinks and when we gave her exact change (including tip), she exclaimed you guys are my favorite customers because now I don't have to come back and check on you. We sat outside at this lounge for 5 more hours that night and she never did come back and ask us if we wanted another drink. That experience pretty much sums up our whole stay. I have paid 1/3 the cost at other hotels and gotten far better service than I got at the Biltmore. In my opinion, this property is definitely not worth the money. I would return to this hotel only if the room rate was under $200/night.

<Content>had a wonderful time, but you do need to be aware of a few things The property is beautiful, and extremely well maintained. all of the employees were very helpful. We stayed in the paradise wing. room was ok, nothing that i haven't seen before. the things to be aware of are the pricing of items such as drinks (cokes) is typical resort pricing. the main pool area fills up very quickly, making it almost impossible to find a spot to sit. so prepare to get by the pool early. other than that, it was a nice stay.

<Content>Beautiful Biltmore -- Fabulous History, Location, and Style Wow! The AZ Biltmore has certainly received mixed reviews. I humbly state that I am a serious world travelor and have stayed in many of the grand resorts of the world. In my humble opinion, the Arizona Biltmore is worth a stay! The hotel is unique with history that no other Arizona property can match. Sure the formal Four Season's or Ritz staff may be more proper and perfect ... is that what you want? I enjoyed the Biltmore for it's unique location, history, and FLR style. This is a hotel that does not look like a cookie cutter product of an upscale chain (ie Ritz, Four Season's, etc.). I want a hotel that is unique to Arizona, not one that could be dropped in any city and look just at home.I agree that the room price is high. But seriously, the prices are high at any fabulous luxury hotel with location, location, location during peak season. Respectfully, I do have a point of comparison. I've stayed at the Phoenician (It's beautiful, but typical decor of any upscale hotel in the world), I've stayed at Camelback Inn (desert scape beautiful and quiet but not as grand as the lush Biltmore) and have visited many more of the Phoenix/Scottsdale area resorts. To me, the Biltmore grounds, pools, and room (I stayed in the main building with a mountain view) were very comfortable and nice. And, the bed was just as good as any Heavenly Bed.To me staying at the Biltmore was a special experience. Walking around Bilmore Estate Drive and viewing the lovely muli-million dollor homes was fun, hiking up to mountain top historic Wrigley Mansion was stunning (however in need of some repair), and soaking in the Arizona sun instead of Chicago Winter.... priceless.Good luck with your decision. No matter where you stay, if you get typical Arizona weather -- be grateful you can afford to travel and enjoy your stay.

<Content>5-star service and architecture, 3-star room The Biltmore is stunning in its architecture and grounds and a fantastic place to plop down in Phoenix during the spring. If you're a fan of mid-century modern, you'll love exploring. Be sure to peek into the conference room spaces, some with soaring gold peaked ceilings - truly unique in design. I encountered true 5-star service from all staff during my stay, including a charming houseman who greeted me in English and then, when I asked for directions to the spa, provided me precise information - in Spanish! Because of his friendly body language and gestures, I was able to infer where to go and when I confirmed it with him (Oh, across the pool...I see!) he smiled and said Yes sir! This kind of interaction is sooooo much better than the typical eyes-down, mumbling no englais response one might receive at other properties.As others have noted, the Biltmore is a bit pretentious when it comes to pricing. Even in the gift shop, a 12-oz. can of soda fetches $2.50 - God knows what it is from the minibar. The Biltmore's biggest opportunity for improvement is in the room itself. Once inside it's as if you're suddenly transported to a typical Marriott in a city center location. Large armoires hold a smallish 20-inch tube TV; if they'd banish the armoire and install a proper 42 flat screen, they'd gain substantial psychological space in the rooms. The rooms aren't tiny, but they're below 21st century standards for space. Bathrooms are somewhat cramped, but at least the tub/shower combo is a roomy six-plus-footer so even men can lie fully in the water if they choose. Rainshower heads help when taking a shower. Only a single sink but a wide vanity and an extra full-length shelf above help store toiletries over a multi-night stay. Closets are ample and lighted by opening the door automatically. Beds are new Serta mattresses in the same quality range as the Westin Heavenly Bed, and they include a substantial down topper (removable if too hot during the summer). However, the Biltmore ruins the effect by using cheap 60/40 blend sheets instead of the all-cotton sheets virtually every 5-star property uses these days.Furniture in the rooms is somewhat dated, with a craftsman style but worn and de-laminating tops on many surfaces. Decor is very desert-style but lacks color - too much beige/brown/terra cotta, not any bold color to break up the palette, even in the artwork or accent pillows. Despite the build date of 1929 (or perhaps BECAUSE of it), the room was quiet - and I was in the main building above the lobby. If in the main building, third floor, odd numbers will provide a reasonable view.In-room dining also falls far below a 5-star standard. No roll-in cart here - it's delivered on an uninspired tray with the single indulgence being a fresh-cut whole flower and long stem adorning the side. I ordered a pizza; it came in a delivery cardboard box. 5-star properties that get this right deliver on a silver platter with cover. For its central location and local history, the Biltmore is a hotel you should stay in at least once. You'll have to decide after that if it's worth returning.

<Content>Great Facilities/Disorganized for the business traveler The outdoor facilities and grounds are great. Make sure not to book a room in the terrace wing as the rooms and pool there are upscale Motel 6. The business center is a mess organizationally: My office confirmed a Federal Express via tracking # that a Federal Express box was delivered to me at the Arizona Biltmore at 10:35 AM. At noon I was still on the phone with the shipping office trying to locate the box. This after 5 previous conversations with the front desk, business office, manager's office (who, interestingly advised that this could be Federal Express' fault as they sometimes mark in their truck that that they have made a delivery when in fact they have not). Finally, at 12:05 PM, the truly helpful Jennifer in the shipping office advised that the Federal Express had been located and that it in fact was delivered at 10:35 AM. Unacceptable processing for a property that touts itself as confererence center and business hotel.

<Content>Disappointed This review is relative to price and expectations. This hotel was probably very good at one time. However, I believe they are still living in the past. The facilities were OK but the service was certainly subpar. Most of the staff would not make eye contact or speak to you. Part of the problem was that many of them could not speak english. Some of them bordered on being rude but they may have been just shy. Everything was overpriced. You got the feeling that they thought they could charge whatever they wanted because they were The Biltmore. They nickeled and dimed you on about everything. They charged an annoying $16.00 per day resort fee. Their valet was $24.00 per day and sometimes, when you would call for your car, they would tell you that they could not get it in advance. It was first come, first served when you got there. What a joke! I have stayed at some of the finest hotels in the world and this is certainly not one of them even tho they might think so. I stayed at much better resorts for a lot less. I am sure Phoenix has much better to offer than this place. Don't be fooled by their past reputation.

<Content>Great service, bad bed My husband and I were there for a conference in January. Gorgeous property with lovely clean room. Service was excellent; everyone was very friendly and tried their best to accomodate our needs - some mix-ups with housekeeping due to language barrier - but all confusion was fixed with cheerful follow-up. The pools and grounds were lovely. Only serious complaint was much-too-soft beds. Both my husband and I and our colleagues at the conference got serious backaches as a result. I ended up sleeping on the floor! Ridiculous for such a high-end hotel. I only hope they invest in some more firm, substantial mattresses. It's hard to function without a good night's sleep!

<Author>Critical_But_Fair
<Content>The Negative Reviews are Correct The ONLY reason to stay at this resort is if you love Frank Lloyd-Wright-INSPIRED architecture (he was merely a consultant to the architecht-of-record). Admittedly, the main building's exterior and interior are stunning and worth seeing, even if you are not an architecture buff. It is probably one of the most beautiful hotel lobbies in the world.However, once you get past the main public areas, everything changes for the very worse. The rooms are not a good value (conference rate is $300) and, more importantly for me, the service is erratic and mostly well below average. My wife and I stayed at this resort for four nights, which gave us time to get to know a number of the staff, particularly those working in the lobby area. They are generally very good people, but I believe they (and, consequently, the guests) are victims of horrible service training. Too many times I had to call a manager over or begin to make a scene before I would receive the service you deserve at a self-proclaimed high-end hotel.For example, most nights it was nearly impossible to find a server on patio areas near the fire pits. Once, I went inside to the bar and asked a server for assistance. She told me that the patio was not her area and that she could not help me. I found the chief bartender and told him about my exchange. He apologized and took my drink order. Later, the server came outside and offered help; she then explained that she had been trained not to take over another server's area. I doubt very much you would ever have a Four Seasons or Ritz employee say No to a simple and reasonable request.Upon check-in, I was informed that I did not have a reservation for my first night, despite having the email confirmation with the correct dates with me. The front desk clerk was unimpressed when I showed him the email (he didn't even look at it). He commented that the hotel was full and that I may have to come back the next day. Only after I told him that it was his obligation to comply with my reservation did he offer me a suite at a discounted price.The suite was large, but, as another reviewer commented, it was appointed like an Embassy Suites. Also, my wife and I could hear every noise and tidbit of conversation coming from the closed off adjoining room (and they could hear us, too).Several ordinary requests from housekeeping went unfulfilled.I ordered some snacks and a small bottle of vermouth (retail price in Ohio is $6) from room service. When the employee finally arrived, the bill indicated that the vermouth was $75! I refused the bottle, but the employee explained that I would first have to talk to the manager. I refused to do so and sent the server away with the bottle.You get the drift. Beautiful hotel. Lousy service (more accurately: very poor training by Hilton, the manager). I will never recommend someone stay here, but it is worth a visit just to look around.

<Content>Mixed review This is truly a historic hotel and a must see for anyone visiting Phoenix. However, we found the hotel to be stuffy and pretentious, and never felt truly comfortable there. The rooms are only average, and the staff were not friendly. It's also very expensive. I guess it's great that we can say we stayed there, but it's a better place to stop by and see rather than stay.

<Content>really average hotel We recently stayed at this hotel for combination business and leisure. It was our second stay at the Biltmore and all in all it was very average and not worth the premium rates they charge. the hotel's decor is a little dated but the grounds, especially at night, are beautiful. The outside fire pits are great on cool nights. The interior of the rooms was tired. Good bed, nice flat screen tv but the chairs, desk, carpet etc are worn and need a little updating. Bathroom was small and drafty. $20 per day for internet and gym/spa was ok . Gym was adequate. Room service food was bad! Hospitality items in room were way over priced - $5 for a small bottle of water!! Biltmore Grill was good and the waitress (Rebecca) was excellent. Front desk staff was ambivalent at best. When we asked for directions within the hotel (which is sprawling) the concierge was not helpful and he acted like he was doing me a BIG favor. Front door staff seemed more interested in chatting among themselves than assisting us with luggage and directions. Executive cars were available, but $15 for a 1 mile ride to the mall was excessive. Meeting rooms were newer and good though food was less than average. You can get the best of this hotel by stopping by at sunset for a drink and a stroll on the grounds. Otherwise if you are being charged for a 5 star experience it is not worth it.

<Content>It was Great! We just returned from a lovely stay at the Arizona Biltmore. The property is beautiful. Anyone who is a fan of art deco decor will be totally smitten with this hotel. The public areas are fantastic. Our room, though one of the least expensive, was very spacious with a very large bathroom. We found the pools to be lovely and clean. We ate at both the cafe and one of the casual restaurants and both had very accomodating service and good food with prices typical of an upscale hotel. There are many planned activities going on at the hotel such as smores by the fire and makeup make overs for teens which we thought were very fun. We are looking forward to returning to this fabulous hotel.

<Content>NOT a five star hotel--no way NOT a five star by any stretch of the imagination. A two or three at most. Overpriced to the nth degree. Do NOT believe good reviews about this place, really truly. I can't imagine why anybody would stay here at these prices. I am used to five star places and love that level of service. When in Phoenix, stay anywhere but here.PROS: The golf course was ok. The architecture of the main building is really interesting, especially at night. Worth a trip if your'e into that.However... The service on the links was awful. The architecture is not Frank Lloyd Wright, however. It's just inspried by him. Worse yet, everything except the lobby and the main common areas have been gutted beyond recognition, like by the worst common denominator 70s Hilton type mediocrity. The pools are nice, but badly updated. Even the rooms have tacky arts and crafts knock off fake furniture you'd see at an Embassy Suites. So if you want to stay here for the architecture, forget it. Stop by and have a drink at the bar, walk around for ten minutes, but stay somewhere else. They took the soul out of this 1929 resort. Having said that, if only the Four Seasons or somebody would restore it to look original 1929 and take over management, it could be a special place, like the many upscale mid-century places in Palm Srings.CONS: During my stay, a partial list: They mow the lawn at 7:30 am with really loud mowers. The tv stations didn't work. No internet in the room, and the business center charged $40 per hour!! EVERYTHING is overpriced as to be a joke!! The porno cost $15 per movie. Sheesh! The honor bar was higway robbery: The teeny little water bottle was $5. This is the desert for heaven's sake--no complimentary water?? The teeny little half coke bottle was $5.50. The thing of cashews, all 23 of them, cost $11. There are flourescent lights in the rooms. I love the environment and all, but flourescent lighting is the worst cheapskate thing in a nice hotel. The gifts shops had tacky tacky 1980 preppie stuff. The food was HORRIFIC. At the Grill, at the Wrights dining room--it's as if the cook saw a picture of a fancy restaurant in NYC or San Francisco, and made the food look like the picture, but the tastes are truly gruesome. Bad tomatoes, broken recipes. The shrimp was yellow, the fish and chips frozen. The staff do not respect the do not distirb signs--we're talking three or four knocks late at night kind of thing. The staff is rather ignorant--they mean well, but they don't have the hotel to back it up.This is really not a good place to spend money. The list of activities is a joke, and everything costs a fortune to do it.

<Content>Can't wait to return. This property is superb! This was our second visit, and the reservations department had our file up and our preferences in place.I do wish that there was an additional place to eat breakfast or dinner on the grounds. The lines were longer than I expected, even with reservations.

<Content>Bilkmore The property itself is beautiful and well maintained. The service is another thing altogether. The fridges are well stocked, but don't dare move anything out of the fridge, even if you have no intention on consuming it. You'll be charged an arm and a leg.Mysterious extra charges have appeared on credit cards from numerous people in my group of several hundred that stayed there for a convention this past summer. The hotel was most unhelpful to rectify the situation. Months later, more charges mysteriously appear without explanation.Don't waste your time and money at this place. It's the BilKmore!

<Content>Horrific, overrated hotel! I was disappointed with this hotel from the second I walked onto the property, then things progressed from bad to horrible. First, check-in was excruciatingly slow and though the reception employee was pleasant, she didn't seem to know what she was doing. I'd say we waited a full 10 minutes before she found us a room. When she showed us where the room was on a map, it looked really far away. When I asked for one closer, she said none was available, but she said that to compensate for the distance, she had given up one of the special, luxury rooms. She whispered that this room goes for $1,000.00 a night - HA! - what a joke that turned out to be. We had to walk outside to get to the room - as it did not connect with the main building. It was over 100 degrees outside and no bell hops were available to help us with our numerous suitcases. We were both sweating by the time - 15-20 minutes later - we got to the room. And the room was a joke - tiny, with poor decor. There was no way it was worth 1K per night let only $100. So, we trudged back to the reception desk, and I explained our dissatisfaction, esp. with the distance - and lo and behold - a room was suddenly available. It was still a bit of a walk, but manageable. The nightmare started on the second day when we discovered - very late at night - that our closet was flooded. All our clothes - those on the shelves and on the hangers were soaked. This was at midnight. The manager said he'd send someone to pick up our clothes and get them dried. I explained that my husband didn't have any clothes left at all since all of his had been in the closet. When we got our laundry back, several items were missing. I advised the front desk, and then a manager, who said he'd follow up and get back to me within 30 minutes. An hour later, I went to the front desk to see him, and he was chatting and joking with an employee. He hadn't even begun to do anything. I checked back another hour later, and he said he didn't know what had happened, but that he'd have the laundry manager call us in the morning. He explained that the manager got in at 6a.m. I advised him to NOT call our room before 9am. I even wrote a note to this effect to leave with the laundry manager. Well, guess what, we were awakened at 6:00 am. I was so furious. He had not found our clothes - he called just to tell me that they were still missing. In the end, our clothes were not recovered, and with no explanation as to why.On top of all this, everything was ridiculously overpriced. A can (not even a bottle) of Coke was $3.50., a stick of deodorant was $8.00. Room service was extortionate and the food at the deli and restaurant (another restaurant was closed for the duration of our stay) was mediocre at best. The service at the bar was very slow. The staff generally seemed inexperienced.The worst was the billing. Our bill at check-out was twice what it should have been. We had to delay our departure getting that settled. Much worse than that, many others in our group found excess, unexplained charges on their credit card bill - a dozen reported they were billed for additional amounts as recenlty as last week - almost 5 months after our stay! So, overall - one of the worst hotel stays I've ever had. I would not go there again if it were free!

<Content>Great Hotel, as you would expect Stayed at the Biltomore as part of a conference. The service was excellent; from bellmen to front desk, to consierge, etc., etc. Tried the spa, and found the quality to be excellent and prices/value better than I expected. At first I was put into a room with a very noisy airconditioner, but was quickly moved to another room which was fine. Consierge was especially helpful with anything we needed. Overall, I was expecting great service and that is what I got.

<Content>Frank Lloyd Wright Heaven Our second trip to the Arizona Biltmore was even better than the first. We went in 2005 for two nights after traveling throughout the southwest. This year (2006) was for seven nights. Although not designed by Wright (as some think), his influence as consultant pervades the entire complex. Numerous pools, a variety of lodging options, and fabulous restaurant (Wright's) makes for a great stay.

<Content>Historic Resort This is a very classic and historic hotel, one of a kind. The grounds are beautiful, every president since Herbert Hoover has stayed here as well as many of the celeb's from the 40's, 50's and 60's. It is worth staying here just to be a part of that history. However, simple things like not having a coffee maker in your room can be annoying, especially for the price you are paying.

<Content>4 Star Grounds, 1-3 Star Service Arriving at the Arizona Biltmore gives you a sense of what a 5-star resort must have been like for movie stars and millionaires during the early part of the last century.You can tell that the place definitely had its moments of elite history, and while it may have truly been one of the most glamourous hotels back then, it shows its age in both good and bad ways.It's as if, as another reviewer noted, that management can't decide if it wants to embrace its past or evolve into some vision of a Las Vegas resort future. The lobby area is truly lovely, cozy and inviting, if a little schizo. There's clearly Asian influences, southwestern influences and, oddly enough, a sense of pacific northwest lodges here. That's the interior... the outside is a different story. The iconic element of this resort are the building tiles that cover everything (and I mean everything) all rendered in glorious greenish concrete. The property loves to drop Frank Lloyd Wright's name, and I can see the influence. That is, if FLW designed a hospital. It's very institutional and the buildings just look a bit like a very well maintained sanitarium from the 1920's.Luckily, the interior of my room was a different story. Very, very spacious and well-appointed. A few small gripes:- The desk chairs are not well padded. Sitting on them for more than 10 minutes will cause you some pain.- Their attempt at copying the dream beds of other hotels is merely a very large mattress topper placed on a cheap mattress and covered with very nice linens, which another reviewer noticed as well- The in-room safe uses a key. Get with it... time for an update.As for the grounds, if you can get past the concrete you'll notice how well maintained they are. Truly beautiful. I saw no notice of the mosquitos, cloudy pools and trash that other reviews make notice of. Simply put, they were immaculate.The service varied widely. Check-in and check out were efficient and everything they should be. However, once I got to my room a staff member was in the room making what appeared to be personal phone calls. She politely excused herself when I seemed to startle her upon pushing open the door.The bakery/cafe staff was indifferent and seemed bothered by having to serve patrons. The laundry service caused me some grief. I called very early and informed them I had some laundry to send out for same day return (promised back by 6pm). Come 6pm, no laundry. At 6:30, a call to housekeeping/laundry was met with a typical we'll check on it response. At 7:15 still no laundry, and a 2nd call got the the same we'll check on it and call you back response. At 8pm, a call to the manager on duty had my laundry to me within 10 minutes, delivered by a staff member who was clearly annoyed that I wasn't about to offer up a tip after waiting 2 hours for overdue laundry.Housekeeping also came very late-- in my case after 4pm.Dinner at Wright's was amazing. Our server, Wesley, gave nothing short of perfect service and made sure we had everything we needed without asking for it. His, and the somalier's, recommendations made for a truly esquisite experience. Highly recommended.One more note for the staff in charge of assigning meeting space: you really should have better sense than to book a rousing political rally next to a roomful of folks trying to concentrate on research presentations. Oil and water.

<Content>First Class all the way.... This was a nice place to stay. It has nice houses around it as you drive up to the hotel. The front desk people were very friendly and helpful. Parking isn't close to main entrance if you don't choose to valet, but it was survivable. The lobby is huge and lots to see. There was a pianist playing as we walked in. Lots and lots of people at happy hour this particular night, which is located in the lobby. There was construction going on so maybe that's why they were all congregated in the lobby. The room was nice. It was a large room and bathroom. The eminities were nice in the bathroom. A service staff member brought bottled water to our room. The pillows and bed were to die for. So comfortable and makes for good sleeping. They have a magnifying mirror in the bathroom that is great! We went down to the pool and it was awesome. They have a slide for the kids that is amazing. Lots of different pools to suit anyones needs. I got this hotel from promotion from a Phoenix radio station and I'm so glad I did. I would definatly come back!

<Content>Wanted to stay longer! What a stunning property! I may be biased being an architect but it was certainly a thrill staying in a hotel Frank Lloyd Wright had a hand in.Everything lived up to expectations from the excellent and faultless check-in (helpful, gracious and willing staff) to the delightful, probably recently refurbished room we had in the Paradise Wing. It was very tastefully designed with some good period touches to keep the history and atmosphere alive. The bathroom was totally state of the art with a massive drencher shower head in the shower and quality toilteries from the Bitlmore Spa. The other public areas of the hotel were also beautifully designed and kept and the spirit of the original design was totally intact.We over looked the Paradise pool which was close to being just that! There was no noise, just a refined atmosphere - maybe the time of year?We dined in Wrights which had recently reopened after being smartly refurbished. This was a little disappointing in that the service was slow (but friendly and with a certain charm). The food was actually very good - went it arrived and at the correct temperature. My main course was tepid and was sent back. Must have caused a stir because not only did I get a fresh dish at the right temperature, but it was on the house as were any deserts of our choice. So in the end it turned out fine and they did go out of there way to rectify this shortcoming - could have been a different story.We also did valet parking which was going to be more convenient than self parking and it was and with excellent service. The outstanding reception staff also checked us in on line and printed our bording passes for our flight home the next day.

<Content>At best: OK The restaurant food was very good, the housekeeping staff was friendly and polite, and the masseuse was also friendly and I left my treatment satisfied and relaxed. The room decor was tasteful and the bed quite comfortable. But, given the Biltmore name, I was disappointed by the perfunctory service I saw at the front desk and from the spa staff. I expected consistent, superior service and I didn't see it. The major complaint was when I was unexpectedly billed for bellman services that I didn't use and the comment was let me explain why we have this charge. But, there were other areas where I saw a lack of attention to detail:a) Definitely the mosquitoes. I would expect that most visitors would not expect mosquitoes in the desert. Despite that, the hotel manager response was something along the lines of the property ground ponds are breeding areas for the mosquitoes. On top of this, when there is a late afternoon/early evening lawn event, you'd think the hotel would have the forethought to provide repellent (esp if mosquitofish cannot survive the desert heat).b) In the spa, I asked the attendant if there were any hair bands. The response was that they were out. How is it that a spa at a Biltmore property could be out of hair bands?c) The ability to hear one another within the conference room was dreadful due to the air conditioner drone.d) Broadband access from within the room. The tech support person was efficient and knowledgeable. I liked that the resort fee covered the broadband access. But, you have got to be kidding that the only two outlets by the desk are both in use (thus, I unplugged the wrong appliance which resulted in the phone call to the tech support person).I truly cannot recommend this hotel if the goal is a restful, pampered stay at a top notch establishment.

<Content>The Phoenician is way better We stayed at the Biltmore over July 4th weekend. It was nice, but I was expecting it to be better considering it was a 5 star hotel. The room was very nice- we were in the Villa's and they did upgrade us since it was not very crowded. I just thought the pool area would have been better and the drink/food service was really slow. The last time we were in the area we stayed at the Phoenician and I will go back there again over the Biltmore.

<Content>nice hotel We had a beautiful room, very big, with a comfortable bed and a huge bathroom, But this is an old hotel, dated. I found it not very clean, the carpets were dirty and also the restaurant was like that (and food was not so good...). I didn't like all that cement, gray walls. Anyway, people working there were nice, we arrived late at night but they allowed us to have dinner even if the restaurant was already closed, and they gave us a lot of information: very nice and polite.I think it is a good hotel if you have children (the pool is very big), but it is too much expensive for the quality of the building.

<Content>Underwhelmed I just got back from a two night stay at the Biltmore where we stayed because of a business conference. It was OK but frankly, I am not a fan of the Frank Lloyd Wright look and feel. The outside of the hotel looked like a Junior College and the inside reminded me of the Luxor in Vegas. I arrived late in the evening and had a heck of a time just finding the elevators which were in a corner of the lobby and blended in with the rest of the concrete. Our room was on the second floor directly over the lobby where at all times of the day, people congregate on the couches and chairs, both inside and outside. From my room, I could hear people loudly talking and laughing from both sides of my room (with our door over the indoor lobby and our windows over the outdoor patio). Since I had to be up early the next morning, I called the front desk around midnight to have the people on the outside patio moved or perhaps quieted down since they were quite loud. Unfortunately, no one at the front desk bothered to answer the phone. The room itself was nice, although very small. It barely had enough room to fit the full size bed, which was very comfortable. Out of our window was a spectacular view of the parking lot. The bathroom was nothing to write home about, however, I did love the shampoo and lotion which smelled really good! Our door looked like it had been kicked open before, as the paint around the door was peeling badly and the frame was barely hanging on for dear life. One of my business colleagues was unable to get into her room one night, as the lock ceased to work and no one in the hotel could figure out how to get it open for several hours. The food was quite good (catered dinner one night) and both times the room service order came fast and was 100% accurate. Beware of hidden charges on your bill as we were charged for a bellman gratuity (we didn't use one) and also a housekeeping gratuity (we would have left one ourselves anyway, but I have never had it added to my bill before??) Overall, I didn't appreciate the theme and decor, however my husband thought it was very cool, so it's definitely a matter of different strokes for different folks. Certainly not the kind of place or service I would expect from a so-called 5 star hotel.

<Content>Magnificent Sisters Weekend At the Biltmore We just returned home from our 3 nights at the Biltmore. This resort exceeded all our expectations from the staff to the grounds. Just beautiful manicured grounds, extremely friendly and accomedating from the hotel staff to the store merchants and resturants. We stayed in a Premier room located at the Paradise Pool. This pool is amazing. The Biltmore is very close to shopping and resturants. The only thing we would change for our next trip is two additional days to enjoy the the resorts many activities they offer. The dive in movie at the Paradise Pool looked to be so much fun. We were only able to enjoy it from our room as we were getting ready for the evening. The bedding was absolutely incredible. I will be ordering their pillows today. The rollaway bed was rated excellent by my sister. This trip was a shopping vacation. We all decided our next trip to the Biltmore will include more resort time.

<Content>beautiful and understated I recently stayed at the Arizona Biltmore and disagree with most of the recent reviews. I found the property beautifully laid out and the architecture stunning. The buildings meld in well with the surrounding landscape and are not the cookie cutter type you find at most resorts. The main pool area, while crowded, was well maintained and the water was a nice temperature and very clean. I had a nice lunch in both the cafe and the grill and room service was efficient and polite. The cab service offered by the hotel was expensive but worth it with nicely maintained, air conditioned cars with no wait. The front desk and the concierge could not have been more professional or polite.

<Content>A fading resort past its prime I have read the recent reviews from disappointed guests, but most of them focus on situations that were particular to their staty (e.g. the front desk messed up with their reservation, etc.)My disappointment is more about the actual hotel itself. I was expecting a beautiful, world class resort, but this was a shabby property that at one time may have been nice, but now is just worn out and tired. Everywhere I looked were signs of delayed maintenance. The overall look of the hotel is of an institutional compound with cement grey walls. There was nothing beautiful about it. The carpets were dirty, the landscaping in poor condition, the swimming pools were murky and cloudy, the pool side furniture faded, worn out, rusting.It was sad walking through the grounds and seeing areas where children are supposed to play ping pong, or on playgrounds, but there was overflowing garbage cans right there ruining any nice effect. At the spa, the showers had mildew growing in them, the towels were worn out and faded, and it had an overall cheap quality about it...not luxurious in the least.Parking is very poorly designed. There is only one self-parking lot at one end of the huge complex, and to get to my room I had to drag my luggage through back alley ways full of garbage and junk. The main restaurant is closed for renovations, so I ate at the casual cafe, where cocktails were $12. What a joke! All the food in this place is double or triple what it should be. I would expect this in some opulent, beautiful resort, but not this place.It was a HUGE disappointment. I would not recommend this place, especially for a special, romantic getaway. You will be VERY disappointed.

<Content>Ruined my vacation Please believe what some others have said- this is a terrible hotel. I chose to go here mostly because of reputation, so I ignored other people's bad experience. There is no way this place is even close to a 5-star property!! Let's start at the beginning-1- I spent extra money to book a room with a mountain or garden view,  was to be credited $50/day towards food/booze. I was really looking forward to eating at Wright's, and relaxing at the swim-up bar2- We checked in, and were told valet parking is $21/day, or we can self-park for $7. We chose self-parking, and I wouldn't have minded paying the $7 if the parking was right near my room- it was not. It was a few blocks away, which is a good hike in this heat.3- We checked in around 7:30 pm, and the first room they gave us had no windows, no view, no patio and the A/C didn't work.They moved us to a similar room that at least had a sliding glass door and working A/C, but still no garden or mountain view- I had a view of the back of some shrubs. (By the way, we stayed in the cottages- my husband said it felt more like a cave).4- The carpet was stained, some of the tiles in the bathroom were broken and cracked. The bed was obviously too hard because they put a pillow-top on it, which kept sliding off the side of the bed, with me on it. I had a terrible night's sleep, and the TV doesn't even have HBO! 5- The pools- this was probably the worst part of our stay. The pools were filthy- I mean, really nasty. The water was green and cloudy and greasy-looking. It was so hot I went in anyway. As I was swimming I pulled my hand out of the water, and there were long black hairs wrapped around it (NOT MINE!!)6- The service at the pool bar was rude. My husband ordered a Michelob Ultra, and the girl who took his order disappeared for about 4-5 minutes, then came back and said Umm, we are out of a lot of things. They have Michelob Ultra at the bar inside. I suppose I could go get one for you if you really want me to. What kind of 5-star service is this??? For the $6 they charge for a beer, did she want ME to go get it myself??7- Went to make reservations for dinner at Wright's and found out it was closed for renovations. Of course, this is not posted on their website, and I was not informed of this when I checked in.I could go on and on, and I will tell everyone I know to NEVER stay here. What a waste of money and time. I could've stayed at the Phoenician or the Four Seasons or any true luxury resort for the money I wasted here.

<Content>Terrible hotel! Even the hotel is rated 4 starts, really not deserve it. We got there 10:00am, they didn't have our room ready til 4:00pm. When our luggeges were delived to the front desk from airport, they didn't call me. When I called the front desk, they claimed they didn't received anything until I went to the frond desk and found my luggages. And also be aware of extra charges for parking fee $7 per day and $22 for cleaning room fee. This cleaning room fee was found on my credit card 2 weeks after I left the hotel. It was never showed on the hotel bill. You can find much better deal and services on other hotels.

<Content>Okay but not fantastic! After checking the price for several upscale hotels in Phoenix / Scottsdale, we decided to stay at the Biltmore.Overall our trip was pleasant and the discounted summer rate made it much more reasonable. But for a top of the line hotel, there were a little too many inconsistencies for me to want to return again.For example, at check in, we were helped by a very warm an dwelcoming gentleman. When we requested a late check out, the women at the front desk seemd unhappy and did not smile at all. The rooms were also a bit dissapointing. When our requested room (a king smoking) was not available, we were offered a double smoking with apatio. We were happy to take the upgrade but if we had paid for this we would have been VERY dissapointed. For one there was no privacy as you can walk from balcony to balcony. Also, our corner balcony was totally covered by trees and there was absolutely no view from it.The inconsistencies countinued into the quality of the property too. Though the main pool area was clean, it was WAY too crowded. The 2nd largest pool area was a much better choice and it offered a child pool and an adult pool in apeaceful setting. When we ventured out too see the smaller pools, we came across some slimey pools without any towels. They were NOT worth the search.The biggest rip off was the food. We ate there several times since we did not have a car and it was NOT worth the price. Don't eat there unless you HAVE too.Overally, we had fun but I wouldn't necessarily recoomend this hotel unless you are looking for the cheapest of the top star hotels, the others are all booked or you get a fantastic deal.

<Content>Nice hotel overall The Arizona Biltmore is a beautiful hotel. We enjoyed our room, but did not like paying $10 for internet access. Basically, if you stay here, except to pay for everything, including $6 for a bottle of water. Also, we had to walk far to our room and in the summer heat, it was difficult.Otherwise, the hotel has a wide variety of activities, including a few pools, a great spa, restaurants, etc. We enjoyed our stay, and would most likely stay here again!

<Content>Great Time at the Biltmore My 11 year old and I were accompanying my husband for a conference there. Since they had overbooked, we were upgraded to a suite overlooking the golf course. The accomodations were fantastic: huge living room with full kitchen (to prepare our own breakfast), fireplace, big bedroom, walk-in closet and a gigantic private patio. My daughter's favorite part of the hotel was the pool with its 70ft slide that she must have gone on a few hundred times. On the week-end they used the pool as a movie theatre showing kids' movies on a screen between 2 palm trees, the seats replaced by floaties. During the week end, the hotel also made smores for the guests. A cowboy was singing by the firepit. Other free attractions included wine tasting and cigar rolling. Contrarily to the previous review the staff was very friendly and we never had any problems with housekeeping. The food at the restaurant was pricy but this is to be expected for a hotel of this class, however it was also very good. The hotel is close to a very nice mall (Meiman Marcus...) and some very nice restaurants. We particularly enjoyed Sam's Cafe for its great food, very reasonable prices and friendly service. We would go back without any hesitations to the Arizona Biltmore.

<Content>Bad,Bad and Nice We left the Biltmore early the service was beyond bad. My children and I wanted a mini vacation so we booked a room for a week 6/24-7/1. The room (399. a night) was lovely a kitchen and living area with a hug bathroom and king size bed over looking the golf course. The problems started with the maid service after having no cream for my coffee on our first morning I wrote a note with tip for the maid to leave cream. I received only two packages of cream. The whole week I was without shampoo and Toilet paper at times and forever out of cream for my coffee. Nothing was being restocked in my room. The mantence department was called every day water coming from dishwasher to toilet over flow. The Spa employees are inexsperienced I had the worst massage ever.They made a big deal about my teenagers having a massage without me in the room even though they had on bathing suit's which ruined my daughter b-day since she chosed not to have a spa day.( We have booked her into a kids spa at our local resort back home.)My teenagers where with me when I booked the spa day their is no mistake they are under 18 no one told us the parent present rule nor 24 hour cancilation. I would have had to spend all day in the spa with my kids. My kids would be the first one from the room if some one started touching them threw there bathing suits they have had massages since they were 9 yrs old at kids spa in resorts all over the world. The next was the room service, 22% service charge means you get a tray put on the table and the waiter leaves for you to set up. No glass or ice for the soda's and the pizza where always under cooked. The food was terrible the Wright dining room was closed so we went to the Grill. the food was like it was reheated and dried out and small portions. The service at the pool was hit or miss. Twice they plain forgot to place our order just like the Cafe we ate at once. I called the manager twice and no responce my husband called from our home and got right threw. The manager called me and offered a free night I declined I just wanted to leave. He offered a VIP treatment where someone comes after the maid to make sure you have everything you need like shampoo or TP. I asked why do I have to join a travel club to get special treatment. I'm not asking for special treatment just what I paid for. The staff needs to learn to great people and work on service. I will not go back I travel to resort all over the world and this is the worst service and food I have ever had. It seems from the reviews that if you are not their for a convention the exsperience is poor.

<Content>Great Hotel, Can't Say the Same for the Clientele This was my second stay at the AZ Biltmore; the first was in 2002 with a convention, where I could expense everything and not feel the hole burning in my wallet. Ah!A system screw-up and a very lovely and accommodating front desk clerk (Tiffany) scored my mother and I an upgrade to a private cottage, with an obscenely comfy bed. Privacy became the key to our enjoyment of our weekend stay, as much of the clientele was of the spring break variety. Loud, obnoxious kids, teenagers and young adults made the Paradise (main) pool the one to avoid. Instead, mother and I found respite at the Fountain Pool behind it, and not far from the spa, where we got some (pricey) pampering. Yep, the extra charges others have griped about are pretty absurd; room service is expectedly high-priced, but add on the delivery charge (um, how else do you *get* room service but by delivery?), service charge and tip, and a large pot of coffee (two cups apiece) cost over $20. Sheesh.Without doubt, the most memorable aspect of the trip was our exquisite meal at Wright's, on our last night. I am a chef, I've dined in dozens of countries, and it was surely one of the top five meals I've eaten. Impeccable service too. I quite like the Biltmore and have a hard time blaming the hotel for its patrons (there are so many rooms, so they must book A LOT of groups, conventions, schools, etc.), but I'm not sure I'll return again... except to eat!

<Content>Overall a Good Experience, there are a few 'buts' My Mother, Husband, and son traveled to Phoenix for hubby's conference. We stayed at the Biltmore for 4 nights. Overall we enjoyed the Biltmore. The grounds are fabulous, the swimmings pools are easy to access... and the large pool has everything you could want in a luxury resort. The staff was very helpful and attentive, and the food was excellent. Unlike some of the other reviews, we didn't find the self-parking to be disruptive. It was fairly easy to find a spot and the walk wasn't bad if you cut through the side courtyards.The buts are the following:1. There was a lot of daytime construction stone work going on during our visit. This created a ton of dust in a major walkway that was hard to avoid.2. The food is expensive, but at least it is good.3. My husband found a scorpion in the bottom of our closet when he picked his pants up from the floor. He flushed it down the toilet. It was the only one we saw, but it did give me the heebee-geebees.

<Content>Maybe once, but not now We recently spent five days at this hotel, and it did not impress us enough to return. Having stayed at three other similarly rated hotels in Phoenix on prior trips, this fared as average. First room was very small and ordinary and smelled of chemical cleaners. When asked about upgrade, were told hotel was pretty much sold out (not accurate) and were offered the only available accomodations which were $400 PER night more! Upon further checking (oh, yes - here's something), we ended up in a somewhat nicer room for which we had to pay $150 more. Not wanting to spend all our time at the desk and moving, we settled for this option. The signature restaurant, Wrights, was a disappointment. Steak was tough and portions sparse. The less expensive Biltmore Grill provided us with better meals and very nice wait staff although eating outside involved shooing away the scavenging birds. The spa was very expensive and treatment was nothing special although the staff was exceptionally pleasant. Housekeeping woke us at 8:30am on a Sunday morning convincing us the Do Not Disturb sign was a necessity. Several guests wanted to play croquet after breakfast, but no one seemed available to provide the mallets, and they still were not available at noon. The people in the shops were delightful especially the women's clothing store. The grounds crew was working very hard, and it showed as the flora and fauna is lovely. The smaller pool areas were relaxing, and the large pool catered to the bar and children crowd: not such a great combination. I think in 1929 this may have been a grand dame, but we felt it many ways it was relying on it's reputation from that era rather than living up to today's higher standards for expensive hotels. Frank Lloyd Wright admirers will enjoy his influence, but the architecture is not reason enough for us to return at these prices.

<Content>Lovely, lovely, lovely My girlfiends and I spent one night at the Biltmore on Memorial Day weekend after days spent hiking in Sedona. What a wonderful place to get cleaned up! The buildings and landscaping is beautiful! We had a resort room with a balcony which overlooked the small parking lot in the rear but also the lovely Camel Mountains. Our room was clean and the bathroom was huge enough to handle three women, no problem. The beds are luscious, pillow top, down everything, crisp clean sheets. We headed to the Paradise Pool, there are eight pools on the property, as well as hot tubs. Knowing the history of the hotel I had visions of Old Hollywood Glamour. Unfortunately the Paradise Pool was more like Spring Break, very crowded, loud rock music playing and a bunch of TVs playing in the private cabanas that open up to the pool area. There is a bar a water slide. We hit the water slide and then headed over to the more serene Catlina Pool, that provided more of what I had expected. For dinner we checked in with the Concierge to ask about Southwest food in the area. HIs response was almost robotic and the directions to the restaraunt were already printed out on cards. We felt that the Hotel was probably getting kickbacks from the place so we asked the Valet guys instead and they were able to recommend some local, authentic places. The Valet guys were helpfull and friendly, I recommend talking to them. When we returned from dinner we had the great pleasure of finding a complimentary s'mores buffet set up around a camp fire with large Adirondack Chairs. There were sticks provided for the raosting and also multiple beverages. It was magical, the Hotel and grounds look particularly gorgeousl at night. A movie was being shown to kids above the pool so they could float and watch. The historical tour is only available on certain days of the week. There is printed material available but it mostly just lists the owners. We enjoyed strolling around the building looking at al the old potographs and exploring the ballrooms.  We slept like babies and awoke to our ordered room service breakfast promptly delivered and hot. We ate on the balcony and watched the sunrise. On the way out I stopped at The Cafe to pick up some food for my flight home. The line tok a very long time. Other than the mild inconveniences everyone was friendly and the Biltmore provided activites and serentiy. And we didn't even try the spa! Some people there looked bored, maybe they go to places like that all the time...I was thrilled to be in a historical and beautiful setting. Go, go, go!

<Content>Loved the Biltmore! Arriving at the Biltmore was a relief after a night in another disasterous resort. THe Biltmore still has the old world charm of a real resort. You truly dont need to leave the property,as Pheonix itself is not much to write home about. I stayed in a golf view Villa room that was tastfully decorated, a very comfy bed and a great view of the cascading golf course.The main pool was a little crowded for my taste, but there are 8 pools on the grounds so there is a pool for everyone.Room service was speedy and actually delicious, (beef medallion quasidilla was the best!)There is plenty of shopping, a Lilly Pulitzer store, so I was in heaven, and a starbucks, 2x the price of a regular- non resort starbucks!All and all it was a great stay, and upon check out, booked my next trip for June.

<Content>Service on the decline Have stayed at the Biltmore several times over the past five years. I usually can't wait to return. This time the service was at an all time low. Room not ready upon arrival, did not get the requested room in main building, maid service arrived at 4:00-5:30 daily, had to request towels and toiletries more than once. There was a huge outdoor dinner dance on the main lawn Wednesday night. The band played literally outside my window all night. When asked why I wasn't told of this event at check in, I got a shrug and was told that the hotel was full so I could not be moved. I'd expect this level of noise in Vegas, but not on a weeknight at the Biltmore. I was there on business and was very inconvenienced by the noise. Finally, I never received the credit that was promised for my inconvenience. At check out I was told that someone would look into it for me. Also, the first day I was there they were hosting a hip-hop event for Scion and the guests were on cell phones at all times, interviews disturbed the guests having tea and the crowd used profanity like I've never heard.

<Content>Architecture Is Great, User-Centeredness is Low It's really hard to complain about the Biltmore in Pheonix. It really is lovely to live in such interesting architecture and in such lovely surroundings.Having just concluded 3 nights there for a business trip I do have one observation-- and for those of you familir with the the Prairie School you will know this.....the rooms are lovely but the balconies are useless. Each blacony is shared making it impossible to open the drapes and get dressed in the fresh air. Also, you can't sleep with the door open without risking someone walking into your room. Obviously it's hard to change the architecture but this is my one complaint. When I am in AZ I love the fresh air and a private balcony let's me enjoy my surroundings more. At the Biltmore you have to sleep with the AC on and the drapes closed. Ick!Ultimately I prefer the Fairmont SCottsdale Princess or the Phoenician. If you are going to spend this kind of money on a fancy room, you might as well be able to use the balcony more easily.

<Content>relaxation at the biltmore i recently visited the biltmore for the second time. we stayed in a classic room in the arizona wing. the room was spacious and clean. the bathroom was huge and the amenities were very nice. the beds were extremely comfortable, fluffy white duvets and pillows. we felt that the service was excellent. when we first arrived our room was ready, 4 hours before check in time. we had great service in all the restaurants and bars. we ate at the poolside restaurant and the biltmore grill for dinner and breakfast. we also visited the lounge each evening. the resort itself is very well maintained. the grounds are gorgeous- so many gardens with beautiful flowers.we used the spa and took part in some of the classes offered- the power walk and an upper body conditioning class. they charge $15 per class which is a little ridiculous since they also charge you $20/night resort fee. we hiked squaw peak on our own which is much better than paying $25/p.p. to do it with a guide from the resort. we felt that our spa treatments were just ok, nothing spectacular.all in all, i love this resort. i would go back every year if i could. it's a great place to relax in the sun and in a beautiful setting.

<Content>Watch out for scorpions- ouch I recently stayed at the Arizona Biltmore for my first time for my annual visit to Pheonix for the auctions. What a mistake... from inept check-in personnel who kept my credit-card, to an initial room where night lights and heating system didn't work and where a requested non-smoking building had cigarette smoke filling the room at 1am the story doesn't improve. The highlight of the stay was to get put in a new room on fourth floor and get bitten on my neck in bed at 2am by a SCORPION, or as they call it a critter no worse than a bee sting. Perhaps it came through the ventilation system I was told. Overall, no compensation, high price, second rate rooms. there are far superior hotels in Pheonix, do yourself a favor stay away from this place.

<Content>Enjoyed the Biltmore My husband and I just spent a week at the Biltmore, staying in room 3313 in the Valley Wing, a nice large, well kept room,overlooking a smaller pool, for a $265 convention rate.( The third floor rooms have no balconies.) We were prepared for the extra charges and all billing was correct. The hotel is an architectural delight - the grounds lovely - most of the staff are more than pleasant. I took the gratis architectural tour of the hotel and grounds and it was extremely well done, done by Nathan, the lead concierge and 13 year employee . ( I tipped him $10, but he did not have his hand out...) The front desk clerk felt a bit defensive when we registered, but calmed down when I was reasonable about room questions. Apparently many of the rooms are so different in size, ammendities, that it is probably a real set up for confusion/disappointment. It is also a very large hotel,( like sister property, Grand Waliea) so must need to have conventions to be profitable. We really loved the Wright's restaurant; grill and pool cafes were also good. Our maid did a great job, so I hope she got the extra we were charged each day.( I left more...) Attention to detail: our heat wasn't functioning and it was dealt with very quickly by two pleasant fellows. We were given a late check out at 2pm with no extra charges. They let us park our rented motorcycle in the valet lot. ( self parking is a a pain, as mentioned earlier by others) The carpeting in the room had a few spots, but it took me two days to notice...sheets, towels, robes were excellent and i loved the desert flower shampoo etc. Occasionally there was uncaring, lackluster service, but it was the exception, not the rule. (Phoenix has really low unemployment.)The pool outside our windown was pretty noisy one day with high energy team building stuff....so was glad I was not napping! Concierge staff were great - helping us get to the wonderous Barrio Cafe, Le Grande Orange Grocery, and Desert Botanical Garden. Also loved the area of the Biltmore - there were actually mature neighborhood trees being nurtured! All in all, the Biltmore made giant, overbuilding Phoenix a good place to visit. It's expensive, but then it is an iconic property with its Frank Lloyd Wright influences and interesting history.

<Content>Dodgy Service, and a ripp off!! i used the resort constantly for two months, practicing my golf, upon arrival all looks well and pretty, and manicured. But a negative things instantly grab your attention, Staff and there attitudes; smooth and cool, yeah maaaaan!, and Prices, just charging extra for EVERYTHING just because you are at a resort (and not a great one at that). EG a basket of balls (about 45) $10 dollars WHAT!! you can buy a range for that, Tips... people with there hands out everywhere, they grab you a buggie...tip pleasee, give yuor clubs a wipe with a manky old cloth...tip please (you get the picture) needless to say i did not tip them EVER for this, and i got a nice silent treatment everytime i used the facility. A MAJOR STAFF OVERHAUL IS NEEDED, and a reviwew of there general policies, mainly that of employing absolute idiots and greedy kids. I WILL NEVER TIP FOR THE SAKE OF IT, WHY DO THE USA FOLLOW THIS TERRIBLE GREEDY TRADITION!!

<Content>Beauty in the Desert Sun This is the third Christmas we spent at the Biltmore, but my first review.On this trip, my husband and I stayed in room 3115 from December 23 - 25, 2005. This was termed a Premier room and we had a special promotional rate of $299/night.We arrived at the Biltmore around 12:30pm, well before check-in time, to find our room ready and waiting. We were in the Valley Wing (built in 1979) which was immediately adjacent to the original, main building. Our room had a private porch area with 2 chairs, a table and a chaise longue. A hedgerow seperated us from the pool area (a lovely, smaller pool with Catalina tile, a fountain and a hot tub, more private than the large, main pool).The decor of the room was Craftsman in feel with some desert-color touches and leather and wood touches. Handsome, and plenty of storage for hanging and folded clothes.The King bed was very comfortable and the linens were soft. Bathroom products were present and accounted for, although nothing spectacular. The Biltmore Spa shampoo they provide smells great, though! The shower pressure was very strong and there is plenty of shelf space in the shower/bath to place razors, shave cream, toothpaste, etc., upon.Throughout our stay, the fireplaces were blazing in the public areas (even though it was sunny and 80 during the day, at night it got very chilly) and the holiday decorations were everywhere. This certainly added to the aesthetic charm of the place.We spent plenty of time by the very busy main pool. We enjoyed lunch on two ocassions at the poolside Cabana Cafe (thumbs up to the roasted peach and marinated shrimp salad and the spicy bloody Marys!) which, for two people, was in the $40 range. Waiters took care of bringing us pitchers of lemoned ice water and fresh towels...they were young guys, mostly, and not exactly heel-clicking perfect but sincere, efficient and friendly.Room service breakfast on Christmas morning was delivered at the stroke of the time we'd requested and was exactly as ordered (amazing how many places screw up scrambled egg WHITES and deliver the whole egg -- not the Biltmore, though!).We did not experience any of the hidden fees that some have complained of here -- everything was very clearly laid out on the forms at check-in and being very frequent travelers we are almost (almost...) used to the service/delivery/etc. fees that are tacked onto room service meals. We did not feel the prices for anything were out of line -- it costs $3 for a small bottle of club soda in the mini-bar and while it's no fun to pay that much, we've both stayed places where that price is easily doubled.The only complaint we had (if you can even call it that) is that this is the third Christmas visit we've made in 4 years and it would have been powerful to have heard a welcome back or even to have received a letter in the Fall asking if we planned to return.Although the resort is 75 years old and thus in some places shows cracks and crumbles (it's almost entirely made of formed concrete tiles, so no surprise there), at all times we both felt like we were in an incredibly special and unique place -- almost enchanted, with the ghosts of the famous people who preceded our stay all around us. The architecture, the friendly service, the happy families and couples as fellow guests, the sense that there was no other place on earth but here...all conspired to create a truly memorable holiday weekend for us.I can certainly say that we will return and hope to make a tradition of spending all our Christmases at this enchanted place.

<Content>Extra costs and things not included My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights, upon check in (after struggling to find anywhere that guides you where to park for registration, and eventually turning our keys over to valet to let them move it from where we temporarily parked), when we checked in we asked where to park and were told (in addition to room cost) valet is $21/night or onsite parking is $7/night IF you can find a spot, which our 2nd night we couldn't find a single spot in their small parking area (about 100 spots for about 800 rooms, you do the math) and ended up parking in the parking garage which is about a 10 minute walk from the room. Our room was in the Garden Villa and was a decent room. I wanted ice and read that ice could be delivered to our room (with service charge and tip no doubt). Before going to sleep my husband looked around for a coffee maker (is it just me or is a coffee maker pretty much standard in all hotel rooms these days?), he couldn't find one so he called the front desk and was told do you know how expensive those are sir? We can't supply them in all our rooms, they'd bring one to us for $12.00 service charge or we could order a pot room service in the morning for $12.00 + fees. So in the morning he went to the lobby to buy a coffee, Starbucks everywhere else would be $3.80 but here it was nearly $6.00 for one single cup. For the mark up I think they could afford coffee makers in the rooms. But oh well. The rooms were decent but no noise control at all and since we were near the main courtyard/fountain the people from the Holiday parties were filtering into the area at all hours of the night and it sounded like they were in the room with us. We could also hear people who were lost as the grounds were very confusing and very dark at night. On the morning of our check out we were presented with a bill that included a $150+ greens fee charge (we didn't golf!) and a charge from the mini bar, which we didn't use. This was cleared up and removed by the front desk, but still if we hand't checked it just would have gone our our credit card unnoticed. My review on the Biltmore is mixed, I'm glad we stayed there however I am 100% sure we won't return. If you are going to stay there, ask about charges ahead of time so you aren't surprised in the end. If you are a caffeine junkie and need your coffee first thing in the morning, be prepared to pay $$$. The hotel itself, the grounds, the pools and the gardens are beautiful, however, the staff was a little snippy and the hidden charges negated the beauty and turned us off from a return stay.

<Content>Need of Tender Loving care Recently stayed at the Biltmore for my boyfriend's corporate retreat. The grounds are very expansive and a little confusing. I actually got lost several time on the way to my hotel room or one of the amenities. I enjoyed the services, spa was fine, tennis was great (try Jas, she is the best instructor), golf course was great. However I was very disappointed with the rooms and service.Our first room was one of the original cottages. Little things were annoying, scuffed up walls, peeling paint on ceiling of the shower but the biggest problem we had was bugs. We had 2 big cockroaches and another unidentified bug in 2 days. Thre was a gap in door. We were moved to a new suite but found the wastebasket was still littered with dirty q-tips when we arrived. Since it wasn't my $$ (company was paying) I couldn't complain too much, but I would have been upset if i stayed here on my own dime. Esp since there were 9 conferences/groups meeting. All having big loud parties etc.

<Content>Watch out for room 1148 Every summer we spend time in Phoenix/Scottsdale area. We have enjoyed some of the most beautiful resorts at very reasonable prices. The Arizona Biltmore was a huge disappointment. The resort was about 1/2 full, yet they gave us a room that had to be the worst room in the place. Nothing worked. Since the airconditioner didn't work, we had to open the windows. We were up all night listening to people walking and talking. Because of the strange configuration of the room, there was no desk to set up the computer and do any work.I agree with all of those people who complain about being nickeled and dimed. Every time you turn around, you are being charged for something else.I enjoyed walking through the lobby and on the grounds, but I didn't have to stay here to do this.

<Content>Come see the architecture, but don't stay here The architecture is interesting, but for the $$ they charge, there are far better resorts. Try the Phoenician or the Princess.The atmosphere here is that of an oversized motel. The hallways of the buildings look and smell like a motel, the rooms could be in an upscale motel. Bathroom was ok, if you like wall-to-wall plastic. Furnishing was sparse in the room. Overall designm including light fixtures were poorly thought out. The bed was comfortable, however (but then again, even Four Points has a comfortable bed these days)The TV did not even have HBO or Showtime.They nickel and dime you for EVERYTHING here! The service is rude and indifferent.Frank Lloyd Wright must be turning over in his grave!

<Content>Best of the best in Phoenix! I have to say that our stay at the Biltmore was truly a wonderful experience! From the moment we walked through the front door till the moment we left, it was a delight for my family. The postings about it being a dreary place with bug problems is far from fact. The beautiful gardens (yes even in Aug!), the activities for the kids, the room and food were all top notch. The staff was all very attentive and every request we had was met in a matter of minutes. We travel quite a bit and stay in 4-5 star resorts each time and I say this is one of the best. Yes it is pricey, but no more than any other luxury resort. If the other postings were use to staying in places like that they wouldnt have an issue. We have already booked our reservation for next spring to spend Easter!

<Content>Big Disappointment I was anticipating my stay at what has been described as a world class resort and could not have been more disappointed. We asked for a non-smoking room but there were ashtrays in our room and the room smelled terrible. The hallway smelled worse. The air conditioning is old and noisy, we ended up having to turn it off to get some sleep. You have to call if you want turn down service - something I have never heard of at all of the hotels I have stayed at around the world. We called one night and they never even showed up. There were no wash cloths in the bathroom, there was mold in the bathtub grout and the light next to the bed did not work. The jets in the hot tub near the spa didn't work and all of the pools and hot tubs had unsightly cosmetic problems. Service at the pool bar is terrible. Service from the rest of the staff is almost non existant. I would imagine this resort will not continue to get the ratings it has enjoyed in the past.

<Content>Hotel Bilk-more My family and I stayed here a week ago for seven nights. While the expansive grounds are fine and the room was nice, we have issue with how expensive everything costs here. The resort seems to see its guests as $$$ only; at least it felt like this to us. We ended up renting a car to go outside the resort to eat as the few hotel restaurants are terribly costly and portions were very small; we also bought foodstuff and water from the groceries. Mind you these shops and restaurants are all of 5 minutes away from the resort--provided you have a car! If you stay in the resort you will have to pay alot for bottled water from the gift shop and if you want fresh fruit be prepared to pay $7 for a fruit plate or $28 for a fruit basket. If your family members or friends wish to contact you by phone there is no toll-free phone number to the Biltmore. They must dial directly.Also the hotel charges a daily grounds fee and they are also charging a housekeeping fee of $3/day in addition! I can understand a grounds fee as that includes maintenance of the grounds and the pool area, but to be charged a housekeeping fee on top of this is too much. If we wish to leave a tip for the housekeepers that should be our choice.As for the staff they are mostly pleasant except we heard complaints from our relatives who called that the receptionists sounded bored and bothered when having to transfer them to our room. For a world-class resort that's supposedly a celebrity hangout, one would think that the receptionists would sound enthusiastic about working here and trying to upkeep the high standards of such a resort.I am sure we will not return to the Arizona Biltmore (aka Bilk-more).

<Content>The good, the bad and the ugly Stayed at the Arizona Biltmore mid July 2005. My room was quite nice, the bed very comfortable and the room very spacious. The bathroom was very large with a huge double vanity and it was very well lit which is a bonus. I personally don't care for Frank Lloyd Wright buildings but all in all it is a lovely facility. It is VERY spread out and I'm glad I like to walk because I did a lot of that as I was attending a conference. The food, made is mass quanity for our conference, was actually very good. The MAJOR negative is that my credit card was stolen out of my room. I travel ALOT and have stayed in 2 stars through 6 stars and have never EVER had a problem with anything from a t-shirt to jewelry to money to credit cards being stolen. I was the only person ever in my room and I always had my purse with me. I had a credit card in a wallet with business cards that I had left near my briefcase and that is where it was taken from. Unfortunately it was one of those instances that I just didn't remember putting that credit card with the business cards or I certainly would have kept everything with me. Nearly $1600 was charged at the mall down the street before my credit card company put a stop to it. I will say the hotel security has been very responsive and willing to help with the investigation. Just FYI for future travelers, unfortunately I learned a lesson the very very hard way.

<Content>Very good experience! I stayed here for one night on business in early June 2005. My room was large, tastefully decorated and very comfortable. The bathroom was large, clean and had a great shower. I ordered a room service breakfast and it was delicious, although expensive after the delivery charges and gratuities.The fitness facility is first class, among the best I've encountered in 25 years of business travel. The staff members were friendly and very responsive.I understand that Frank Lloyd Wright designed the hotel and it really does have some distinct architectural touches. One thing you may want to consider, however, is that the rooms are in separate buildings and you may have a walk of anywhere from a few feet to a few hundred yards to reach your room.

<Content>Oh So Absolutely Wonderful!!! Stayed here in October 2002 ... wonderful experience. It was the first of what is now our annual Girlfriend Weekend/Trip. The AZ Biltmore set the bar high of what to expect from a reposrt / spa. We were upgraded to a suite ... very spacious. Staff was extremely nice and helpful. Upon arrival, we requested a refrigertor and DVD player (to watch Sex and the City DVDs in-between spa treatements) ... both delivered within minutes to our room. We visited the mall located approx 10 minutes from the resort ... the Congierge Desk told us to call them when we were ready to return and they would send transportation to pick us up.The SPA was sssoooo wonderful. I had 5-6 different treatments over the weekend and everyone I came in to contact with there was great.

<Content>FACELIFT NEEDED I had not stayed here before but had heard the hype. I was disappointed. I was here for a conference, so I was not on my own $$. This place needs a good refurbishment. Worn and dated furniture and linens. Bathrooms outdated. I appreciate vinatge and antiques, but this was dark and dreary--very 80's looking. This place was very hard to figure out where you are. You can get lost easily.Spa was nice. I was asked at the front desk BEFORE my massage how much I wanted to pay for gratuity on my massage that I had not yet even had. Actually, I don;t even think I was asked. I was told. I felt that was very tacky. I asked for a hair tie at the spa and they didn't even have a rubber band. Not very spa-like.I felt as if everyone had their hands out for tips. I do tip well, but I do not like to be forced. And to have to tip 5 people for putting my luggage in the car.Food for my function was amazing. They did a nice job. But I don't think my group was on much of a budget :)This place was nice, but does need some serious sprucing up. I am a regular at Royal Palms down the street. I would definately choose Royal Palms over this place any day.It is not the amazing resort I had expected.

<Content>Glad I Wasn't Paying For It My stay was on someone else's dime; I was here for a conference in April. Landscape is very appealing. Loved the chairs scattered about. The main pool is fair. It was difficult to find empty pool lounge chairs. Enjoyed the salsa-making demo in the pool area. The resort has many activities scheduled, but no one tells you about them! We found out about them on our last day there.. what a waste. I think the rooms are overpriced if they're in the high $200s per night. Don't bother eating at the bistro. The meal was mediocre, and the service was horrible. We stood at the door for more than 5 minutes before anyone greeted us, then we waited another 5 minutes before a table was cleaned (there were many dirty tables).

<Content>something missing in a Resort took mom after a cancer treatment to relax. I experienced alot of staff wanting to enter the room at random times during our stay. One was the day of our checkout at 9am while we were eating breakfast. The staff opened the door and wanted to know when we were going to checkout then left.I also realized when I got home that one of the sale robes that I got from dillards was not in my suitcase. I called the resort within 5 hours and was told by security that no one has checked into the room and they would look for the robe. they returned saying that it was not in lost and found or in the room when they checked.Every year mom and I go to local resorts in Arizona because of the discounts in the summer. I would have a very difficult time getting mom to go back to this place because of the inability to trust the staff. I believe this place to be very beautiful and it is, but this is a resort and my 75% $10.00 shower robe should not have been that much of a valuable item to not offer to replace; it still had the tags on it. (went and got another one the next day)should you give this place another chance....yes... since our stay in the summer of 2004 I understand that it is now under new management. Employee honesty is something earned with time and hard to find. If you stay here you will enjoy the events and some wonderful staff BUT make sure you keep an eye on your valuable and not so valuable things. And remember to take everything with you!!!

<Content>Nobody's perfect; even at top dollar It's a crying shame that this resort hasn't got its whole act together given the peerless architecture and setting. Some elements of their customer service put others into stark relief with their crass ineptitude e.g. we arrived and sat down for afternoon tea and were told you'll be waiting a long time before THAT table gets cleared. No hello, no how may I help you?. Tactless; not what you want to hear after a 300 mile drive. I thought it might have been a one off, sadly however, only half the employees were putting their customers first. On the upside, the main restaurant delivered memorable quality food, wine and service. Likewise the spa staff were attentive and courteous. Excellent for a day/evening visit, maybe for an overnight but you'll feel short changed with a longer stay.

<Content>A nice stay My sister and I just returned from a four-night stay at the Biltmore, April 13-16. Not being a huge Frank Lloyd Wright fan, I was somewhat anxious about our stay. There have been many reviews posted on this board, some bad, some good, so I will try to address those areas of concern as much as possible in this review. First of all, there were no scorpions or cockroaches, or any other scary insects, spiders, etc. The property is beautiful and extremely well-kept. The majority of the rooms seemed to center around one of the eight pools, we were in one of the Catalina villas. What I think was the main pool was quite large and had a small slide, although I don't remember ever seeing any children use it. This pool was very chilly, too cool to really enjoy for most people from some of the comments I heard. It had a bar with a swim-up area and there was also a nice area to dine for lunch by the bar where one would be comfortable in swimwear. ($10-15 price range). Our pool was much warmer and had palm trees and lots of chairs. There was a wading pool attatched for small children. Plenty of towels and chairs. Drink service was spotty at times. It was clean at all timesThe villa was nothing special, but certainly not shabby either. There was a small entryway with a closet and a chest, a good-sized bathroom with a large vanity and two sinks, perfect for my sister and I. The tub/shower was very basic with glass doors so as only one person could use the bathroom at a time in our situation. There were two queen beds, nice and comfy with feather pillows and nice furnishings, although I did notice some wear and tear on my spread. The nicest part of the room was a large balcony that overlooked our pool. BUT the downside was that it was a shared balcony with three other rooms, so you couldn't feel safe leaving the patio door open at night to listen to the lovely sound of the pool fountain at night, which we would have loved to do. If you were sitting at the table there was a sort of screen that made it more private, but if we would have had a large group next to us I could see it being a real problem. The ideal situation would be to book the whole set-up which seemed to consist of a large villa with two smaller rooms on either side, that way you would have the entire balcony to your group. I cannot imagine what the cost would be though! We ate at the Biltmore Grill on the patio one day for lunch which was nice. Not too pricey. We didn't have any other meals there during our stay as we spent the majority of our time sight-seeing, this being our first visit to the area. We didn't use many of the facilities but the exercise room looked really nice and well-equipped and was included in the cost of the room. I am pretty sure there was a $16.00 a day resort fee for all nights stayed.Valet parking was offered but we never used it. There was a fairly large self-parking area in back of our area of villas. It was a bit of a trek at times depending on where we found a spot but we used bellhops for our luggage so that was no problem. I think we may have been there at a fairly quiet time of the year so I couldn't say if there would be a problem if the property was booked. The location of the Biltmore seemed perfect for our first visit to Arizona-close to Scottsdale and the freeways to head up to Prescott and Sedona.Having read previous reviews and being a coffee drinker, I brought my own pot from home. It was no problem setting it up in the bathroom. There is a Starbucks on property if that is more to your liking. There is a well-equipped honor bar, pricey as always. We used room service the first night for a pizza, fast and OK. The price was listed as $16.00 but we didn't read the fine print about the $10.00 delivery add-on. OUCH. A daily paper was outside our door early each am and they gave us one while checking out without asking. There was a hairdryer and two nice robes to use, a limited selection of toilitries but they were replaced during our stay. Towels were always fresh and comfy. You need to call for ice but during the time the pool bar was open we could run down and ask for it with no problems.My only major complaint was with housekeeping. The first day we returned about 1pm from our travels to an unmade room. There wasn't a card to hang on the door asking for early service which wouldn't have been practical due to the layout of the rooms, I guess. I called housekeeping to inquire and they said all I needed to do was to request early cleaning which I then did, by 10:30 each am. The next day we were gone until after 6pm and the room was clean but the maid hadn't taken all of our dirty, obviously used glasses, etc. The following day we were out by the pool, returning at 11 to a dirty room, back again at 3:30 to a dirty room. By this time I had given up, the maid finally came at 4pm. I did say something to her and she did apologize but said no one had told her about our request for early cleaning. This is a huge pet-peeve of mine, but there is no point in letting it ruin my vacation...but it will figure in when making another reservation at a Phoenix property.To summarize, we had a wonderful time at the Biltmore. Our rate was probably about $225 per night, we booked air/hotel through Orbitz. The buildings themselves are pretty stark, with the architecture and all, but the grounds and plantings help soften that hard look of cement. The staff was pleasant and very helpful, excluding our housekeeping problems. But if we were to return to Phoenix I would try somewhere new if I could get as good of rate at another nice property. Hope this helps you in your search for a Phoenix resort.

<Content>Good for kids who love the pool We stayed here March 27th for several days. We have 2 boys, 5 and 7. I read many reviews via tripadvisor to try and decide what hotel would be the best. First let me say that this is an upscale hotel. Our goal was to find a hotel with several pools, in a great location. This hotel has 8 pools..1 main pool with a waterslide and swim up bar. All the chairs were taken before 7 a.m. every morning so we didn't use this pool. All the other pools are nice size with good size baby pools and less crowded. They provide the towels, waitresses come up every so often if you'd like something from the bar and the kids had a blast. The pools have fountains the kids can play in, basketball hoops, etc. The grounds are beautiful and well maintained. Keep in mind tennis, bikes, and anything else does cost and is not free. The room was fine...2 double beds, decent bathroom, but unlike some other hotels where you have 1 bed in one part of the room with a tv(where the kids can watch cartoons) and another where mom and dad can watch something different. The people were very helpful and nice. It is in Phoenix so to get to good restaurants or putt putt your going to want to go to Scottsdale Rd. which is about 15 min. drive. Overall our stay was great...I'd recommend this hotel if swimming and relaxing is your forte.

<Content>a mixed review having read previous reviews i was all geared up for scorpions and dreariness...well, i saw no scorpions and i think the dreariness referred to may be a lack of appreciation of frank lloyd wright. the architecture is gorgeous, the grounds are well maintained with beautiful fountains and flowers. this hotel is extremely family oriented. i think it would be a great place to bring small children (there were billions of 'em) and also great for teens...lots of other teenagers, large safe grounds to roam around in, as well as basketball, golf, etc. on the down side, the food was really bad and the service in the restaurant terrible. also, no coffee makers in the room so you have to go to starbucks for a $4 coffee... that is until i discovered free tea and coffee (and bagels, creamcheese, jelly on sat/sun) in the gym (a.m.) or in the salon (p.m).

<Content>A bit dreary Satyed at the Biltmore in Phoenix for a short stay with my husband in March 2005. My overall impression is that this resort needs some updating. The first room we were put in had a view of a wall and seemed like a basement room in a cheap Holiday Inn -- not really what we paid for as part of a $750/night spa/golf package that included a premium room with a view. The second room we were put in was much larger, but frankly (no pun intended -- Frank Lloyd Wright) was still dark and dreary. The furnishings were dark, upholstery was dingy. The bathroom had nowhere to hang a towel, and the shower had no place to set a bottle of shampoo, soap, etc... The shower drain was very slow, and the toilet ran constantly. The staff at the check-in desk seemed unpolished and a bit overwhelmed. The resort is HUGE and seemed to be filled with a lot of business groups. On a positive note, the grounds were very pretty, and there were lots of comfortable places to sit and relax and read a book. Unfortunately, there was no one around to serve a drink or snack -- in order to get a drink or something to eat, you had to be in one of the restaurants or on thr back terrace where seating is minimal at best! The restaurants were average. The spa was quite tired -- the waiting room in which you were placed to wait for your aesthetician/massage therapist was bright (in a bad way), uncomfortable, and had only a couple of magazines that were outdated and totally unappealing. The chairs were scratched/banged up and uncomfortable.My husband and I were on a spa/golf package, but somehow there were no tee-times for my husband. If the resort sells you a golf package, they should certailnly have a tee time for you?! I took a Pilates lesson three days in a row with two different instructors. A private session was $95.00 but both instructors joined me in the workout, so I didn't get any feedback or one-on-one instruction -- very lame. Wrapping up, I probably would not return to this resort. For a spa experience, I will try somewhere else.

<Content>One bad one in three weeks in USA I booked this place through expedia and when I arived there they wanted cash which made a bad start to this stay. The room was not what i call good, rather dirty carpets and a shoddy look to the rooms.The free breakfast was a dainish bun with coffee, def not what I expect from a USA hotel.More surprising was that the TV station had the Playboy chanel on which might upset these with children .To be honest I def would not book into this hotel again and rather spend a few extra buck on a decent place. Sorry guys

<Content>Exceeded my expectations I attended a conference a few months ago at the Arizona Biltmore and had the time of my life. Every chance I got, I was lying beside one of those gorgeous pools sipping a smoothie. Absolutely wonderful. The atmosphere at the Biltmore was so relaxing. The architecture was also a real treat. My room was gorgeous... really didn't need two sinks, a tub, AND a shower, but there you go. Only one not-so-good experience with staff... I was ordering a snack at the cafe (where you can eat-in at a table overlooking the main terrace, or you can buy snacks  sandwiches to go) and I was served by an asian lady who was pretty obnoxious. Not helpful at all. I think the only reason I noticed was because the rest of the staff were so nice. Overall, staff were very friendly  professional. I would definitely go back to the Biltmore... I've travelled a lot and I was quite impressed with the place. Only complaint: food portions at the restaurants were much too large (but as a Canadian I've learned that most American restaurants serve disgustingly huge portions, so this comment isn't really limited to the Biltmore).

<Content>Loved the Place I recently stayed at the Arizona Biltmore 12/4/04 - 12/8/08. This was the second time that I stayed at the Biltmore. This is one of my favorite resorts. I think that the hotel and the grounds are beautiful. I loved the Frank Lloyd Wright type architecture and the grounds were well-manicured. Yes, the grounds are a little confusing at first with the buildings sprawled around the property, but you get the hang of it really fast. The resort has a lot of comfortable areas where you can just sit and relax, maybe read a book of just people watch. The weather was lousy during this visit - 50 degrees and raining for four straight days - but the resort is comfortable enough so that you don't feel trapped in your room. They also run a shuttle to the Biltmore Fashion Park right outside of the hotel. Be warned that the shopping area is outdoors. The room was large and comfortable and nicely decorated. The bathroom had a double sink. The room may seem dated if you are not a fan of Frank Lloyd Wright, but the decor is appropriate to the theme. The pool area is great. The pools themselves are large and there is a water slide. Unfortunately, on this visit, the weather prevented anyone from using the pool. On my last visit, the pool area was quite crowded on the weekend when it was 100 degrees. However, there are othere pools around the resort that are not as crowded and much more quiet. I found the staff to be friendly and extremely helpful. The concierge was great with sightseeing suggestions and directions. I ate the cafe for lunch a couple of times and was able to order items that were not on the menu.Overall, I loved the resort and would definitely stay there again. A couple of minor negatives that I will mention. I thought that the spa area was small for a resort of that size. The locker room was small and the indoor whirlpool, sauna, and steam room all seemed cramped in too small of a space. Also, the resort will tack on several charges to your daily rate. There is an automatic $3.00 per day housekeeping charge and a one-time $10 bellman charge. Also, expect anything that you buy on the resort grounds to be twice the amount that you would pay outside.

<Content>Unacceptable Service I had stayed at the Ritz Carlton in Phoenix, and was somewhat disappointed by the dated decor. Hence, on my following visit to Phoenix, I decided to stay at the Arizona Biltmore. The property is pristine and tranquil, but the service cannot compare to that of Ritz Carlton by any means. My disappointment started at the front desk. A girl named Alexa assisted me. She appeared discontent and obnoxious. She didn't even bother to greet me even after I had greeted her. Moreover, she took an attitude with me. I called the manager from my room and commented on how the hotel of such caliber shouldn't have employees such as Alexa- especially at the front desk. The manager attempted to avert my attention by asking me about the room, but her response overall, was unsatisfactory.I thought that surely my encounter at the front desk was an anomaly, but realized later that the unacceptable to mediocre service dominated the hotel. The bartender at the swim-up bar located by the slides is probably the only one who should be working there.

<Content>Mixed bag all around We were lucky to get a good rate, because if we had payed the full price we would hve been very irritated. the main building is nice, and the food and pool were really wonderfull....esp the pool being open really late...I loved night swims! I did not have any spa treatments, so can't comment. OK, now for the bad part...the room was in one of the outer wings, and looked like it had not been redone since the 70's...saggy bed, orange carpet, etc. Maybe the rooms in the main lodge were nicer, but I don't know. Also, very spawled out and confusing to find your way to your room at night. Lots of lizards (not in room!). Kind of a strage place.

<Content>Never Again! Scorpion stings! Quite disappointed upon our arrival.....I should have done my research more thoroughly. The rooms, although spacious, were BROWN and DULL....Not like a spa resort should be in my opinion, but it's the Frank Lloyd Wright thing. The food was excellent, but our food and beverage bill after a 3.5 day stay was over $800, and we didn't drink much. On our second night, we were hanging out by the hot tub off the main pool, and my husband and I were BOTH stung by a scorpion.I'm pregnant and was nervous about the venom, and the manager just acted pretty nonchalant about the whole thing. It ruined our evening's plans, we had to order room service and not one person bothered to call the next morning to see if we were O.K.....Those stings affect not only the area you were stung, but your entire nervous system....hand movement, throat, vision, etc... I cried myself to sleep it hurt so bad. There should have been more lighting or at least signs warning us of the possibility. We're from St. Louis and didn't realize this would happen. Our entire trip was just a downer.

<Content>great spa! A friend and I booked a room for one evening. We both found the resort to be lovely. The grounds were amazing and the architecture stunning. Spa treatments were 1/2 off, it made a luxory a reality. I had services with Monique and she was wonderfull. I would say best brow wax in the valley. Overall I enjoyed myself, the only downside was the concierge was a bit uninformed. But the spa staff was really helpful.

<Content>Rude, unhelpful staff Worst travel experience of my life. Totally unhelpful staff. All had hand out. No parking unless valet service used. Public parking 1/2 mile from lodge. Could not get to room from parking area (security fence in the way - walking around would be 2+ miles) Repacked car - demanded refund and left.Overpriced, with rude unhelpful staff.
