<Content>Good and cheap hotel Stayed at Shinjuku Prince from 21 November to 25 November 2008 with my family on a short visit to Tokyo. Location wise it is good as it is near a lot of shops and eating places. Rooms are small but rather functional and clean. No cable though and at night the rooms were a bit stuffy.One big inconvenience is the Narita Limousine Bus does not stop at the hotel so you end up lugging your luggage from the Shinjuku Station to the hotel a good 10 to 15 minutes away!Breakfast was reasonable though not great... all in all... quite good value for the price you pay...plus in Tokyo you won't be staying cooped up in your room anyway.....'

<Content>Mini Me On business in Tokyo. Stayed here two years ago. Back then it was really poor. The rooms were very small (yes we are in Tokyo) but more importantly, the deco was very poor. Looks like something out of a 60's Ikea catalogue!! Even the TV set resembled one that looked exactly like my granddad's!!Moving forward to 2008. Well, the exterior and lobby is still the same, a 60 - 70's look. But the rooms were all renovated. New carpets to corridors. Rooms and bath were nice and new, with flatscreen TV and safe (yes there wasn't one in the old one). Great location too. But the rooms are still small. the Bathtub still more like a bath sink rather than tub. The wardrobe was, well, kind of like a see-through wardrobe.Any average hotel, however, you can't knock the fact that they put some money into the renovation and to be honest, the rooms are quite cool. I hope they start on their lobby area soon.Oh staff were friendly too!

<Content>Ideal Location Located a short walk away from the very busy Shinjuku station, the Prince is an ideal place to base yourself whilst exploring Tokyo.The Fuga piano bar is a great unexpected bonus of the hotel,situated on the top floor it commands fantastic views over Shinjuku and is well worth a visit.

<Content>A box, but a great one Yes, it is a box but what a great box it is. The location of the hotel is excellent - right in the centre of Shinjuku, a few minutes from the station. We were in Tokyo for a long weekend - the subway makes it easy to get around but you also have the bonus of sights being on your doorsteps and places to go at night. The rooms were small but clean, staff were friendly and spoke English. If you want luxury, go and pay three times as much in west shinjuku, otherwise this is a good bet.

<Content>Generally good value The location is generally excellent, but the Narita Airport limosine bus does NOT stop at the hotel. It stops at Shinjuku train station, about a ten minute walk. So if you have luggage, you'll have to take a taxi. If you don't have much luggage, the train to Shinjuku or the AIrport limosine bus will be about equally convenient. The room was a bit on the small side, but clean and everything worked. Nice electronic bidet toilet. Staff were friendly. I got a good internet special rate that included breakfast, which was a nice sized western-style buffet. I joined the Prince Hotel's club on their website, which gave me a late checkout til 5 pm, at no extra charge. Membership was free. THere are lots of 24 hours convenience stores nearby, and the great 24 hour Don Quixote store nearby. There are a few subway lines close by, but if you exit at Shinjuku station, it could take you 1/2 hour to figure out which exit to take, as the signs are poor. Lots of great restaurants, some inexpensive nearby.

<Content>Excellent Location This hotel is in an excellent location which is my main priority when booking a hotel as you spend little time in the room to start with. On your doorstep is the fabulous Shinjuku area which is buzzing at all times of the night and has hundreds of restaraunts, bars and department stores. The JR train station is located across the street and the subway directly below the hotel itself so travel around Tokyo is very easy. The room itself is small but spotless. The staff very helpful. The only drawback is that there are only 3 computers available with internet access. If your here on business take a laptop.

<Content>This is Tokyo... I don't know what western folk expect, Shinjuku Prince is avg. size rooms for a business grade hotel in Japan. The new rooms are nice, very very clean, I like the contemporary look. Bed was comfortable and the loo had the obligatory seat warmer. As for prices, well I paid 129 USD per night incl breakfast (sgl). Anyone can get that rate right now on Prince's site - and believe me that is reasonable for what I got. The railway lines nearby didn't make any discernible noise and the earthquake (rated 2 on Japan's scale) was a teeny tremor too when I was there.The staff were lovely! The bellhops frequently went to their PC and got me maps, translated Japanese info into English... They, like most hotels here ship bags to Narita and other locations for 20 bucks or so, I love that feature in Japan. It's about 6 bucks to cab from the hotel to JR Shinjuku station's 'New South Exit' which makes it easy to get to Narita Express train (NEX) if you don't have them deliver your bags. This hotel is built above the Seibu Shinjuku rail station, it's prob 10 mins walk max from JR's East exit - look for the Kabuki-cho exit by Studio Alta and then walk straight toward the giant neon EPSON sign, you will see the hotel.It's worth the money, no rooms aren't as big as a Sleep Inn in Texas, but hey, you're in the tightest place in Tokyo!

<Content>Prince in name but certainly not fit for one! All I can say is the Tripadvisor does a great public service in providing a voice for people to advise others on hotels like these. And as regards listing the flaws with the Shinjuku Prince, where do I start? Basically, I chose this hotel because I thought we were getting some sort of an upgrade which we paid more for, the 'renewer room B' I believe it was called. But the room was so small it was incredible; there was hardly enough space for the tiny bathroom and double bed within it. I know rooms are small in Tokyo but I should mention that we also stayed at another hotel in Roppongi for the same price and the room was literally twice the size. The pillows had this foul odour akin to dirty laundry, and there was dust everywhere. Furthermore, unlike most hotels, we were unable to adjust the temperature in the room. It was either too hot or too cold. And the ventilation was appalling.To top it all off they charged us into the hotel bar despite the fact that we were residents!! We decided we'd go for one drink at 6pm on a Sunday evening to the empty Fuga Bar on top and we paid 500 yen (about 鈧?.50 or $5) admission. I showed my resident card to the barman but he politely explained that the charge still applied.There were some positives such as a good location, friendly staff and a good view, but apart from this stay miles away from the overpriced and undersized Shinjuku Prince.

<Content>Overpriced box I booked my stay via expedia for us$180 per night, which I thought was exorbitant after I saw our room. We got a standard double room, which included a double bed, and not much walking space. There was a small set of hangers hanging from a rod but no closet. The desk was small, as was the computer screen sized tv. We got a nice city view from the window, which was nice. The bathroom resembled one that you would find on a cruise. After closing the bathroom door, I felt like i was on a cruise again, with the white plastic surroundings, so it was a bit claustrophobic. Thank goodness we only stayed for one night at this hotel. I felt really claustrophobic staying in the room, and felt that there was hardly any ventilation. It was quite dry too. The location is pretty good, its a short walk away from the JR station, but if you're taking the NEX from Narita, be sure to get directions on how to get from the JR to the hotel, because it can be confusing with all the construction around the station. As with most JR stations, there are plenty of restaurants and convenience stores around for you to visit. The hotel is a short walk away from Kabuki cho as well so if you want to see some shady clubs then you can go there too. As for the service, check in took five minutes, and the concierge/bell desk were extremely resourceful and helpful with our questions.Overall, if you're going to be out and about the whole day, and will only use this place to sleep, its a good convenient option; however, for around 200/day I think you can find other, more spacious options.

<Content>What an excellent hotel I was in tokyo for a quick stay 2 night stay before heading home to London. This hotel is worth a stay. Room was nice and comfortable and the view of the Shinjuku skyline was nothing short of awesome! The most important thing of all was that the service was great. The staff spoke English which was very comforting as this was my first visit to Japan and I dont speak a word of Japanese! Shinjuku station is just round the corner and very easy to get to. If visiting Tokyo, stay in this hotel.

<Content>Convenient, small but ideal for a few days I've used this hotel a number of times for many years and find it very convenient for a few days. Yes, it is small but 'upgrading' to a superior room can help, although that can mean a cost not far off something like the Keio Plaza Hotel.If you need to work west from Tokyo, the Seibu Shinjuku line is right beneath the hotel (and not noisy unless you get a low room). This line is ideal for Tanashi and Tokorozawa towns but gives you the benefit of living in the nightlife of Tokyo.Staff are friendly and speak reasonable English; restaurant is not exactly gourmet but passable and the bar on the top floor is OK and gives a good view.

<Content>Awful, Awful, Awful Wow! We had started our stay at the immaculate Prince Hotel in Akasaka. After one night in this dump, we were glad to get out. As others have said, the location is a bit seedy, but the rooms take it to a whole new level. $200 USD for a fleabag? There were stains everywhere, bedspreads were worn and disgusting, furniture terrible, everything terrible. Don't stay here. I can't believe Prince is keeping its name on the property.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel and Great Location I stayed at this hotel for five nights during a holiday two weeks ago. It was wonderful for the price. It wasn't anything fancy, and the bed wasn't the greatest, but it was just perfect, and exactly what I was looking for. I was so jet lagged when I arrived, and although my room looked out over a giant neon sign, the curtains made it dark as could be. So dark, I slept well into the next day and I woke up and thought it was still night. Some of the great things about this hotel are its location. It is located right outside of the Shinjuku station where the Tokyo Metro, JR Lines, and Narita Express are all available. Nightlife is very close by, which makes it great because taxi's are so expensive in Tokyo. There is alot of dinning near by too. On the otherside of the train station there are alot of great restaurants, and you can venture to the near by McDonalds for some western food when you need it! Waterpressure is great, and rooms are spotless.On the bad side, I thought the bed was bit lumpy, but I got used to it quicky. Also, the walls were a bit thin to the room next door, and I heard the entire conversation the person in the room next to me was having. The hotel seems a bit dated, but you won't spend much time here anyway.Thanks Shinjuku Prince!!!

<Content>Good location, good price small rooms i stayed at this hotel 2 times. i like the convient location. big nightlife around u shinjuku station is only 5 minutes walk away so u can get around really easy.actually the rooms are very very small but if u are in tokyo u havnet much time to stay at your hotel because there is much to explore.i recommend this hotel to all folks who want a central location with good public transportation excesss.the breakfast buffet wasnt that nice and very small, but around the hotels there are so many restauants shops and department stores so that this is no problem at all.who are into luxury should stay away from this hotel.

<Content>A Good Hotel After booking this hotel, I had read some pretty negative reviews on it. It is true that the room is small, especially by western standard. Sleeping in it is not a problem, however. Using the bathroom may be quite a task for a big guy who is taller than 6 feet, I imagine. Fortunately, my wife and I don't fall into this category of size!I had also read of a complaint that the hotel was located next to a red light district and there was a prostitute soliciting a customer (who was with his wife) outside the hotel. When I was staying at the hotel, I couldn't tell where the red light district was. And certainly, I did not come across anyone that remotely looked like a prostitute anywhere near the hotel during my five day stay there. But then I may not be discerning enough on this type of matter.In fact, I found the location of the hotel to be very convenient. Takeshimaya Times Square is within walking distant. Nearer to the hotel, within the same building, there is a 200 yen shop. There, you can buy many things needed at only 200 yen per item. In fact, the hotel is surrounded by many shops and all types of restaurants outside and within the Shinjuku Train Station. You can also walk to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building (near Tokyo City Hall) and have a free bird eyeview of the city and a look at Fuji Mount at the 45th Floor. There is no need to pay to go up Tokyo Tower to do this!The service at the hotel is helpful, especially the bell boys. You don't have to struggle with the Japanese language. They speak good English and are very helpful to customers. One of the things that I am deeply impressed about the Japanese people is that they are very attentive and systematic in rendering services. In general, this helps to compensate for the fact that English is not so widely used in Japan.My wife and I agree that in spite of the samll room we would stay at this hotel again if we return to Tokyo. The service and the convenience of location more than compensate for the small room.

<Content>Stay only here only if you have no choice Although located in Shinjuku (near the train station and near a stop on the Narita Express), it is actually located so far from the train entrances that you have to walk well over 15 minutes to get onto a train. The walk to the train entrance is crowded with people and there are no escalators. It was awful to try to navigate carrying a suitcase and carryon.Further, it is located right next to a red light district part of Shinjuku. We saw a prostitute soliciting clients almost every night, right at the hotel entrance (and surprisingly, the hotel did not ask her to leave). And pimps, etc. selling sex services are right on the street next door. It made our long walks back to the hotel from the train even more unpleasant.The rooms are very very hot, and there is no way to increase air flow or decrease the temperature. There is also no ventilation in the bathroom. We had to open the door of our hotel room after taking a shower because we felt a bit dizzy from the heat  steam (a problem excaberated by the overall general hot condition of the room). During the times we had to open our hotel door to breathe, we noticed a lot of other hotel guests doing the same - I guess they all had the same problem.Finally, the room was not spotless. There was dust and stains at various places, e.g. carpet, curtains, etc. Although we spent very little time in our rooms, the time was very unpleasant. I would not stay here again.

<Content>Small rooms but good location The Shinjuku Prince is located in the Shinjuku district of Tokyo. The location is super-convenient, as it's located right next to the Shinjuku Subway line. The area is super congested though(as 2M people pass through the subway station each day!), so if you're looking for more peace and quiet, I'd recommend staying in another area of Tokyo.The hotel room I stayed in was a standard - the price was reasonable. The room, from an American standard, was super tiny. It was also fairly clean and quiet (could not hear any street traffic). I would probably stay here again.

<Content>Good location and price I stayed in a single room on the 12th floor. On the positive side, the room was plenty big for 1 person and very clean. Although I did not know it before I got there, a breakfast buffet was included in the price. The staff spoke English well and was very helpful. The location is good as it is close to the station, if you can tolerate walking through crowds of teenagers and next to loud pachinko parlors.On the negative side, the hotel is on-top of a train station, so if you are unlucky and get a room on a low floor facing the trains, you can hear them starting at 6 am. I have stayed here twice and did not hear them the first time.

<Content>nice hotel, nice price I've stayed at this hotel two times, and both times was pleases.Yes, the standard rooms are small, but the superior rooms are large enough for two with much luggage. A Japanese friend visited my room (the standard one) and commented that it was a typical Japanese hotel room. The superior room was more in line with what American/European tourists expect from a hotel.Other plus points are the location in the Shinjuku area, which is quite lively, and the attentiveness of the staff, who went out of their way to organize tickets for me to events playing in Tokyo during my stay.The only negative I can think of is the breakfast--I don't particularly like Japanese food, especially in the morning, and the other options were limited and not very good.Other than that, I quite enjoyed my stay at this hotel and would stay there again onfuture trips.

<Content>great location, not too pricey i go to japan at least once or twice a year and i've been doing this for about three years and i would have to say prince hotel is not a bad choice. although many people would say that shinkjuku prince hotel is very small and its impossible to live in, its not true. what u have to keep in mind when travelling to japan is that the hotel rooms are small, (well maybe not when u talking about grand hyatt). but tokyo is a city full of fun, u wont need time in the hotel at all! i've stayed in many hotels including keio plaza and grand hyatt, but if u are in tokyo for some fun, try shinjuku prince hotel! (and why waste 4-5 hundred bucks for a place jsut to sleep in?) it's close to station, surrounded by shopping malls, u can just go on and on there. plus it's pretty safe, going back to the hotel at one or two will def not be a problem.

<Content>Ridiculous rooms Visited with my wife in March 2005. The standard double room was minute even by Japanese standards - and impossible for two people to live in. There was no one who could offer any advice on activitgies in Tokyo and the hotel did not have the kind of English language tourist information available at other hotels. The location near Shinjuku station is excellent for transport, entertainment and resuarants.

<Content>OK. Good location This was the cheapest hotel we could find in the location we wanted. The room was the size of our closet and it still cost $100, so value isn't spectacular. The toilet was excellent and more high-tec than my dvd player. The hotel overall is nothing to rave about but it is one the cheapest places in Tokyo. We've stayed in some pretty bad dumps around the world so this place was pretty good for our needs. If you can find something in the same class for cheaper, I would say go for it. However, if you find a room at this hotel for a good price, stay here. The location is excellent, close to airport limo stop, train station, bars, shops and fugu restaurants.

<Content>Not Impressed For $130/night I didn't expect 5 stars, but this was kind of disappointing. Very small room, very small bathroom and shower area (felt as if we were in a space capsule). Free breakfast was horrible. The location is good but beware that it's in the begining of the Red Light District and there are tons of massage places around and the women would like to drag any man in, regardless of wife or girlfriend's presence.

<Content>Can't afford the Park Hyatt? Stay here! OK, so this place isn't as beautiful or as hip as the Park Hyatt ... but it is also more affordable. This hotel is in the same area as the Park Hyatt, in Shinjuku ... you'll recognize all the flashing lights, giant video billboards, sushi bars, nightclubs, pachinko parlors, video arcades, etc., that you saw in Lost In Translation and want to see in Tokyo. Just a stone's throw from Shinjuku station, so very convenient for those travellers arriving in Tokyo on the airport trains that roll in from Narita.Rooms and bathrooms are small ... large-sized people may consider them cramped ... but this is Japan ... land prices are high, and a larger space would definitely hit you in the pocketbook. Functional, clean, and also very Japanese (they even have vending machines that sell underwear, for businessmen that forgot to bring an extra pair).You can still visit the Park Hyatt in the evening anyway, and the lower room rates at the Prince will allow you to splurge just a bit more on the town.

<Content>Good location and don't ask for more We went to Tokyo during the cherry blossom season this year. It is close to the Shinjuku station. Shinjuku is chosen as we went to Hakone as well for sight seeing and hot spring (Okada Inn). The Shinjuku Prince hotel is also within walking distance to the Odakyu train station where the train takes off to Hakone. We stayed two nights in Tokyo. Checked out, left our suitcases in the hotel and went to Hakone for two nights with a small bag. Back to Tokyo (same hotel) for another two nights. No extra charge for leaving suitcases for overnight. Actually, most of the hotels in Japan offer this kind of service for free.Semi-double room was very small and we had difficulty to move around with our suitcases on the ground. Bathroom small but functional. Acceptable cleanliness. Lots of travellers from HK and Taiwan. Some staff can speak English. Moderate price range. Cheaper if booked through travel agent or flight+hotel package. Next to the Kabugi and shops are still open till 10-11pm.
