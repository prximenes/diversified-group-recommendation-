<Content>single room for 鈧?0 In Jan '08 while on a business tour to Brussels, when I finally got free from 3 tiring days at the seasonal meetings, I went to the world's freedom capital for just one night...Getting off the Amsterdam central trainstation I just walked past the canal, off the tram lines and straight into the hotel. It seemed small but OK from the outside... I inquired about the rate for a single bed. It was only 鈧?0 which seemed pretty good for a budget traveller that I was by then ;-)The guy at the reception was kind enough to let me have a look inside the room / check amenities first before checking-in.The breakfast was included but I decided to have it out with a friend.The room was rather small but had all basic necessities like hot water shower, safe, phone, cable tv, radiator and a split aircon. The bed was comfortable, the room spotless and the easy chairs by the small full-length window looked quite nice.All in all it was a good find... and nice BB for just 鈧?0!!!I am surprised to see that now the rate is 鈧?05 per night!!! That's expensive for this small BB property!!!

<Content>Convenient Location Located close to Central train Station and city centre. The hotel is comfortable although the rooms are extremely small, the bathroom however was of reasonable size.Friendly front desk staff and above average breakfast.We were only there for one night so cant really offer any further information but would recommend for a stopover when in Amsterdam.

<Content>Friendly but dirty The location is convenient, just 2 blocks from the Central Station. However, the Hotel is very dirty! when I checked in my room, there were wet socks on the luggage rack and the towels were wet. One had lipstick on them! I thought I entered the wrong room! I returned back to the reception, and asked them to clean the room while I'll go on a tour in the city. When I returned back, nothing was done. I found bread crumbles on the bed and long hair on the pillow. I had to cover everything with my own towels to be able to sleep on. I don't recommend the hotel for professionals or for family. just for young teen agers who don't find a place in a hostel.

<Content>Super great location I didn't expect much since it is only a small hotel but I was pleasently surpriced. The hotel had a great location close to the train station and shopping street. The room was nice and clean. We stayed 3 girls in one room and it was spaciuos enough for us. The staff was nice and helpfull. The lobby was nice and I especially liked the fireplace on a cold January day. It was fake but it still warmed.The dislikes are my pillow smelled... and at night it can be quite noisy because of the traffic just outside your window but I got used to it after 1 night.Despite of that I would definitely stay there again if I come back to Amsterdam.

<Content>Great Location - Ok Hotel... Usually stay in the what was the Ramada but is now the Tulip Inn and compared to that this was not as nice. Reception area is lovely. Hotel is in middle of a re-furb at the moment so there were lots of workmen  pots of paint all over the place so was a little hectic during the day. Thankfully this did not disturb us too much! Sadly was unable to smoke in any of the 3 rooms we had booked within our party. Did manage to change one of them to smoking in the end. However the no-smoking rule is being rolled out 1 July 08 so not sure how that is going to change all hotels let alone the city! Biggest plus was the location - literally a 3 min walk from Central Station. Also if you are anything like me the Shower is important and I can confirm that they have good ones at the Sint Nicolaas! Would I return - no. Would I return to what was the Ramada - yes! Also be sure on what you rate you are paying at time of booking as they tried to charge us an additional 50Euro which we swiftly got knocked off.Breakfast in reception in the mornings between 7-10 was nice and I found the hotel staff to be helpful.

<Content>Bargain hotel in city centre It's OK for a short stay, and was a real bargain for EUR 65 per night. The hotel is aged and shady a bit, and the rooms are small. But, it's a perfect location, close to Centraal Station and the nightlife.

<Content>Way too expensive for what it is Great location and a very nice looking lobby, besides that it's a bit of a dump. Our room was horrible looking and did not seem all that clean and the toilet smelled. Considering we paid around 鈧?40-150 a night I certainly was hoping for something better. Staff was friendly, but not terribly knowledgeable about the city.

<Content>Decent place to stay. Helpful staff We had a 3 beds room. The beds were single and small but comfortable. The bathroom was decent. Good water pressure. The room was old, and felt a little on the dirty side. If you were there for a few days and just there to party and get out I would stay there again. The staff were friendly and helpful. Recieved a password for the internet that lasted the entire stay. The free breakfast could be skipped, but plenty of places nearby. Across the street from a nice coffee shop to begin the day on a good foot.They were remodeling the lobby but never heard a thing on the 3rd floor. Just about done when i left. The elevator is slow so I usually just went right for the stairs.I gave it a above average experience because I usually stay at much better hotels but I really could not complain about anything. Probably worth less then half of what they charge for what you get in other cities.

<Content>Helpful, but annoying rennovations This hotel was pretty clean, basic room with 3 single beds.There is generally only 1 person at the front desk, so that can be frustrating waiting to get your room key every time you go in or if you've got a question etc.The free wireless requires you to get a 2 hour ticket from reception each time, and generally it only works from reception... i got it working from the room, but it was constantly dropping out.It didn't have a waste bin which was annoying, both in the room or bathroom.They are currently doing some serious renovations, so during the day if you want to sleep it's near impossible with the impact drills going etc... and there is a lot of dust flying around.The staff are helpful and give directions, and bookings etc, but at the moment it's the renovations that killed it for me.

<Content>Lovely central place to stay We have just returned from a 3 night stay in the Hotel Sint Nicolaas and would recommend it to anyone. It was a convenient and easy 5 min walk from Central Station which was wonderful as I was travelling with my 2 children on my own. The staff were friendly and helpful and the hotel had a lift and a luggage store. The latter enabled us to check out on our last morning and leave our bags until lunch time (which allowed us to hop on a tram and have final morning's cycling in the gorgeous and safe Vondelpark - my children's favourite Amsterdam activity). Our room was wonderfully quiet for a European city centre budget hotel. The bathroom was a good size complete with good shower over a large bath. The breakfast came included which was a great bonus in an expensive city and set us up until the afternoon. We had a great choice of cereals (with or without yoghurt), bread, croissants, cold ham, turkey and salami, boiled eggs, fruit, coffee, tea etc and those little packets of chocolate sprinkles that children love to put on their bread for some unknown reason.

<Content>Lived up to expectations We spent two separate nights at the hotel, the first one when we arrived in the Netherlands, and the second one on the last day of our vacation (we went on a bicycle tour).Both times we had a triple room, but the quality of the rooms varied dramatically: room 11 was basic but comfortable and clean (the wooden beams even gave it some character). Also, it was quiet, looking onto a side street, while room 16 was very noisy and appeared not to have been cleaned properly. The bathroom door wouldn't close all the way, which might not be a serious problem for a couple, but makes it awkward when it's three people just traveling together who have to share a room.On the plus side, the hotel is really close to the train station, the staff if courteous and helpful, and breakfast is such a wonderful spread as you would expect from a much more pricey establishment.

<Content>OK, too hot, but friendly staff We booked this hotel for the UK Bank holiday weekend for E160 per night.The location of the hotel is great and the staff were always polite and helpful. Free internet is handy.We stayed on the 4th floor and the rooms looked recently renovated. It was clean and tidy. Completely acceptable for a budget hotel.However, the first day that we were there was very hot and we were unable to cool the room down - even once it had cooled down outside. We had the airconditioning on overnight full but could not get the temperature down to a pleasant level and the staff were not sure how the unit worked (but polite).The breakfast was average European fare and not really worth getting up early for.So the lack of sleep due to the heat is the reason why I have marked down the hotel. After all you are there to sleep.So I would not recommend staying in this hotel during summer.

<Content>Loved this hotel! For only 2 stars, this hotel is terrific. The location is very good- immediate access to walking trips, mutliple trains and shopping. Fast elevator and nice rooms. There is construction across the street and also in the front of the hotel, but we thought of it as an alarm clock :) Friendly and informative staff and maid service too! CLEAN, SAFE, COMFY ROOMS (cool coffee shop across the street)

The rooms were very nice and the beds were extremely comfortable. The staff were really helpful and friendly and the location was fantastic too. I'd definitely recommend a stay here.

<Content>nice hotel kind staff stayed here with my husband and daughter for one night on our way to take our daughter to another part of Holland for an international exchange programme. Stayed one night in a triple room (room 21). The position is ideal not 5 mins from the station and very near centre. the room was large enough, warm with a nice bathroom and t.v. Best of all was the kindness of the receptionist on duty morning of 30th January. When I told him one of our large cases had been broken during our flight and if we could call a taxi to get to the station, he told us it was too near to get a taxi but they'd help us. He called a worker who was working on refurbishment in the hotel, who came with a big trolley, walked with us to the station, helped us get the tickets to our next destination, then took us to the platform (carrying the case up the stairs) and put us on the train. We had to force him to take a 3鈧?tip (putting it in his pocket). The young man who was very nice and with perfect english was from a country ending in stan (no not Paki or Afghani). I saw this hotel recommended in the Sunday Times and I'd recommend it to anybody

<Content>Brilliant value for money This hotel was great value for money. Perfect location 3 mins from Central Station. The room was clean, comfortable, light and airy, more than adequate. Compared to lots of other quotes for hotels, this was considerably cheaper. I would strongly recommend it, although not luxurious, we would definitely stay here again.

<Content>saved by the saint After staying one lousy night at Winston hostel, we changed accomodation to Sint Nicolaas. This move saved our holiday.We stayed two nights and slept well. Room was clean, cosy and peacefull. If you aren麓t so interested in drinking and partying all night, this is a place to be. No noise in the nights, even so the street next to the hotel is very lively.Breakfast is good and the staff helpfull.Hotel is situated very well, walkingdistance to every major attractions. And if you don麓t want to walk, tramstop is very near the hotel.

<Content>A safe haven within a short walk of everywhere We arrived in Central Station and only had to walk a very short distance to the hotel, which was good as the traffic reminded me of the old video game Frogger! The Receptionist was pleasant and allowed us into our room slightly before the earliest booking in time. He commented that our room had been newly decorated two weeks prior. On taking the lift to the forth floor the doors opened and we were greeted with a painter on a ladder blocking our exit! Great I thought, however he was polite and moved out of our way and even directed us to our room. The room itself was not exactly large but was more than adequate and the bathroom and shower were excellent. At night time there is noise from the road outside due to the trams, however my wife is a light sleeper and didn't complain about it to much! Breakfast in my opion was a sandwich.... Breads and cold meats. There is cereal available also. The hotel is a great starting point if you plan to walk around the city. My wife complained that I made her walk everywhere! The trams are easily accessable though if you wanted to travel further away from the hotel.By the time we were leaving the painters had completely finished on our floor and the hotel was looking good.All in all the hotel was great and even the tram noise wouldn't put me or my wife off returning. If your after a good reasonably priced hotel to use as a base for dandering around and exploring the city this one is it.

<Content>Well Done they saved my holiday Sint Nicolaas, is a good basic friendly hotel. It does not claim to be something it is not. After walking out of our previous hotel after one night which claimed to be a 3 star we were very happy with the cleanliness, attitude of the staff, facilities etc. We would stay there again. Well done.

<Content>I Agree, This Hotel Has Gone Downhill The first time we stayed at the Sint Nicolaas was in 1999 and I absolutely loved it. The location was perfect, the staff quirky but very friendly and the rooms were basic but clean and large.Since then we have returned to Amsterdam twice a year, always staying at the Sint Nicolaas, and the last couple of times have just not been enjoyable. For our last October trip in we tried a new hotel and will not be going back.There has been a subtle change and it has not been for the better. The decor is looking really shabby but more importantly it just doesn't feel friendly and welcoming any more. I'm sure there has been a management change. The breakfast has changed to self service and the quality is vastly inferior.

<Content>Gone terribly downhill I stayed at the Hotel Sint Nicolaas on a previous visit to Amsterdam six years ago and had a pleasant stay. So it was the first place I thought of when returning to the city.How I wish I booked another hotel for my wife and I for this stay.Our room was absolutely filthy, right down to the bedsheets and pillows smelling unwashed since the last guests used them. The carpet outside the bathroom door was stained and sunken. The furniture in the room was old and rickety. The TV in room didn't work (no sound). The whole room smelt sweaty and most unpleasant.The staff (or should I say the receptionist - who seemed to change every few hours) were completely ineffectual at dealing with our problems. Their responses ranged from disinterested to helpful but inactive. We were told we couldn't move rooms as they were full and the promised cleanup of the room was half hearted.The common areas of the hotel (breakfast room, hall etc.) as well as our room seemed tired and in need of facelift, I doubt any changes have been made since my last visit six years ago and the hotel really suffers from it.A few other things bothered me about our stay here this time:- The breakfasts provided were of a very poor quality, the bread was almost stale and the cheese limp and uninviting. Even the coffee was bad.- Having to buzz the main door to be let in is a major pain, especially in the rain as you have to wait for the receptionist to get up and manually let you in.- They have nowhere to store bikes.- The walls between rooms are paper thin.- This hotel is grossly overpriced for the area, there are much better options in Amsterdam.On the positive side the Hotel Sint Nicolaas is in a really great location, the free wi-fi internet was useful and.... did I mention it was in a great location?We had a wonderful time in Amsterdam, in spite of our stay at the Hotel Sint Nicolaas. Such a shame to see how far this once good hotel has fallen.

<Content>A delightful stay! We just returned from Amsterdam and had a delightful experience at the Hotel Sint Nicolaas. This was a last minute reservation, and were happily surprised! The location was perfect - 5 minutes walk from Central Station and 10 minutes to Dam Square, with numerous trams stopping within 1 block of the hotel. The rooms were larger than in most European budget hotels, the bath was huge by comparison, and the buffet breakfast was substantial. We found the staff to be competent and very helpful, and would definitely recommend this one!

<Content>Not for light sleepers We just returned from a three night staff at the Saint Nicolaas March 24th. No quads at this hotel, so our family of four needed two double rooms. The staff were accomodating, but as noted in a prior review, they seemed to change daily. Their demand for full-stay payment on check-in should have been a hint. The rooms were very sparse, and the night staff was unable to find towels or soap when requested. The main problem is the extreme noise of this hotel. Five different tram lines run late into the night less than 20 feet outside of the windows. What you gain by location, you lose in amentities and quiet. Unless close proximity to Central Station is your utmost requirement, we reccomend shopping around.

<Content>Can't really complain at the price, and location Just got back from 5 nights staying in this hotel. I paid 60 Euros per night for a single, which is expensive compared to a double but what can you do??The location is excellent, very close to Central Station and away from the RLD and noisier tourist areas. Close to the Western Canal belt, which I preferred. The room was very basic in terms of the state of the bed, wardrobe, and other fittings, but clean enough, always warm, and you do get a free safe to use. The bathroom was a little damp and sparse, but the bath was massive and the shower worked very well, if set very low down. One major complaint - the noise coming from the main street to the right with trams and buses. The traffic can get very noisy, even with the double glazing. Trams tearing past late at night did annoy me to start off with, but I got used to it until I was awoken at 3am by a tram breaking very hard.The lift is definitely large and modern, ignore the Scots guys comments. The breakfast was pretty basic, but fine for me, and the staff were OK, although it did seem to be someone different every time. This became annoying when they stand at the door and don't let you in when you've been there 4 days already. There's also free internet use, which was great.Overall, a decent enough budget hotel in a very good location - if you can put up with the basic standard and noise on one side of the hotel.

<Content>I love this hotel I love this hotel and will be staying there again next January. If you want a room in Amsterdam for under $100 with an elevator and decent breakfast (free), good luck in your search. The staff is VERY friendly at Sint Nicolaas, the place is kept very clean and safe, and it's in the best location royalty, you won't find it here, but you will find the finest hotel available for under $100 euro. By the way, if you don't appreciate the free breakfast, and haven't been to Amsterdam, you might note that most restaurants in Amsterdam are not open in the morning, and do not serve breakfast at all. It's the effort that matters to me the most, like a free breakfast that don't HAVE to offer it's visitors, and that's what separates Sint Nicolaas from other hotels, they want you to be comfortable.

<Content>Definately worth a visit A 2 minute walk from the station, with heavy bags was rewarded upon finding the Sint Nicolaas had a lift!!!! and what a lift, I swear we could have held a party in this enormous room they called a lift! the bedroom was spacious with a bathroom almost as big, must admit the place could do with a make-over but despite this fact, we would still recommend this hotel for its charm and location (not to mention the charming blonde manager!)

<Content>Highly recommended In reply to a negative review I have just read about this charming hotel. I feel it is totally unjustified. I am a regular visitor to Amsterdam (at least 5 business trips a year)  have stayed at the Sint Nicolaas hotel for the last 12 years. The standard of hospitality  friendliness cannot be beaten. This is 1 of the only 2 star hotels offering an elevator and the gentleman from Scotland complains that it is making a loud noise! I suggest that next time he stays in a hotel without an elevator and experience the Dutch steep staircases! The generous breakfast is FREE, which is also unusual in Amsterdam! The staff are very polite and go out of their way to assist. I am perplexed to hear that his experience was negative  can only conclude that this gentleman is perhaps a very unhappy man. I recommend this hotel highly to all my friends  business relations.

<Content>Staying at the Hotel Sint Nicolaas I recently stayed here for 5 nights and was very disappointed with this hotel based on the amount it was charging (the same as 4* in Scotland). The rooms were reasonably clean but dull and the bathroom had a bit of damp, and was not always very clean. The breakfast was very disappointing, ham and cheese sandwiches with some butter and jam, every morning. The staff were not particularly friendly. The hotel had an old lift that made a terrible noise, and woke us up every morning as soon as guests started to go for breakfast. The stairs were wooden and old, so also very noisy. I asked to be moved rooms, and was told that I was in the quiet room, as the traffic was noisy on the other side of the hotel.However, the hotel is in an excellent location, only 5 minutes walk from the train station and 5 minutes walk to Dam square, and there was a lovely Chinese/Indianesion restaurant next door to the hotel.
