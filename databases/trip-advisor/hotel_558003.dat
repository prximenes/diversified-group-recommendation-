<Content>Modern and Chic Hotel Obviously it is difficult to get rooms at a decent price anywhere to stay during the xmas period, especially when xmas is only 10 days away. We were very lucky to be able to secure a room through www.asiatravel.com at a reasonable rate of HKD900nett per night consecutively from xmas eve to boxing day. And we were very grateful to be given a free upgrade to the Executive Spacious room. The room is very tastefully decorated with a King size bed. The room is also quiet eventhough we are facing the main Hennessy Road. The toilet is functional but I have an issue with the glass door; it is very heavy and difficult to be kept opened. Apart from this, it also beats me why the hotel doesn't offer complimentary bottled distilled/mineral water. Some other 2/3* hotels in Hong Kong replenish the bottled water daily where Metropark Wanchai is trying to position themselves as 3.5/4*? The staff at Metropark Wanchai are very polite and helpful, but somehow I find they seems a tad cold and distant. Overall Metropark Wanchai is still value for money during the festive season. Jaffe Road and Lockhart Road just behind the hotel have plenty of bars, pubs, restaurants to chillout. Airport Express Bus no. A11 from airport stops at Empire Hotel, just across Metropark Wanchai. This mode of transer from the airport to the hotel is worth considering because you can see sightsee Hong Kong and Kowloon along the way for just HKD40, and it takes about 30mins to reach considering you are travelling in a bus.

<Content>excellent hotel in good location We enjoyed our stay at the Metropark and will definitely stay there on our next visit. The rooms were a good size and very fresh and modern. We only had breakfast in the hotel but no complaints there. You had a choice of a la carte or buffet. The staff were very friendly. It was ideally situated near the MTR with a road crossing right outside the door. Anyone who knows Hong Kong will know what a boon that is as sometimes you have to walk a long way just to cross the road. All in all a very good place to stay whether on business or pleasure

<Content>All that glitters... A white and bright contemporary lobby gives an upscale feel, but we found that not all aspects of this hotel are as flashy as the entrance. Our complaints are, frankly, relatively minor, but for what is supposed to be a four star hotel, we think that this hotel does not quite reach that standard or offer a value for money option in Hong Kong.Yes, the location is great, and most of the staff are quite friendly. However, there were several things that we felt let this hotel down: our room amenities were not replaced/refilled, some of the lights did not work in the room, we could not check in until 4pm despite the check-in time being 2pm, we were put in a room on a smoking floor when we asked for non-smoking, and we were not able to move. Perhaps most frustrating was the internet access: we could not connect to the internet in our room, and we were not offered assistance with this despite explaining the situation. Moreover, the cost of using the internet in your room or in the lobby is very high compared to the PCCW wireless access available all across Hong Kong if you have your own laptop. Luckily, we had a laptop and paid HK$20 for 24 hours of access - the hotel rate for in-room internet access was six times this amount!

<Content>Excellent location and value (for HK) A small, simple hotel which is perfectly located as a base to tour HK and Kowloon. Excellent public transportation access - tram (just across the road), bus (2 mins walk), MTR (6 mins walk), ferry (wan chai pier). Lots of restaurants on Lockhart St (behind the hotel... between Hennessy and the Convention Centre). There are several convenient stores, including a supermarket, nearby.The rooms are well proportioned (I got an upgrade), large bathroom with all the amenities. Was pleasantly surprised that they even provided complimentary toothbrush, razor (since it's a 3 star hotel). A safe in the room is also a big plus. Not noisy at all (but maybe because my room was not facing the main road). Modern decor and kept very clean.Staff and service are very good. They even have a turndown service!Would definitely stay there again and highly recommend it.

<Content>It's okay I tried out the Metropark at Wanchai after the mostly positive reviews, but was unfortunately a little disappointed. That said, there were some positives:- good location: while the hotel is a block from the red light district, you wouldn't notice it if you stay on Hennessy Road. Wanchai is not the most glorious location in HK but it's exceptionally convenient for MTR, buses and trams and would get you to most places on the island in a flash for a fraction of the price of the hotels at Admalty. - service: the staff at the hotel do seem to pride themselves in providing good service to their customers. While it was disappointing to be given a twin bed room (having made a reservation 2 months in advance) they did managed to change it to a double bed on the 2nd night.Having experienced two rooms, I would say one's experience in the hotel depends on the room one's given. For what is a reasonably new hotel the twin room we stayed in earlier had an awful damp smell and was very small and dark (okay, I know this is not a 5 star hotel). The double room we were given for the next night was much better, although the shower curtain still give out an awful smell.As I said, I think the hotel is okay, but for the price there are lots of better alternatives in HK.

<Content>Convenient location I stayed in this hotel for two nights in Oct 08 - primarily as a shopping stopover. I booked the basic room, but on my arrival (which was 3 or 4 hours before normal check in), not only did they have the room ready, they upgraded me to their new product (their words not mine) called the Lady Only room. Well I was on my own and female so I guess I qualified! Room was really big, views over Hennessy Road, I'd say the hotel had recently been renovated as the bathroom was pretty swish. The usual hard bed as is to be expected in China. The only thing I could fault was that the bathroom lighting over the makeup mirror was a bit dark, but on the upside a fan in the bathroom so no foggy mirrors. And there were scales in the room - not that I wanted to weigh myself mind you, handy though to make sure all bags are below the luggage allowance! Breakfast was standard buffet. There are a few mcdonals in the area if a cheap quick breakfast is what you are after! The hotel was near the Wanchai MTR and I walked to Pacific Place (about 10 minutes) before it got too busy. Very helpful reception. Oh, I nearly forgot - a pillow and blanket menu if you don't like what they've provided!

<Content>Perfect place, perfect stay After 30 visits to Hong Kong I finally found a hotel with a excellent price/service/comfort/location balance. In the middle of Wanchai, close to busses, tram and MRT. A zillion restaurants and pubs for big and small wallets within minutes walking distance. Comfortable rooms, good shower, good service, safe and not over priced.

<Content>Great stay - nice, clean and pleasant staff We stayed for two nights in this hotel. It was very nice and gives a good impression right from the lobby and it doesn't fail to impress in the rooms and the service as well. The price was fantastic for what we got and the area is great to stay in. The tram stop and MTR station are only a couple of minutes walk.

<Content>Perfection in the city I went to Metropark Hotel Wanchai for a short business trip and stayed there for 3 nights total. The main reason for me to visit this hotel is the convenience location. It just took me few minutes walking to the subway and to the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre. The relatively low price of the hotel also engages me so much. After I get into the hotel, I found the value of the hotel is much higher than the price. In addition to very clean and tidy rooms, the modern design of the rooms and the extremely helpful customer service impressed me a lot! The hotel staff was incredibly friendly and were eager to help any way they could, if needed.There are also some local authentic places to eat just around the corner from the hotel. Last but not least, those big shopping malls such as Time square and Sogo can be easily reached by subway. It just fit for the shopping lovers like me!

<Content>Very Value for Money! My husband and I have stayed at The Metropark Wanchai from 28 Aug for a total of 4 nights. Here are some pointers worth highlighting for fellow tripadvisor members :1. We arrived past midnight at the hotel due to flight delayed and the front desk reception was all ready waiting for us as he greeted us by our family names when we stepped into the lobby. 2. We have booked for a comfort room with 2 single beds but had requested for a queen bed. Our wish was granted without any additional charges. The hotel is selling the comfort rooms with queen bed at a higher price.3. We did an early checkout and left the luggages with the hotel to do some last minute shopping. Without releasing that I've left my accessories in the room after check out, the staff was very nice to have returned it to me by leaving it in my hand luggage. Very honest staff.4. The location is superb just a mere 2 minutes walk to the Wanchai MTR. It's proximity to Tai Yuen Street is what we loved as we can get quality toys at really cheap prices for our kids. 5. There is a nice Dim Sum Restn few doors away from the hotel, the diced chicken steam rice is only going for HK$1 for a bowl on weekday and most dim sum cost only HK$8.80 per plate.6. And I really appreicate the location after doing some shopping in areas like TST and Mongkok which I found to be too overwhelming and crowded.7. The room and toilet are of good size.8. One minor complaint I have though is the stale smell coming from the aircon vent.

<Content>Good Hotel, great location, HARD bed, Very Nice Rooms This hotel was recently remodeled, with very modern and updated decor, and taxi drivers called it the singapore hotel so it must have changed hands recently.Booked on Orbitz for about $120 per night. A VERY good location, easy walk to any nightlife or shopping or times square. #11 bus went stright from airport to the front door. Was offered upgrade to business class room for $50 USD for two nights. room was large with flat screen TV, room was immaculate, with very good internet access, shower and service. They offered daily laundry service. Did not use the restaurant but it looked good but I believe it was actually next door, but they advertised the buffet. This is not a resort hotel, but a great business class hotel with a great location, good customer service, good rates, and even with the rock hard bed, I would consider staying here again. Security in lobby was attentive, and front desk was very helpful with perfect English skills.When in Wanchai I would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Could be great, depending on your needs. We stayed here, having stayed at the sister hotel in Causeway Bay, and wanting to experience a couple of locations on the island. As a family we found it difficult to book sleeping arrangments to suit us anywhere, even with only wheeling in a cot and having our other young child on our existing bedding. It seems the rooms are small here and mostly you are required to either upgrade to a suite or get two rooms (fine except if you can't get adjoining rooms you're seperated as a family...)So I was surprised that the hotel website allowed us to book a comfort room as a family. I was more surprised when we arrived and were told they weren't sure the cot would fit... I understood what they meant when we got to the room. Two small single beds and just enough room for the cot. I'm not sure what room we had been given as the hotel was quite full and we were upgraded the following night to a larger room (which was ok).Perhaps the website had a fault as Ive since noticed 'no children permitted' next to most of the rooms on the website! Certainly we seemed out of place in this business hotel and it was pretty hard going in such a small space for all of us but I can hardly complain as it was a very very very good price for us to stay there (considering what we had paid for a suite at the other hotel).To the hotel: It was modern and clean. The bathroom was perfectly clean and the room had most of what you'd need. The views were pretty ordinary. Teh first room had an ok road view, certainly nothing flash, but the second room looked out over alleyways and the back of apartment blocks with air conditioning units. It was hideous really but then I didn't sit staring at it. The room was kind of chic anyway so it made up for it. If I was on my own or in a couple I'd be more than happy. It just wasn't really suitable for families like ours; though older kids with their own room would be fine. There was no pool or gym or anything like that and the restaurant was just average. The buffet breakfast was reasonably priced (they gave us a discount) but a bit strange with its combinations of ye olde english style food and bits of asian etc. I didn't really get into it... but it was adequate.The main attraction here is the location, which is great. There are restaurants near the hotel and plenty within a short walk; there is a train station a block away; a tram line outside; the star ferry a short walk. Near the hotel are some factory outlet shops that look pretty bad from the outside but stock some amazing stuff but you need to be willing to rummage a bit (I bought for HK$50 Bebe shirt with original US price tag at US$260...)All in all a fine choice if you're going to be out and about and need somewhere for a short stay close to everything. For longer stays or holidays you're probably better heading elsewhere.

<Content>Great location I needed to go to Hong Kong for a business meeting in Central, but my husband and a girlfriend decided to tag along. Chose Metropark Wanchai for price and location. It was ideal on both. Our flight arrived at nearly 7pm, we took the Airport Express and then the free shuttle. Bus stops right across the street from the hotel, so dragging suitcases the few steps to the front door was not a problem. Checking in was a breeze, my husband went straight to a restaurant to order dinner, while my girlfriend and I checked in our belongings. Fortunately, our favorite resto for Peking Duck was literally around the corner - American Restaurant - and by the time we arrived, appetizers were being served. The hotel is very near where the action is, Lockhart Road, and deciding from among several bars and restaurants can be tricky. Pacific Coffee is right behind the hotel, so is a good choice for non-buffet continental breakfast and free internet which runs on Windows 98! Coffee is pretty decent, too.The hotel room was very clean although small-ish, but par for the course in HK, modern furnishings (newly renovated), flat screen TV but limited cable channels. The pleasant surprise was the size of the bathroom which was roomier than my own home TB! However, we noted moulds growing under the clear sealant around the tub - a slight turn off but not enough to put us off entirely. A can of Dettol can be bought from the 7-11 (also behind the hotel) and should solve the problem. We were on the 9th floor, the non-smoking floors are higher up - and was far enough up to insulate from street noise, which isn't as bad as on the Kowloon side.Did I say the best part about it was its location? It is a couple of blocks from the Wanchai MTR, a very pleasant walk away from the Wanchai Ferry Pier, and a slightly longer walk takes you to Queens Road East which can take you to several bus stops. And for those with a tech proclivity, the Wanchai Computer Center is down the road and across the street ;-)Service was very fast on the two occasions I needed something (an adapter and an extra pillow), but yes, the beds are a tad hard. Nonetheless, it was a very pleasant stay. All three of us agree.

<Content>Great Stay! Stayed here last weekend...took the A11 bus from the airport and it drops you off just down the street from the hotel. Basically a clean and modern hotel...with a few nit-picky issues:-They screwed up my reservation so I had to wait in the lobby while they sorted it out (30 mins). But then they upgraded my room to make up for it.-The AC is loud if you want to have it on full blast at night.-Beds are especially hard.PS: the coffee place around the corner (behind hotel) has free internet.Definitely would stay again.

<Content>Great Location This Hotel is in A great location on Hong Kong Island itself. It's only 50-100m from Wan Chai station, giving you access to the best Metro/Underground I've ever used! The Hotel room was lovely - new furnishings, and clean! Apart from 'holiday' facilities, such as a pool etc, that this hotel does NOT have, the in-room facilities are great! Internet is NOT free though. A nice hotel, if you are looking for somewhere new, clean and convenient!

<Content>Thumbs up Just a stone's throw from Wanchai MTR station, with little restaurants dotted along way. Key shopping areas such as Causeway Bay, Central, Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon etc are just a few stations away.The hotel is newly renovated, finishings are modern and slick. Staff are friendly too....just one comment on the steps from the recep to lift...why are they there in the first place, makes it tricky to move bulky luggage.Considering the price and location, a great choice, will definitely stay there the next time I visit HK.
