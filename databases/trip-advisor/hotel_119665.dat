<Content>A gem of a place Stayed here 4 nights early December. Worried that it might be a disaster considering the low cost but what a fantastic little place. On the 'good' side of Union Square with all the designer stores on the doorstep. Honestly I work in Travel and have stayed in some top hotels but the location of this place just can't be beaten. Don't expect luxury. The facilities are non-existent, but if you want nice rooms in a perfect location at a very good price, you can't beat this little gem. Staff very friendly and our stay was extremely pleasant.

<Content>Great hotel if you're Deaf. This hotel is a pretty good value, but we found it very noisy, especially Saturday night.The room itself was quite nice for the price. The bed was comfortable. The room was clean. The view was good. Unfortunately everything seemed to make noise: The elevator, which we were right next to, made a horrible chunking noise whenever anyone used it. We could easily hear the people in the adjacent room. And the pipes shrieked.Unfortunately, I think most of the larger rooms (Queens, suites) are closer to the elevator. So either get a double or bring earplugs. It was less loud on Sunday and Monday night (less guests and less use of the Elevator)

<Content>My Second Stay at Baldwin - met my expectations again This is my second trip to SF, but this time with my parents (who's never been there before).As everyone has mentioned, this hotel is strategically located near Union Square (where the shopping is) and Chinatown (where the good/cheap eats are IMO). It is also a couple of blocks away from the Montgomery train station (BART/MUNI trains) and the bus lines on Market street. Furthermore, it is also a block away from the Cablecar line, which is great for tourists like us.The room we stayed at (#305) was clean, although a little small, and was perfect for what we needed. We stayed there for two nights and had no problems whatsoever. They served coffee in the morning, but no breakfast. The staff was friendly and helpful. We had no problems with them. I'd stay there AGAIN when I travel to SF in the future. Its convenience is unbeatable. The price is fair for its location.

<Content>A bit noisy - right next to the elevator shaft We were in room 301 which is situated right next to the elevator and you could hear the elevator going up and down most of the time. We paid $250 for 2 nights during a peak time (Nike Women's Marathon) so most likely that was a good deal for a place so close to Union Square and during that time, however I don't think your room should have so much noise that it's challenging to get any sleep.

<Content>Fantastic Location This hotel is in a fantastic location, just a block off Union Square, so close to shops and restaurants, you couldn't ask for more.The room inself was fairly standard, but top marks for cleanliness.The double bed was quite small, but the good thing was that you could open a window and have some fresh air, not like so many hotels in USA that just have air conditioning.The tea and coffee making facilities were in reception, rather than in the room, no big deal as the lift was quick so only took 2 mins to go down and grab a hot drink.The staff were very helpful, didn't see any of the housekeeping staff, but the receptionists couldn't do enough for us. I would most certainly stay here again and I would recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Central location with friendly atmosphere. We stayed here early October and even though we had done our homework on location, were pleasantly pleased with the hotels location. In the heart of the city, just a few steps away from Chinatown and easy access to the two cable car lines or street cars, to give you quick tranportation to the main attraction areas.Ok there is street noise but then again you are in the centre of a city and the lift can be heard but not enough to disturb you.Our room was on the ninth floor and the view from the window overlooking the roof tops was lovely, the bathroom was very modern, and it was handy to have a safe deposit box in you room at no extra charge.We found the hotel recepitionists all to be very helpful.

<Content>Great location, great hotel This is a great little hotel for the price if you are visiting San Francisco. Staff are friendly and helpful; the rooms aren't huge, granted - but they are clean and well tended.It's the location that is the winner, for those of a timid nature it feels safe at night; transport-wise cable-cars and busses to everywhere are just a couple of blocks away; Market Street / Union Square (for those of a shopping-inclined nature) are a short walk (nay a mere leap) too; and it is right at the start of Chinatown.If you are visiting SF you shouldn't be couped up in your room anyway, apart from coming back to wash and change before going out again - all in all I would highly recommend this hotel - it does what it says on the tin and it does it well and without pretentions.

<Content>good location, nice and clean hotel Stayed here for two nights from Oct 24-26th. For some reason, a lot of the hotels were sold out over the weekend and we ended up here. It is a 5 minute walk from the Bart Station at Montgomery St. Stayed in room 302 for 142/night. There is no air conditioning in the room, but the ceiling fan was sufficient. You can you open the windows for an additional breeze, but from previous posters, there is a noise factor. Bathroom was small and clean. There is a desk and chair, flat screen tv, blow dryer is in a drawer under the tv, queen size bed. I would stay here again.

<Content>We Picked a Winner! This was our first time to San Francisco and were overwhelmed by all the choices on Trip Advisor. This little hotel seemed to stand out as being in an excellent location and at an affordable price. We had a super worry free week. Each day we would step out onto the street to a new adventure. We also took advantage of the 3 day transit pass and it worked out great. From the hotel you can walk to alot of destinations if you are so inclined.The front desk were polite and efficient and helped arrange our shuttle for the trip back to the airport. Cleaning staff are awesome !!!

<Content>Good value  This hotel is at a nice central location close to Chinatown and Union Square. The recption staff was friendly and the room was nice and clean (although we were bemused to find everything from the TV remote control to the hairdryer nailed/screwed/velcroed/glued to the furniture) and good value for money.

<Content>Great location, pleasant hotel A very decent hotel at a great location. China town and Union square are at a very short walking distance. The hotel itself is clean and bathrooms have been recently renovated. Keep in mind that the hotel is at quite a noisy location. If you are sensitive to noise I would not recommend th Baldwin. Earplugs will prove to be useful. All in all a great hotel for a city break.

<Content>Good value My wife and I stayed at the Baldwin five nights at the end of September, 2008. The location is ideal, although in a vibrant neighborhood in a bustling city there was the obvious nighttime noise. But nothing overwhelming. Great access to restaurants, stores and public transit.The building, while old, clearly has been well maintained and has a lot of character. The rooms (we had two, as the helpful staff allowed us to move away from a room near the elevator after day 1) had good, updated bathrooms. Rooms lacked frills, but were excellent for the price. The mattresses were very hard.Only complaint would be noise from what appeared to be the elevator shaft. The elevator functioned well for us, but made a tremendous racket while in operation that could be heard clearly and loudly from our first room (ending in 1) and could even be heard faintly from the 2 room.But overall, the Baldwin was an excellent home for our trip.

<Content>Fantastic location and a great deal This hotel is a complete gem.The location is absolutely fantastic - you are within walking distance of 2 BART stations, the cable car line, Union Square and Chinatown. The front desk staff were very helpful. The rooms were very tired looking but in a way that looked that it had been cleaned a lot over the years. Looking like it has been cleaned a lot is not a bad thing for a room!The shower was not very good and the elevator was slow. But apart from that I think this is a great hotel for people planning to do lots of shopping or partying in San Francisco.

<Content>Decent value, great location PROS:The Baldwin Hotel has a location that can't be beat. My husband and I chose the hotel because It is easily accessible near the Montgomery BART station and the venue of the wedding we were attending. Also, it is just a block away from Chinatown (you can literally see the Chinatown gate from the hotel doorway), North Beach, and is amidst all the great downtown SF shopping. The staff were helpful and housekeeping service was good. Room decor was classy and clean.CONS:There is no free internet service which seems crazy to me in this day and age, especially in a city like San Francisco. Also, the only elevator is this loud old machine and our room happened to be right next to it. Try to request a room that is not adjacent to the elevator, otherwise you will be tossing and turning on Saturday nite when people return to the hotel at all hours of the night. Another downside is the only ice machine is in the hotel lobby.

<Content>Great little hotel in a Perfect Location! My hubby  I took a 5 day trip to SF  stayed at the Baldwin. We couldn't have been more pleased! Sure the room was a little dated, but it only adds to its charm. We booked a double room, thinking that meant a queen size bed, but I think it was a full size. But we made do with it! We could've upgraded, but how much were we really going to sleep while in such a great city!The elevator was a little slow, but we were on the top floor  had an amazing view! We slept with our windows open for the fresh air  because we were so high up, traffic noise was not a problem. We had friends in the city  when they came to pick us up from the hotel they couldn't believe the location! They are going to have other friends  family stay there while visiting them. Again, I can't state any clearer how great this location was! Walking distance to everything. We took the metro quite a bit  it was easy to use! Great little bagel shop with fresh juice around the corner for breakfast! We ate at Farallon (amazing!) and Bix Supperclub (quite an experience! we even saw a couple of actors there!)If you have any other questions, just shoot me a message!

<Content>Great Hotel !!! What a great Hotel. We were a bit concerned at what it would be like as it was the most reasonable hotel we could find. We shouldn't have worried. The location is great and safe - right outside the China Town gate. The staff could not have been more pleasent or helpful. Room was quite small but spotless and recently renovated. Wouldn't hestitate on staying again.

<Content>Basically OK The Baldwin is OK. The staff are friendly, the location is good (right near Chinatown) and the windows open, so you can get fresh air. I also liked the fact that it was not affiliated with a chain. My only complaint is that it's frumpy without being interesting. All of the furnishings look like they were chosen by someone who had forgotten his glasses and randomly picked things out at a Home Depot closeout sale.

<Content>A bit of a hassle We stayed here for 4 nights. On the plus side, the location was very convenient, it was right outside Chinatown and was an easy walk to SFMOMA, the Ferry Building, and bus stops. The room and bathroom were clean and okay, although I asked for an extra pillow because the one pillow I got was flat and hard. Having just a ceiling fan and no A/C, it got too hot in our room. What really didn't help is that the ancient radiator in the room, while technically turned off, was still running a little bit of hot water. The front desk guy came up to look at it but really couldn't do anything about it. Our room faced the street, so there was definitely noise to deal with, but that would have been okay. What wasn't okay was the constant banging sound (something in the building rattling, maybe the elevator shaft) that was so loud I could hear it through earplugs. Couldn't sleep through that. On our 2nd day there, even though we left the Do Not Disturb sign on our door, our room was cleaned anyway. This was just a little annoying because the whole reason we put the sign out is because we don't need new towels every day or to have our room cleaned when we've barely been in it. On our 3rd morning there, we had no water pressure in our shower. Another time our room got cleaned and the bar of soap we had only used for 2 days was thrown away and replaced with a new one, wrapped in plastic. As eco-conscious travelers, this was irritating to see.We stayed here to save some money, but in the end, the prices were still too high for what you get.

<Content>Ideal! Had a great 3 night stay here. The staff are helpful, the rooms spotless and the location great. I am so glad we didn't go for some fancy named hotel with no substance. The ceiling fan was totally adequate (coming from Scotland I was surprised how chilly San Francisco could be!!), and although not the biggest the room definitely big enough. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for good value close to Union Sq

<Content>Great hotel in SF The Baldwin Hotel is an excellent choice of lodging in San Francisco. We could see the gate to ChinaTown from our window. You can walk anywhere from this location. It is a few minutes walk to the BART, cable cars, buses and many wonderful restaurants. We couldn't have picked a more perfect location at a reasonable price!!! Our room was spacious, very comfortable and clean. Though our room faced the street the noise of traffic, garbage trucks, etc.... was not enough to bother us or keep us awake. The people at the front desk were always very helpful in answering any questions. I highly recommend this hotel and would stay here again.

<Content>Great value, great location My wife and I just stayed in the Baldwin Hotel for five nights and we enjoyed a very pleasant stay. We booked through an online service, pre-paid and took BART from San Francisco Airport, with a subway stop three blocks from the Baldwin. Check-in was quick and easy. Our room was on the 10th floor, with a queen-size bed and private bath. The room was small but very clean and the maid service every day was thorough. There were only two pillows on the bed but when we asked for two more they happily complied. I have read some complaints about the front desk but that was not our experience at all; they were always very friendly and helpful. The first night we stayed there it was hot but a ceiling fan kept it pretty comfortable. After that the temp. dropped and it was very comfortable. The elevator is slow but not so much as to be a problem. The location is excellent, right down the block from Chinatown; just beyond Chinatown is North Beach (a little Italy) and a bit farther Coit Tower (with another slow elevator that is worth the $5 charge to the top, where there are spectacular views). Union Square is also near, as is the cable car terminus down to Fisherman's Wharf. Trips to Alacatraz leave from Pier 33 but make a reservation - those trips fill up fast in the summer. The cable car trip is fun but there are long waits at the turn-arounds. We also took BART to the F line trolley to Fisherman's Wharf, which also worked well. There's also a Starbucks just up the block from the Baldwin. Checkout is at 11 a.m. and our plane did not leave until 5 p.m. However, they let us leave our bags at the front desk and we wandered around Chinatown for a few more hours. One depressing note: there are a lot of homeless in the general area, though we did not see any congregating at the Baldwin. Some are pretty aggressive demanding money though overall it is more than anything else a very sad testiment to our society's inability to make these folks' lives better than sleeping on the streets and begging.

<Content>Basic Hotel but Great Location The Baldwin should really get a 3 rating, however the location and comparisons to other SF hotels for the price gives it the extra edge. Make no mistake, this is an old-style, bare bones hotel with no extra amenities. No AC, a creaky, slow old elevator, and very sloooow front desk sevice. However management has made the best of what it has, and the room I had smelled of fresh paint and the bathroom was newly redone, with immaculately white grout, new tiles and fixtures, and an effort to give a sense of a nice stay with decent toiletries.There is no AC, but a large ceiling fan that did its job on a spring evening. The front desk is usually manned by one, maybe two people who do not like to multi-task. Many Europeans seem to stay here, and the language barrier, as well as the ridiculous amount of paperwork upon check-in, as well as an antiquated computer system and the use of old fashioned metal keys leads to a lengthy wait should you be in line. Check in and check out take over 15 minutes-- There is decent free coffee in the lobby 24 hours a day, which is a nice touch. The beds have a lot to be desired, and the pillows are synthetic and flat. Only two pillows on a queen bed instead of four, and a cheap, thin cover with no extra blanket in the closet. On the plus side, there is a large safe in the closet to hold laptops and large personal items, and when you leave your room you can use the deadbolt lock in addition to the handle lock. Also, the hotel locks the front door between the hours of 10pm and 6am to keep non-guests out, and guests can enter with a key. The front desk always had someone there at late and early hours, for added security.The location cannot be beat. Turn in any direction from the front door and Union Square is all around you with its many restaurants and shops. The gate to Chinatown is right there as well. Close to the financial district too.There are many boutique hotels in SF, and you never quite know what you are getting yourself into, especially in the lower price ranges. With the Baldwin, it pretty much meets average expectations, with no negative surprises, and even a few positive ones, like how clean it is, good security, and the overall feeling that at least an effort is being made to make the best of what they have. The neighborhood is great and vibrant, and again, with Union Square, some of it can turn shady fast. Not so with this location. In all, I would stay here again if my more favored (luxury) hotels are seasonally priced out of my range. This is a great choice for a good value in an excellent setting.

<Content>Cozy Cozy in every sense of the word. Our room was small but comfortable. Very clean, new furniture, good bed. Nice bathroom with claw-foot tub. Made for some interesting showers and a really nice bath. As reported, no a/c, but the ceiling fan helped. Our window opened to the alley so there was some street noise. Forwarned, we brought a small sound machine. If the fan is enough, the double-paned windows shut out the outside noise excellently. No noise from the room next door.The staff is friendly, responsive, and knowledgable about the area. The Baldwin is a great starting point to just about anywhere in town. Cable cars, busses, and BART all nearby.Reasonable by San Francisco standards, the Baldwin is a real find!P.S. The (single) elevator is no slower than a lot of hotels I've been in, and faster than some.

<Content>Great Value  A Great hotel on a Great location, 10 steps away from the gate to China Town and 2 blocks from Union Square. Great value for this location.Be aware of two things:1. You're staying in a big city so at night there is some noise outside: they pick up the garbage with a big noizy truck, they fill the newspaper boxes, clean the streets and some people like to honk the horn when driving. Don't take a streetview room if this bothers you.2. Most rooms don't have aircon, so if you have to open the window to get some fresh air you have more noise from the garbage trucks etc.Again: these are minor issues if you concider the great location and low prices!

<Content>Great Location - Great Value I stayed at the Baldwin for just one night, before moving on to fancier digs when the remainder of my group arrived in the city. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay, and consider this hotel one of the best bargains I have come across. The hotel is located within a couple of blocks of Union Square and is, therefore, within an easy walk of just about any shopping or eating you might want to do while in San Francisco. The staff was very helpful and very knowledgeable about the area. The bathroom in my room was honestly just about the cleanest I have ever encountered in a hotel. The bed was comfortable, and the room the perfect size for me. There is only one small elevator, and it is slow, and the street noise can be excessive, especially in the early morning. However, these will be minor issues if you ask for a room in the back of the hotel on a lower floor. All in all, I can highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great location, good price Great rates for a hotel on such a convenient location. Just half a block from the Chinatown gate, a few blocks from Union Square and lots of great stores, theaters en restaurants within walking distance. The room rates are being raised however by parking expenses... The hotel offers a $ 25 a day deal with a local parking service but you should really consider parking a little further out to save on costs or take public transportation or a taxi.The hotel itself was pretty basic. Clean room but small. The bathroom too. The storage closet (with personal safe and ironing board) was bigger! Hardly any noise coming from other rooms but very unpleasant was the noise coming from the alley below when they came to empty the dumpsters at 4 a.m. Another annoying noise came from the shower. Whenever we turned it on, it made an incredibly loud screatching noise that was just deafening! No idea what caused it. Skip the coffee in the lobby (yuck!) and go to Starbucks two doors down in stead.

<Content>Hidden Gem in San Francisco The Baldwin Hotel was the perfect choice for our recent trip to San Francisco. It was very clean, quaint and affordable. In a city that is very pricey, from it's stores to luxury hotels, it was the perfect no frills hotel. It was located right outside the entrance to China Town, a few blocks from the BART station, trolleys, streetcars or buses. We would definitely stay there again if we ever return to San Francisco.

<Content>So so Hotel room was small and not a great view. The parking ramp was two blocks away to get our vehicle and $30 extra to park in the ramp in addition to the regular hotel booking. That may be how all of San Francisco is, I'm not really sure. The area was really nice and the hotel employees were very helpful in telling us how to get around town and where to go.

<Content>Great location and value We stayed here four nights and I would stay again. It's a convenient location and a good value. Our room was small but big enough to unpack our bags and get them out of the way. The bathroom was likewise small but very clean and had a claw-foot tub. There's a Starbucks a few doors away and lots of great dining options. The staff was pleasant. I felt quite safe coming in and out while my husband was at meetings. We took the BART in from the airport -- the Montgomery station is a few blocks from the hotel.

<Content>Great value I stayed at the Baldwin for two nights while I attended a seminar at the Grand Hyatt a block away. The hotel is right at the gate to Chinatown on Grant Avenue. My flight happened to get in very early and after a BART trip to the Montgomery station and the short walk to the hotel, I asked if it was possible to check in and was graciously accommodated.I had a single room on the second floor just above the lobby. Although I had requested the quietest room possible, the room was right on the street. It was noisy but not unbearably so; the windows are really good, and I always travel with earplugs. Had I not been there on a weekend, it might have quieted down much earlier than it did on Friday and Saturday nights. I was really tired so I wasn't disturbed by the city noise (only thing that woke me up was the 2:00 a.m. garbage truck) . The room was super clean. There is a digital safe in the roomy closet. Wireless internet is available for $9/day. Water pressure was excellent and all in all, I had no complaints.This is a ten-story property and I'm really glad my room was only on the second floor--the elevator is slower than anything I've ever seen, so after getting my bag to the room I used the stairs for the duration of my stay. The staff was friendly, helpful, and efficient, and at the AAA rate of only $104 per night, I could not have asked for a better experience!

<Content>Great Value in San Francisco Clean, warm and safe. Super site to stay at by yourself or family. Save some money and stay here. Great Location for downtown and Moscone center! 1/2 block away from the gate to Chinatown on Grant street. ( could see it from my room window) and about 3-4 blocks away from the BART Montgomery station. It is an easy walk to Moscone center down Kearney street. If you want to catch muni you can on Kearney or Market street! i recommend getting a city map with the Muni and Bart routes. You can get this at any 7-11 for $4 or here is an online version which you can print up and bring with you. http://transit.511.org/static/providers/maps/SF_712200711012.pdfWireless Internet access $10 per day, tel calls 50 cents a pop. (I recommend buying a calling card at the 7-11 1or2 block away on Pine street) I bought some food at the 7-11about 2 blocks away . There are numerous other inexpensive restaurants within walking distance. I recommend Lori's Diner near Powell and Market on the second floor. About $20 for nice turkey dinner with 2 beers. I didn't try the restaurant in the lobby. The folks at the front desk will watch your bags when you check out if you want to go walking about for a while..http://maps.google.com/maps?f=qhl=engeocode=q=grant+street+san+francisco+casll=36.71431,-76.24785sspn=0.593359,1.109619ie=UTF8ll=37.792117,-122.404647spn=0.00457,0.008669z=17layer=ccbll=37.789924,-122.405439cbp=1,341.66173738753173,,0,-2.1873763128327104 this is the view from the street. Print out this map to find the directions to the BART which costs $6 riding from the SFO airport. Wireless internet was $10 per day and they have parking available for about $30 day down the street. Definately recommend! There are a lot of smaller hotels like this in area.. search the internet.. not all are on the internet sitesorbitz etc.. I found this fthrough chinatown website.. http://www.ihsadvantage.com/h/hotelinfo/san_francisco/ca/us/83079/?pfs=887#trafficLogID=507700402visited=trueEnjoy your stay!

<Content>Best deal in San Fran! Hands down! Baldwin hotel is a great finding! Cheap, clean, spacious and amazingly central to all things San Francisco! If you're going there, save your money knowing you'll stay at a decent hotel by booking your room there! Truly above all expectations. And I was travelling with my uber-picky boss - and she was pleased! The only thing disappointing about this hotel is that the staff doesn't seem to know much about social life to give good tips on good clubs and bars, but hey, that only added to the experience as we had to explore by ourselves!

<Content>Excellent for the price Nice place. Very convenient downtown, next to Chinatown, near Union Square, Moscone, etc. Room was small, but how much space do you need? Bed was comfy. Shower was a tub with a curtain, and it worked GREAT. Room was clean; service was good. Like many big city hotels, you might hear a dumpster being emptied late at night or early in the morning. If you're a nut job who expects 4 stars at a 2 star price, pick another place. Otherwise, I'd recommend this to anyone on a budget, who wants a centrally located hotel. I was pleasantly surprised.

<Content>Perfect location, good service I stayed at the Baldwin end of October. The location of the hotel is great, everything is close.The room was quite big (with 1 queen-size bed), at least bigger than I expected. The furniture is old but ok. The bathroom was very clean and everything was in good shape and working. I had a room on the 6th floor with windows on two sides of the room, both of them could be openend. The staff at the reception was very helpful.I would come back!

<Content>Perfect Location  Stayed at the Baldwin Oct. 12 - 14, 2007. First time there. The person at the front desk was very helpful throughout our stay. Checking in was flawless, the room was average size for classic San Francisco hotels. Our 10th floor room had 2 walls of windows that opened and we were high enough to see the city. The location puts you 45 seconds from the gates of China town. You are next door to a Starbucks and across the street from a upscale wine lounge.No noise at night other than a fire truck.We took BART to get to the hotel and from the Montgomery Station you are only 3-4 blocks away. Easy enough to roll the suitcases to the hotel.Will stay here again.

<Content>We got poor sleep The value, location, service for this hotel was great. However, we got poor sleep the Friday night we were there because trash pick-up was outside our window at 3AM. There was also a really loud furnace in our room that made funny noises all night. The next morning we had hotel personnel shut if off and that helped a lot. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful.

<Content>Good Price, Great Location Stayed here this past weekend. It's a simple, gracious older hotel that has excellent proximity to a number of San Francisco attractions. Chinatown's gate is half a block up Grant; Union Square itself if a couple of blocks away.There's no air conditioning, which isn't much of an issue at this time of year. My room faced Grant, but being on a higher floor, it was pretty quiet. The loudest it got was when some folks came stumbling back from a party, and I didn't hear them anymore once they actually went into their own room.Only downside is that the in-room copy of the free tourist magazine had a page ripped out by a previous occupant. I put it in the trash. The maid put it back on the desk, so I just ripped it in half and put it back into the trash. These magazines are free, so it's not as though they need to reuse them until all the pages are ripped from them. :)

I usually patron the Kimpton Hotel Group; 4-5 Star Hotels and pay a small fortune every time. However, the Baldwin fits my needs perfectly as the location is amazing and the rooms are clean. For the rate you could not find anything better.

<Content>Awesome location! Great deal! Like the others say this was a great location. Practically everything is within walking distance, and if not there is public transporation right around the corner (subways, busses, and cable cars). We were a one minute walk from the gates of Chinatown which was awesome. The room was quite large and clean, the staff were easygoing and tried to be helpful whenevery we had any questions. Even though our room faced the street, we had no problem with noise. The only downside was poor water pressure in the shower (also the hallway had a bit of a funky smell - but our room was fine)

<Content>Great location \, but noisy Stayed at the Baldwin Hotel for four nights. The location is absolutely great if you need to stay this close to Union Square and/or Chinatown.all of the staff that i met was very friendly and the cleaners are doing an execellent job. The bath room was qiute big with a very small claw foot bath tub.The bed was really comfortable and the ceiling fan didn't really make that much noice, but when I found the noice from Grant St. to be a bit too loud - especially when they started to tear up the street outside one night.... ABSOLUTELY NOT THE BALDWIN'S FAULT!!

<Content>Baldwin was perfect! The Baldwin exceeded our expectations. I wanted to stay somewhere with my wife that was $100 or less, but not seedy. Not only was the Baldwin not seedy, it was pretty elegant! The people who worked the front desk were some of the best I've encountered - extremely friendly and helpful. Although check-in was not until the mid-afternoon, they were able to get us into our room at 9am.Our room was fabulous. It overlooked Grant St. and was immaculately clean. Not large, but not ridiculously small either. The bathroom was nice with good water pressure. The Baldwin's location is absolutely perfect to seeing San Francisco, and in a very safe area. There is no continental breakfast, though they do offer some subpar coffee. Also, the wireless internet is not free (and quite expensive, so we passed). Overall, I would absolutely recommend the Baldwin to friends.

<Content>Good, basic accomodations that did not disappoint The hotel is fairly clean and in a great location. It is on a very busy street so you do hear a lot of traffic noise during the day, although at night it's not that bad. The location can't be beat if you want to be close to shopping, Chinatown, Union Square, and public transportation. My room was small, clean if you don't look to hard, and freshly painted. It had a clawfoot bathtub and a view down to the shops on Grant Street. As long as you are not expecting anything more than a reasonably clean, safe hotel with basic accomodations that's not fancy, you will not be disappointed here. In this price range, it's better than the majority. For the right price, I would not hesitate to stay here again.

<Content>Great locaction What a terrific find! This hotel is located right at the China Town Gate and only 2 陆 blocks from Union Square There are 3 parking garages within a block and a half. The room was not huge, but we had room enough for the 3 of us. Everything in our room was new: the carpet, linens, fabric, windows, tiles, furniture and paint with all the charm and quirks of a historic old hotel. I appreciate a hotel room where I can open the window. We stayed on the 9th floor and the water pressure was fine鈥攖he shower had a low flow head, not much you can do about that. The staff was friendly and helpful. It can be noisy鈥攜ou are in the middle of a very busy city. We just closed the window and the sirens went away.

Spartan but well-scrubbed and well-kept rooms and pleasant staff. Compares favorably with the more expensive places we've stayed in San Francisco. Good value and great location at Chinatown Gate.

<Content>Stink, Stank, Stunk There were cockroackes under the ice machine, weird stains on the carpet of our room, and the clean up by the maids was awful. Not only that but you nearly trip over all the pan handlers outside the door of the place. Take a wrong turn in this area and you may never be heard from again, scary!!! Let me not forget the incredible rude woman at the desk.

<Content>Wouldn't stay anywhere else... ...in S.F. unless I decided to spend lots of money. So if you're traveling on a budget or simply don't feel like spending those dollars on a hotel room, by all means stay here. The Baldwin hotel is located at the Chinatown gate, so you're close to Chinatown (obviously), Union Square and the Market St. BART station (don't use Powell Street station if you're offended/bothered by beggars and the likes..the walk to and from Market St station, however, is perfectly ok). Walking to Fisherman's Wharf takes about 15 minutes.I stayed there for three nights in late March. The room was ok and actually more than I expected for under 鈧?0 a night. A bit like two to three star hotels in European capitals. The bathroom was large and everything was clean, which to me is the most important thing when it comes to hotel rooms. Staff was always nice and helpful. Again, the location cannot be beat and I wouldn't even consider staying anywhere else, as there are plenty of other opportunities to spend your money on when in S.F.

<Content>Great Hotel!! I would recommend this hotel, great location and a great price. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The rooms very comfortable and clean. If I visited San Francisco again I would stay here. The airport shuttle bus drops you off and picks you up right outside the hotel.

<Content>It was all good!! I read over 60 reviews on various hotels in SF before choosing The Baldwin Hotel. Not fancy, but completely adequate. I recommend this hotel highly. Yes, it was very plainly furnished, no clock, and the bathroom mirror is on opposite wall than sink. But, everything else was just what we are looking for. Stayed 3 nights in March. Very safe location. Friendly, helpful staff. Excellent price. Clean, comfortable room. 1 block to Chinatown.I did not miss a mini fridge or micro. I definately will stay here again.

<Content>Clean and Simple I booked through Opodo and got a reasonable deal ($70 per night with coffee but no breakfast) although a collegue found a cheaper rate next door at the Astoria ($50/night included a small breakfast).I was pleased with the hotel which was nothing fancy but clean and secure with friendly and helpful staff. For those without wireless laptops, there was internet available in the lobby for $10 per hour.The location was excellent, right by the entrance to China town, near Nob Hill and not far from Little Italy.An overall favourable experience.

<Content>Clean, Comfortable Hotel In Excellent Location My husband and I stayed for a week at this hotel. The location is very convenient (1 min walk from Chinatown, shops etc), lots of trams/trolleys/buses nearby also very easy to walk to most places. We also felt very safe walking around at night (some of the other hotels in this price range were in dodgy areas). The room was very clean, the bed very comfortable and i would definitely recommend this hotel to a friend.

<Content>Nothing fancy but still liked it This place is a terrific bargain for San Francisco. As described in other reviews it is nothing fancy and in fact the rooms are rather spartan but the bed was very comfortable, it's well located and considering the location the street noise is not bad. I was traveling by myself when I stayed here and it met my criteria for something that wasn't a budget buster but still well located and a place that I would feel comfortable as a solo female. I arrived on a late flight and after asking the front desk clerk if it was safe I ventured out to a 7Eleven to get a snack at 2am and felt ok doing it.

<Content>Good hotel, though noisy This hotel is quaint, clean and situated close to San Francisco's Union Square. The staff members were kind and helpful, and we got a great deal for a weekend night using Travelocity. The room was simple and clean -- nothing fancy, but nice. The shower was an old-fashioned bathtub with curtains that go around the entire perimeter. Our experience was generally good except for the following:- There was a considerable amount of noise outside our room at 8 a.m. on Saturday morning. It sounded like glass bottles being dumped into a garbage bin or truck.- The old-fashioned furnace in the room made it incredibly hot, and it wasn't clear how to turn it down or off.- The hotel has a deal with a nearby parking garage for $20, which is actually a good deal. However, it's a couple blocks away, with no valet service to the garage. Not a fun walk back to the hotel if it's late at night  cold!

<Content>Great Hotel and Great Locations!!!! Only One Concern The hotel location was great. Extremely clean. Close to ChinaTown and the shopping district. My wife and I stayed her for two nights and were able to walk to everything. Hotel offers a discounted rate at a nearby parking garage which worked perfect for our stay. My only negative was the noise in the room next to the elevator. The elevator cable beat the walls when moving from floor to floor. I think rooms 201, 301, 401.... are next to the elevator. Other than this one detail, I would highly receommend this hotel.

<Content>Great Find My husband and I had an excellent stay at the Baldwin Hotel (Oct 21-26). The staff were very friendly even at 11 pm when we checked in. The room was large with a spacious walk in closet. The bathroom was spotless and looked new. The room was thoroughly cleaned everyday and we had no complains whatsoever. There was fresh coffee in the foyer everyday......way better than Starbucks a few doors away. The hotel is close to Chinatown and other cafe's, restaurants and to main sights.We highly recommend this to all travellers to San Fran. With regards to the saxophone player.....his repertoire wasn't great but it was very nice having music drifting up into your room after a very long day of sightseeing........seemed like the real deal.Overall...great , would love to go back again

<Content>Great Location, Great Price We were amazed how centrally located this hotel was, for the cheap price per night. We would suggest getting a room with the gigantic clawfoot tub, perfect for soaking worn out legs from walking up and down the hills! The room itself was in need of a fresh coat of paint, etc., but for the price you can't get a better location. It's wonderful to be able to step out the front door and see the gate to Chinatown and the best shopping in town! Not to mention how close you are to the public transit and cable cars! You're never too far from great food, Chinatown's dim sum is excellent and there's tons of continental and fancy restaurants just down the block. The staff was very courteous and willing to help with anything. Do be cautious of the room door locks, we're not sure what happened but it seems like the door keys open more doors than just your door, but we're not certain. Overall a great place to stay!

<Content>A big up for Baldwin! I'm so glad we took a look at this tripadvisor site before we made reservations because like the others below we are completely satisfied with Baldwin Hotel.We took a room w/ two doublebeds and it had a walk-in-closet and a very clean bathroom w/ a spacious bathtub.No view what so ever but that didn't matter since we were seldom in our room. The location was fab! Close to everything, cable cars, attractions, shops...you name it. Very friendly staff as well.The only thing that was annoying - and the hotel had no part in that -was a saxophone player that unfortunately had his spot right under our window and who played the same tune over and over again...aaargh.But apart from that we sincerely recommend this hotel to everyone who travels on a reasonably low budget.

<Content>Run down hotel in a great location This hotel was in a great location . It is minutes from Union Square and china town and only 15 mins walk from fisherman鈥檚 wharf鈥?and it鈥檚 a nice walk too.The hotel itself is run down and in need of new carpets etc.. our bed was not a full double so I was disappointed. When I asked to move to a room with a larger bed they said they had nothing available! It can be noisy and I did hear the elevator from both rooms鈥?only slightly but there is no getting away from it. However I suppose it鈥檚 a case of you get what you pay for. In relation to other hotels it is cheap and if you want to spend your money on the attractions its ideal. I found the staff ok but nothing special. Not a bad hotel in a wonderful city

Getting anywhere was as simple as a short walk or calling the desk to make transportation arrangements. The room was clean, comfortable, and a decent size considering the age of the hotel. Overall this hotel was a great value!

<Content>Great for the price! The Baldwin is a 1940's hotel just below the Chinatown Gate. Good location for shopping and getting anywhere on mass transit. Get the Tourist Pass and go crazy. The rooms are good size, very clean and reasonably quiet (stay away from the elevator!). No breakfast, but places to eat are nearby and abundant. The staff was friendly and very helpful when needed. No clock in room and crap TV, but really not issues for me. Good value.

<Content>A Pleasant Stay We stayed there four nights. The room was simple and smaller than chain hotels but if you're there to see the city and not the room than it's not a problem. The room was very clean and in good condition with the exception of the carpeting which needed to be replaced. No noise from other rooms and we weren't near the elevator so no comment there. I must say the staff at the front desk was very friendly and helpful in their suggestions of places to go. Overall, for what we paid for the room, we were pleased. Oh, and the best part - the location! Chinatown is right there. North Beach, Union Square, BART, and cable cars are all within walking distance. We would stay here again.

<Content>Good bargain After I booked it, I learned Hotwire rates the Baldwin as a one-star hotel. That made me apprehensive, but my stay in late July effectively erased that. Hotwire's rankings are based, in part, on a hotel's amenities. By that standard, it's true that the Baldwin is far from luxury. The rooms don't have refrigerators, hair dryers, safes, coffee makers, air conditioning and the TV doesn't have a movie option. There's no restaurant on the premises and no room service or nightly turn-down service. No swimming pool, either.While these are all fine features to have, they do affect the room price. Not having them also affects the room price -- in this case making the Baldwin a bargain in expensive downtown San Francisco.Here's what my room did have:Lots of space and absolute cleanliness. Hotel-average furniture. Two very comfortable beds with good mattresses. New windows that effectively kept out street noise. Thick wall construction -- no sound transmission from other rooms. A ceiling fan. Cable TV. Usual shampoo/soap. Lots of good-quality towels. Bathroom that looked as if it had been recently modernized with new tile floor. General look of good maintenance -- no chipped paint or dirty walls or windows. In the lobby there's free a.m. coffee and tea. You can borrow a hair dryer. There's a public internet computer (pay extra to use it). There's also parking at a garage around the corner (think the hotel's Web site has info about that). The staff was helpful and courteous.This hotel is in a safe area just steps from Chinatown and the Financial District, making it extremely well located for business or vacation travel. There's a Starbucks in the same block, a Japanese restaurant next door, a cafe across the street, a convenience store around the corner and more Chinese restaurants than you can count within about three blocks. In recent years I've stayed in half a dozen of San Francisco's small boutique hotels (and one large one -- the Marriott, which was filthy). While I can't say the Baldwin is my absolute favorite (I do like an in-room fridge), it truthfully is as nice or nicer than others that cost more.I'd stay there again in an instant.

<Content>Great Price, Great Location, Great Hotel The Baldwin Hotel is located about half a block away from the gates of Chinatown. I was able to look outside the window and see the gates of Chinatown--wonderful view. I got a twin size bed room. The room is decent size. Each room has its own bathroom (HUGE PLUS for a budget hotel). One strange thing was there was no mirror above the sink in the bathroom. I found shaving a bit awkward. The mirror was located behind (not on the same side as the sink but opposite). Old style claw feet bathtub w/ shower. I will definitely stay here. It is also a 5-minute walk to the financial district. If you are on a budget, then this hotel is a fantastic place to stay.

<Content>Great Deal!! I would stay at the Baldwin again in a heartbeat if I were to return to San Fran. The rooms were basic and a little small but VERY clean. The bathrooms are large and there is a walk-in closet for great storage. The hotel is in a great, safe location. I stayed with 3 other girls in our mid-twenties and I never felt unsafe. The hotel is close to the Powell and Montgomery stop on the BART and in the middle of the high-end shopping district. It is about a block from Union Square and about 50 yards from the entrance of Chinatown. If you are looking for an affordable place to stay so that you can spend your money on sightseeing and shopping the Baldwin is for you!

<Content>Perfect for the price Honestly, I didn't expect much when my husband and I was going to SF. We know it's an expensive city, and USD 90 for two nights sounds a little too good to be true. But when we arrived (we only walked a few blocks from Montgomery bart station) at the hotel, we were gladly surprised. The building itself is interesting, the size of the room is considerably big (not huge, but definitely not small) and clean, the location is awesome (1 minute walk from Chinatown gate), the people are very helpful and friendly. I couldn't recommend this hotel more. It's worth every cent.
