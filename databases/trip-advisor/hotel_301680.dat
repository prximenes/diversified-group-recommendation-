<Content>Neither Here Nor There Clean, efficient, but rather soulless hotel. No views to speak of, other than the port (fascinating though it is) on one side.Service is fine, gym is compact but adequate. Good location in CBD, but not the place I'd come on leisure.

<Content>Underwhelming M Totally unremarkable downtown business hotel. No big complaints, but seemed a little dated and tired. Bottled water provided in the room was astoundingly bad tasting, so watch out.Biggest issue- badly nickel and dime on extra costs. Internet was like S$30 / night -- in a city with free wireless! (of course, you couldn't get it from the room). The Internet / breakfast package was  S$40, despite the fact that you could get breakfast via room service for less than S$10.Also, my co-worker had no hot water at all one morning she was there. Unacceptable at this price!Location is OK -- close to Metro, but in a downtown area that completely shuts down at night and on the weekend.

<Content>Good business hotel; great staff My second stay at this hotel for a business trip and booked a suite. Price much higher (even with the poor exchange rate) than on last visit athough all services the same. Unlike a previous reviewer, I prefer the seaward view given that the alternative is an office block and a street. The staff in the club lounge are great - happy and smiling (well most of them) and consistently helpful. Food quality and presentation is high. Give it a go for business anyway.

<Author>ahhhhhhhhhh
<Content>Not bad - been in nicer~! Got this on a deal from wotif. Good price. Hotel very flashy and new and room pretty trendy. Internet charges a real rip off when half the hotels in the world now give it away. Just search local wireless and you'll be able to 'borrow' signal from local offices anyways!Staff a little stressed on check but friendlier after that. ocation handy for a walk to China town and also for underground.Not bad all in all but much nicer hotels in Singapore for same price!

<Content>A nice hotel Got our 2 night stay from a 'secret deal' on a website so we were unaware upon booking. We weren't disappointed. Not only was the price right for such a good location and modern hotel, but the 拢20 upgrade to 'M Class' they offer is an absolute bargain.Free food and drink in the M Lounge, as well as the chic room (all of which is on the 28th floor) with all the trimings was well worth the extra expense.The location is perfect for connecting to public transport/metro, and for wandering into the nearby chinatown.The view from the room was overlooking the docks which some may feel isn't the best, but personally I found amazing to watch the whole industriousness of the area, as well as the view out to sea.Staff were more than willing to help, with check-in and out being a breeze (There were staff literally falling over each other to help!)A great 2-3 night option.

<Content>Average - 100 better hotels in Singapore Started with checking in at 11pm after a late flight. Front desk told me didnt have my reservation. Showed my confirmation. No sorry Sir we don't have your reservation.....long pause. Um well can you fi me in? Ok. ordered room service as restaurant closed. Club sandwich arrived with only the bread and lettuce. Nothing else???? Room was large but was 2 single beds pushed together. Housekeeping made the bed to be a king after speaking with front desk after ahorrible night sleep. Maybe i had a bad run but i know for a fact there any many better hotels for a similar price in Singapore. This is not a 5 Star hotel.

<Content>Fantastic service, food, and rooms I had my wedding there and was assigned one of their biggest suites for an overnight stay. My only regret was not extending my stay! I had a marketing job which involved me organizing corporate seminars and small trade shows in hotel locations across Singapore, many of them 5* hotels, including the 6* Ritz Carlton. M Hotel is a 4* hotel and yet I was treated like royalty being congratulated by all the staff members we came into contact with including the front desk! I don't know why one reviewer commented badly on their event management skills when he didn't even hold any there. From my experience, their event organizers had great aptitude, attention to detail, and accurate delivery. Staff did not just sit there and take notes, they provided professional advice and came up with details that I haven't thought of in my years of event organizing experience! My suite was spacious, had zen-style furnishing, a jacuzzi bath and a separate shower. Although the shower area was tiny, the jacuzzi tub more than made up for it. The highlight was the glass walls of the toilet/bath that immediately fogged up electronically with a touch of a button on the remote. No other hotel in Singapore has this unique facility! View from window wasn't that spectacular, we got assigned one with views of the container shipping terminal as the suites with scenic views of the city or sea were already fully booked. There is a well-known spa facility within the hotel premises located on the pool floor, called HAATCH which is known locally for its state-of-the-art beauty technology. Package prices were a little too steep even after M Hotel guest discounts. Food is excellent. Some wedding dinner guests commended highly and claimed the quality exceeded that of prestigious venues such as the Ritz Carlton and Fullerton Hotels. I couldn't agree more, and better yet, the menu was customizable, you could suggest the chef used less salt, more chilli etc, and they would deliver just as you pleased. Of course I would return to stay.

<Content>Only if you have too.......... This is not the first time I have stayed here and this was the worst experience I have had in Singapore. Rooms are small, minimally appointed and tired. Coffee shop where they serve breakfast is nice and the quality of the food is just about acceptable, but they seem to have a problem with hot water as I could not get a tea or coffee made which was more than luke warm. They tried to charge me 3 times for the same business centre usage and thats after paying quite a hefty rate. By Singapore standards, this is a poor hotel.

<Content>Good Business Hotel Good business hotel in the business district. Very clean, though does miss a little character and agree with the others about the check-in staff.Bed I had was almost futon hard, and Breakfast was usual hotel price without being that exceptional which I thought was unusual for Singapore. Room was a very odd layout with nice amenities arranged in non-practical ways.There's also some construction next door right now, so suggest ensuring you get a room away from the construction (other colleague had an issue with the noise at night).One thing it does have is a very cool almost 70's bar which I would recommend for business get togethers after work.

<Content>Good weekend specials This hotel was the secret deal special on the wotif.com booking site.  The hotel is located in the CBD, which is deader than a doornail during the weekends, thus the special rate of $200 SGD per night (inclusive of taxes). The rate also included an upgrade to a Superior room, 3 pm checkout and an offer to upgrade to the Executive Floor for an additional 70 SGD ++ per night (which we declined). Anyone wanting breakfast would do well to upgrade, as the hotel's breakfast runs $31 SGD++ per person, whereas it's included on the Executive Floor, along with free flow non-alcoholic drinks during the day and three hours of cocktails with canapes in the evenings. Location wasn't really a factor for us, as we visit Singapore often and can get just about anywhere via the MRT, which is a five minute walk from the M Hotel.Those wanting to be in the middle of things in Singapore will be disappointed in this hotel, as it's located in the CBD, with not much else around.We found one Starbuck's, one Gloria Jeans and one Coffee Bean near the hotel, but all three were closed by early evening on Saturday.Our Superior room was located on the 18th floor. We were in a non smoking room, but there were cigarette burns on the furniture and a faint smell of smoke.We were told the room had a queen sized bed, and perhaps it did, but it was the smallest queen I'd ever slept on. It was comfortable enough, but tiny and a bit low to the ground.This hotel bills itself as a moderate business hotel and the room was indeed set up more for business than leisure.Our room was clean, except for the drapes which someone (presumably a kid), had gone after with a ball point pen and grubby fingers.The bathroom was small, but perfectly adequate. The sink area could have used more shelf space for storage of cosmetic items, but so it goes.Our room had a city view and was very quiet, but perhaps that was because the hotel was practically empty during our stay. We could hear a door slam once in awhile and I got the distinct impression that the hotel could be noisy during the week as the walls seemed a bit thin.The hotel served us well, but left the impression of a worn business hotel which had undergone a quick, cheap make-over. For instance, the closets, walls and desk top were a light, modern wood, yet the tops of the bedside tables were a mismatched dark, stain laminated surface. The door to the room was also dark ,and badly worn and chipped, yet the carpet appeared fairly new. It felt incongruous and a bit odd. The hotel service was a bit spotty. Very good at times, pretty awful at others. When we called for assistance our first night, we were told to first call Housekeeping, then Room Service, then Housekeeping again. We finally gave up and went down to the Concierge Desk where we were promptly assisted.All in all, this hotel worked well for us for a weekend getaway. I certainly wouldn't pay full price to stay here, but we felt we got our money's worth at $200 SGD a night.

<Content>Clean, but Don't Expect Much I had to make an urgent trip to Singapore in November and M was the only hotel with accommodation availability for 4 nights. Checked in at 'round about 5 pm. The front desk lady was polite but fairly incapable. I was told there wasn't a room for me, but when I requested her to check the data, a room somewhat appeared. Then she had my number of days of stay wrongly recorded, and my name... A Malay colleauge was asked to help her. She had a very bad running nose which she did not bother to blow. She was efficient, but curt.The room was clean, but the hot water facility was quite erratic. There was a night I had to wait for 5 minutes before the hot water ran. The maintenance man came after the problem resolved itself. Saving grace was the room cleaners who I found very efficient and polite. The operator who answered my call for a late night room service was very helpful too.Checking out was ok but service was curt.Unless absolutely neceesary, I do not think I will go back there again.

<Content>Noisy, useless internet, robotic staff Checkin was quick - I had goofed up and was supposed to arrive the day before but the hotel still charged me a penalty of one day for not arriving but I wasn't surprised as this is just standard practice.The check-in staff are robots. I asked for a quiet room but didn't get it. My room was facing towards the harbour and it was very noisy - there was like a very loud train shunting noise or a bit like a pile driver that used to go on all night till 3.30am every night I was there. I was with a group who were on a business conference and anyone on the harbour side got this noise but if you were on the other side it wasn't there. Some of the group I was with also complained but got various answers as to what it was. I was there only 3 days and I just put up with the noise to the point where I got used to it.The hotel wi-fi internet was included in my room rate but it had a very annoying habit of loggin me out every 10 to 15 minutes. This also happened to other people in my group and we were doing presentations in the hotel and it was very annoying doing an hour long presentation and having to re-login every 10 minutes in front of an audience. I complained to the front desk that there was a problem with the internet and they responded they couldn't do anything as it was an IT problem but they didn't even ask me what the problem was so I responded Are you going to ask me what the problem is? at which I got the standard answer that it was an IT matter and they couldn't do anything about it - they never asked me what the problem was. Just robots.The room rate they quote was S$310 then they put on a service charge of 10% which is something I only found out about at the checkout so the real room rate is $341 plus they add on 7%.GST so the total comes to S$365 per night. Why don't they just quote the true rate of $341 plus GST rather than add a 10% service charge/tip. They charge me including service chage and GST S$148 to launder 2 shirts, 3 T-shirts, 2 underpants and 3 pairs of socks. They chaged me including service charge and GST S$124 to print 116 pages in the Biz Centre.Room furniture is cheap but I found the bed hard but good. They have a kettle in the room which I like if you want to make a cup of tea. The shower is small but always had hot water. Everything worked well except the internet.Breakfast was good and we had lunch one day in the restaurant on the ground floor and it was very good.If they fixed the internet,got rid of the noise and put in real people at the check-in I would go back but as this is not likely I will not be returning.

<Content>Singapore has some great hotels... this isnt one of them... We arrived on a late flight with high hopes, its listed as five star so we were expecting good things. The staff were helpfull but the room was well below par. It was small, had a kinda IKEA fit out to it and the cheap fittings were scratched and needed replacing. There was also a large stain in the middle of the floor, not great. The bed was a double (not a queen or a king, not very 5*) and myself and my wife both rolled to the middle repeatedly in the night (cheap matress).Singapore has some great hotels, I've stayed in many of them, this is not one of them in my opinion. If you have an office nearby then go for it, its not that bad but unless you need to be there go for a better option.

<Content>I would definitely stay here again! I booked a club level room at the M Hotel and was completely satisfied. The bed was one of the most comfortable we have experienced (could be because of the 19+ hours of flight time.) The room itself was beautiful, and very clean. The air conditioning worked very well, even with the curtains opened. The club level boasts breakfast, cocktails in the evening with hors de' vores, and 2 hours of conference room use. Great for a businiess trip. When we entered the club lounge, we were greeted by name each time. The service was amazing. There were only two downsides: the shower is very small (with a bit of mold in the caulking, which we found at all three hotels in Singapore,) and the location. If you are doing business in the financial district, it is great. It is also convenient to the MRT Subway system. With a bit of knowledge, the MRT is a great way to get around...very clean and safe.All things considered, we would definitely stay in this hotel for our next Singapore trip.

<Content>Small and cute Room After spending my holidays in Koh samui and taking a late flight back to SG,we decided to stay in M hotel as it was my bday.Plus i had to work the next day so it was convinent for me to stay in the hotel since the hotel was only 5mins away from my office.I was suprised that when we were checking in,the staff didnt even mention anything about it being my bday.Usually,when i stay in any hotels on my bday,staffs are more attentive towards pleasing the guest.However,the room was a consolation,since all the basic facilities are available.I like the decent sized bath tub and the LCD screen TV in the room.Overall,i would like to stay in this Hotel again due to its location,near my office and near to the train station.

<Content>Enjoyed the M We stayed two weeks at the M Hotel while we relocated and searched for an apartment. We found the room to be spacious with comfortable furnishings, a large desk, and nice bath. All the restaurants had varied menus and attentive staff. The hotel personnel were very helpful and offered great advice which made our transition to Singapore much easier.

<Content>Good Clean Business Hotel I stayed at M Hotel for four nights in March 2007. It is a good hotel for business travelers. The rooms are decent size and comfortable with Hi-Speed Internet access (broad band) and with a desk working area.The location of the hotel is good, not a tourist area but you can walk about three block to the MRT (subway) and in three stops you are downtown, or a short 10 minute cab ride to get to the city center.The only negative thing I have to say about the hotel was its restaurant service. Most of the breakfast selection is Asian which is fine if you like that for breakfast. The Western food selection is limited to cold cereal, toast, and cold scrambled eggs. I ate dinner in the same restaurant one night and the food was no better, the steak was over cooked, and servings were tiny. Better to eat downtown or at the water front every other place I ate in Singapore was fabulous.

<Content>Very Good Business Hotel I stayed at 鈥淢鈥?Hotel for three nights during October 2006. This is a very good hotel for business travellers. The rooms are big and comfortable with internet access (broad band) and with a working area. Although I have stayed in a high floor, the view was not very good, but this is not very important if you are travelling for work.The location of the hotel is very good, although it is necessary to take a cab to get to the city center.

<Content>Nice hotel The M hotel is located in the business district of Singapore on Anson Road. I got a room on 24th floor overseeing Singapore harbour. The hotel has 4 elevators  you never have to wait long enough. The rooms are perfect for business travelers as the rooms come with hi-speed internet access (even though i did not use it), keyboard, cordless phone  pretty good cable channels including CNBC. It seems the hotel was recently renovated as most of the fittings  furnishings looked new.The only negative part of the hotel was its restaurant service. On my first day, the steward took more than ten minutes while i was seated there to take my order even though the restaurant was not full. In the morning when i went for the breakfast  while i was entering, a steward shouted at the top of her lung asking me to stop right there, asked my room no.  then very rudely took me to a tabel behind a huge column. I think the staff needs more training on its service standards.The location of the hotel is not in a tourist area but then you can always take a cab to Orchard Road, Esplanade, etc..which are a short ride away.Overall I liked the hotel  would love to go there again.

<Content>Good for business, bad for leisure I stay at this hotel every week and have done so for the past 18 months. If you are thinking of staying here, remember ...... THIS IS A BUSINESS HOTEL. It does not cater for leisure travellers that well .... no lobby lounge (just a small chinese tea bar) and no 'filipino band' playing in the evening. There is a pool but have never been there. The overall theme of the hotel is fairly sterile, but caters perfectly for the needs of the business traveller ... all of the rooms come with an ethernet cable, travel plug adapters, and cordless phone. All the staff know me here by name, and of course i have had a few hicupps - one in particular where i had to write a two page letter to the GM about one of his duty managers who was just plain rude to me. Other than that, this place is fine. Breakfast is ok (they do cram you in though if it is busy), club floor/lounge is good (ask when you check in for an upgrade and they will usually do it for SGD 60). Its often difficult to get a late check out without paying a half day room rate. Also, laundry is not that fast and the minibar is ludicrously expensive (go to the 7/11 a 30 second walk away) ..... SGD 5 for a 500ml bottle of water, and SGD 10 for a 330ml beer. The double rooms are queen size beds (smaller than normal), and if there are two of you i would strongly recommend a king size room otherwise you will be very uncomfortable. The bottom line here, if you work in the city this hotel is great. If you are here on holiday ... i would pay extra and stay elsewhere.

<Content>Better than some 5 star hotel I stayed in this hotel with my guy in Feb 06 and we both loved it (especially my guy).We chose this hotel because it's close to the ferry terminal (my guy need to take a ferry to Batam for a business meeting).My guy and me always stay in the Hilton whenever we're in Singapore but now we decided to change to M hotel instead.Besides the Hilton, he had stayed in other 5 stars hotels but he still think M hotel is best among them.The location is in the financial business district of Singapore but not near the shopping areas (which is mostly in Orchard road).The hotel staff there are very polite and friendly.Rooms are relatively big and new...like the bathroom especially.It's about 10 mins to the subway so u can easily take the subway to Orchard which is just s few stops away.

<Content>Five Star Hotel lost in the 1970s Room is tiny, trying to pack in simple furniture and fittings. The room smells, the air con is cold and the control panels are uncontrollable. The bed is tiny; more a semi-double than a double, and length-wise it is less than 180 cm. The city view is actually a view of a big ugly building; the water view is one of a dock yard. The carpet requires slippers to avoid the touch, and the smells emitting from it are without description. The broadband internet does work. No problem there. The bathroom is tiny. The shower really does splash everywhere, and the sink is clogged. The club lounge is sub-standard. Drinks are fine, though limited, but the food is like some finger-food party you may have been to in the seventies. In fact the whole place would remind you of some hotel from 007's From Russia with Love.

<Content>Very good hotel I may have been the other traveler issued the same keycard as reviewer in late january.In any case, my first impression of this hotel was less than great when there was a wait at check in for the club rooms and ooops then the rooms wasn't ready ( 15:00 hrs?). But the really pleasant staff who showed me to the club lounge and made sure i was well taken care of soothed that little problem. And then, given the keycard that resulted in me opening the door to the boxer short white backside of some unsuspecting someone, complete with my ooops wrong room I guess apology. The totally apologetic young lady at the club lounge and a room change in minutes. And the Manager's call to apologize and send snacks and drinks compliments of the hotel. This is a first rate hotel. Not because it gives things away, but because it responds to guests with sincerity and aplomb.

<Content>Awesome I stayed at the M Hotel for 10 days on the Club level and it was absolutely AWESOME. Open bar, EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT happy hour food, full, buffett breakfast................forget a regular room, get the club level, spend a little more....still less then the Ritz or Swissotel, and get 10 times what you paid. I have stayed at the Ritz, Swissotel, JW Marriott, Hyatt's, etc., this staff on the Club Level was absolutely the best I have ever experienced. The sales team, however, was absolutely horrible if you are thinking of throwing a party or an event. I met with a girl there she showed me the meeting space, gave me prices, told me she would call and NEVER got back to me. I wanted to stay there 60 days, talkd to a woman named Colleen in sales and she quoted me a more expensive rate for 60 days then I was getting!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was going to give her 60 nights in business, and not only did she NOT give me a deal, she charged me more. I went to a corporate suite elsewhere., She was a horrible businesswoman,. CLub level still is the best.

<Content>Nice hotel but a bit isolated The M-Hotel is a modern hotel but it's located in the business area, rather far from shops and amenities although there are plenty of taxis around.The rooms are nice and high tech but the bathrooms are very small and the shower is tiny and drips water all over the floor!One thing which I thought was bad was that the 'standard' laundry service means that you don't get your laundry back the same day. For that you have to pay 50% premium. I have never encountered this elsewhere.OK as a business hotel for a couple of nights. Any longer and I would advise heading to Orchard or City Hall areas.

<Content>Exceptional value for money My girlfriend and I spent two nights in Singapore on our way to Australia, and I booked a room with a sea view for a ridiculously low amount of money (about 鈧?0/night for two including breakfast!)The place was simply amazing. 5* amenities (and yes, I know what I'm talking about, I take about 50 business trips a year, at least 20% of which in 5* hotels and the rest in 3 and 4*), beautiful room, lovely view, great breakfast, very pleasant personnel (you take a sit to check in more comfortably!).Most highly recommended....
