<Content>decent place The Vibe Hotel holds itself out as a trendy botique hotel. (Saw various advertisements for the hotel later while traveling, further confirming this). The hotel is fine, but nothing trendy or botique about it.It is a clean, decently priced, lower-mid to mid range hotel, well located just outside the central business district, in an area where a lot of similarly priced hotels are located, in addition to a lot of backpacker hotels/hostels a couple blocks away. The service is just ok, but -bonus- they have a pool.I expect the trendy botique claim by management is based on their cheap, brightly colored furniture in the lobby and music playing pretty loud in the lobby, with a flat-screen showing Austrailia's music video channel. But music and pink sofas does not a stylish/unique/interesting hotel make.So ok hotel, but not as advertised. Fd

<Content>what a fantastic hotel! Stayed here in a 4 bedroom room. What great value for money. The room was well sized, excellently layed out and super clean ( No tvs in odd places, no climbing over furniture to get into bed) The decor was very modern and there were no obvious signs of wear and tear on any of it. We woke up too late for the buffet breakfast but made it down in down to eat breakfast at the cafe. Which wasn't overly cheap but all of our meals were lovely... Possibly the best bacon i have eaten : ) The service was great all staff were polite and gave of the impression they were happy to be there There was no real view besdies the building next door but the position was very convenient. I have stayed in hotels 2x the price and didnt think they were at the same level. Would definately stay there again, infact im booked in again in January!

<Content>Nice City Hotel Arriving from HKG at noon we were told that the room was not ready before 4pm. This was practically the only downside of the hotel. It is nicely decorated with a modern touch, the price-performance ratio is right and the location is convenient for exploring Sydney. Our room was very spacy however a little loud in the morning as it was facing the street - ask for a backside room. The hotel itself was very clean, if you do not want to eat outside try the burger of the roomservice menu, very delicious! All in all we'd choose this hotel again if we'd come back to Sydney.

<Content>Not everything you would expect Once I checked in, the service was okay, could have been better, but during the entire the front desk staff were the only nice staff and would always ask if you needed something.The hotel inform me that they are renovating the rooms and thats why the room i was saying in wasn't up to par with the rest. This part showed, from the bed you sleep. Every time you would turn, you would feel a new spring hitting you in the wrong and uncomfortable spot. The looked as though they just bought the property from another hotel that went bankrupt, the lobby looked presentable about the rest whole was more a 2 or 3 star with furntionings and fixtures.The next morning I went down for breakfast, this was unbelievible. You have two options when ordering breakfast la carte in the restaurant which over priced to the buffet. I chose the buffet, hot breakfast was about $25 and continental was $17, but overpriced for what you get. In the hot breakfast you get 4 half dishes for hot food, which was cold or had no more. Since eggs werent on the hot food item, which was then asked and staff gave attitude after ordering the item. If I was travelling for business or pleasure, I would not recommend this to anyone. One of the worst experiences I have had in hotel in Australia.

<Content>Middle of the Range I have just spent three nights at Vibe and it was fine but not earth shattering. I contacted them direct and bargained for a good rate and also managed to get an up grade to an executive room which was large and airy. The location is quite good Its a funky but the standard of decoration is of a type which has started to go shabby very quickly. The staff were helpful and friendly and service was good. A problem with the TV was attended to immediately. The breakfast was not good. The poached eggs are rubbery, overcooked and tasteless. The sausages were dreadful and so was the coffee. Overall I would probably stay there again but only if I could get a great deal.

<Content>A great one night stand. A really pleasant surprise given the price bracket. We booked this for one night between train journeys as it was an easy walk from the station not expecting much. However, our room was large, good seating area, comfortable bed and tea, coffee etc. It has good internet facilities for those not travelling with a laptop and a bar and restaurant. On the night we were there these were empty and the service poor but others tell me its usually OK. An easy walk to most of the CBD and definately a good option if you are not looking for an iconic view!

<Content>Suprised by the price! I stayed here on my own for 3 nights. One of those nights was Australia day and I got a room at the last minute after being let down by somewhere I had booked. This hotel suprised me, I wasn't expecting much for the price but the room was spacious, had all the usuals (tea  coffee making, fridge, couch, tv etc). The decor is a bit unusual - a lot of very bright colours, flourescent green  pink. Very comfortable bed  good quality linen.The staff were very helpful and allowed me to leave my bags with them when I had checked in very early, they gave me a key  the bags were in my room when I was able to go up at about 1ish.One of my nights there was a lot of noise from the room next door (sounded like students or a team celebrating) but I called reception and they had somebody come up straight away  ask them to be quiet.The hotel is located within a short walk to everything in the city centre and is located in an area with a lot of other hotels  hostels so there's plenty of tourists around.Overall, I would recommend staying here. The place is clean, the location is central and the staff are polite  helpful.

<Content>My favorite hotel in Sydney I stayed at the Vibe in sydney just a few weeks ago. It is my favorite hotel in the city. Very Hip in decor and clean with quiet acomodations. For the price it is excellent. I have stayed at 3 other hotels that were more expensive and found that the Vibe is far superior to them. The breakfast buffet is very good also. I would recommend this hotel to all who travel to sydney.

<Content>Excellent value for money Ill keep this review short and sweet. The Vibe has enormous rooms is in a fantastic location and is good value for money. I booked this as one of the mystery hotels or secret deals I cant remember but basically we did not pick this. We were told a rough location and that it was 4 star and after we paid we got told which hotel. We were in Sydney a few days only so we were pretty flexible... we were pleasantly surprised. The only bad thing is that you can hear the noise on the road quite clear (this may be the same for the majority of hotels so central I don't know).. however is you consider yourself a normal sleeper you should be fine!

<Content>Clean rooms  I thought the Vibe hotel was pretty good  would recommend if you can get a room for about $120. The Vibe Room I stayed in was a decent size  my bed was made everyday with fresh clean towels in the bathroom too. Room was very clean throughout. The Mini-bar was well stocked although I didn't need to use anything - there is a Coles supermarket about 3 mins walk west from the hotel on Goulbourn St if you need anything, Reception staff had no problem finding me some cutlery when I walked in with a take-away at midnight. Didn't get a chance to try out the restaurant but if you are on a budget then the pub over the road has a cheap menu with good food like a thai green curry for $12. You can order a Pizza from room service for $20.Internet costs seemed somewhat overpriced at the hotel, I think it was $2 for 15mins, they have 3 computers in the lobby area so at least the facility is available if you want to pop on quickly. Otherwise there is a really cheap Everywhere Internet place just about one block away (3-5 mins walk) its combined with Gloria Jeans Coffee Shop on the corner of Castlereagh  Liverpool St. You get something like 150mins for $5 or an hour for $3. The banana muffins are nice too ;-)Darling harbour is about a 15-min walk. You can catch a train from Museum station, only a block away, on the corner of Hyde Park, if you don't fancy walking all the way up to Circular Quay.

<Content>Poor Service, Average Room Very Poor customer service, very long wait at check-in and check-out times.Very small pool.Hotel kept credit card by accident when checking out at 10am. Didn't contact me to let me know. The first i found out about it was when i got out of a taxi at the airport at 4pm and had no credit card. I called the hotel and was told they forgot to tell me i had left it there. I had to canel the card because i needed to catch a plane.Would not stay again

<Content>Nightmare on Goulburn Street I am currently staying at the Vibe while on a 2 week business trip. The stay was booked off the hotel website. The reciept printout clearly states the the rooms have broadband along with several other facilities. Apon arrival I discovered that broadband was not included with the room. I queried reception about this and was informed that I would have to pay an extra $24.95 per day to have access to broadband. When I asked about the receipt I was told that it was just an indication of what could be available, not what was included. This is a clear case of false advertising.When I got to the room I discovered that it had not been cleaned properly, with rubish left in the wardrobe, and the rubish bin in the bathroom.The room was not very well sound proofed, recieving alot of traffic noise even though it is on the sixth floor.Vote with your feet. Stay somewhere else, I will next time

<Content>Fantastic value for money I was massively surprised by pretty much everything. The room was only $89 a night so I arrived with quite low expectations only to be met by great service, a huge room overlooking goulburn street (not that noisy) and despite terrible tv reception it was the best value stay i've had in a long long time. Plus the location, five minutes from Crown Street in Surry Hills was brilliant. I've stayed in many hotels in Sydney over the last three years, including the massively over-rated Kirketon and the Hilton by Town Hall but, purely for what I got for my money, this rates as one of my most satisfying stays.

<Content>Great for the price My boyfriend and I stayed one night at the Vibe Hotel and I thought, for price and location, you can't beat it. They had just recently undergone a massive renovation and the rooms were modern and comfortable and included any amenity we could have asked for -- minus complimentary towels at the rooftop pool which was slightly annoying since we called down to housekeeping 3 times and were clearly ignored. So basically, aside from lack of towels at the pool, out stay was comfortable and hassle free and exactly what we were looking for.

<Content>Good hotel for a city break My husband and I stayed at The Vibe hotel during the final part of a month long trip to Australia.We booked the hotel through Toga reservations and got a great discount from the rack rate.The staff at the front desk were extremely friendly, as were the staff in the cafe/bar.Our room was on the 3rd floor looking out over Goulburn Street. There was a little noise from the street but nothing that bothered us. The room was just the right size for the two of us and the bathroom had a powerful shower and big bath.The location of the hotel is brilliant. Close to Central Station, Chinatown, Hyde Park and an easy walk into town. Plus the monorail and metro are close by if you don't fancy walking.

<Content>Great room, lousy amendities and terrible customer service The room is great and the rate is not good as well. But that is all I can say about positive aspects of the hotel. The 'classy' rooftop swimming pool is more like a giant bath tub, and when I was there, there was only one man sun tanning. Not surprisingly, as the water in the pool did not look well-maintained. Vibe hotel is a business hotel for business people, but that was definitely not the impression I got. First of all, the internet was not working, and it takes on average 3 phone calls and 30 min before getting any of your requests attended to. The person who helped us with the internet has no basic knowledge about the internet... When we checked out, we were billed A$40 for internet charges (we only used internet to syn up our email..). We thought that the wireless internet at the lounge was complimentary since the internet in our room was down, but we were told that that was impossible and were treated as freeloathers. When I requested to look at the internet log files (I am still holding onto the log file), I saw that we were charged A$20 for 8min of internet usage!! The manager on duty, Mr. Godwin Oparah, was not only unhelpful, but was very rude to us. He accused us of lying and argued with us for more than 10 min. We were catching our flight, so this last episode totally ruined whatever good impression we had of the hotel. To rate him and his staff's service and attitude, on a scale of 0 to 10, I would give them a low 1.5. Out of the 5 counter staff I spoke to, only one of them was polite and professional.Would only recommend this hotel if you don't mind bad experience for the price and location.

<Content>Fine for the price We stayed at the Vibe for 8 nights in October 2007.The room we had included a rollaway bed for our daughter, but was still large enough to accommodate us all without a squeeze. Only problem for us (we were on the first floor) is that we didn't get a bath, only a shower, which isn't great for a 3 year old. The decoration was looking a little tired and the floors were not vacuumed every day, but the bathroom was kept very clean.The restaurant was a bit of a nightmare at breakfast time. Come down at about 8am and you struggle to get a table or near the buffet. A lot of Germans seem to stay in this hotel, but maybe they were there as part of a tour group.The bar food was excellent. Modern, contemporary dishes - loved the green Thai curry, duck and risotto's. Also try the tapas dishes! All though this was a little more expensive, it was convinient for us and the price is not that bad when you consider where you are.It is about a 1 mile walk to Sydney harbour, but there are many routes you can take, if you bear to the left/straight on when you come out of the hotel you can go through the shopping areas or if you bear slightly to the right, you can walk through the park areas, which is much more pleasant at rush hour.Only problem we had was exchanging travellers cheques - the reception never had any money!All in all, good value and no complaints.

<Content>Best value for money in Syd! I was travelling for business,  stayed for one night.The Vibe is very clean, with modern furnishings. Decent sized rooms. Room service was good. Location is good. I'm sure tourists would find it quite convenient to all the tourist attractions.I travel to Sydney occasionally, and I've been looking for a good hotel in Sydney that I would go back to. This is it!

<Content>Fine for the right price The Vibe is well located within easy walking distance of most things in the CBD, and a short stroll to Central Station. It's clean and comfortable, and public areas are quite funky, but don't go expecting 4.5 star luxury. Aircon can be a little hard to get right, and except for the front desk the service is very hit and miss, but if you can get it as we did as a secret hotel for $126/night it's good value. We would have been disappointed with the standard if we'd paid rack rate of $330/night (does anyone actually pay this?)

<Content>Great Hotel My partner and I recently spent 3 nights at the Vibe. It is a great hotel , very clean, very spacious. The room we stayed in was on the top floor and was extremely big. We were given a room with two king sized beds. The staff were great and check in and check out was made very easy. The 24hour reception was very handy for us as we had to arrive and depart very early in the morning. The hotel was very close to the city and walking distance to darling harbour.The bathroom was very big and clean which was great. The only problem we found was that the shower/bathtub could have been dangerous as it was a high step to get in and out especially when wet.Our room didn't have a view unless you count the train tracks but this wasn't an issue and the sound of the trains and traffic could hardly be heard which was great.We will definetly stay here again when we are in Sydney.

<Content>No Worries ! We may have been lucky,but we had a good stay.(5 nights) Watch out there are 2 other Vibes in town,this one is more correctly  Hotel Sydney  Helpful staff,funky decor,ground floor corner bar/cafe/eatery.Three lifts.The quieter rooms are on the back and higher up in this triangular building,but not all of them have a view across the lane.Some near by building work starting.Our twin room was easy to convert to a double.No shower mixer/thermostat a pity.Very sound proof walls.A longish but good walk through Hide Park and the city down to Circular Quay.

<Content>Hotel is OK But Noisy Came to Sydney from Hong Kong, was on a business trip, hotel was OK, but my room was next to the lift and some kind of engine room, so there was some noise and vibration, so if you are one of those that cannot sleep well except in an ideal environment, make sure you ask for a quiet room. Otherwsie the hotel is OK.

<Content>Exceeded my expectation After reading the reviews on this site, I was slightly sceptical about whether this hotel would be any good or not. Luckily, it completely exceeded my expectations.We stayed for 3 nights and really enjoyed it. The room was really big and very nicely designed with just the right amount of funky colours without it being too over the top. The room was also extremely clean and quiet.The breakfast also exceeded my expectations and was the best hotel breakfast I've had for a long time, with plenty of choice.Staff were very friendly and efficient. Checking in and out was a breeze.I would definitely recommend this hotel and stay there again myself. It's also well located within walking distance to all the major city sights as well as all forms of transport on your doorstep. I like the fact that it's on the border between the CBD and the Darlinghurst/Surry Hills area as you've got the best of both worlds. Visitors should head up to Darlinghurst/Surry Hills for some of Sydney's best restaurants within 5-10 mins walk of the hotel.

<Content>An excellent stay but a couple of flaws We stayed for two nights at the vibe and overall had a great stay. Firstly the rooms were very good: modern design, spacious and with seperate dressing area. The room was clean and cleaned well during our stay. Also the corridors outside the room were wide and airey - you don't get the hemmed-in feeling you can get at some chain hotels.A couple of other bonuses were the small rooftop pool which was right next to a small gym (which was well equipped with modern machinery) and a sauna. All of these were rarely used and so made great places to unwind.The drawbacks were relatively small. Firstly the internet was too expensive ($6 for half an hour wi-fi), and secondly we ordered room service and the food was poor: not accompanied by what was promised, dry burger, over seasoned steak. That said, with so many great restaurants in Sydney, this should only be a last resort.We found the staff polite and helpful, so overall a good stay and I'd recommend, especially for the price/location.

<Content>OK but nothing special We had always wanted to stay at the Vibe so was expecting something a bit more special, it isn't cheap. It's like a standard hotl but with funky colours. Some rooms are also better than others, our parents visting from the UK got a much better room.So overall OK and clean but not worth the money. If you can get a deal $150 night would be worth it.

<Content>Fantastic location and CLEAN My boyfriend and I just stayed at The Vibe hotel after getting a great deal on an executive room via needitnow.com.au and we totally loved our stay here.Firstly when we arrived check-in was a breeze, it took about 2 mins to check us in (at 10am our room was ready) we were on the top floor and had a MASSIVE room, the bathroom was huge and had a really nice spa (big enough for two) two sinks and heaps of room. There was also a really nice couch, and the bed was very comfy. The first thing I noticed was how clean the room was, everything was immaculate. We had a really good view of Elizabeth street and Centrepoint Tower.Room service was fairly quick (about 30mins) and not overly expensive (you must try the mozzarella pizza balls!) we didn't get breakfast as we though the menu was pricey (but on par with other breakfast room service prices at nearby hotels)I've stayed in lots of places in Sydney but this hotel is my fav, the people were really nice and the room was clean. We were on the street side so there was quite a bit of noise at night but we couldn't hear anthing from the other rooms. The gym and pool (which looked only half full of water) were right across the hall from our room and we didn't hear any noise from there and there were plenty of people using them.Museum station and Hyde park are only a few hundred metres from the hotel and you can easily walk to Haymarket and Darling Harbour from the hotel (we did) I would totally recommend this hotel.

<Content>Very good location - clean and comfy I stayed here for my first three nights on arriving in Sydney - I am staying in australia for a year, so wanted somewhere nice to stay before moving on. This hotel was clean and comfy and the staff were really helpful.there was some noise on my first night - but was fine after that. One side of eh hotel has lots of traffic noise, but its not too bad with the windows closed. the pool on the roof and gym are lovely and were always empty so I had the pool to myself!There is a cafe downstairs if you want to eat there -but its so near the city I reccomend going out to explore!

<Content>would stay again Have just returned from a 5 day stay at the Vibe Hotel.This hotel was so convenient to public transport and within walking distance of many other places. We would consider staying there again if we returned to Sydney. The room was clean and spacious and the bed was very comfortable.I thought the breakfast was a little disappointing. The tea and coffeewere disgusting. After a day or so I asked if there were tea bags available which of course there were, but they had to come from the kitchen. Also it was scrambled egg every day. If you asked you could have eggs another way but you don't want have keep asking for things that should have been provided anyway.The reception staff were very friendly and helpful.

<Content>Great Stay at the Vibe Stayed here during our trip to Australia in 2006. We were in Sydney for 1 week and I must say we loved the Vibe. The location is great located downtown with pubs all over and restaurants can be found easily as well. The rooms were very modern and funky, and you really do get a good VIBE from this hotel. That being said we did the tourist thing for a majority of the time without spending much time in the hotel at all. The pool is nice and located on the roof which is kind of interesting. Room includes a mini-bar with ridiculously high prices, but what hotel does not overcharge their mini-bar. I would recommend this hotel, very nice stay, very nice city, that being said we just used this hotel for sleep, and to relax after doing the tourist thing.

<Content>Pretty good Sydney is still very full at the moment - and so this place wasn't my first choice. But it was a nice surprise - the rooms were good and spacious and a bit funky. The bed was particularly comfortable. The bathroom and wardrobe space was huge. Good size bar fringe. Seperate sofa (although it's clearly a sofa bed and a little uncomfortable). TV was sadly a bit on the small side. This location is great - it's in the seedier end of town - but I quite like that !! There are many many resturants close by of all kinds, and a couple of pubs across the road. A short walk to china town. And there is a full supermarket a couple of blocks away towards Pitt St. It's a fair walk to the Martin Place, but if your business is at this end of town - it's a good location. I didn't sample any of the food in the hotel.The broadband internet connection was the usual $29.95 for 200Mb (!) - and then it would charge you yet another $29.95 for anything over that. That's simply robbery. I used my wireless broadand instead which costs the same for 2GB a month !Overall - pleasently surprised at this price point.

<Content>A great overall experience The Vibe Hotel was awesome! After reading some of the reviews before booking this hotel, I was skepical..but, it was clean, great attendance, the only problem I had was with the remote, don't mess around with it, if it's not working. I was there for two days on my own, felt very safe! I stayed in the hotel for a total of 5 days. Food, of course is expensive, but... if you are hungry and not sure where to go.. just step outside the hotel, go left from the hotel and then about 2 or 3 blocks go left and you will run into China Town, lots of different foods and good prices. You can walk just about anywhere, but ladies, watch the high heels, they'll get your feet! I took off and just walked and discovered so much... The Opera House, Botanical Gardens, the parks, a dinner cruise was awesome, you can see the city night lights, the shopping....so much to do.. the weather was great! My overall experience with the hotel... GREAT! I would definitely stay there again! Clean, curtious staff, quiet...and they were all accommodating! Best advise on getting there from the airport...catch a shuttle! I took the taxi... $50, plus I tipped $5.. which I found out later, did not need to do that! I was overcharged to begin with. I took the shuttle back to the airport and it was great! a few stops on the way, but the conceire told us what time to catch to get to the A/P on time and it was fine!

<Content>Efficient reception, pity about everything else A wot mystery hotel room booking, $149. No traffic noise being on the long side (south-east facing) of this triangular hotel, so I'd recommend requesting this when booking.Room has minimal freebies, just a couple of cakes of soap and shampoos. Good hairdryer. Bathroom needed maintenance. Decor is funky and plenty of well-positioned mirrors were a nice feature. Some local TV stations had dodgy reception on the ageing 4:3 TV.My partner got bitten by bed bugs. We pre-ordered room service breakfast which was delivered on time, although housekeeping woke us up at 9am on Saturday, with apologies. The full breakfast was awful: rubbery eggs, undercooked tomato, greasy hash brown, undercooked mushrooms, a nice thick slice of still-warm toast but no butter unfortunately, sausages were OK.Reception was very efficient and polite, and they were happy to hold our bags securely after checkout.

<Content>Loved It I booked the room through [--] suprise hotel. I was very happy with what i had recieved. The Vibe Hotel is Perfect for getting to all areas of the city, and even though it is on busy Goulbourn st, with the wondows closed it is hard to hear the busy traffic just outside.Loved the rooms inside, i will definately be staying there on my next visit to sydney.

<Content>A bit scarry! We also stayed here after booking a mystery room. Other than we only paid 99$ the only other positive was a decent location and the room was suprisingly quiet.However I did feel like we were in a dungeon with the world smallest window. The room was clean a decent size but with the lack of any natural light it is certainly not for the claustrophic. i would have felt more at home with a minning helmet on!

<Content>Great Location, Fun Decor One of the best things about this hotel is it's location. We stayed at the Vibe for two nights, then travelled elsewhere, and returned for 2 nights. We took the train to and from the airport, and got off at the Museum stop, the Vibe is just one block downhill from there.From the hotel it was a short walk to Darling Harbour, and only slightly longer to Circular Quay. The train station was close for further excursions, or to get back from Circular Quay (uphill that way!).The decor was fun, very retro with velour pillowcases, lots of lime green and purple, and mirrors on the wall. The bed was large and very comfortable. Our first room (601) was very quiet, the second room (624) had a bit more noise with the plumbing for some reason...We didn't use the pool or gym, but checked it out. The pool area was nice, tide was out as some other people have commented! Gym was small but had 3 treadmills and a TV to watch while you ran. Sauna was also small, but most of them are!Ate at the restaurant for breakfast, dinner and had room service. Food better in restaurant than the room service, but both reasonably priced.The staff at reception were not particularly friendly as has also been previously commented on, but the staff in the restaurant were pleasant.I think the main issue other posters may have had is with The Vibe claiming to be 4 star. I am guessing this is due to the pool and gym - I would probably say it is more of a 3 to 3.5 stars, but we got a good price in an expensive city so we were more than happy with our stay.

<Content>A good Vibe at this hotel Overall the Vibe hotel is just like pictured on photos- colourful, modern and funky (probably doesn't look the best from the outside though). We stayed in the only apartment that they have at the hotel -two bedrooms, two bathrooms, living area and kitchen, so for four people that was plenty of space (they don't advertise this apartment on the web, so we inquired about it directly). The rooms were very clean and tidy, beds made and dry towels changed every day of our 3 night stay. Although the hotel is on a busy street, the room was very quiet. Oh, and for all the ladies, this hotel actually had a GOOD practical hairdryer, not like one of those midget things that are attached to the bathroom walls. Small things are often the ones that leave a good impression, he he.The location is also very good, just a short stroll to George street, Chinatown and supermarkets. About a 20 min walk to Darling Harbour and 40 min walk to Circular Quay. The only negative comments I have would be due to the fact that our corridor always smelled like smoke, and the dishwasher made the dishes dirty rather than clean. Also, the staff seemed very disorganised, which was the most annoying part of our stay. We had paid for the stay on the arrival, but at our checkout they did not have a record of us paying for the stay! Luckily I had the receipt for our payment to prove it. But then, what they had to do was to charge my credit card again, and to cancel the original payment together with the bond fee. Hmmm... Very complicated! In turn, the original sum of money + $100 bond was not returned to my account for another 10 days or so, which was very frustrating considering I had just come back from a holiday, and quite broke :)Despite this, Vibe is a nice, clean and well located hotel, and I probably would stay there again.

<Content>Mostly good We found The Vibe to be modern, clean and well maintained. Although located in the city, the room was nice and quiet. No major traffic noise. The room was spacious and included a small refridgerator which was convenient. We arrived early and the receptionist was friendly and offered to store our bags while we toured around town.As for negatives, the rooftop pool was only partially filled the TV had poor reception and the morning we left the elevator was broken forcing us to carry our luggage down the fire stairs into an alley next to the hotel.Overall a good hotel for the price and would definitely stay again.

<Content>parking and Vibe hotels We stayed at the VibeHotel on Goulburn St after booking a Mystery hotel on Lastminute.com.au. It is rated as a 4 star hotel. After reading some rather negative reviews on Tripadvisor after booking, I wondered how our experience would be. I agree with those that commented that it's not a 4 star hotel, mainly because of terrible tv reception, old style tv and such a loud fan for the airconditioning we had to turn it off to sleep. The hairdryer didn't have any hot air! The issue that prompted me to write this review was the difficulty with the carpark arrangement. The parking station is across the street from the hotel. The lift doesn't work, so we had to walk down several flights of stairs with our suitcases. Next morning at checkout the front desk assured us twice that even though the carpark ticket issued by them had the wrong date (by two days) it would work in the exit machine. After walking back up (several ramps this time) to get to our car and drive out, the ticket didn't work, but the kind attendant saved us a trip back to the hotel to sort this out by taking our details and let us drive out. We stayed at the VIbe hotel in Milson's Pt last year and had difficulty with the hotel carpark being full and having to park several blocks down the hill. Vibe have a car-park issue for sure.The room was small, but bed comfortable, quiet room (apart from the fan problem) position in town excellent, and quite a smart refurbish, but glad we only paid $110 a night which is the deal we got with Lastminute.

<Content>Could Have Been Better... We spent 2 nights in The Vibe end of January 2007.Booked the hotel off LastMinute.com as of of their discounted Top Secret Hotel Deals where you don't see the exact hotel until you pay.Unfortunately the hotel is located on a busy road and the street sounds carried into our room. Shower drain made a terrible stink every time we used it - reception said they would make a note of it and look into it after we left - not much good to us.Room fittings were standard.Swimming pool on roof was 3/4 full and had paint peeling off the sides and bottom of it.Room overlooked a delapidated parking garage.Location was pretty good - right next to Chinatown with many good restaurants around.15 minute walk to Darling Harbour.

<Content>Location! Lastminute.com.au Mystery room $99 per night. It said that it was a 4 star hotel but I think they are pushing it to get 4 stars. The staff are lovely and most helpful. Location is exceptional. Just felt very ripped off by the in room internet. Every 200mb they charge about $25. So for me to do work from the room the internet for 24 hours was over $100!!!! Madness. Rooms have been done up but you can see the bad paint job. Appeared fairly clean, a little tired. Worth just $99 a night, wouldn't pay ANY MORE.

<Content>Nice Hotel My husband and I stayed here with another couple for a weekend in January. I too was a little unsure about the property from the other reviews posted on this site. I however had no problems with the hotel at all, the staff were lovely and the rooms were of a good size.The pool area was very nice.I wouldn't have any problems recommending this property. My advice about the staff, be nice and they will be nice in return.

<Content>Very Odd Stay at the Vibe The rooms were very nice. The hotel in general was fine. The location is good, walk to Darling Harbour, Central Station and a longer walk to Circular Key.The roof top pool was nice if small. We used it twice and the first time was fine.The second time we used it on the last day of our stay was not satisfactory at all. An odd couple were having sex in the pool. They were not guests of the hotel and one was in her underwear. Ourselves and another unconnected family complained to hotel staff several times but no one came up. Eventually the general manager came up, and went away again doing nothing. We were horrified and complained again so he came back up and confronted and removed the couple. He said the hotel would drain the pool but I saw no sign of this and the pool remained open with other patrons using the soiled pool!Disgusting.

<Content>Good value smart hotel We stayed at the Vibe for 4 nights in early January. We had been slightly apprehensive having read other reviews, but we were really pleased with the hotel. Our room was big, with a sofa and table in, the decor was smart and modern, and the air con was good. Room service was really good value. All the staff we encountered were friendly and professional. The hotel is in an excellent location and only about 10 minutes from the city centre. We would definitely go back.

<Content>Average Hotel but outlandish prices at New Year Had 5 nights here over New Year. Rate charged was pretty outlandish but all Hotels seem to also do this.Hotel was much as stated by previous Trip Advisor guests - clean, very modern decorating, corridors could be somewhat noisy but we often so tired from the day that it did not affect us. We did have 1 day when room did not get cleaned before we got back 4pmish - and told staff not to bother. Reception staff on arrival also unhelpful. It was very busy with New Year and also Cricket followers. It was adequate but I do not think that we would stay here again.

<Content>Nice Vibe Spent two nights at the Vibe in December 2007 and liked it... hotel feels very modern and clean, my sort of hotel. In-room internet access a bit expensive (due to bandwith charges) but at least it had internet. Location is excellent just on the edge of Chinatown - very well placed in Sydney.Food / drinks were decent and reasonable priced, and the pool and gym on the roof, whilst small, was modern and adequate. Only slight black mark was an extremely moody receptionist with bags of attitude who wasn't very helpful on check-out, but that wasn't enough to spoil a generally good hotel experience. Recommended.

<Content>Rude Staff ! First of all I've sent in customer feedback to the manager of this hotel addressing all points I've raise below. Apparently customer feedback is not a great priority of this hotel as it has been several weeks with no reply.Let me mention that I received a very good deal on Lastminute.com for my room. 3 days before I was due to arrive I called the hotel to confirm my booking and let your staff know that I will be arriving late. The staff I spoke to on the phone and the staff who checked me into the hotel I found to be extremely rude. She wouldn鈥檛 make eye contact, wouldn鈥檛 make small talk, was very abrupt and treated me like I was some worthless customer off the street. She asked for me to leave a $100 deposit for my room in case of incidentals. While I appreciate the need to make sure I鈥檓 not going to trash the room, raid the mini bar and do a 鈥渞unner,鈥?the booking was made under a business name. It was a corporate booking; the hotel had my credit card number, name, employer, my address and other contact details. Never in my career in hospitality and the hotel industry have I heard of hotels asking for a deposit unless the entire stay was being paid for in cash. I鈥檓 assuming the girl I spoke to on the phone and the girl who checked me into be one and the same, because all other staff I had contact with on reception and in your restaurant/bar/caf茅 to be pleasant and helpful.My room was nothing really more then a standard hotel room, it was clean and it was tidy. I had requested a non-smoking room when I made the booking however I learnt when I found my room that I was given a smoking room. I would also like to point out that Vibe was the first hotel I have ever stayed in that did not contain some sort of locality guide or information on the hotel. I appreciate that the hotel is in one of Australia鈥檚 largest cities and it would be impractical to list even one quarter of the attractions however listing services offered by the hotel such as your rooftop pool (which I only learnt about today when looking at your website) may not be such a bad idea. The room did include a menu for Curves; however I learnt that half the items on that menu did not exist.I would like to congratulate their housekeeping staff, although I didn鈥檛 鈥榯rash鈥?my room, I did leave a lot of personal belongings around the room. The housekeepers managed to clean the room well around my belongings which I appreciated.With the right adjustments to customer service I believe Vibe Hotel on Goulburn Street could be a great hotel. Unfortunately at the moment most guests appreciate polite and helpful staff. It only takes member of staff to be rude to ruin a guest鈥檚 entire stay. Everyone appreciates that people have 鈥渙ff-days鈥?but after reading other reviews on your hotel it appears this may not be the case since there is an abundance of the same sort of complaint.

<Content>Horrible  we won this stay through Ebay, two nights accomodation with breakfast each morning. First of all it took 3 attempts to book my stay through the call centre prior to our stay, they just could not get it right. The parking station is across the road in Wilsons carpark, so you have to cart your luggage across the road to the hotel. It costs $22-00 a night to park.Apon check in, the reception staff were very unfriendly and did not even bother to explain where we were supposed to go for breakfast in the morning, what the times were or any facilites of the hotel, such as the pool etc. The room is very small and we were on the main street, we could hear all of the traffic (beeping of horns) and every emergency vehicle sirens that went past ( which was constant). We had been placed in a smoking room, and we dont smoke, so the room stank of smoke, we noticed the windows open to get rid of the smoke smell. Our tiny T.V was broken, and we had to manually change channels, the room directory had been scribbled in by children and some information was impossible to read. The room is tiny and with a small double bed, the room has a funky feel to it with retro furnishings. The bathroom is tiny and the bath is even smaller still, dont expect to have a good soak in this bath as it wont happen. You get two small towels  thats it.The next morning we went down for breakfast and the girl could not find us on the breakfast list, so we had to wait whilst she called around to see if we had breakfast with our stay, after waiting we finally sat down to breakfast at 930am, without warning the staff began to unplug all of the equipment and pack up at 950am, taking the food away, a girl then said that breakfast was over. The breakfast was buffet style, the food was not too bad, with a small variety of cerals, eggs, bacon, coffee etc.We were supposed to get a newspaper delivered to our room each morning, that never happened. On the second day, we decided to have a lazy day in our room, at 230pm room service knocked on our room to make it up, then we were rewoken at 330pm by the mini bar girl to check the mini bar to see if we had used it, when we told her that we had not, she still had to enter our room to check the fridge regardless of what we said. On check out day, we had a late check out of 1pm, so we decided to have a sleep in, at 1030am we were woken by the banging on the door to make our room up. After check out the hotel gives you a ticket to exit Wilsons parking, our ticket did not work and we could not exit, so we rang the hotel from the carpark, and they rushed another ticket over to us, which of course did not work, the pay counter in the carpark was unattended, so the hotel staff had no idea how to get us out, we were stuck for an hour in our car, while the hotel rang another Wilsons carpark to get someone there to open the boom gates. We have since then written to the hotel, in regards to our stay and hence still no answer. This is just a glorified backpacker hostel with a little colour and nothing else!

<Content>Smelled bad and made me itch! I stayed there last year and checked out a night early and paid a penalty just to get out of there. It used to be a Quality Inn and still felt like one. The room smelled bad. Even the telephone smelled funny. I stayed there one night and it made me itch. The place felt very dirty. Instead of staying there you should stay about a block away at the Travelodge Wentworth Ave. which is about the same price and a lot cleaner!

<Content>Unfriendly staff I have stayed at the Vibe Hotel Goulburn Street about 6 times for business over the past 12-18 months primarily due to it's location and the modern decor which makes a pleasant change from your average hotel decor. However, the staff have never been remotely friendly or helpful.Staff were extremely rude and unhelpful to the point of being unco-operative when I requested a 'smoking room' (yes it is tragic). I was told none were available but that I had been upgraded to an executive room to which I indicated no that is what I had booked and paid for. I was then given a standard room on the third which turned out to be a non-smoking floor and it was not until I asked them to arrange for me to be transferred to another hotel that a room suddenly became available.This time I also noticed the cleaning standards had slipped - the shower screen, bath and tiles had scum marks all over them and the mirrors were dirty.Great modern decor, spacious rooms but a shame about the way it is run.

<Content>Only at the right price I booked vibe as a surprise for my husband to celebrate our anniversary. The hotel was offering a package which included breakfast and a free double CD of chillout music and is decorated in a nice funky style which I knew would appeal to him. It was also nice and close to work so we got a sleep in! The rooms are nicely decorated and look pretty much the same as the website. They are quite large and the bed was very comfortable. We did not find the airconditoning noisy as previous reviewers had mentioned and the lifts were fine. The bathroom was standard. The roof terrace and pool area are attractive and the equipment in the gym is brand new and good quality. Most of the staff were not particularly friendly or helpful with the exception of the bar person and evening waiter. We ate at the restaurant because it looked inviting and it was freezing outside. The entrees were overpriced and a bit ordinary but the main meals were very very nice. I would recommend giving breakfast buffet a miss and heading to one of the hundreds of cafes on castlereagh street. Most of the hot food was lukewarm and certainly not worth the price. Overall I think the hotel is fine if you can get it from a last minute site but really need to lift their game in regards to service and food to be worth the $160 a night they are trying to charge as there is so much competition in Sydney for this price range.

<Content>Never again Out of three lifts only one lift worked and by the time that arrived it was quicker to take the stairs - not a pleasant experience, especially with a whole heap of luggageWhen we finally got to our room the bathroom had absolutely no benchspace to place any tolietrise and worse still there was no divider between the toliet and the shower. The mattress was so hard I woke up several times in the middle of the night from pain and was almost crying from lack of sleep. The next day we were relocated into another room on another floor, but there was a very distinct smell of cigarettes in the hallway.I will never again stay in this hotel.

<Content>Disappointing I booked this hotel after reading the reviews and kept my fingers crossed that all would be okay. For the price I got the room for it was okay but the cleanliness was lacking. There was no sheet between the quilt and myself, which meant if the housekeeping staff were slack you had a dirty quilt on you, or if you were hot you had no sheet for cover. The bolster pillow also smelt like sweat. It just wasn't up to scratch on the cleanliness side. Didn't have any other issues with the hotel, butI will still not be booking this hotel again.
