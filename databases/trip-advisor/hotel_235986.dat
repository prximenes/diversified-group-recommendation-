<Content>Hotel La Scaletta this place is the worst. carried bags up 100 steps to be told we had to carry them back down and across the street. After was in bed for an hour the came and kicked us out because they said they were over booked? Good thing because we found a better hotel for less just down the street.

<Content>La Scaletta...could be Betta Loved the location of this hotel though the street is very busy and traffic knows no boundaries in Italy! Thank goodness for the elevator (94 steps after 12 hours of travel was daunting)! Our room for 10 days was small and the bathroom even smaller. It was clean as long as you don't look too closely. The mold in the shower was disconcerting so I just cleaned it myself. There was no place to set simple toiletries and felt like it was a constant balancing act just to brush our teeth. We were told we would have a room overlooking the Boboli Gardens which in fact overlooked the parking lot. No big deal. I agree with the previous reviewer...the staff was helpful but not overly friendly. If we did not say buon giourno first they didn't usually acknowledge us. I sense in Italy customer service is not at the top of their list. I agree with conserving water and didn't have a problem withgetting fresh towels every three days. But maybe two towels per guest could be offered. Breakfast was sufficient but was always looking for some fresh fruit. Lots of carbs ( however with all the walking you'll do you can afford a few extra!).Now having said all of this... you can't beat the location. The rooftop terrace is great with the most spectacular views day and night of this glorious city and the bells from the nearby churches were a wonderful way to wake up in the morning! We found ourselves sorry to leave this quirky pensione and would probably return armed with better info about their rooms.

<Content>Location was amazing! This hotel is a great value. Its 2 blocks from the Ponte Vecchio and 1 block from Pitti Palace (Boboli Gardens). The staff was very friendly and the hotel had free internet access.The rooms were spacious and the bathroom was big.We loved the roof top decks, the views were amazing especially at night.A great value would recommend hotel to my friends.You won't be disappointed!

<Content>Quaint and Convenient! La Scaletta is a great value - right on the center of things only one block from Ponte Vecchio and one block from Palazzo Pitti. The name is a hint - be ready for lots of stairs! We loved our night here and wished we had a longer reservation, especially since the rate was a great value. We enjoyed wine on the rooftop terrace - great views! Staff was helpful (not very friendly, by American standards) and breakfast was minimal -- cereal, juice -- but included. This was the only place in 10 days (Rome, Florence) where a hotel provided free wireless internet - that was awesome!

<Content>Views over Florence The roof terrace at La Scaletta is absolutely stunning. We walked in off the street and the roof terrace convinced us to stay (pity it then rained so we didn't get to enjoy it). Friendly staff who booked the Uffuzi and Academia for us so we could avoid the queues. Large room was bright and clean. We enjoyed CNN after 3 weeks without English TV. Double window so even though we faced the street was pretty quiet. Lots of stairs to climb to reception (or very small lift) and quite a few stairs within the hotel too. Breakfast was average, I would skip it next time and go to the cafe on the corner by the Gold Bridge which does great coffee and scrambed eggs.

<Content>fantastic terraces My husband and I stayed here for two nights in June. We chose the hotel after reading the reviews on this site, so basically knew what to expect. That said, we still couldn't find the place!!!Once you do find it don't be put of by the appearance of the stairwell that you have to climb in order to reach the hotel, the views at the top are worth it!I agree with previous reviews re staff. We only encountered one friendly receptionist, but the young lady who ran the outside bar at night was lovely and very friendly.Our room No 22 was at the back of the hotel - so no worries with regards to noise other than from the bar above - it was on the small side and the bathroom and shower was tiny! But the view of the Boboli gardens was amazing. There is no safe so take anything of value with you. The location of the hotel is fantastic as previously stated and well within walking distance of all the sights. The breakfast was a major disappointment without any variation, and very limited choice. But if all you need is something wet and warm to get you going, grab a cuppa and sit on the top terrace and relax!In conclusion this is probably one of the strangest hotels that I have ever walked into, but I would go back again and recommend it to anyone who isn't after 4 star luxury just a fantastically located central and, clean hotel. Just make sure that if you go you sit on the upper most terrace at sunset with a very reasonably priced bottle of their house wine - it's unforgettable.

<Content>A Jewel in Florence My sisters and I have just returned from a four day visit to Florence. Having searched the internet for a reasonably priced, well located hotel we decided upon La Scaletta. For exploring Florence, we could not have chosen better! Situated only a few footsteps away from the Ponte Vecchio and Pitti Palace in a quieter area of the city, the hotel was conveniently positioned for all the sights. The bedroom (triple room) was large, and the beds extremely comfortable, with a large ensuite shower room - our only disappointment was that the room did not have tea/coffee making facilities - but perhaps this is not 'standard' in Italy? If you enjoy a substantial breakfast to set you up for the day be prepared 'eat out' as this was a very minimal, unappetising affair : ham, cheese, pre-packed croissant, machine tea and 'flask' coffee. Tables were not fully set and the waiting staff unwelcoming. Be aware that the hotel operates strict breakfast times (7.30-9.30) and if you arrive at 9.25 you will not be allowed to eat! (Tea/juice machines were switched off, coffee pot and food removed!!) Prior to our visit, I liaised via email with the hotel and found them to be extremely helpful - unfortunately, on arrival, we found only one female member of staff to be welcoming (and she was always very friendly and helpful, with excellent use of English). However, do not let this put you off of staying at the hotel - we only wanted to use it as a base and it's worth it for the outstanding views from the hotel's two rooftop terraces. Wow! What views! Absolutely breathtaking (a rooftop view of Florence including the Duomo, Pitti Palace, Boboli Gardens, etc) - if you only visit to sit on the terrace, do it! We would love to revisit Florence and wouldn't hesitate to stay at La Scaletta purely because of its convenience and stunning vistas. If you have difficulty with stairs, then be warned - if the lift is out of action there are 94 steps to climb and, once in reception, some of the rooms are down a very steep set of stairs (not easily negotiated with suitcases!) All in all a great time was had in Florence and we all slept soundly on very comfortable beds! We would definitely return to the hotel, despite our few 'niggles'.P.S. If you get a chance, take the bus to Fiesole - a beautiful hilltop village with amphitheatre and, again, magnificent views.

<Content>Charming and convenient We accidentally ended up at this hotel, after the one we had originally booked turned out to be a dump. Thank goodness we had a guide book on Florence, found this hotel under the recommendations, and called them to make reservations for that same day. Though the location was extremely convenient, literally seconds away from Ponte Vecchio, finding it was a nightmare. The streets of Florence are pretty confusing, this hotel is in the very center, and the Italian numbering system makes no sense. After we parked the car, it took some walking up and down the street to notice the miniature plaque and entrance. The elevator was tiny and scary. The hotel itself, however, was very nice and charming. The room was furnished in a retro style but we had no complaints regarding cleanliness. It faced Boboli Gardens so it was very quiet, despite the occasional loud TV we heard through the walls. The roof terrace has lovely views day and night, perfect for relaxing. The staff was friendly and very helpful. The breakfast was the only true disappointment. It was surprisingly basic and not worth wasting time on. We instead grabbed something from the nearby sandwich shop each morning. In a nutshell, I thought this place was good value.

<Content>Lovely roof terrace We really liked this place! It has charm and character, with interesting old furniture and lovely old terracotta tiled floors. Ask for a room at the back, facing the Boboli gardens for  A room with a view.It's true that fresh italian coffee at breakfast would be an improvement, ( see an earlier review) but eating breakfast out on the delightful roof terrace, gazing out at all the famous sights, more than compensates for this. Sitting up on the terrace in the evening,with a lovely glass ( or two..or more..) of wine is the perfect way to end a day in Florence.

<Content>Bargain Hotel in Great Location What a great little hotel (pensione) in a fantastic location. Our room was huge and you could hold a party in the bathroom there was that much space.The view off the top of the hotel was aweome and it was really only a 2 minute walk to Ponte Vecchio and another 2 minutes to the Uffizi. The staff were helpful, friendly and were competent English speakers which helps when you're only experience with Italan was a phrase book on the flight over.Breakfast was very minimalist but that doesn't detract from the experience. We were grateful to have breakfast included at alll and it was a great start to the day.If you're after a great deal with absolute minimum fuss, the Hotel La Scaletta was a great find.One word of caution... the address of La Scaletta is Via Guicciardini 13. Now, number 13 you would expect woud come straight after 11... it was actually in between numbers 47 and 49!? I'm not sure what that's all about but it was confusing to us to say the least!

<Content>La Scaletta is Charming We stayed at the La Scaletta for two nights with friends while in Florence on vacation. We did not realize that you have ninety-four steps to climb to the hotel which is located on the third floor of an old plazzao. We dumb Americans were traveling with too much luggage and the elevator is small, so our initial reaction was oh no! Once we navigated the elevator, we found a charming little hotel with a friendly staff and an old world atmosphere. Our rooms were hugh as were the baths with tub/showers.The furnishings were simple and the beds firm, but we found the entire atmosphere very Italian which is what we wanted. I will have to say that breakfast could be better. I don't want coffee out of a machine anywhere, espicially in Italy, the land of wonderful coffee. The breads and pastries were pre-packaged as well. All and all, I would stay here again for the charm and the wonderful location. The price is very reasonable and the staff very professional. A good value for the money.

<Content>Disgusting place. This is possibly the worst place I've ever stayed in. The tiles on ourfloor were broken and missing, my husband fell on a slipping tile and almost broke his back. The mattress was hard as cement, and the pillow was worse. I had to roll a towel up and use it instead of a pillow--it was softer, and that's saying a lot. The breakfast was awful, pre-packaged croiissants, coffee out of an instant machine (not pods, but the old fashioned drippy stuff that you'd put a coin into at a rest stop, minus the coin, and this was italy--land of cappuccino, espresso  lattes!) There were a million steps and the place was very dirty, there wasn't even a place for the toilet paper to hang up, it was stuffed behind the radiator to keep it off the floor. Beautiful view, however, that was the only good point, and of course the location. But we left after one night, needing a decent nights sleep. The place has enormous potential, but it is old, dreary and run down, needing some serious money pumped into it to bring it up to par.

Quiet and with a view from the room that was breathtaking. Very nice large room. Hotel was interesting that all the rooms were linked by crazy stairs everywhere. I would most certainly stay here again!

<Content>La Scaletta--Charming, friendly, old world experience This was my second time staying at La Scaletta (first went in 2006). Last year I stayed for 5 days; this year for 8. My friend and I were delighted to be received so warmly by the same staff as last year--the lovely and most helpful Giovanna, Silvia and Sara (who speak fluent English), as well as the ladies in the kitchen! Scaletta, with all its staircases and nooks and crannies, is a charming, modest and homey place. The continental breakfast (included in the price) is generous and yummy. Construction on the terrace was in progress last year. The now-finished 2-level terrace is delightful, offering excellent views of the Duomo, Palazzo Pitti and the whole of Florence and the distant hills. To have your morning coffee there is to be in heaven... And an evening glass of wine (available for 3 euros at the terrace bar) is pretty great, too.Scaletta is close to everything a visitor to Florence wants to see--the Uffizi, the Duomo, etc. You can walk to Santa Maria Novella in a leisurely 20 minutes.Because there are so many stairs, it is not appropriate for guests with mobility issues. The elevator is quite small, but perfectly serviceable if you have a little patience and a sense of humor. It does make an alarming banging sound when it stops, but that's part of its charm. If you come home late, there's a switch on the stairs that will light up the stairs.I've stayed in 2 rooms--#30 (2 people) and #32 (4 people), both very clean, comfortable and air conditioned. Scaletta may not suit guests who are used to more lavish accommodations. The bathrooms (and showers) are small, which seems to bother some Americans. It's a little inconvenient, I admit, but how much time are you planning to spend in there?Negative comments really must be taken with a grain of salt. As Americans we are used to over-sized and slick. La Scaletta is neither. My friend and I were completely satisfied with the accommodations and service, and we do not hesitate to recommend it to travelers hoping for a low key, thoroughly pleasant, old world (in the best sense) experience.I plan to stay there again when I return to Florence.

<Content>Great hotel, wonderful views My family and I just returned from Florence, and I have to say that our stay at La Scaletta sealed the deail on making it truly a wonderful experience. The hotel staff are friendly and very helpful. Our quadruple room was bright and airy, with 15 foot ceilings and an airconditioner that worked. It faced the back, so was very quiet. I wasn't so concerned that it did not have a view of the Boboli garden, because the terrace more than compensated for that. The best thing about the hotel is the terrace, which has a view of the Boboli as well as the rooftops of the city of Florence. You can see the lit up Duomo and other sights. We had wonderful times sitting out on the terrace and relaxing with a drink in the evenings after a long day of sight-seeing. Raphael, the bartender, mixes a really great mohito with fresh mint that he grows on the terrace. Continental breakfast, while not extraordinary, was still good , with juice, ham, cheese, croissants (which were the only thing that were not fresh), and a choice of several hot beverages dispensed from a great little coffee machine.The hotel is well located - a five minute walk to the Ponte Vecchio, the Uffizi and the bust stop, and about 7 minutes to the Duomo.If you arrive by train, the D bus from SMN takes you to the hotel. Get off at the Ponte Vecchio stop.

<Content>Comfortable, friendly, good value, great location We were very comfortable and happy at this unusual hotel with its friendly, helpful staff and fine location. The view from the roof terrace is the answer to a digital panorama-stitcher's prayer, and breakfast is very good. Ponte Vecchio is mere steps away, and there are fine eating establishments near at hand, Bebo's in particular. The elevator is perhaps the smallest in Italy, and poses an interesting challenge with average luggage.

<Content>A Hole not a Hotel Rick Steves recommends this hotel, but as usual with Steves, he does not seem to have been to this holetel. While the roof terrace is incredible, you eventually have to descend the many, many narrow steep stairs to your room. And what a shock awaits you! I had the most expensive room in the hotel and I have not stayed in a worse room in my life. Unless you must have a cheap room in Florence at 105 E per night, I would avoid this place and book a room with a view somewhere else. Believe me, I have traveled the world and never have I stayed in a worse place.My freshman dorm room was palatial compared to this Holetel. The dining room furniture shows the Holetel Scaletta's roots as a student hostel and the breakfast served here is so depressing that after one time, I avoided it and breakfasted down the street at a cafe. The shower was coffin sized, there is no working air conditioning (which must make this holetel an oven in the summer), the balcony windows are blocked from fully opening by poorly installed inner glass doors, the bed is awful, the sheets are stained, and the they and the thin towels are changed every other day. This place draws a low rent crowd with bad clothes and grooming, and each of them seems to be on the bum or on a very tight budget. I would hold close your purse when you are around them. One guy told me he was a golf pro, but as I continued talking to him, it turned out he was clerk in a golf shop, and to this day I think he was pimping his wife.At night the thin walls echo with moans, snores, couples arguing, babies crying and doors slamming.You get to this place by ascending four floors in the Holetel's teensy, rickety outdoor elevator that often sticks shut or stops with a frightening shudder between floors. The desk help is friendly, but the owner is the sort of smarmy person that John Clese parodies. The hotel sits on one of the busiest streets in Florence which is saying something as Florence's streets are clogged with traffic at all hours and seem to have one smoky motorcycle for each resident.The best part of my stay in this awful place was the taxi ride to the train station.

<Content>Great place to stay We just returned from 10 days in Florence and stayed at the Hotel la Scaletta. The location is great and is on the Pointe Vecchio. All major sights are within walking distance with lots of good eateries nearby. The hotel staff spoke English and were very hospitable and accommodating. Breakfast was served every morning and the cost was in the middle range -140 Euros per night - 125 if you paid cash. There was a deck on the roof with great views of the city. The rooms were comfortable with a private bath and it was very quiet in the evening. Not much street noise. I would highly recommend it and hope to return someday.

<Content>Location Superb Spent 3 nights last week, our first room was delightful, then we had to move to a much larger rather austere room, overlooking the very busy street, between the Ponte Vecchio and Pitti Palace. Getting there was a hassle, there are so many people walking in this small street, trying to park and unload luggage is difficult, the hotel is on the 4th floor, an elevator starts at the second floor, it is so small taking 2 pieces of luggage and two carry-ons presented quite a challenge. Breakfast is standard, a beautiful terrace on the top floor is wonderful, if only they would allow guests to take their own Chianti up there. Parking in this central location was Euro 25-30 per 24hrs.... Easy walking to all the sights, and long lines waiting to get into the Uffizi Gallery( 2 hrs) book ahead before leaving home. Next time would go in October to avoid the masses of tourists, mostly on tours, who clog the streets.

<Content>Fabulous ambience, family friendly The reasonably-priced dinner atop La Scaletta was the highlight of this very family-friendly mid-town hotel. Late night sitting on the upper rooftop with a bottle of wine was a perfect romantic ending to a delightful day. The view is spectacular. The stairs took us all by surprise (there is an elevator), but when you realize what La Scaletta means, it all made sense. The rooms were lovely and spacious and the staff (a family) was extremely friendly and willing to do what they could to make your stay in beautiful Florence memorable. Of the 13 hotels we stayed in on our Italy trip (2-4 stars included), La Scaletta was my personal favorite.

<Content>Oasis of quiet in busy city This hotel was in a great location. The staff were lovely, they didn't go out of their way too much but they were very friendly. Breakfast was a little disappointing. We had a room with french windows overlooking the boboli gardens and would recommend this room very much, although it was a littel old-fashioned the view and the quiet was lovely. The roof terrace is the highlight and makes the hotel a gem.

<Content>The difference between vacationers and travelors . . . Vacationers will hate this place and will continue to write negative reviews.Travelers will love this place - it has a unique charm and rewards those who wish to experience a country and it's personality.Look at it this way. . .If your idea of a good evening is to have an early dinner and then watch the news on your TV in your 4 star hotel room, then Pensione La Scaletta is not your kind of place.If your idea of a good evening is to sit on the rooftop of your pensione and watch the sunset over Florence, see the bats stream into the evening sky from the chimneys at dusk, then go to dinner and a small local restaurant - then this is your kind of place.

<Content>Run away, there is nothing quaint about this hotel If you are reading this you have gone too far...Don't be misled by the one person who loved this hotel. The staff were unhelpful and the furnishings were all circa 1970 (the 30 years of use showed). The first room that we were in had an incredibly musty smell, the shower had HALF of a shower curtain (yes, they cut a curtain in half so that water sprayed all over the floor while you showered) and if you walk up the stairs back to the hotel in the evening (five flights) there are no lights to lead the way. All of the double beds were actually two twin beds on separate frames pushed together. My partner and I awoke to find that beds were pulling apart in the night from us rolling over. We asked to change rooms and found only a slight improvement (this room looked like it had actually been cleaned in the recent past.)The breakfast consisted of canned fruit, instant coffee and packages of melba toast. While the view from the roof garden was beautiful, the garden itself was in deplorable shape. Broken pots were strewn about, the planters were crowded with weeds and the seating was fairly non-existant. All of this for the outrageous price of 130 Euros a night.

<Content>Terrible place, grouchy owner This PENSION IS TERRIBLE. It is so decrepit, to go to our room, we had to go downstairs through a narrow stairway and through a labyrinthe where we were relegated to a dark place. In one website this was described as a hotel, to our chagrin it is a hole in the wall. The bathroom was only as big as a kitchen cabinet (2 feet by 2 feet) and the toilet bowl was less than a foot from the door of the tiny shower. When had to use the bathroom, one had to move sideways inside that tiny bathroom. The beds were hard and all of us could not sleep at night and the staff, especially the female owner was grouchy all the time. At breakfast, the owner was watching everyone eating and all there was was bread and cereals and coffee. Everyone was complaining. WILL NEVER EVER STAY IN THIS PENSION EVER AGAIN !!!!!!!!!! Terrible !

<Content>Interesting place to stay Pensione Albergo LaScallatta is in a great location, between the Ponte Vecchio  the Pitti Palace. The layout is very interesting - the place is like a 3-D puzzle. My roommate  I had a room with a bath down the hall, the bathroom flooded every time she took a shower - I did not have the same problem. Some of the staff was very welcoming  helpful, but some of the other members of the staff were particularly unpleasant.

<Content>Beautiful Rooftop! I recommend this place to all my friends. I stayed in a 3 person room in 2001, it was very sizeable and charming. I felt like I was in an authentic Italian apartment. Great location. The rooftop view remains in my memory today as one of my most beautiful sights.

<Content>Labyrinth Hallways in Decrepit Pensione We were in Firenze July 4-18, 2003. My wife and 2 small daughters had to stay in a different room in a different level; we were charged 150 euros for these 2 rooms. The rooms were on different levels with half staircases to go over (like a bridge). The archaic elevator was claustrophobic, jerky and dark. The elevator had 2 doors, an insider and outer door. If someone forgot to close the inner door, the elevator would not come when called, so enjoy carrying your luggage up 4 floors. My wife slept with my 2 daughters in a queen size bed with weak springs. The shared bathroom was down the half stairs and up on the other floor. Scary to travel to bathroom in darkness. At least her room had A/C. My room had no A/C, noisy cheap fan, huge shutters that were broken, and a noisy view of Via Guicciardini which partied all night. I slept only a few hours to be awaken by a street cleaner truck. The madame/hostel was rude and had the audacity to charge us 16 euros for stale toast, milk for the girls and coffee for us. The roof-top breakfast spot was closed for cleaning. A very large rat was seen on the main floor outside courtyard. The sign outside rated this place as 2 stars; I would rate it 0.5 stars. One night was plenty for us; got out ASAP. In Canadian funds, one night cost me $278.00; for this price stay in the Tuscan hills to the south.

<Content>Not worth it Terrible! The room was dirty. There were dust bunnies the size of cats under the beds, especially frustrating if you have allergies, or drop something. We had to ask for a TV and a blow dryer. They were given with an attitude. Not the most customer service oriented place. Yea, it was cheap, but now I see why. Use discretion! This should be your last and only choice!

<Content>Quite a nice hotel My second experience and enjoyed it again. Roof top garden view is amazing. Staff is friendly... even Madame after you get to know her and get her to smile. Great location... a block from Ponte Vecchio and stone's throw from Pitti Palace. On the quieter side of the Arno.Highly recommend!

<Content>Not a great experience We were referred to this Hotel via Rick Steve's. We may have had a non-standard room, but it looked like a kitchen that was transformed into a room. The air conditioning unit had a hose that was suppose to go out the window to release the hot air, however, they had it stuck out the window with the shutters closed so it was blowing all the hot air back into the room. Then in the middle of the night it broke. We probably just had a bad experience, and may not be the norm, but we were scheduled to stay there four nights and after one, we were glad to get out.
