<Content>loved the Orcagna We stayed at the Orcagna for 5 nights and we were delighted with the spacious room and the warm welcome we received here. The room was spotless, plenty large fluffy towels, bedding changed after 2 nights and a simple but plentiful breakfast. It was away from the main tourist areas but a pleasant walk into town and plenty restaurants in the neighbourhood. Would recommend to anyone.

<Content>A Wonderful Stay! This place is underrated - It's in a residential area outside the tourist zone, but there are shops, restaurants, and services close by all frequented by locals - even a laundromat. Clientele is interenational. Our room was large,comfortable with a balcony overlooking the street (very quiet though) and good sized bath. The breakfasts were adequate tho' I would have liked some fresh fruit, but the fruit juice and cappucino's made up for it. Game room out back and a small garden. The A/C is individual and very quiet. We left our balcony door open at night and no mosquitos.The day staff couldn't have been better. They made reservations for museums, gave recommendations for shopping and restaurants, bus directions, and handled our faxes and phone calls. The breakfast staff gave better service than some of the restaurants we dined in and the housekeeper was a sweetheart.We stayed at a 4 star near Treviso that couldn't compare. We should have taken one of its stars and given it to the Hotel O.

<Content>Quiet, comfortable, convenient. The hotel was on a relatively quiet street just outside the historical district. 15 mins walk to the center. Pizzerieas nearby. Computer access. Nice breakfast. Clean.

<Content>Better than your average ** hotel Got put in Orcagna after Hotel Jane, its partner and *** hotel across the street didn't have room for us. We had a quadruple, which was VERY spacious and actually very comfortable. Everything was clean and the continental breakfast was very nice. The staff at the front desk was in general very helpful, and usually spoke good English. I have never stayed in another ** hotel before, but only could imagine worse. This hotel was very nice and perfect for 4 girls in their twenties to explore Florence, especially on foot. It's not in the center, but that didn't really matter because Florence is small enough to walk anywhere. Good experience, except when checking out they charged one of us twice and we had some problems finding someone who spoke English to get our concerns taken care of. Wouldn't be my first choice, but would definitely stay there again.

<Content>A bit out of the way, but we loved it! This hotel is located on Via Orcagna, which is in a more residential section of Florence, about 10 minutes walking from Santa Croce. We arrived in Florence via train, and right across from the train station were buses, which made it easy to get to the hotel. (I can't remember which number, but it is orange!) The closest bus stop in both ways is right around the corner from the hotel.This is a family run hotel, and the staff is plenty nice. The lady at the front desk was very pleasant and after check-in, quickly oriented us on the Florence map. No elevator, but we were given a huge triple room on the second floor for the two of us. Room was clean. The bathroom was small and it was just the tub, showerhead and a flimsy curtain, but got the job done. Breakfast was good, with very nice espresso and milk, warm croissants, yogurt, cereals, and juices. We were actually encouraged to take a bit extra for the road! In terms of eating options, there are lots of places within a few blocks. One we enjoyed is a pizza place (Luna) that has excellent pizza, in addition to very good pasta and some sort of a lounge in the basement (we didn't check it out). There is a single free internet terminal that we used. This came in handy as we tried to contact Air France to try to change our plans during our trip (to stay longer in Florence)!If we were to go back to Florence, we'd try to stay somewhere closer to the train station, as we'll be planning more day trips out, but if this were the only hotel we available, we'd still be thrilled!

<Content>Very nice hotel Very friendly staff, clean and spacious rooms, all you need. Breakfast was also good and the location is fine (12 to 18 mins walk from the historical center) but there are also several bus routes really nearby. The only downside was the lack of sound insulation; you could hear the people upstairs walking around and anyone who talked loudly on the landing.

<Content>Average hotel Average hotel. The location was also not too great. Took 20-25 mins to get to the train station. The hotel was too cramped, the rooms too small. The breakfast was not too great either - cereal, croissants, juices and cofee. The staff was great, and very helpful. No internet access available in the room. There was one computer in the lobby where you could access the internet for free.

<Content>Great Location but too loud My husband and I spent 3 nights at this hotel in October 2007. The hotel is within walking distance from all the major sights--about 15-20 minutes. It is located on a pretty quiet street. The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful. The hotel rooms are huge compared to other hotels in Italy. It was very clean. The only problem we had was that the walls were paper thin and we heard everything. We could clearly hear the people above us, all of the hotel doors opening and closing, etc. We probably wouldn't stay there again because of the noise as it was difficult to get a good night sleep. Besides the noise, it is a very nice hotel and worth the price.

<Content>Fantastic staff and hotel!!!! We drove into chaotic Florence and found our hotel with a little difficulty but upon arrival - what a welcome!! We were having trouble with our hire car and Simone from the hotel rushed to our aid and saved the day. Throughout our 3 night stay, Simone was extremely helpful and suggested local places to eat and visit. She even humoured us when we tried our poor italian vocab on her. Her english was impeccable too. Our room faced the street and was quiet, clean and spacious. The hotel has a cute little garden in the rear which was great to sit in before or after a big day of walking. The breakfast was agreeable too. We loved Florence and think this hotel was part of our happy stay.

<Content>good value For the money, this was one of the best hotels we stayed in during our three weeks in Italy. The room was very big, with two windows. (The shutters aren't that hard to figure out--just pull the strap.) We didn't find it noisy with the windows shut and it has air conditioning if you need it. It offered a bigger than usual continental breakfast, with cereal and yoghurt in addition to the usual rolls and croissants. (Don't expect an American or British style breakfast anywhere in Italy.) Have the caffe latte--you'll get two steaming jugs, one of strong black coffee and one of milk. The staff were very friendly and helpful, and happy to answer all our questions. We had a picnic supper one evening in the little garden, enclosed by jasmine covered walls. The only slight drawback is it's a bit far from the centre to walk, especially if you're planning to be on your feet all day. However, the bus service is frequent and close by, and you can buy tickets at the front desk. There is an excellent, casual little restaurant (Taverna) just a few blocks away--we ate there three times. Finally, I give this place bonus points for being one of the very few hotels we've stayed in anywhere to have a good reading lamp on each side of the bed!

<Content>Loud All was great except you could hear EVERYTHING. At 4AM, the people above us decided to check out. I could hear even the zipping of their luggage. Then they used the elevator which had a LOUD motor. Finally, everyfootstep of the cook making breakfast from 5AM - 7AM on the hardwood below could have well been on the headboard of the bed. Needless to say, there are plenty of hotels closer to the Florence action for the same price where you could get a full night sleep.

<Content>OK, but that's all The hotel can only be described as ok.It's not very big and it's slightly outside of the main part of the town.We were on the 5th floor, and the lift only services to the 4th floor. So we were forced to drag our luggage to the 5th floor.We did have a balcony to our room and it looked onto the Duomo which was very nice. However, the balcony does not appear to be very well looked after, and more of an advertising feature.The room was ok for a 2 star hotel, good points: Quite spacious, in room safe, tv, Bad points: Wet room bathroom and very tiny.The breakfast is very simple, no hot food.

<Content>Stay at the back or not at all OK, the good points are great staff, clean and very spacious rooms, free internet in lobby.Bad points are the rooms facing the front have pretty thin windows and allow street noise in quite badly. Also there were metal security shutters in front of the windows with no instructions how to raise them. They act as curtains at night as no curtains other than net curtains. As I was only there 2 days and out all day I left them alone. Street is not noisy but the scooters are when one goes by every 20 mins at night. Hotel should get better soundproofed windows.Breakfast very poor for 110 Euros a night rates - just cereals, croissants and bread. No fruit, vegetables, eggs or meats.Hotel is too far from centre of town. It would be OK if you weren't spending the day walking around anyway, but as a tourist you're on your feet. I took the buses 14 and 31, but the stop where you get on is not near the one you get off due to the 1-way system so it's confusing on first arrival. To get bus into town, turn right out of hotel and head for the trees at end of street. Bus stop sign with bus numbers on is small and near the intersection on the new street you arrive at with trees running along it. To get to hotel from town get the orange buses from the bus station next to train station (on right of train station when looking down at map) (don't confuse it with long-distance blue bus station on left of train station where i got a good bus to Siena 75 minutes away.) Buy a 24hr ticket at bus station and put it in ticket machine when get on bus first time you use it, or just buy tickets at hotel reception and punch each time on bus.I asked for 13.00hrs check-out to shower after gym in town but was put off in the nicest, politest way! If the hotel can guarantee you a room at the back before you arrive, stay here it'll be good and worth the walking.Michael,London

<Content>Great base in Florence The hotel was on several bus routes (30,31,14) so was easy to get to from the Santa Maria Station, though it was also in walking distance from the Duomo/Ponte Vecchio areas (about 15 mins).The room was large, clean and comfortable and the breakfast was adequate.The staff were cheerful and helpful, especially Simona who booked tickets for the Uffizi for us and booked a reservation at a restaurant we wanted to try.There was a great local restaurant (Trattoria Sordi), with a Risotto al Funghi to die for!One tip - buy a 16 Euro, 7 day bus pass.It makes jumping on and off the local buses so much easier and even took us to Fiesole for a day trip (no 7 bus).

<Content>loved it! Our stay couldn't have been more pleasant. We would stay here over and over. For starters, the hotel staff was very friendly, knowledgeable and helpful at all times. I was a llittle sick the day we arrived and the hotel desk person recommended a pharmacy and then read all the directions for my medicine to us as the directions were in Italian. I was soon feeling better and thoroughly enjoyed this hotel. There is a small internet portal in the lobby that you can use for free. Very convenient. The breakfast room is lovely and has a simple, but tasty breakfast every morning until 10 or so. The location is great. It is on a somwhat quiet street and if you walk less than a block, there is a bus stop that is easy to use. We sat outside a couple nights after returning from town in a garden area out the back door of the lobby. Absolutely lovely! Our room was clean, fairly large, and had a big wonderful bathroom with shower, tub, bidet, sink, toilet, window, and supplies. Couldn't have asked for more! Our bed was the most comfortable and largest we had on our whole European tour. There was a big wardrobe for clothes that also had extra pillows, blankets, and a safe. It's small, with only about 12 rooms or so. There were four rooms on our floor. But, that's how we like it. Comfortable, personable service and convenient in every way. Would gladly stay again.

<Content>Loved it HIghly recommended!!! We really loved this hotel. We highly recommend it. It's very quiet and the people are really nice. The breakfast is very simple... Crossants, Cereal, Yogurt, Buns, and your choice of drink. I always ordered Cafe Latte or Cappucino. Very delicious!!! When you leave the hotel don't forget to leave your room keys to the front desk. The receptionist taught us how to use the bus. That was our means of transportation. The bus stop is about a 5 minute walk and it's a very cheap way to get to the Centro area. The cost of the bus is 1 EURO for 1 hour and you can buy the ticket from the hotel's front desk. When you get on the bus you'll need to stamp your ticket in the machine. I guess it's on an honor system because the bus driver never did check our tickets. The weird thing is that there are three entrances to the bus not like where I'm from there's only one front entrance. The bus ride to the Duomo is about 15 minutes. If your craving for McDonalds you can catch the bus to the Santa Maria Novella Bus Station and there's one in the bus station and one across the street from the bus station. The neighborhhood around the Orcagna seemed safe. Just remember that everything closes at 8pm. Hope this helps...

<Content>Nice, friendly staff at Orcagna hotel We have just returned after have spent 6 nights at the Orcagna hotel. We are very pleased with the hotel. It was quite and not a lot of trafic.It's situated in a resedential area and that make it a perfect place to stay in a city like Florence wich is packed with tourist in the historic center. So when we come back in the evenings we could choise between several nice resturants and pizzerias in the neighbourhood and a good provision shop. But best of all - the hotel staff. Nice, friendly and serviceminded. The hotel itself is a little 70th in some part a little worned, but very clean.It has a nice family feeling.

<Content>Wonderful little hotel!!!!! Just returned from Italy on March 15th. Stayed at the Orcagna for two nights and really liked this hotel. The staff was wonderfully helpful. Sylvia, Valeria at the front desk and Isa in the breakfast area. The room we had was facing the back of the hotel. The breakfast was very good. Florence is an extraordinary city and we crammed as much as we could in the two days we were there. Thank you everyone.

<Content>Orcagna deserves more stars We found the location convenient, only a 30 minute walk to the train/bus station, and only 15 minutes to most other locations of interest. Best of all, it is very close to two supermarkets that are open everyday of the week between them. The staff is extremely helpful and very pleasant. Our room was excellent with nice balcony and nice residential Tuscan view.

<Content>Switched hotels on us We were booked at the Orcagna Hotel but when we registered, we were told they were full and they put us in their sister hotel The Jane across the street. I was not happy because these reservations were confirmed. However, the Jane Hotel was very nice. The room was large by European standards,and clean.The staff at the Jane was not as friendly and The Orcagna. They spoke very little English and seemed to have no patience if you did not speak Italian. For this reason, I probably would not stay there again.

<Content>like a home with a great value Despite being located a little off the historical center, hotel orcagna is a great value hotel. The staff is friendly, although they lack in speaking english. The rooms are clean, there is always hot water, good working mini bar and cnn international on the tv...If you do not mind walking 25 min to see the major touristic attractions and seeking for economy when travelling, this place is a real gem.

<Content>A great Base for Florence My Fiance and I stayed at the hotel in the middle of October, and I must say that Simona and the other staff were nothing but professional and incredibly friendly. Any request we had they went out of there way to help us or provide us with the relevant information.The hotel is a 25 minute walk from the train station. This included our baggage. (Whatever doesnot kill you only makes you stronger.) Its a stones throw to the Arno and some great pizzerias. (If you go to the La Staglioni you must have the Panna cotta dessert you would disown you own mother.)It is only a 10 minute walk to the Uffizi Gallery and Ponte Vecchio Bridge and 15 minutes to Accademia.The room was clean and recently renovated and quiet considering we were on the street side. It exceeded our expectations for what we paid. Would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Friendly staff, great breakfast and nice rooms Great find in Florence. The rooms were confortable and clean. The airconditioning was great. The bathroom was small but confortable and modern. The staff was great, always friendly and helpful. The lady who served breakfast made you feel like you were visiting family. Coffee was great and so were the pastries. It might be a little far from the center of Florence but the bus was just a block away and the walk to the center was nice, wonderful small street with plenty of little shops to entertain all the way. I would certainly come back to this great hotel.

<Content>Fantastic hotel for the price I have just spent 4 nights at the Orcagna Hotel and found it very impressive. A small but very clean room, well equipped with a small balcony overlooking Florence and an excellent bathroom with hot water all the time. The breakfast was good, incredible coffee or hot chocolate, fruit juice, rolls, jams, sweet rolls, cereal and yoghurt. All very fresh and as much as you wanted. The TV had CNN so we could keep up to date with world affairs in English. The staff very friendly and helpful as well. The area is not touristy at all, we had some great meals locally where we stumbled through Italian menus with support from waiters.There is a Co-op supermarket 2 minutes away for any food needs or as gifts to take home - wine, oil, vinegar, cheeses, prosciutto etc. The only thing that downs the rating to 4 is the walk into town - not itself a problem but it does make it a long way from the station for buses and trains. Otherwise we enjoyed walking into Firenze along the river.

<Content>A good night's sleep in a friendly atmosphere We stayed here for 2 nights in the beginning of October, 2004. Paid 85 Euro/double room. The staff was very friendly and helpful; the bathroom very clean and the bed comfortable. We had a nice balcony with a view of the street below. The mosquitoes bugged us one night but I don't know of any places that can control that; we just had to do a thorough search of the room in the evening and keep the windows closed. They had one computer, where the guests could use internet for free downstairs. The breakfast was ok--croissants, coffee, juice, cereal, yogurt. The only small downside is that it took about 15 minutes to walk to the main part of town but it wasn't terrible.

<Content>Warm, welcoming and friendly This is a cute little hotel, where the welcome was warm and friendly and the staff were very helpful.Our double room was really large, clean and comfortable. So was the bathroom. It's older, but clean.The breakfast is good, too.The hotel is about a 15 to 20 minute walk into the centre of Florence. It is also possible to get a bus - there is a bus stop a short distance from the hotel. There is a supermarket around the corner, too.Unfortunately we were told we were unable to use an international calling card from the phone in our room. In fact, we were also unable to use the phone to even call an international operator. This was frustrating, as we stayed at the hotel on the basis that it offered direct dial telephone in the room. However it did not spoil our overall impression of the hotel.

<Content>Hotel was okay Hotel was ok. Nice lobby, cute breakfast room with adequate breakfast (yogurt, cappuccino, mediocre croissants), very helpful staff. ROOMS: very small, but clean, with clean, modern bathrooms. CONS: To turn on the airconditioning, we had to stand precariously on furniture to turn on the unit mounted near the ceiling. The a/c is turned off from 2am-5am, so you might wake up sweating. The a/c is turned off whenever you leave the room. MAJOR CON: NO HOT WATER in the morning during my four day stay. This was frustrating. I had to take evening/late afternoon showers, and sometimes even then the water was only warm and not hot.
