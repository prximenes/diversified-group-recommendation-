<Content>Loved the Aviatic The Hotel Aviatic St Germaine is lovely and the staff is wonderful. I only stayed one night, but if I return to Paris I will stay at this hotel my entire trip. There is a metro stop within four minutes and plenty of restaurants and shopping within five minutes. My room was very nice and I am extremely picky. The decor was very nice, the bed was comfortable and the deep soaking tub came in handy after walking in Paris. There is complimentary wine and snacks in the evenings, which was also a nice touch. Paulo and the rest of the staff were very kind and patient with all of my questions. Stay at the Hotel Aviatic St Germaine and you will not be disappointed.

<Content>A really pleasant experience We have just returned from a three night stay in Paris at the Hotel Aviatic, on the rue de Vaugirard.Previously we stayed at the Holiday Inn further up the same road but found the Aviatic much superior in many ways. The staff were very helpful in all manners (except one experience when we had to persevere to get a jug of VERY hot water) booking tours and transfers. The breakfasts are fresh and filling but repetitive ,served in a tiny breakfast room. It is full of charm and character.We stayed in a double deluxe room on the 6th floor which was small but very well appointed.The bed was extremely comfortable after pounding the pavements of Paris all day long. The hotel is located about 10-15 minutes walk from two different Metro stations so very conveniently placed to get to all the famous Parisian sights. There are some good restauarants and brasseries nearby , but our 5* favourite was the Restaurant Rousseau on the Rue the Cherche Midi. They serve some splendid food, good wines and desserts to die for - about 15 minutes from the Aviatic. All in all, a very memorable experience which we would gladly repeat, and our thanks go to the hotel staff for makingour stay a very enjoyable one.

<Content>not great We had a standard room, which had not been renovated recently and really looked rather tired, bathroom included. It had a small window and inadequate lighting. It was small but I have been in smaller rooms in Paris, this was an acceptable size. Our room overlooked the interior courtyard so we were not bothered at all by street noise, but were very bothered by the noise of the metro! I find it hard to believe that this has not been mentioned in more reviews, I think only one reviewer mentioned it. We were on the first floor, so I presume it is not a problem on upper floors. Make sure you ask for an upper floor room! I also did not like the narrow metal spiral staircase to access the room, although there was a decent sized lift. Although this hotel is in the 6th arrondissement (St Germain des Pres) it is closer to Montparnasse. If you like Montparnasse this is a good thing as you get the best of both districts, also being pretty close to Rue de Rennes and Boulevard Saint Germain. Personally I think that Montparnasse is fine and has some good restaurants and museums but I do prefer St Germain and would have liked to be a bit further north.

<Content>Highly Recommend Aviatic Hotel We stayed at the Aviatic Hotel in Paris for 2 nights and loved it! It was our first time to Paris so we relied on TripAdvisor and guide books. Not much was said about this hotel in the books so I wanted to share our experience. It was very richly decorated and our newly renovated room was tasteful and very clean. It was small but we expected that. It is located in the 6th and we were abe to walk everywhere. It is only a 5 minute walk from Gare Montparnesse bus terminal (we took the Air France bus from CDG Airport). Fromt he hotel we walked to the Eiffel Tower, across the Seine to the right bank and back. We were in walking distance to St. Germain which had good restaurants and lively night life. We loved it and would recommend it to anyone looking for a small, clean, tasteful hotel. For only 160 euros per night we thought it was a great deal.

<Content>Great hotel and staff Two couples (mid 50s) in Paris for first time. Great room, staff very helpful and friendly. Their English was excellent. Rooms extremely clean and non smoking. The king size bed was a surprise. Our rooms faced the inner courtyard and it was so peaceful at night. A little bit further to walk to the Seine than I anticipated but the weather was great and the transportation system very good. The breakfast was excellent - the coffee machine offered cappuccinos, American coffee,cafe latte etc and you could help yourself as much as you wanted to the buffet and refreshments. Great start to the day - you didn't need lunch. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Great Hotel for your money Me and my wife took a breack last 19 September for 3 nights at this hotel. Convenientely located ( also if not so close to the Luxembourg gardens ) just in walking distance from the metro line 4, is a small historic hotel with a family target clientele.Our room on the 3 floor was a superior room with a good bathroom but the bed wasn't a queen bed but two single paired bed. Room was a little small but perfect for Paris standard bedroom size, it was the number 315 just close top the elevator with a sad inside view. Was very clean and with a good closet.Breackfast is also a good value for money at 14鈧?Overall if it fits your budget is a wise choice.

<Content>superior room! went to france for 11 days, stayed in 5 different hotels and this was the most disapointing one. we had booked a superior room.it was small but that i dont mind, the decoration is long over due and it is not central to my standard being close to the montparnasse railway station so far from the seine. after reading the reviews it feel like i was in a different hotel but no the pictures prove that i am talking about the same one!would not return.

<Content>Fabulous, Romantic Hotel in a great Location Do not, whatever you do, confuse this gem of a hotel - L'H么tel Aviatic (Saint Germain) - with the other Aviatic hotel nearby. Our taxi from the airport tried to drop us off at the other Aviatic and we were horrified (it lacked any appeal and looked very run down). I have since noticed that some of the Aviatic's critiques have been wrongly posted (the descrpitions don't fit!) onto the H么tel Aviatic Saint Germain's profile - the only explanation for some cutting reviews - because this place (and I reiterate - the AVIATIC SAINT-GERMAIN) is a real find. We were welcomed into the tastefully decorated lobby (greys, reds and dark woods, with a spattering of antique furniture) with genuine smiles and invited to come down at 6pm for a complimentary apperitif in the lobby (a delightful gesture). Our room, although not huge, was beautifully dressed up in tuile de jouy fabrics (tr猫s romatic!), and had more than enough space for luggage. The bathroom was impeccable - not one speck of dust! It felt more like we were staying in someone's home than a hotel.That evening, after our FREE aperitif, we asked Reception whether they could recommend a restaurant. The knowledgable chap knew the area like the back of his hand and we were surprised to see how very close we were to St-Germain and the River. In under ten minutes we were seated in lovely restaurant (the concierge booked us a table). Overall we were utterly enchanted with the hotel, its d茅cor and its staff. We'll defintely be coming back. The price for the quality is excellent. HIGHLY RECOMMENED by two Brits who are usually difficult to please!

<Content>Wonderful Aviatic hotel After a long trip, from Mexico, I arrived to the Aviatic Hotel, located at Rue Vaugirard. It was wonderful to enter to the room an see a very confortable bed, a clean and spacious bathroom. This is an amaizing hotel, with TV via satelite, internet conexion, they offer a delicious breakfast. One important issue for me was the kindness of all the staff and the owner of the hotel, incredible! they made me feel really at home. I have no doubt to repit the experience to stay at Aviatic and I麓m very confortable to recommend this hotel to my friends.

<Content>Loved this Hotel We spent a few nights in the beautiful hotel. We had our family of 5 with two connecting rooms and we were all very comfortable. The hotel is perfect for families and for couples looking for a fabulous place to stay. The hotel is perfectly situated in town - we were able to walk or take the Metro everywhere we wanted to go! We would stay at this hotel over and over!

<Content>Aviatic Hotel Saint Germain is a real standout!! I took the family to Paris summer 2007 and we stayed at the Aviatic Hotel Saint Germain for a week in late August. We positively loved the place! We had 2 adjoining rooms on the top floor. The layout was great as it gave the adults and the kids the space we needed. The rooms were spacious, comfortable, and tastefully decorated. The beds were super comfortable and the rooms were quiet at night, something my wife and I value greatly. Staff was friendly and helpful, and we loved the breakfast. Last but not least, the price was affordable, in spite of a strong Euro. Two thumds up to great, centrally located hotel when visiting one of the coolest cities in the world!

<Content>Very nice hotel, perfect location! Nice hotel with very friendly and helpful, multilingual staff!! Rooms are clean, location is perfect!!When we go back to Paris, we will certainly consider it again!Minor thing to be mentioned.. the breakfast is quite expensive.. that's why we booked without.. There is a small supermarket and some bakeries nearby, from where you can make a solid and tasty breakfast yourself, for a quarter of the price of the hotel breakfast.Hotel is close to subway station Falgui猫re (line 12) and to St. Placide (line 4)

<Content>Lovely little gem As I was travelling alone I thought carefully about where I would stay. This proved to be a great find. Normally I would avoid anywhere near stations but this was a lovely area. Very reasonable, friendly staff, close to Tour Montparnasse where the airport bus arrives, a shopping centre and Monoprix. Also close to Velo station in rue de Vaugirard (I would recommend trying the bikes - read all the instructions first!). Lots of good resturants near the tower or just walk down directly in front of the Tower past all the shops to Saint Germain (It was brilliant but probably much more expensive to stay). Very clean and lovely fully tiled bathrooms - no grotty corners and it still has great character. Small rooms yes but this is Paris.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel, great location and superb staff We have just returned from a terrific stay in Paris. The Aviatic hotel is magnificent and we have never experienced such incredible service in Paris before. The staff beginning with Jean-Marie who was extremely considerate and helpful upon our arrival from London, with exchanging our booked room for a bigger one once he realised how tall my husband and I are :-) I applaud the staff we met , they were knowledgeable, courteous and helpful at all times, thank you Paulo, Marilyn...The rooms are very clean, up-to-date with all modern cons. The hotel is located perfectly for Paris' tourist and non-tourist attractions. walking distance to Jardins de Luxembourg, Poilane, la Seine, Louvre, Nagoya, terrific cafes, restos and shops... I lived in Paris and have visited it many times afterwards but this has been one of the most memorable stays thus far.We shall return and stay at the Aviatic St.Germain!

<Content>Excellence... I stayed at the Hotel Aviatic, on the rue de Vaugirard, which is an excellent location to stay when in Paris. The staff were very welcoming and the rooms clean, spacious and extremely comfortable. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Paris or going there again as it's position, beautiful interiors and excellent service would be hard to beat else where.

<Content>The Aviatic is Great We loved staying at the Aviatic. The location is terrific and it is a very friendly and clean hotel. My wife had her wallet stolen out of her purse at the Musee d'Orsay and it was the quick action of Alberto at the front desk of the Aviatic hotel that was able to find out that it had been found and turned in at the museum and we were able to get everything back except a small amount of cash. This was all in the midst of the transportation strike. We would stay at the Aviatic again!

<Content>wonderful hotel I visited this hotel in September of 2007, few days ago.The Aviatic is an excelente three stars in Montpanasse. Metro, restaurant and bars only two minutes away; The staff is very helpfull they changed the room at the same price because we have a little baby and the standard room was not big enough.The rooms were clean, modern and tastefully designed. We would not hesitate to stay there again

<Content>They gave us the ol' switcharoo We were incredibly excited to stay at this hotel that everyone had said was charming and wonderful. We never got to.We emailed and confirmed our reservation the day before. Unfortunately, when we got to our hotel - well before check-in time - we were told they didn't have room for us, and that we would have to stay at another hotel they booked for us a block away. They gave us a somewhat bogus excuse, which was confirmed by the fact that we witnessed the other hotel (where we stayed) give the same excuse to other travelers, requiring them to go to Aviatic Hotel! I'm not sure what the deal is, but I've heard this happening in Europe and it left a bad taste in our mouth. It seemed like a perfectly charming hotel though.

<Content>Lovely Hotel! We just returned from a wonderful week in Paris staying at the Aviatic Hotel Saint Germain. What a lovely hotel! I鈥檝e not written a hotel review before, but I thought I should share our great experience. We chose the Aviatic based on TripAdvisor reviews and were delighted with our room--a superior on the 5th floor. The superior was roomy by Paris standards, charmingly decorated, and included a nice sized bathroom with shower and tub. Wonderful amenities included adjustable AC, room in the fridge for our own bottle of wine, bathrobes, in-room safe, and great water pressure. The room and bathroom were spotlessly clean throughout our visit.The staff could not have been nicer. We were greeted in English and given a map, directions to attractions, and transportation advice, such as getting a Carte Orange one-week Metro pass. Over the course of our stay, we received ready answers to our questions, always in good English, from the different persons staffing the reception counter. Everyone was polite and helpful.The elevator is very small but was useful for getting luggage up to our room. We often used the circular staircase to come and go.The hotel's location is ideal on a quiet street very close to transportation. A Metro is right around the corner on Boulevard Montparnasse, and several other Metro lines are nearby as well. It's only about 10 minutes to Gare Montparnasse (we took the Air France bus from CDG to this train station and walked to the hotel). The breakfast room looked nice, but we chose to save a few euros and eat down the street. Boulevard Montparnasse offers many dining choices, and boulangeries and small supermarkets are also nearby. We especially liked the little shops (pastries, take-out, fresh fruit groceries, etc.) up the street on rue Notre Dame des Champs. For a wonderful dinner, don't miss the Chez Marcel bistro on rue Stanislas. While located in the 6th arrondissement, the Aviatic is closer to the 14th than to Boulevard Saint-Germain. However, it's an easy walk north to this bustling area and to the Seine. This hotel was a very good value. Previously my husband stayed in the 6th at a similar hotel for twice the rate, and his accommodations were not as nice. We would definitely stay at the Aviatic again.

<Content>A fine hotel We stayed at the hotel from June 16th to 21st, 2007.The location was very good (about a 5 minute walk to the Metro) as well as a short walk to many restaurants of all types and price ranges. Further, it was an easy walk to many shops, etc.The room we had was large, A/C and had a large bathroom (by Paris standards). We also had an in room-safe and fridge (though items were expensive if you chose them). The hotel had an elevator that worked well. Free newspapers in French, English  German.You could get breakfast there (14Euros) but it was expensive for what was offered. You'll do better at one of the close restaurants.The staff was friendly, helpful and all spoke English very well.We'd consider this hotel again.

<Content>Great Location Reasonable Price This hotel is in an awesome spot especially if you love to explore. The room we had was exactly as shown on the website and bathroom was nice and large. The rooms will always be small in Paris and as we spent most of our time exploring the bed was just perfect to come home to after the days acitivities. The metro is only just up or down the road however it is an easy walk to most tourist attractions. The local eateries also cater to the english speaking tourist quite well (helps to no a little french of course this is paris!!). My wife was also pleased to have some shopping alternatives close by with some chain stores and smaller boutiques all within 500m. We caught the Air France shuttle bus from Orly into Montparnasse and only a 5 minute walk to the hotel. So either by train or bus the airports are easliy accessed.Overall a great spot great price (for Paris) and well worth a visit. We stayed for 6 nights and did not encounter any problems with the staff always happy to help where they could.Would we go back ? Yes and also recommend it !!

<Content>NIce Hotel, Great Location We selected the hotel based on Tripadvisor reviews. The hotel staff was very nice, room was small, but very clean, and the bathroom was very clean. Great location. We would stay there again. Tripadvisor reviews were accurate. It is all a matter of perspective. I should note that some people may become confused since The Aviatic St. Germain and the Aviatic Hotel are the same Hotel. Some people call it the Aviatic St. Germain, others Hotel Aviatic. So there is no confusion, it is located at 105 rue de Vaugirand in the Latin Quarter. It is within easy walking distance of the Eiffel Tower, Train Station, and Metro Station.

<Content>Fabulous hotel - highly recommend I've never written a hotel review before, but having stayed at this hotel just recently (Oct 2006) and after reading a poor review about it I felt it necessary to share my experience. We thought it was a lovely hotel and good value for money for Paris prices.From the minute we arrived we were greated by friendly staff who spoke perfect English (and didn't appear to mind either), in a clean, well lit lobby. They were extremelly helpful in providing directions to metro stations, restaurants and tourist attractions. Also offered to book us into see any shows. There was a computer offering internet to guests also.Our room was a twin overlooking a small courtyard. It was very clean and tidy with a fabulously huge modern bathroom. The decor was quaint Parisian but not guardy like I had expected it to be.Expecting to only eat crossiants in Paris, our breakfast was the best we had experienced through Paris/Italy, even offering a toaster (it had been a month since I'd had toast). I totally rate this as a good cheap hotel to stay in. You get what you pay for right and if you want all the fancy trimming go 4 or 5 star and pay horrendous prices.

<Content>Great Location, Very Clean My wife and I decided to book our first night in Paris from home--so we had an destination when we got there. However, we didn't want to be locked into one hotel for the entire week, especially since we had no idea what to expect with regards to the location.We made a good choice with this hotel. The Hotel Aviatic was very easy to find from the metro station--about a 5-10 minute walk. We arrived before check in, but the staff allowed us to check in our bags until the appropriate time. (They also allowed us to leave our bags there the next morning while we were out and about.) The staff all spoke English and were very helpful.The elevator to our room was really small--we almost had to go one at a time, but it was nice to have. Our room was about what we expected--except for two twin beds as our double. Others who have been to Europe know that this is pretty standard, but we were a little shocked. But we got over it quickly as it was all part of the experience. Otherwise the room was very clean and comfortable. No complaints at all.I would definitely recommend staying here again--even though it's on the pricier side, but I would try a different room.

<Content>What a gem We stayed at this hotel for eight nights in July and it met all our needs and more. Friends told us that hotel rooms in Paris are small so we booked a Millenium room which is larger. It met all our needs - clean, comfortable beds and pillows, air conditioned, very nice bathroom and very friendly multi lingual staff. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wanted to stay in Saint Germain de Pres.

<Content>Tres bien! Nice hotel and a good value for Paris. Location was good, between the Eiffel Tower and the Latin Quarter, with access to several Metro stops within 2 blocks in any direction. Several restaurants just around the corner on Blvd. Montparnasse, especially convenient after a tiring day of sightseeing. All staff, especially front desk, were friendly and helpful. We stayed in two adjacent rooms (226 and 227) in the back building; both rooms overlooked a quiet inner courtyard - really more of an air shaft. The circular staircase to upper floors was treacherous - really not usable - but there is an elevator that was always functioning and quick. Terrific bathrooms, with tub/shower combos and great water pressure. The carpeting and coverlets were worn, but the rooms were clean. Our rooms were air conditioned - unusual in hotels of this level, but very welcome, as it was 85 - 90 degrees while we were there. Buffet breakfast was very good: fresh fruit salad each day, croissants and a full assortment of cereal and breads, plus cheese and yogurt. NB: work was being done on the front of the hotel, with netting and scaffolding covering the entire facade.

<Content>Good Value at the Aviatic hotel This was my 4th visit to Paris and I went on a solo shopping trip for a few days and was looking for a hotel in the 6th. The Aviatic is a little further away from St. Germain des Pres than I had hoped, but I enjoy walking (I could have taken the metro) and was able to use the money I saved on lodging for shopping! The heater in my room was not working and it was a French holiday, so I stayed in 3 different rooms. It was not a problem and the staff offered to help me move my things. All 3 rooms were consistently clean and quiet. The staff was friendly and helpful. It's close to Montparnasse and easy to get to and from the airport via bus.

<Content>What a pleasant surprise This is our first trip to Paris. After our not so pleasant experience with our hotels in London and Tokyo last year, we thought hotels in all big European cities would all be like Manhattan in high seasons, either too expensive or just dirty and stingy closet like rooms. The Aviatic Hotel was at similar price as our earlier hotel in London, but it was just day and night. We are not sure if it was just our bad luck in London, or just in general Paris is a city with better values, but we were quite happy with out stay at that Aviatic.First of all, there are no curfew hours, we can return to our room no matter how late, which is a big plus considering the city is the city of light. Second, the bathroom is big and clean, which is not typically found in this price range for big city hotels. The Aviatic is also nicely located in the middle of everything, so there is plenty to do within walking distance. Over all, we liked it a lot.

<Content>An excellent choice of hotel We have just had a wonderful long weekend in Paris, and want to recommend the Hotel Aviatic most warmly. We chose it after extended research on the internet, and found the positive comments on Trip Advisor very helpful in this regard. We agree wholeheartedly with those who found this a good place to stay. It is a delightful hotel close to the Boulevard Montparnasse in the quiet Rue de Vaugirard. We were greeted warmly on arrival by a friendly receptionist who changed from speaking Spanish to the previous arrival, into fluent English for us. Each receptionist over the next three days was equally polite, friendly and helpful. Our room was immaculate and spotlessly clean (a service repeated each morning), tastefully furnished with a good-sized bathroom. Ample cupboard space was provided in the small entrance hallway. We were next to the lift, but heard very little noise. Breakfast was good value, with an ample choice. We were initially concerned about the distance to the Seine, but discovered regular buses from just round the corner covered the distance in under 10 minutes. We would not hesitate to stay there again.

<Content>Okay value I visited this hotel in September of 2003. It is very basic - rooms are typically small but comfortable. I found most of the staff helpful but had problems when checking out. They attempted to charge me for a number of drinks from the mini bar (pop and water) when we had touched nothing in the minibar. The manager was very rude about it - and kept saying she had checked it herself. My suggestion is to ask that they empty the minibar on your arrival if you have no intention of using it - as it was a headache to get this straightened out. Otherwise a fairly good value.

<Content>MIL approved! On the basis of the agreeable price offered by an online hotel booking site, the strength of the positive comments on this forum, and crossed fingers on the negative, my husband booked rooms at the Aviatic for me, my mum and teenaged siblings when we visited Paris last month. I don't know about other cultures, but in Asia, there are no mother-in-law jokes and they are revered... :P So you can guess the amount of prior research my husband undertook and his trepidation at the MIL's reaction when she finally arrived.Well, after a gruelling 17hrs on the road - flight from Singapore with stopover in Bangkok, we were expecting to be faced with the usual offer to let us put our luggage at the hotel until we return to check in at the usual time of 2pm. But we were pleasantly surprised, and really grateful, when they allowed us to check in there and then at 9am.They did not have adjoining rooms, so they upgraded one of the rooms to a millenium room so that we could have them directly opp., which was another nice touch. The rooms were clean, modern and tastefully designed. Bathrooms were well-sized, too.A little gripe would be the fact that the free internet in the millenium room was not working. When I asked the front desk, they said the wireless system for the whole hotel had not been working since it was installed (?) and recommended that I buy an internet card (9euros for 1hr!) to use the pc in the lobby. Then again, I wasn't expecting to be upgraded to the millenium room and free internet access in the first place.We had booked only 2 nights.. just in case we did not like the hotel. Right after checking in and giving the room a once over, we asked to extend our stay by another night.And my husband still remains my mum's favourite son-in-law :)This hotel is definitely MIL approved!

<Content>Excelente price, center and lovely staff This is not the Hilton... its only an excelente three stars in Montpanasse. You will find a superb hotel, cozy and warm, metro only two minutes away, Duroc station and Montparnasse Lafayette Galleries 4 minutes walking, stores, bars, etc etc etc. I realy think you will be very please to stay at Aviatic next time you go to Paris. Please, meet the staff!!!!! Philipe, Cecile, Marie!! I even know their names! They were just fantastic. From now on, Aviatic is my Paris hotel for life.

<Content>Mixed Bag My wife and I just returned from 3 nights at the Aviatic Hotel. The room was on the sixth (top) floor and was perfectly fine, esp as European hotels are concerned, but nothing special. We paid 95 Euro/night. Smallish in size, the room was built into the attic like roof of the building, so it had very low, sloping ceilings in spots. The Staff was not overly helpful, I must say. You are largely on your own for restaurant picks, but they are better with answering questions about transport, etc. The cleaning service was good although they oddly never took away dirty glasses, knives, etc. The Hotel is located in a reasonably convenient area, although we did not care for many of the nearby restaurants at all and wished that we were staying with some better nearby dining options.

<Content>Nice stay - No complaints Overall, I enjoyed my stay at the Aviatic. The room was comfortable, and the staff kept it clean. Although the hotel itself felt a bit cramped (especially the stairways), the room was big enough for me. Even though I speak no French, I had no trouble communicating with the staff, who all spoke reasonably good English. The breakfast was good, although I've had better at other hotels.A few (very) minor complaints: The bag of chips that was in my room was NOT free; I ended up having to hand over a Euro for it when I checked out. Also, when I tried to return late at night, I found that the outside doors were locked, which is not bad in itself except that I had to wrestle with them rather noisily for a while to get them open. Finally, the directions to the airport that I got from the staff on the way out were probably not the most direct route. But these are all nitpicks; I didn't have any major problems with my stay. I'm relatively new to overseas travel, and I was bracing myself for a disaster story after reading reviews of some hotels, but my stay at the Aviatic went smoothly.

<Content>Rude, dirty and dishonest! My wife and I arrived here after a long flight in September '03 and will never return. We had pre-paid on Priceline and were given a room so small we could not stand and open our suitcases. The promised air conditioning was absent.When we asked to change we were sent to a different hotel 3 blocks away. After settling into a barely passable room there we were told we could not stay and required to return to our original room at the Aviatic. We declined, were refused a refund and left. The Aviatic staff were rude, the rooms dirty, and it was clear that there was a bait-and-switch aspect to the whole thing. I surmise that they use Priceline to dump their worst rooms on customers who are then locked into paying with no recourse.There are so many lovely choices in St. Germaine..go elsewhere!

<Content>The BEST! True Parisian Decor  I searched for three months on the Internet too get the best for my money and this is it! A family owned Hotel, recently refurbished, large european bath rooms, lovely buffet breakfast included in price, which was so very reasonable. The room was festooned with all the Parisian toile, stripes, lace, fabulous draperies, and pictures, that you could expect...with a garden view. The staff is outstanding...if you don't speak french bring your Rick Steve's phrase book, all Paris people love it when you TRY to speak their language. Always start with Pardon me Madam/Monsouir...and end with s'l vous plait (if you please) and merci beaucoupe (thank you very much). All of the staff speak some english, but appreciated your efforts in speaking French.The Hotel Aviatec is located one block from the Metro (tube) Saint Placide stop and that is the best way to get around. I felt very safe even after dark. Wear a money belt. CLOSE to everything!With the metro you are minutes away from anywhere you want to go in Paris. Taxis get stuck in traffic, lots of it, and the meter just keeps on ticking.January is a good time to travel, less tourists, you blend in, don't wear white tennis shoes or you won't. There are lots of SALES this time of year. Bring a waterproof 3/4 jacket and you will stay dry even in the snow! I wore ecco clogs and we traveled miles each day.All people in Paris were helpful and nice!Sherry

<Content>Ignore the star ratings, stay here 8/22/03Just got back from Paris today, stayed at the Aviatic Hotel and if anyone is interested in going to Paris I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel. The staff were extremely helpful  polite, don't listen to the people who tell you that you should attempt to speak French, everyone I spoke to at the hotel spoke English and didn't mind at all that Bonjour was about all I knew. The superior rooms are more than adequate and you can get specials on them (I booked thru evacations.com). The hotel is on a quiet street but there are nice restaurants about a 2 minute walk from the hotel, you won't need one for breakfast, they include a continental breakfast with your room. If you are a little unsure of french cuisine there's a McDonalds and Hippopotamus restaurant nearby. Thanks to everyone at the Aviatic, you made the trip much easier than I anticipated.

<Content>Friendly, but dangerous I stayed at the Aviatic two years ago.The staff are friendly, the rooms are good (aircondition) and clean, the breakfast is typical french (small selection).The negative is that there were no non-smoking rooms. The French people smoke everywhere. The emerency exits are useless if a fire breaks out on the lower floors. All stairs are leading down to the reception and there are no outside escapes. This rat trap would not be legal in Norway.
