<Content>A good budget accommodation It was of reasonable walking distance to Chinatown, Paddy's Market and also Central Station which was quite fun to look around. The area is quite an old run-down area in my opinion but I wouldn't call it dangerous and felt ok walking from Chinatown with a couple of people at 10pm at night. The hotel is a good budget hotel that is clean and I do recommend this to those on a budget that just want sleep. I personally wouldn't choose this hotel as a long term stay however, and would rather pay a bit more for a more central location and nicer interior. The only reason I chose this hotel was because we planned to stay here one night, but I don't regret staying there- I thought it was a pretty cool experience. I give it 3 stars because of the fact that it's budget accommodation but I think it's a 5 star budget accommodation

<Content>Excellent value I stayed here while attending an academic conference at UTS. When I booked it was called Aspen but by the time I arrived it had changed its name to Aspire. I was pleased with it. Great location, comfortable, reasonable price. Not flash, but a good-sized room with all the things you expect plus a big balcony with sliding doors that opened. I was on the third floor and looked out onto roof-tops so I could leave the door/curtains wide and have a sense of the outside extending beyond my room. The neighbourhood was leafy and residential, as another tripadvisor reviewer had said - surprisingly so given that it was a block back from Harris St and a few minutes walk from Broadway. I felt that I'd made a good choice for my $115/night.On my first morning I was up at 6am thinking I'd walk briskly around Darling Harbour, but was seduced by Bulwara St and explored it and surrounding areas instead, admiring the tenacity of quiet, tree-lined residential spaces in such proximity to the city centre and the snarling mass of arterial roads. I longed to peek inside the victorian terraces and see how many were expensively done up inside and how many might be affordable - judging from the outside, not all were renovated, some (with bicycles chained on the tiny verandahs and none-too-flash exteriors) looked liked they might be student accommodation. I found myself imagining that I could live here, if I had to. I think there'd be a good community feel to it, if only because they all had to turn inwards to appreciate their little patches of peace.I was glad that I'd found out about the Ian Thorpe Aquatic Centre (near the Powerhouse Museum, on Harris St) before I came because otherwise I might not have thought of bringing my swimmers and goggles with me. The $4.50 (student rate) for entry was well-spent given how wonderful it felt doing laps after a long day of sitting and listening to speakers at the conference.

<Content>Loved the Aspen I have just returned from a 2 night stay at the Aspen in Sydney and it exceeded all my expectations for a value hotel. It was clean, comfortable, quiet and the staff were very helpful. The hotel is in walking distance of a number of smaller restaurants and pubs, as well as being a short walk to Darling Harbour for a much bigger choice. And the price, booked online through the hotel website, was about half of brand-name hotels in the area. Had some problems with the on-line booking and had to ring the hotel but eventually sorted it out. I will definitely stay there again and recommend it to others.

<Content>A well priced average city hotel with friendly staff A well priced hotel -central city, Not far to walk to Paddy's Market and China TownDecor getting a bit older but in a nice quiet area.The room was a comfortable size with table and chairs and armchair.Shower over bath in Bathroom and comfortable enough size.Our room had a queen and a single bed,Outlook was onto apartments and a bit dark, and the balcony was not that inviting.Walls not sound proof as our neighbours complained to us at 8.30 am that they could hear our TV and couldn't sleep.We didn't think it was that loud.Taxi to Darling Harbour wharf 8 was about $15and a Taxi back from STAR City was aprrox $10.$12 on shuttle per person to airport (although we were charged $15 Per person to get there- that driver Made $6 that day.Staff were accommodating at reception and check in /check out was hassle free.We arrived about 9 am in the morning and were allowed to check in early,We also checked out at 11 am following day as we were going on a cruise on Pacific Dawn.Not a Flash hotel but very adequate and presented good value for the price we paid

<Content>Clean, Quite  Stayed for 6 nights at Aspen Ultimo. Very friendly staff at the reception (Steve  Pound). We booked a std room but was given a superior room on the 3rd flr with one double  a single bed. When we first arrived at this hotel in the late evening, the surronding looks a little nasty with old run down buildings. However, on a second look around in the day time, the surrounding is very safe  very near to Market City (Chinatown)  Darling Harbour. There is a link-bridge, one block from the hotel to Chinatown, Darling Harbour  Entertainment Center. The hotel is also very near to Powerhouse Museum  Ian Thorpe Aquatic Center. The hotel has a small business center with 2 PCs  a printer. You have to pay $5/hr (there are cheaper ones in city). My booking includes WiFi in the room. Secured car parking is complimentary. There is a small restaurant in the hotel but I suggest you try the Hannah's Pie just down the corner that serves very good Chicken/Mushroom  Seafood Pies. Else Kopitiam (one blk away) has very good Malaysian food. The only down side is the central heating. It gets cold in the middle of the night  the thermostat can only set at 24 degree max. However, will definitely stay in this hotel again.

<Content>Good value in need of refurbishment Great check in staff, very helpful and friendly. The room was spacious and clean. It just really needs upgrading. It looks like an old people's home from the 1970's.Close to darling Harbour which's a five minute walk and to Paddington market. If you are happy to walk to get to public transport then this is the place for you. Get a good pair of walking shoes as everywhere is a good 20 minute walk at least. A cafe is nearby serving breakfasts and snacks on week days and there are a few convenience stores close by, although these are very expensive - æ‹¢7 for a bottle of water, chewing gum and a chocolate bar! Great pie shop nearby too!

<Content>Aspen Hotel - Good 3 star property The Aspen Hotel in Ultimo is convenient, quiet and clean. It is a basic older style hotel but if you want something that is within walking distance to Capitol Theatre, Chinatown, Paddy's Market, Monorail, Central Station, Powerhouse Museum, Darling Harbour etc etc this is a cheap alternative to the major hotel chains in nearby Darling Harbour and CBD. So much is closeby in the way of restaurants, entertainment etc there seems little point to paying more for the bigger hotels if you only need a base in which to sleep.If more than 2 persons in the room book the Queen/Queen rooms rather than use the sofa beds. The sofa beds are only really comfortable for a child of no more than 10yrs. The rooms are tired but clean and comfortable. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful - nothing is too much trouble.Keeping in mind this is a 3 star property with no frills, I have still rated it as above average due to its location, price and friendly helpful staff.

<Content>Reasonable hotel My partner and I stayed at the Aspen Hotel (formerly Mercure Ultimo) for a weekend in April while attending a conference at Darling Harbour. Overall, we were happy to stay there.The proximity to Darling Harbour makes this hotel very convenient if that is where you intend to go. A short ten minute walk along a footbridge, and you're there. The city is also easily accessible from here. Ultimo is a quiet, pretty inner-city suburb.The hotel itself was okay, but not great. We had booked a deluxe room, but were put into a standard room. We didn't bother arguing about this, for two reasons. The first is that they let us check in early, which was a huge advantage for us. The second is that we were only charged $150 for the room, which we thought was reasonable given its location.We had no real issues with the room, except that the balcony (where we were allowed to smoke) had no furniture. The staff were always friendly and helpful.I would probably stay here again, especially if I had to visit Darling Harbour.

<Content>Good City Break Hotel Had a three night stay here. Efficient check-in and friendly young staff. No-one working there seemed to be over 35. At night it felt safe as security were present in the lobby and a card system in operation for main doors and room doors. As it was very city central there was some street noise but we were high up and it did not disturb. Rooms clean as was everything else. Good sized bath for a hotel. Room service delivery very prompt. Only had continental buffet in restaurant but plenty of choices for both breakfasts. Helpful concierge staff for directions and departure. No outstanding luxury but a good base for exploring a great city due to good location very near to buses and train hubs.Small negatives: Trays left in corridors for almost a day (not just ours). Terrible choice of music in bar. I know this is very personal but c'mon, thrash metal and heavy acid type dance? I found the beds too soft but that , too, is quite a personal gripe.

<Content>Excellent Location, Excellent Value Hotel is just 2mins walk from Chinatown and centre of Sydney, yet in a quiet residential area next door to a small park area. Good quiet location. (turn left out of hotel then down the hill and across the footbridge by the Power Msuem.. easy)Hotel is only very slightly dated, but I would not say dirty. Rooms OK, everything i needed was there and clean and working, so no complaints. Best performing aircon in a hotel room - one that seems to work - what a bonus! Nice balcony as well. Staff very helpful with sightseeing etc. A nice little cheap (æ‹¢45 night?) hotel that has benefit of excellent location. A similar hotel in centre of London wold prob cost 5-10x as much per night...Does not have the 24hr facilities of the larger Mercure or Novotel etc - but I rarely use them anyway. Does have room service and laundry etc.

<Content>Staff is fine, hotel is dated and dirty Just tried to check in and did not bother. No internet in the rooms and the Hotel is in terrible need of an update. Very dirty room. I could barely see out the windows. They had not been cleaned in months. The manager admitted that the hotel is in a serious need of an extensive remodel. This is a one star hotel in its current condition. For the same price you can stay at superior hotels.

<Content>Dont waste your money First impressions of this hotel was that it was very outdated and needs some work done. When we booked a room at this hotel we asked for a non-smoking room, we were given a room on the smoking floor which we were not happy about it but because we were only staying the one night we didn't bother to change it. When we got to our room it was very noisy, you could hear the T.V from the room next door you could also hear people talking. The room was tidy but very old looking with furniture that was vey tired looking, varnish was peeling of chairs etc. The bathroom was clean but the toilet seat had this huge crack in it and it was just holding together, i would hate to think what kinda 'stuff' and germs were lingering in that crack. The carpet needed a good clean, bar fridge made clanking noises all night.Basically if you can find somewhere better than do so i would NOT be staying here again.

<Content>Big Room, Convenient. Stayed in a king corner room, very spacious with king bed and two sofas. Also with a balcony. Rooms are dated but clean, understand refurbishment is planned.The main things were all good, bed comfortable, aircon works, linen was plentiful and good, shower had enough pressure.In my experience Mercure hotels run with minimal staff, but found front desk very helpful and available.Great location in quiet residential street, near Monorail.

<Content>Large Rooms and Balconies The location of this hotel is perfect. Close to the Monorail (100 metres) and the Explorer Bus Route (50 metres). 200 metres to Paddy's Market. 15 mins walk from Central Station and 20 minutes to city centre. Hotels with balconies (or, indeed, a window that opens) are hard to find in Sydney but all rooms here have a large balcony. Built in the 70's the rooms are very large and seem to have the original furnishings...a little worn but very comfortable. Aircon good. Room safe is handy. Be careful leaving luggage as storage area not locked or monitored. Reception service can be off-hand and people hard to understand. Restaurant needs a redecorate and meals are average. We have stayed 3 times and we will be back in October 2005. Recommend if you pay less than than $150. Not worth rack rate of $295.

<Content>Very convenient We stayed there for a week and enjoyed its very convenient location, at a short distance from monorail which takes you downtown with a short ride. Besides, the Chinese district and the entertainment one are close to the hotel which means you can get good and cheap food at any time and buy funny and inexpensive gadgets. Room are nothing fancy but they are ok and the street is very quiet.Of course staying in Darling Harbour means being closer to nightlife but we had no troubles travelling back to Mercure Ultimo also at night.I'd definitely stay there again.

<Content>Poor service First impressions weren't that great. Upon arrival the young lady at the desk was borderline rude and not quite as inviting as you would expect hotel staff to be. We had an early flight and arrived before check in so asked if we could store our bags and return later on in the afternoon. When we returned to retrieve our bags, one was missing (coincidentally the bag with all our camera equipment).I realised before I had left the storage room that the hotel was not liable for anything that was stolen or damaged. When explaining what had happened to the young guy at the counter he seemed quite unfazed and unapologetic. By the blank reaction that I recieved, it was quite obvious that he wasn't prepared to even pretend to find out if it had accidently been removed. I doubt he even said anything to the manager.I thought to myself okay my fault for leaving it in storage end of that matter.So we went back to the counter (minus one bag) and preceeded to check ourselves in. The young guy handed us the key card and promptly disappeard leaving us to wonder what room we were in. Overall the hotel was resonably comfortable.The service unfortunately was incredibly bad. Many staff members (apart from one nice lad) were very standoffish and not very helpful, they seemed like they would rather be somewhere else. A few times I called house keeping and the phone would just ring out. After days out items would be missing from the minibar (we of course got charged for them). When the beds were made, it was as if the blanket was just thrown over.My stay at this hotel, even though the above happened, would have been enjoyable if the staff were friendly and polite.
