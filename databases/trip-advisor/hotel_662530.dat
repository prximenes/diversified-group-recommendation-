<Content>Great Hotel at an excellent price! This is a great hotel, with excellent location, near Alexanderplatz station, with a lot of great restaurants nearby, which also have reasonable prices. The rooms are extremely clean, with a nice decor. The bathroom (with a shower) was nice, clean and beautiful. The only slight problem is that there was no telephone or fridge in the bedroom. The staff was friendly and helpful. Great breakfast (not included in the price, but not too expensive). Amazing value for the low price!

<Content>Great location, good value, nice rooms My husband and I stayed at the Motel One - Alexanderplatz for two nights in December and highly recommend it. It's like a boutique motel. Decor-wise, it is modern with the chocolate and turquoise color scheme, shag rugs in the lobby and a flat screen tv with a simulated fireplace video playing. The rooms, while small, are nicely decorated and include small flat screen TVs (that do play American DVDs). It's in a great location - within walking distance of the train station and bus lines (we caught the bus to Tegel airport quite easily), major sights, and many bars, shops, and restaurants. It really is excellent value for the money. Our stay ended up costing $95/night including all taxes and fees. The hotel also offers a breakfast buffet for 6,50 euros, which initially seemed pricey for yogurt, cereal, juices, breads, and coffee, but ultimately was quite convenient for us on our last morning there as we needed to get to the airport and didn't have time to search for a breakfast spot. There is a supermarket about a block away for those who would rather spend money on other things and save money on food. I definitely would stay here again.

<Content>Setting the standard for budget hotels in Europe! I'm normally a very tough critic of the places I stay, so it was not easy for me to check off 5 stars for my rating of this place. In fact, it was very tempting to give it just 1 star to drag the average down, so that hopefully there will be vacancies next time I visit Berlin! But the sheer value that this hotel offers for the price is something I have yet to see anywhere else I've traveled. There are bones that can be picked (and I shall pick at them), but this... this is what hotels twice the cost should aspire to!The Motel One Alexanderplatz is a brand-new building (when I looked it up on google earth, it was still a parking lot), built just off of Alexanderplatz proper -- which is about as ideal a location in Berlin as you could hope for. It is a very spread out city, with many different neighborhoods and areas, each with their own center. But Alexanderplatz is about as near as you can get to being in the center of the center! You're around the corner from the express bus stop to/from TXL, and a block away from the Alexanderplatz train station (regional and S-bahn trains), U-Bahn stations, and tram stops. Not only that, you're right next door to one of the bigger department stores (Galleria Kaufhaus... it's not KaDeWe, but it will do in a pinch if you need a pair of shorts), and one of the biggest tourist destinations (the Ferhnsehturm -- which also works as a handy landmark to navigate by). Other major attractions, like the Rotes Rathaus, Nikolaiviertel, Museuminsel, Neue Synagogue, and others are in easy walking distance. Those with a thirst for nightlife will find Club Weekend catty-corner across Alexanderplatz, Kino Internationale just down the road, and the legendary Berghain a cheap cab ride (or rather long drunken stagger) away.I'm not sure if there's any other ways to say the location is perfect, so I'll move on to the hotel proper.The design is clean, cool, and contemporary, with a lovely series of lounges with free wi-fi on the entrance level. Drinks, coffee, and light snacks are available, and in the morning, a large breakfast buffet that is arguably worth the 6 Euros/day extra. The front desk staff tends to the young, attractive, and very helpful. I had a package sent to me when I first stayed here, but it got held up in customs until after I had left. I figured it was a loss, but when I made a return trip (I really loved Berlin) over a month later, the staff remembered me, and the package, and presented it to me on check-in!The rooms are small, but the minimalist decor and cool tones help keep it from being claustrophobic. The big windows open, depending on what room you have, on the back courtyard, Rosa Luxembourg Strasse, or... the massive, 4-track elevated Stadtbahn running through the city (the Alexanderplatz station is just east of the hotel). The first time I stayed here, I had a room facing this, and was surprised by how quiet it was. I was, however, on the 7th floor, so I'm not sure if the noise would be worse on lower floors or for light sleepers. But for someone who's loved trains since he was a kid, it was, if anything, an extra perk!The bed and pillows were very comfortable, climate control was a cinch. I do wish that there was a proper desk chair in the room, however... sitting on a cushioned cube for too long isn't very comfortable on the back. I'd suggest an alternate arrangement if you're planning on spending a lot of time in your room working on business at the desk. Also, wi-fi, while available in the rooms, is EXPENSIVE. Not only is it overpriced, but your time will continue to run out whether you're logged on or not. Again, there is free wi-fi down in the lobby/lounge, but if you're planning on doing a lot of emailing and chatting from your bed, be prepared to fork over some Euros.The bathroom unfortunately has a shower that doesn't close, making it almost certain that you WILL get the floor wet, no matter what you do. It was, however, clean, nicely laid out, and not too cramped. The toiletry products are on the cheap side, so you might want to bring your own, or pick something up at a convenience store. Everything was cleaned thoroughly and promptly by housekeeping.All in all, I don't think I could have been happier. Their price could almost double, and it would still be a reasonable value (though at that point, I might consider upgrading to something bigger, with a bathtub and more amenities). However, at the prices I paid (about 50 Euros/night), Motel One Alexanderplatz was an incomparable value. You can keep your eyes open for other good values in Berlin, but if the price is still good, you will NOT be disappointed with this hotel. Great location, wonderful staff, quiet peaceful rooms.... What more could one ask for!

<Content>Great value for money and great location I stayed at Motel One for a few nights while I was in Berlin for a conference and was gobsmacked by the quality and service I got for the price. The hotel is very nicely decorated, with amazing attention to detail. Everything was spotlessly clean and the room was very comfortable. Breakfast was great and they offer free wi-fi in the lobby.You just It's located right next to the train station at Alexanderplatz, but the rooms are very well insulated so I couldn't hear a thing. Usually I'm a bit weary of Train station locations but this one is not shabby and I felt perfectly safe walking by at night.

<Content>What a steal! The Motel One Alexanderplatz was a steal! It could not be located closer to transit. It was very easy to get to sites and was a happening area at night. Our room faced the street which was a little noisey at times, but the view was great! Our room had everything we needed - beds were so comfortable and the bathroom had everything we needed. Breakfast was included in our rate and was simple. I would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again. I don't think you'll find a better deal in Berlin.

<Content>Great location, good hotel Great location, within walking distance to all the major attractions. Although directly opposite the rail tracks, with the windows closed I didn't hear any noise and found the room to be very quiet - I am particularly fussy when it comes to having a nice quiet room to sleep in. The rooms, whilst small and without proper wardrobe space, are clean and the bed was comfortable. The bathroom had great water pressure - just take your own soap as they don't provide it.Breakfast was good - bread rolls, selection of cheeses and sliced meats, boiled eggs, fruit salad, and cereals.The hotel reception was friendly and efficient (and spoke perfect english) . I really liked this hotel and if you are having a weekend break in Berlin I would recommend staying here.

<Content>Nice and modern Must admit we didn't get off to the best start, the location is very convenient, but not too attractive, and unfortunately our booking had been misplaced. The front desk staff were very friendly and quickly found us a room, at the price we had originally booked for. The rooms are nice and modern - small, but perfectly comfortable and clean. We didn't stay for breakfast as we had an early train, but overall the hotel had everything we needed. The only staff we came accross were lovely, even when we ran into them at the station and were given extra travel tips!

<Content>Like a fancy Motel 6, but fun and a great price This hotel is located well, near the Alexanderplatz station, great for getting anywhere. The decor is really fun and bright and upbeat. Someone told me it was aspiring to be like the W chain. Um, no. But still, it is fantastic at its own price point, which is fairly cheap. It's very happening at night actually and can make it hard to check in at that time since the front desk people are also bartenders! While it does have a bit of glitz on the outside, the hotel is fairly bare bones at its core, but for a night or two, it's good stuff. The breakfast is decent, light fare and in the lobby which is very open and full of light in the morning which is nice. Nice tv with good channels which is good when rolling in at night and wanting to chill. I can see why this chain is doing so well. They have this particular market down to a science.

<Content>Wouldn't go back Good points:1. Five min walk from Alexanderplatz railway station2. Very close to Unter den Linden and all it's sights and attractions, 3. Clean rooms4. Good breakfast and excellent coffee (6 am to 10 am only though)Bad points (many):1. No baby cots (!)2. No tea/ coffee making facilities i.e. kettles in the rooms (this is shocking and the first time we've encountered this problem in a proper hotel)3. No bath tubs in any of the rooms 4. Heating very hit and miss, if left on: makes the room stuffy and suffocatingly hot, if left off: room gets cold quickly5. No table fans available if required6. Railway tracks run along the hotel: so very noisy. The rooms away from the tracks have a depressing view of the wall of an adjoining building7. Far too expensive: we paid 107 Euros per night per room including breakfast and this is only a 2 star hotel. The 4 star Park Inn nearby costs only 89 Euros per night (without breakfast but far better facilities and outstanding views of the city: we stayed there for one night only as it was fully booked on the other dates)

<Content>What A Gem - Especially For The Price! I traveled to Europe for three weeks in June with six other professional women aged 40 to 60. Because we don't spend a lot of time in the rooms, we didn't require the Ritz. However, we wanted something modern, clean, safe, with good service in a good central location for sightseeing. The Motel One Alexanderplatz definitely lived up to our expectations, especially trying to please seven women who have traveled extensively throughout the world. Our trip began in Berlin for the first three nights at this hotel. We were definitely pleased from the start with the easy bus system to/from the airport to the hotel, walking distance to great restaurants and bars and Museum Island, subway a block away, great clean rooms that were quiet and good service. We had originally booked the Marriott, but switched to this hotel after reading the reviews on TA and getting a great price. The rooms are not spacious, but the location can't be beat, the lobby is nice, and the rooms are very modern, comfortable, and clean. Two thumbs up, especially considering the good price!

<Content>Excellent value for money I stayed at Motel One while on a business trip. The name, Motel one, scared me off . Makes you think of some dirty old motel but this place is actually really good. The hotel is categorized as a two star hotel but I would say that it feels like a four star!The location is brilliant, walking distance to most places and if you prefer not using your legs train, buses and s-bahn are all close by. The rooms are very nice and clean and good sized. There's a flat screen in the room with a built in DVD which could be very convenient for some I guess. The bathroom was nice and modern, kind of luxurious too with black granite, black mosaic and white tiles. A lot nicer than you would expect in a two star hotel. The breakfast was good with plenty of things to choose from and there's a little garden so at night you can have a glass of wine outside if you feel like it. I would definitely recommend the hotel as it is excellent value for money. I would however recommend you to ask for a room facing the garden, not the street. Some of my colleagues found the trains outside noisy.

<Content>Amazing Value for money, very modern central hotel We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights on a girls weekend and it was such value for money! We stayed Thurs-Sun and overall it cost us something like 120euro each for 3 nites, how cheap is that!!!!! The hotel was so clean, very funky reception/ bar area.. the hotel is decorated very modernly, bright blue decor.. the rooms were quite small for two people and so was the bathroom but the bed was really comfy..It wasnt a major complaint for us as we just wanted something basic but we were certainly impressed.. The subway station is a 5minute walk from the hotel and its also were the insider berlin tours meet from so very confienient for travelling on subway and for day trips and evening bar crawls. Overall I would recommend this hotel if you were not looking for a spacey room and just wanted somewere fairly nice to lay your head at night.. i would defo return to this hotel.

<Content>Loved it! This hotel had a very good balance between price and quality. It's actually pretty cheap! The rooms, the staff, the breakfast, ... Everything is highly professional. The U-Bahn is not far and the Hackescher Markt is just a block away.If I ever go back to Berlin, I will not have any doubt about my hotel-choice.

<Content>Great Hotel As other reviewers have said the location of this hotel is fantastic. Just a few minutes walk from the S bahn so brilliant to come in from the airport. We had rooms with a view of the television tower and although also over the S bahn tracks the noise was not a problem. We decided to go for the breakfast as at 6,50 euros it was ok value. I can really only think of one thing to complain of, the bedrooms are pretty small. The design is pretty cool also, our 17 year old was very impressed!

<Content>Good value Me and my wife stayed in a double room for three nights in late january. We payed 74 euros for the room per night, which was without breakfast. I recommend that you don't include the breakfast which will cost you 6,50 euro per person, as there are lots of nice places to eat close to the hotel (try the hackescher h枚fe area).The lobby of the hotel is very trendy and the design is obviously well thought through. The same goes for the stylish room, all in all I would say that the hotel looks like a 4 star hotel. What makes it a 2 star is the lack of certain things as wardrobe, telephone and minibar in the rooms. The room was also quite small, but that does not matter to us at all when we are on a trip like this. The only negative thing I could say is that the rooms that face the front is 20m from the railway line, but as always on travel we had brought earplugs so we heard nothing. Ask for a room facing the backyard if this bothers you. Also, the bed was very hard, even for me who likes a firm bed. Other than this I would say we had a brilliant stay. The standard in this hotel is by no means a two star. The bathroom was very nice along with rest of the room. My wife (who is a designer) fell in love with the curtains and the bedblanket, which had the same patterns as was used in the receptionarea. FoodTip:- Eat at the restaurants close to the hotel, there is a lovely thai restaurant just outside, and a great italian trattoria called Ossena in (Hackescher h么fe). I would also recommend the ming dynastie opposite to the chinese ambassy (metrostop is Jannowitz br眉cke). Fantastic food and enormous portions at reasonable prices. BarTip:- Erdbeerbar not far from Alexander Platz (Max-Beer-Str. 56) has fantastic daquiries in many flavours. It is not very big, and has a urban relaxed feel.Sightseeing:- Brandenburger Tor, the berlin wall etc are obvious attractions, but nothing beats going up in fernseherturm for a view of the city at a height of 220m. It will cost you 9,5 euros per person and is well worth the money. I recommend going here in the last period of your trip, so that you can get a better understanding of where you have been (which streets etc).

<Content>Centrally located, contemporary design at a budget price This was my first stay at the Alexanderplatz location, but rarely my first trip to Berlin - I travel there often on business.The Motel One Alexanderplatz is located right at this famous square, and thus within walking distance to many businesses and tourist attractions. Public transport connections are excellent - there is hardly a more central place to stay in Berlin.The rooms are small but nicely furnished (including a flat screen TV with built-in DVD player, granite-and-tiles designer bathrooms) and excellently soundproofed.The hotel opened in 2007, so everything is new and spotlessly clean.There is no minibar and no in-room telephones. This ties in with the concept that you pay for your room at check-in (all major cards accepted), so there are no queues at check-out. you just drop the key card. In-room Internet is available for a fee, as is a public Internet terminal next to the lobby.The spacious lobby offers free wireless Internet access (WiFi), drinks and snacks in the evenings. In the morning, the buffet breakfast (6.50 Euros) is served there.The hotel does not have a restaurant, but there are numerous restaurants around the Alexanderplatz square, as well as all major fast food chains located in the train station - so you will not go hungry.The hotel offers very good value for money. I would recommend it both to tourists and business travelers to Berlin who like very good, centrally located accommodation at an affordable price. If you look for room service, a spa or other luxuries, this two star superior hotel is not for you.

<Content>Great Location - Great Value The hotel is located directly at the Alexanderplatz - where you want to be. The hotel is brandnew.A little bit of design , nice staff and only minimum service (which is ok - sice the pricve is great).Try to get a room to the back - it is very noisy to the front.We had some problems with the smell of the brandnew carpet (we arrived 3 days after the opening), otherwise the perfect spot for a quick weekend in Berlin.
