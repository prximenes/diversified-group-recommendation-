<Content>Will be back! My fiance and I stayed here for one night while we were in Frankfurt visiting the Christmas markets. We absolutely loved the hotel! Got an amazing rate thru the Leading Hotels of the World website. The location was so convenient, a 10-15 minute walk from the main train station, the service is really friendly, the room amenities were great (we were upgraded to a suite, as I belong the the Leading Hotels of the World club, and we were given a bottle of wine, and a platter of fruit and chocolates upon arriving). Free minibar is standard in all rooms of the hotel. Best of all was the 2 hours of open bar in the hospitality suite (by invitation, which I think you get if you stay in a suite), courtesy of the hotel麓s bar, 篓Jimmy麓s Bar篓 (renowned in Frankfurt. My friend used to own a bar in the city and told me Jimmy麓s is one of the main after hours hangout for local restaurateurs and bar owners!). We decided to sleep in so didn麓t get to try the hotel麓s champagne breakfast, but we will do next time we go to Frankfurt as we will definitely stay here again!!!

<Content>What a great hotel What a lovely hotel. It is easy to get to with one stop on the U bahn from the Central Station or if you want to give your legs a stretch it's a 15 minute walk from the station.We had a warm greeting from the female receptionist who showed us to our room, which was in the wing. WOW what a room it was very large with a nice bathroom with his and hers sinks. The bedroom had nice beds and a good sofa to sit on. The free mini bar was also welcome as was the fresh fruit.This is a lovely hotel that deserves it's star rating. I would stay here again without hesitation. The room was a little warm would be my only critism, but we opened the windowed and suffered no issues with Road noise (on the Saturday night that the window was open)We went for the Christmas market, which I found to be better than Cologne. It is a long walk from the hotel, but easily accessible by the U bahn and public transport system.

<Content>Old-fashioned hospitality that creates contemporary comfort The hotel has a distinct 1950s Wirtschaftswunder charm, combining period furniture with lots of real antiques. It doesn't look or feel like one of those generic contemporary luxury hotels at all where everything is part of the same neo classical design concept. It has a more layered and lived in quality. And therefore the quality of the furniture and the rooms also tend to vary a bit. I had very good rooms at Hessischer Hof and rooms that were ok but not great.But what really sets this hotel apart from many of its Frankfurt competitors is the general level of hospitality here. For example, Hessischer Hof offers by far the best breakfast of any German 5star hotel I've ever stayed in. Period.And WLAN, minibar, fresh fruit in your room, Pay TV etc. are all complementary. It's not about the money you save on all of those freebies but you want to salute a hotelier that is smart enough to recognize how much of a nuisance all the extras they charge at other hotels can be. In a way old-fashioned hospitality becomes very modern hospitality here.

<Content>Dreadful - bad 10 years ago and still the same... Stayed here for one night - wrongly assumed that since I hadn't stayed here for well over 10 years it must have been updated WRONG. the hotel is old, the staff are surley and the rooms are dreadful. i had a single room - i kid you not, it was like a cell. a tiny bed shoved against the wall with a little desk in the room - bathroom same size as the bedroom. i booked a non-smoking room, at reception i double checked it was non-smoking....the room was a smoking room! i got moved to another room which was bigger but looked out on the main road. the road this hotel is on is the main road past the messe.....busy 24/7. the aircon in the hotel doesn't work, the heating was on max and no way to adjust.....it's was like a sauna. opening the window meant noise all night. bed was like sleeping on a slab of concrete. staff unhelpful. nothing good i can say about this place......and i would have written the same review 10 years ago! i can assume this hotel has zero repeat business but manages to get trade from the messe since it's so close. stay at the arabella or the hilton - much better and frankfurt is so small it makes no difference travel wise.

<Content>Beautiful Hotel This truly German hotel came at an excellent rate through Hotels.com for a 5 star hotel. It was very close to the main train station but just Northwest of it enough to stay out of the Red Light district, which is advisable.The room was elegant and the bathroom was pristine. Provided for you free of charge is a fruit bowl, bottled water, sodas, beer and juice. They even provided a small step machine and weights in the closet if you wanted a quick workout. There were 3 English channels, one was MGM, the rest news channels. There are blinds that pull down over the outside of the windows that completely block out the sun, so you can sleep late in the morning if you want to.I loved the breakfast, in this very elegant dining room with a big long buffet that included a little bit of everything. Also, the International Herald Tribune. It was a perfect place to stay in Frankfurt.

<Content>all around superb All around excellent. Likely the best of about a dozen hotels we stayed at during our 2 week whirlwind tour of Europe. Service, cleanliness, amenities were all superb. Moderate walk to the botanical gardens was awesome. Stayed on a sunday for a time-zone adjustment night, so can't say much about the other activities and nightlife, but we had a great time.

<Content>Love to be pampered Stayed at the Hessischer Hof with my 15 year old son on July 20, 2008 and since this was the last leg of our 10 day South Germany tour, we're a little tired (though culturally, visually and emotionally enriched) and can't wait to get back home. But the experience that the whole hotel gave us is quite relaxing and even feel pampered, from the check-in procedure, the patience that the front desk lady in answering my questions (or trying to find answers to my numerous questions) and even helping me book for dinner at the wonderful hotel restaurant, to showing us to our room, just like an honored guests in an old friend's house, is just superb! This is really a nice icing to cap a wonderful trip.Highly recommended.

<Content>Fabulous! We stayed at this hotel for 1 night and it was just wonderful! The room was huge as was the bathroom (2 sinks, a bidet, separate shower and tub). We even had a separate little room for our luggage. The restaurant was great. The hospitality suite from 6-8 was great. Met some nice people and drank free champagne for 2 hours.We were there on a Sat night and got a great rate. I believe the weeknights are more, however.The only thing I would warn about is the breakfast buffet. While it was in a gorgeous room with more food than you could ever possibly eat.....it was pricey. I think we ended up paying 26 euro each.

<Content>What a gem! We just had 2 nights here and it was our best experience in 3 weeks. Old fashioned charm, decor and service with an awesome restaurant and breakfast. I felt like I was in the 'plate room' at the White House! A little far from the main centre but an underground subway across the road. And Frankfurt is a surprisingly pretty and quiet city. Loved it.

<Content>Small nice hotel with excellent service The Hof is an excellent recommendation for business travelers and others that are looking for 5 star services for a great price. Although I didn't go to Frankfurt for business, it is still very accessible to visit all of Frankfurt from this location. The train, which is interestingly difficult compared to Paris, Barcelona and others, is located across the street and can take you anywhere.Some of the best features that were written about, I have to mention as well, which is one of the reasons why we decided upon the Hof and not the Radisson or others was the extras that they give you. By no means am I cheap, but being an American in Europe and the Euro issue, we should take advantage of the few things that ARE offered. The staff gives you free fruit in your room: banana, red  green apple and an orange with one still and sparkling water. These are replenished 2x/day. The mini bar has 2 oj's, 2 German beers, and lemon  lime mixers. All for free. Restocked 2x/day as well.One of the best services are the complimentary drinks 6-8 pm in the lounge. You have your choice of anything! Also, you are giving marinated black  green olives, nuts, and BBQ chips. Nice touch, but they should rotate the items daily for variety. If you haven't been to Europe in a while, this drink bill out would be about $75. This is a great precursor to dinner.One of the biggest surprises is the lack of breakfast options. Personally, I think they should add, maybe even for pay, some croissants, muffins, and coffee. To get this, you have to walk down to the Marriott and get it. About 1/8 mile~not far, but not convenient. A turn down service is offered which is excellent and you have yourself waiting with slippers and robe. You will love it.All in all, the HOF is an excellent option from the larger and swankier hotels, but the service here is what makes it different.

<Content>Unique and Special Pulling up to the Hessischer Hof you wonder what you've gotten yourself into. The hotel is in the business district and is in a non-descript building. And then you walk inside!The lobby is intimate and the staff first-rate. Check-in is quick. The rooms are large, especially for Europe. I loved the decor -- the desk was an incredibly interesting piece of furniture and the chair comfortable to work in. The bed is great with a soft feather comforter. The sitting area is decent sized. Do ask for a room off the main street, which can be noisy.The bathroom is quite large and has a nice tub. Amenities are plentiful and include bath salts. Large towels are on a heated towel rack, so always warm!Lots of little freebies -- internet is free. BIG bottles of still and sparkling water in the room are free. They give you a plate of fruit. The mini-bar (beer, soft-drinks, juice) is free. They have a free happy hour in the evening with drinks, olives, and munchies. And the hostess makes you feel right at home. Numerous free international newspapers are available throughout the day. You feel like a guest rather than a commodity.We ate dinner in the hotel restaurant. They had a wonderful prix fixe menu that included wine. Service was outstanding and the price was excellent, even with the exchange rate.Wakeup calls were timely and check out was quick. The staff was uniformly pleasant and attentive -- they actually take you to your room. Room keys are the bulky old-fashioned kind (which you leave at the front desk when you go out), but I found them quaintly refreshing.If you want a cookie-cutter, large chain hotel, this isn't it. But if you want something different, special and unique -- that makes you feel like you're in Germany, not anywhere USA -- try the Hessischer Hof. You won't be disappointed..

<Content>The ONLY place to stay in Frankfurt Arriving to Frankfurt for a day layover on my way to India, I decided to crash at the Hessischer Hof Hotel. The place was easily accessible by the city metro system (with only one transfer) from the airport. Arrival was a breeze and the woman spoke fluent German and English. The hotel itself was historic yet lovely and the STAFF is what will keep me coming back there EVERY time I visit Frankfurt. They were SO WELCOMING and friendly. The gym (at an adjacent real gym) was great and first rate. The front desk gives you a pass AND a workout bag that has shower slippers AND bottled water for free! They have nightly cocktails (again free) and direct you on great restaurants and things to see. Don't miss the Goethe house and museum and the opera house. I opted out of the champagne brunch and had coffee in the sunroom. Awesome place!

<Content>Loved the Hotel charm Shortly after arrival i was impressed on how they treat their guests with a very warm welcome.First i received an invitation to their arrival lounge. You can have free drinks (really anything), snacks (excellent food), from 6:00 pm to 8:00 pm. They provide free wireless throughout the Hotel. For security reasons you get a login and password for internet access upon arrival, which is good for 5 days.The Service is excellent. They carry your luggage to the room for you.They provide umbrella's if it's raining outside, they arrange taxi and everything you need for your travels for you.A huge stack of free newspapers in the lobby, which can be delivered to your room if you wanted to.Excellent restaurant within the Hotel. It's crowded sometimes due to its popularity, but very elegant and in Renaissance style.The rooms are really spacious, the rooms are being cleaned twice a day, a free mini bar in the room awaits you with beer, orange juice, soda, water (sparkling and flat)...The best is the Hotel bar in the basement. Very elegant andtruly a real bar.Overall a very nice hotel with great service and flair.Will definetely stay there again.

<Content>fantastic hotel Me and my wife stayed at hessischer hof for a weekend break to visit the christmas markets. I booked the hotels indulgance package direct with the hotel. Fantastic breakfast  dinner with wine to compliment your meal included in the price. You are also invited to free drinks in the hospitality suite beetween 6-8pm any drinks you want. Having stayed at other 5* hotels this takes top spot for me . Ignore the negative reviews on this site this hotel ouzes quality.

<Content>Great restaurant and close to Messe and centre This is a hotel that beats the rest in Frankfurt. Good service, very nice rooms but ask for one facing the back not the street because of the noise.The reason I like it so much is the top class restaurant.Dinner was excellent and breakfast one of the best hotel breakfasts I've had in many years. Overall a hotel of class and very good value. Convenient for the Messe and Frankfurt centre. Would highly recommend.

<Content>Noisy three star hotel Facing a street overlooking the fairs.Walls facing the street and windows makes street noise very audible.Internal walls: heard every single word the neighbor said over the phone.Smoke! Woke up middle of the night as cigarette smoke piled in through the vents (could not be turned off).Room looks and feels like 2-3 star in a UK suburban hotel.What is nice:Staff is friendly. Breakfast very good.Go somewhere else if you are sensitive to noise and odours.

<Content>5 star ++ And what style! This one is listed in the Leading Hotels of the World book and website. I have stayed in many of the others recommended by the LHW and none of them have cut the mustard. This place does, and it does from the minute you arrive. This hotel oozes real understated elegance. Reception is impressive with antiques and portraits dotted around the place and the staff are great. The rooms are beautiful and huge. With individual touches like Versace style ornaments, flowers and a bowl of fruit. The mini bar is free and has a small selection of wines, spirits and soft drinks. One surprising thing about the hotel is the complimentary bar area which is open around 6pm for all guest. I sat and had a bottle of Champagne, and all for free! Now that's class!Ok, so Frankfurt isn't the most fascinating place on earth but you just have to visit this hotel.

<Content>Comfortable, but in need of an update This hotel has a nice period feel to it, despite its bland exterior. Service is pretty good and the Jimmy's Bar is a pleasant (and popular) place to spend time.My room was surprisingly large, with a hallway, seperate bathroom and WC and endless storage spaces. The downside was that it felt a little dated and dirty, and my room's basement location didn't offer much of a view.The hotel is in a good location not far from the central busness district.Be warned if you are considering taking children here, the TV has free adult channels which seem to be on all the time. As a regular business visitor to Frankfurt, I'd say this hotel is ok but I'd rather stay at the blander but fresher Hilton, or the more funky but further-out-of-town Radisson.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel, excellent staff, perfect location! I stayed at the Hessischer Hof Hotel in Frankfurt and I think that it's simply... the best!The location is perfect, Rooms are very nice and spacious, and the Staff is very professional.A warm welcome, smiles, nice and smiling girls at the Reception... Good ambience at the Hospitality Suite (a sort of welcome cocktail on invitation).. great housekeeping service.. the buffet breakfast in the morning was great too... well... SIMPLY THE BEST.Alex at the Reception above all is really professional, he helped me very much during my stay, with the Internet connection, the plugs, he also helped me when my return flight had been cancelled for a strike (you can imagine my desperation... but he always helped me smiling and I felt really rassured and safe!)In general all the Reception Staff is at complete disposal of the Guest, and always smile to you.I will surely suggest this Hotel to all my friends and to all my colleagues, and of course next time that I will be in Frankfurt... I will book a room here again!

<Content>Great Service, in need of a refresh I stayed in this hotel for only one night and upon arrival was initially disappointed. The hotel is supposed to be 5* but the room furnishings are somewhat old fashioned and could do with a refresh. The bed was very small too. That said, by the time I left I was very happy with my stay due to the fantastic service. Little things like the free minibar, free fruit and chocolates, the turn down service, the card on your pillow with the next days weather, the free shoe shine services, the quality bathroom products... all little things but they make a big difference. I would stay here again but this hotel could be truly five star if they just spent some money on upgrading the rooms.

<Content>Disappointed This hotel is a member of The leading hotels of the world and the first thing I noticed was the dirty carpet in the lobby are, near the lifts. I mean really dirty.The reception area is small and the still use keys, not swipe cards to open the room door.The rooms are good size and mini bar is complimentary. The restaurant is very good. Last day of our stay our check out was at 2pm. We went out to do some shopping and when we returned to the hotel room, the maid already took the sheets off the bed and threw them on my suitcase. He was cleaning the bathroom when I told him that we haven't checked out yet.His response was that it's ok, we can continue packing. I was really upset, went down to the reception and they called him out the room. I never had that shower that I was going to but I got an apology from the reception.

<Content>Luxurious Hotel This hotel is quite luxurious. Rates are very high during convention times, but we were able to get a steal of a rate (85 Euros) by booking directly through the hotel's website for a slow weekend. Our room was elegantly appointed, particularly the marble bathroom, and even included a pair of bedroom slippers for each of us. The minibar was complimentary and included water, beer and fruit juices. A plate of fresh fruit and bottled water (both flat and fizzy) was also left for us each day. The hotel invited us to a complimentary evening welcome cocktail reception. Their bar (Jimmy's) has a clubby feel, and we were able to order a light meal there late at night. The restaurant looked very good, but we didn't have a chance to try it. The staff is excellent and speaks fluent English.
