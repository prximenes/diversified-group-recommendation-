<Content>Superb Value for Comfort  I stay at this hotel quite often whilst on my trips and connecting journeys to Amsterdam. The hotel's location is a bit out of the main tourist areas but is served well efficiently, to  from the hotel with the 15 minutes shuttle leaving from NH Barbizon Palace, opposite Centraal Station.The rooms are of high standards with all the amenities you would expect from a 4 star rated property despite it actually having an official 3 stars. It deserves better. Bathrooms are very clean and more than well equipped. Constantly the toileteries' selection is more generous than most other hotel companies I have stayed with. TV with few English and European Channels are avaialble in the rooms. Beds are very comfortable. The check-in staff are polite and helpful and they do actually try to remember that you stayed here before! Also I get to meet the Northwest Airlines Flight-crew in the mornings, everytime when I am checking out and they are leaving for Schiphol for their flight. Overall a highly recommended hotel for an extremely reasonable price.

<Content>Average Hotel Had a very corporate feel to it. A little bit of a pain to get to and from especially after visiting a few coffee shops, shuttle bus runs every 30 mins from opposite central station and takes roughly 10 mins to get to hotel.Room service was nice, rooms were large although not very clean, dust in corners etc.Staff were OK, receptionists were helpful but lacked sincerity.

<Content>4* NH Central Station We just spent a night in this hotel and it deserves a higher ranking! First it is true that the hotel is about 10min by car from the central station and the building looks terrible from the outside (used to be an old hospital). But it is a 4* hotel (by international standards) and is is MUCH better then any hotel you can find in the city centre in that price range. We payed 84,-鈧?per room (parking =free) and 12,5鈧?for breakfast wich was really very nice. The hotel is used by the staff of North West Airlines (they get better prices!!). The rooms are very nice and the beds very comfortable.The shuttle bus works excellent. It goes every 20min to the NH Barbizon (much more expensive) across the central station (near the red light district). The last bus from the centre to the hotel leaves at 02:45am!!I really do not understand all the negative comments. It is an excellent hotel at an excellent price!

<Content>In a galaxy far far far away.... They decided to call this the Central Station. They could have called it the Outer Mongolia as it is just a name after all. It might change your expectation of where the hotel might be but the reality is it is nowhere near central or indeed a station, so it would be just as accurate.Rooms are adequate, just not quite what you expect in an NH hotel, everything is there but just feels a little more downmarket. Empty mini bar fridge, Wi Fi internet access, not a biscuit with the kettle in room, that type of thing. breakfast needs to be booked in advance for 鈧?2 price, but the hotel do not have any vouchers or indeed alternatives when required. If you need to get anywhere early or late you need a taxi as the complimentary bus only makes scheduled trips from 4-10pm. Taxis cost between 12-18 euros depending on which taxi mafia you pick up. All told, better pay a few euros for a nearer and better hotel unless you have business on the newer north side area.

<Content>name of hotel is a con! the name of this hotel is a con! its called central station and is no where near it! although the hotel offers a free shuttle bus. you spend most of your time waiting on it.when we first arrived in amsterdam we had no clue where to get this free shuttle bus and no one else knew where to direct us to it! when we finally found where to get it we were waitin 40 mins in the ICE cold! (not a good start) The hotel room is very basic and not the cleanest think they need to invest in new carpet! **keep your shoes on** had a nice toiletry set for men and women but that dont make up for the cheap perfume smell comin from the cupboard!! ( i think a prozzie was livin in it haha) overall hotel was alright but would stay somewhere a bit more central. wastes alot of time waitin about!

<Content>Nowhere near Central Station! WARNING! - This hotel is absolutely nowhere NEAR Amsterdam Central Station. It's not even close. Admittedly, a shuttle bus does run free of charge to the centre, but visit on days of low demand (as I did) and you'll be waiting around for a while.Otherwise, it's just a typical business hotel. The rooms are bland, the food is poor, the drinks are expensive and the breakfast really wasn't up to scratch at all. But it's relatively comfortable and thoroughly inoffensive. Stay here only if you really have to.

<Content>Everything great but location ROOM: Large enough, very clean, very well kept, clean bathrooms equipped with soap and shampoo, all modern facilities, refrigerator included, SLEEP: The mattress is firm, and the hotel is quiet at night, which is the main reason I booked it. Surely hotels in amsterdam central will be more noisy. SERVICE: Very polite and helpful. Although they could not easily find an extra comforter for me :). But they tried to get a blanket instead. LOCATION: This is the main issue here. I arrived in amsterdam central at 7:30 AM in the morning on a sunday, and the shuttle only runs from 10 in the morning that day. The staff at the NH central hotel (where the shuttle runs from) did not appear to be too friendly. So we took the ferry from amsterdam central station to the amsterdam noord region. The ferry takes about 10 minutes and is located right behind the central station. From the other side, we had to walk for about 15 minutes to the hotel. Although the walk is very nice, it is NOT the Amsterdam-ish walk you would expect. No canals, no coffee shops. The hotel is in the middle of a residential and industrial area. So, YOU DO NOT GET THE AMSTERDAM FEEL when living in this hotel. IMPORTANT TIPS:1. I did not look for them, but looks like there are not easy to find convenience stored near the hotel. So get your grocery supplies from the main city before you go to sleep overnight2. To get to the ferry, just walk to the opposite side of the central station, and you will find it. Or ask for information at the central station.3. To avoid getting lost on the walk from the ferry to the hotel, DO NOT LOOK AT THE MAP ! It is confusing. Just keep following the road where the ferry lands.4. They allowed us to check in at 1 PM, which was pretty good for a very busy easter weekend.

<Content>Not too bad but a little far out.. Myself and 2 friends stayed here from Fri 2nd until Sun 4th March 07. We booked it because the Victoria hotel in town was fully booked and this one looked quite nice  modern. We got a taxi from the airport to the hotel  were charged 60 euro's which was a rip off! (It cost only 35 to return)The check in staff were very good  spoke good English. The bar was good too but did not have Sky Sports on. Happy hour is every day between 1700  1900 which made it good value (50% off) otherwise it was expensive. We used the free shuttle bus quite a bit but the driver was very moody  refused to take us one time as he was going for his dinner. The timing sheet on the wall said they were every 15mins but that was a bit of an exaggeration and also gave you the impression that there was more than 1 bus which there wasn't. Taxi's into the centre ranged from 10 - 15 Euro's which isn't too bad but can mount up over the weekend. My biggest gripe was the room service - or rather lack of it! In the lifts, there were lists explaining what food  drink etc could be delivered 24/7 but both times we tried, we were told service had stopped as it was too late. Admittedly, it was 4.30am each time but 24/7 should mean just that. Breakfast was ok - Sausages were very undercooked and the toaster was rubbish but the bacon, scrambled eggs etc were fine. Overall, I would recommend this hotel for business travellers or couples exploring rather than the 'Lad's weekend' we were on as it's just too far away from the centre.ps.. We had a great meal in the Karma Sutra indian restaurant on Saturday night. Great food at a good price. You will not be dissapointed.

<Content>NH City North, relaxed, friendly, fabarooney A party of 8 visited Amsterdam weekend of the 6th October for two nights.The staff were really helpful, the rooms were great, and the bar was good too. we didn't eat there at all but decided instead to explore the city and sample local Dutch hospitality.The hotel is in the north of the city which is a little way out of the hustle and bustle of the centre but they do lay on a shuttle bus service for their guests until approx. 3am. Be aware though that the bus only seats 8 so if you in a que be prepared to wit 15 mins for the next one. During busy times the driver will drop you at the ferry instead, and if you decide to get the ferry back make sure you get the middle ferry and not either of the ones to the left or right as you'll have a longer walk back than 10 minutes.a really nice touch, was that one of our party waas celebrating their 40th birthday, and the hotel were emailed secterly in advance. They upgraded the room without charge and left wine, biscuits and chocs in the room at a reasonable cost (which I'd planned for)Recommened! but not dring periods of heavy rain as the glass roof leaked a bit.A restaurant I'd def recommend is witteuyl (translated into The White Owl) in the museum quater. V.good, I'd thoroughly recommend this, especially their chocolate board. See feedback!Brost!

<Content>Good hotel, highly recommended We stayed here for three nights, the rooms were very clean, modern and quiet, the bed was really comfortable and the bathroom/ shower room was very clean and modern. The staff were ok, polite and helpful. The hotel operates a shuttle service in to the centre of town ( very nr central station) this proved to be a great service, only 8 minutes drive and departing every 15 min during the day, after midnight you had to ring ( from the waiting room at the barbizon nh hotel) however a mini bus was despatched straight away, and saved us from using a taxi ( can be expensive) at any time during our stay. alternatively a 10 minute walk to the ferry (free!), brings you nicely to the central station. overall excellent hotel, do not let its slightly out of the centre location put you off! it was a welcome break from the hustle and bustle of downtown amsterdam. My girlfriend had a few minor gripes, the ironing board did not stay up, however we did have a good iron in our room, fridge and all the usual comforts.

<Content>Good hotel in Amsterdam We booked this hotel through Venere and got a rate of 408EUR for 4 nights. I was glad that we chose this hotel insead of others at city center. The area was quiet and there was a grocery store Alber Hein closeby. 10 minute walk to the river and take a free ferry you will be at central station and city center. But don't take your luggage walking this way. We did this by mistake and the road was rough and seemed endless. Bus 38 takes you from the ferry to outside of the hotel. The room was big and clean. The bedding was good. Compared to the stories I heard about other hotels and those hotels we saw at city center, I felt that we made a good choice. It has air conditioning, but not necessary during our stay in early September. We did not encounter large group of NWA crew like other people mentioned in their review. The staff was friendly. The internet was expensive, ~ 22 EUR per day. Did not try the breakfast. Save 4EUR if breakfast ticket is purchase one day in advance. There is a shuttle from this hotel to the other NH hotel near central station, but not close enough to central station if you have luggage. Bus 38 might be a better choice.

<Content>Highly recommended My friends and I stayed 3 nights at the NH City North as part of a summer eurotrip. Here's the hotel rundown:Location: 10 mins outside city centre, but easily accessible by free shuttle to city centre (check timetable), or free ferry (10 min walk to pier, and free ferry 24hrs). Taxi to city centre is about 13 Euro. Prefer this location to one downtown as it's quieter, but still everything is easily accessible. Good food in various restaurants around the hotel.Front Desk Service: very efficient. Vincent and Kimberly are especially friendly and helpful. Look out for long lines of Northwest airlines staff checking in and out though.Rooms: Large, clean and comfortable. Television stations are mostly english, and there's also PPV. Bathrooms are large as well, with all the usual ammenities. Hydromassage shower head is a plus. Rooms lack a minibar, but there is 24hr room service. A/C does not get very cold even when on max, but the temp is still comfortable. Pillow menu is nice, and the beds are super comfortable. Extras such as complimentary short stories book give this hotel an edge.Overall: Standard 4star business hotel at the same price as 2 and 3 star hotels in amsterdam. Good service, very comfortable rooms. Would definitely stay here or in another NH again.

<Content>Spend a little extra $ and Stay Here! We would definitely stay here again. After staying in some run-down BB's, this was a refreshing change. We were travelling on a budget, but wanted to spend just a little more money while in Amsterdam and enjoy a hotel. It was SO worth it. The non-smoking room was big, with a fridge, TV, safe, etc. Everything was dark wood, very clean and felt fancy for our usual budget accomodations! They even have the option to request a different types of pillows with different fillings! I felt like a wealthy business-woman, without paying a hefty price. We stayed for 5 nights and loved it. There were 2 ways to get to the city center: NH has a FREE shuttle that would run about every 15 minutes from noon to 10 pm to/from their other NH Barbazon Hotel that is just across from Central Station, or you could walk about 10 minutes to get to a FREE ferry that will take you across the IJ waterway (about a 3 minute ride) that gets you to Central Station. The ferry runs 24 hours a day. The only thing to remember, that we were never told, is that going from Central Station back in the direction of the hotel, there are 3 or 4 different ferries, so be sure you get on the one going straight across to Buiksloterweg - I think that's the name of the street. Sometimes we opted to do the walking down to the ferry, because one of the shuttle drivers had a little attitude and wasn't always the most polite guy, so when we didn't want to deal with it, we took the ferry.The only 2 bad things I can say about the hotel is that when we walked into the lobby and elevator area, it always smelled funny - like sulfur, sewer, cooking beans... we weren't sure what it was, and that when we wanted just a little butter with a butter knife for some bread we bought at the store, we could only do it through room service is it was an insane price for a little butter, so we just went without. The people at the front desk were always helpful... oh, and the bathrooms are wonderfully large and clean, and I enjoyed a relaxing bath every night. If we come to Amsterdam again, my partner and I are sure to stay here!

<Content>Excellant Hotel Highly Recommended stayed 14/04/06-17/04/06 I took my boyfriend on a suprise birthday trip to amsterdam and chose the hotel after reading the reviews. I emailed the hotel letting them know I was bringing him for a suprise and when we got there they upgraded our room and left us a nice bottle of wine. The breakfast is highly recommended with hot/cold variety. A free shuttle runs which takes you to dam square and runs till 2am which we used most of the time if later then we would walk to central station and take the ferry which was about 20 minute walk to the hotel. Very friendly and helpful staff.

<Content>Excellent place to stay if you know Amsterdam My wife and our adult son stayed in two rooms for four nights checking in on March 16, 2006 and checking out on March 20, 2006.We were able to obtain a good package from Expedia flying directly from Boston via Northwest and staying at NH City North. This was our fourth trip to Amsterdam.Knowing Amsterdam, it was easy for us to take the train to Central Station, to transfer to the ferry to the north side and transfer to a bus to the hotel. Our total elapsed time was about 3/4 of an hour.Our only downside was that the Northwest crews stay at the hotel and are given priority at check in. They become upset if they have to wait 10 minutes although we had to wait 3 1/2 hours. This is a downside.The hotel is new and all of the rooms seem to be the same so that we had an extremely nice room even though we had a deal. Our room was far above basic with nice furnishings and it was Clean.The area is an upscale residential area with adequate places to eat in the area. The hotel cafe was quite good and reasonable.Other than the check in downside the staff was very good and helpful. We enjoyed our stay and will stay there again.I think, probably, the NH chain is the best in Amsterdam but they miss the boat when they discrinate against their customers other than airline crews. I'm actually surprised as they otherwise seem to be on the ball.All in all, however, it is my preferred place to stay.

<Content>Comfy beds Good price, comfy bed, shuttle service was good and ran up to 230am which was handy. Drinks at bar expensive but this was to be expected. Probably would stay somewhere a bit more central next time, however if this hotel was remarkably cheaper would consider it. Friendly staff on shuttles and at reception.

<Content>Nice place to stay We stayed at this hotel for a week-end and although not downtown, the location was really a peaceful, and all in all, it was a real good experience: comfortable bed, nice bath-room and helpful staff. As to the price, one of the best we managed to find in Amsterdam. In addition to the hotel shuttle, there's a peaceful 5-10min walk to a ferry which drops you just next to the Central Stations, where you may find virtualy all of the most important bus and tram lines. I would surely go back to this hotel whenever I am back in Amsterdam.

<Content>Recommended ! I just came back from a weekend stay in Amsterdam. I chose NH City North based on positive experience with NH and the generally good reviews here. I was not disappointed.The hotel is located in the northern part of the city, on the other side of the river. However this is only a slight disadvantage. There is a shuttle service running from 10 am to 11pm (weekdays) and 2.30 am (weekends) which takes you to the square outside Amsterdam Centraal (in front of NH Barbizon Palace, to be more precise). Hotel facilities are very good, nice lobby, very nice English style bar and very good breakfast. You can book breakfast upon check in for a reduced price of 12 Euros, IMO it's worth it. Nice rooms, nothing luxurious, but perfectly OK. At 89 Eur this is very good value in Amsterdam, the only side is location but it relatively minor thanks to the great shuttle service. Amsterdam is a rather expensive city, namely in terms of accomodation, and IMO this is a very good deal.

<Content>The BEST so far I WOULD DEFINATELY RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL TO ANYONE.This hotel is the best hotel we have stayed at in Europe. And we have stayed at three ... two of which were holes in the wall. literally. BUT this hotel not only has a warm welcome it has a FREE shuttel to the central station where everything branches off from. we showed up with out making a reservation which im told is what europeans do. anways they all speak english and we felt perfectly at home.

<Content>It's good, and has the best NH breakfast NH Hotels seems to have a quit good idea of what guests wants. However, not all the NH's are into all the details. This one does: Nice reception, Nice room (with a BIG bed for one person, won't cost you more than just a simple bed) and a good breakfast. Only downside: don't wake me at 9AM.

<Content>Comfortable Amsterdam hotel but ... Our group of 7 stayed at this lovely hotel Oct 14-15 2005. Room, staff etc etc excellent - location on Noord (residential side of Amsterdam). I'd recommend purchasing 12E breakfast voucher night before (costs 16E otherwise). Complimentary hotel bus takes you to free 1 min. ferry crossing to Centraal Station every 15 mins. Be warned though that many airline staff stay at this hotel and regard it as their own! We had a very nasty and rude encounter with one such American female whilst waiting our turn to return to the hotel from city centre. We reported this incident to the hotel security but heard nothing further. I'd definitely use the hotel again however ...

<Content>Good value, although a little out of the centre This hotel was perfectly clean and well equipped, by European standards, with all the amenities that you would come to expect from a large chain of hotels, and has one of the lowest prices in Amsterdam at 鈧?9. The staff are polite, conscientious and multi-lingual. As the hotel has been built in the Noord, which has more space for development, the rooms are of a decent size and there are elevators unlike many hotels in the main part of the City. The only drawback is the location of the Hotel. It is not in the main body of Amsterdam but is located in the Noord, across the river. This means that from (Amsterdam) Centraal Rail Station you have to take the passenger ferry, located immediately outside (Centraal) on the river side, which is free of charge and goes 24hrs a day, every 6 minutes during the day. This ferry takes around 1 minute to cross and then it is a simple 10 minute walk straight along the road to the hotel. Basically, upon leaving the hotel you will arrive at Centraal, about 14 minutes later. Alternatively, you can take a bus (Numbers 34, 35, 91, 92, 94, 171, 172, 174) which stop in the road outside the hotel and take about 10 minutes from Centraal. Or you can take a taxi 鈥?though, most are unsure as to where the hotel is 鈥?at 鈧?5 for a 5 minute journey. The airport is a 15 minute train ride from Centraal 鈥?at around 鈧?.
