<Content>Charming Hotel, Great Service We stayed at Inn at the Opera for 1 week. Location: very convenient; 1 bus ride to the wharf; 45 minutes to Napa Valley. Reception Staff: courteous, efficient  friendly. Room: clean, comfortable, temperature is just right. Our key card did not work on the third day after we came back from Napa- the reception was quick to fix the problem. Free continental breakfast is filling although the waiter failed to fill our cup with coffee after asking us if we wanted some. We will stay there again in the future.

<Content>Felt like family at Inn at the Opera We consider Inn at the Opera our home in San Francisco. On our most recent stay the entire staff--front desk, concierge, bell, housekeeping and restaurant staffs were all exceptional in making us feel completely comfortable and taken care of despite a travel change resulting in our arriving a day too early without a reservation for that night. Nevertheless, the desk staff provided an available room for our first night and with the bell staff facilitated painless transfer to our reserved suite for our second and third nights. In a survey following an earlier visit, my wife had suggested that considering the number of older guests that bran flakes be added to the complimentary brunch. This time there were bran flakes鈥攁 detail reflecting the level of this hotel鈥檚 customer service. We are very grateful to the entire staff for making our stay such a pleaure. In addition the Inn at the Opera is near the Civic Center including the City Hall with its rich history and elegant rotunda, the San Francisco Opera, Ballet, and Symphony, and the San Francisco Culinary Institute that serves to the public a Friday lunch buffet that is both reasonably priced and elegant. Located in San Francisco鈥檚 Hayes Valley district, to the south and west are an abundance of neighborhood restaurants with a European flair, coffee shops, bars, boutiques, bookstores, and a sense of families and community. Block after block of level streets offer respite from Union Square and Nob Hill for the knee challenged amongst us.

<Content>Great Place Excellent hotel to stay at. I stayed here for one night to visit the SF Ballet for the Nutcacker. I had heard some indifferent reviews, and had some concerns, but after getting there I loved this hotel. The area is not bad, as some people make it out to be, and the hotel is really nice. The rooms are really clean, and the beds are very comfy. The breakfast in the morning is so-so, but it is free, cannot complain about free food. The hotel really throws you back to the old days, makes you feel like your staying in an old victorian! I enjoyed it, you will too, Tim.

<Content>Room @ this Inn took 2 days to adjust to the european style type of room (studio with refrig.  micro),but thereafter was very cozy  most adequate.adjusting to the small size of the room was challenging due to last years stay @ another svc property in s.f.(The Donetello) which for a studio was huge! my wife  i highly recommend The Inn @ the Opera...the staff is professional  friendly  go out of their way to please  serve...the daily complimentary continental b'fast is awesome...the onsite restaurant (Ovations) is pricey yet admirable in quality  service.

<Content>Love the place and the staff Usually we don't get great services from hotels in general. On this trip we drove from the vino bello in napa and stayed at the in at the opera. We never got such a good treatment from the staff. We remember Joseph and Rowena from the front desk and even Patricio the valet guy, they were amazing treating us as true costumer should always be treated. The hotel is great for what we were looking for( european style). Totally recommended .

<Content>Great experience; Perfect location! Although this isn't a true 5-star establishment (but easily 4-star), we definitely had a 5-star experience. This hotel has a very European, old-style feel to it, though it has been updated to ensure that guests are comfortable and everything was very clean. The staff was gracious and friendly, and although the valet parking was full, they directed us to parking right behind the hotel which actually saved us a couple of dollars. The location was perfect - practically next door to the Opera House and Civic Center, which made for a lovely evening stroll (though very short). We stayed in a Junior Suite which was very comfortable and many amenities were provided which are not always found in hotels (green shopping bags, dishes, etc.). The free continental breakfast was quite good and the restaurant was intimate and beautiful. We hope to arrive early enough next time to have dinner there before a show. We hope to return to this gem of a hotel many times in the future.

<Content>Excellent European-Style Hotel Whereas our stay in October was marred by lapses in staff attentiveness, this time the service was very good. Brian at the Front Desk is especially professional and enthusiastic. The rooms are comfortable and well-appointed, and the hotel is excellently situated for patrons like us who are coming to attend the opera.

<Content>Great Staff, excellent continental breakfast The staff were most helpfull from the moment we arrived from advising us on what to do and how to get there. Doors were opened and at the desk and in the hallways we were always cheerfully greeted and helped. The dining room provided a convenient continental breakfast served by a helpful and excellent staff. Dinners were excellent. We are older and appreciated the ability to split both salads and the main course. The facility reminded us of clean, older European hotels where we have stayed. The hotel was well located to use the Muni transportation systems. We enjoyed the opera next door and took advantage of the CITY PASS to see the sights and many attractions of San Francisco.Gordon  Helen, Vancouver, BC, Canada

<Content>Charming hotel, great for operagoers We love to stay at the Inn at the Opera when visiting San Francisco for the opera. The Opera House is right across the street, making it an ideal location, and the staff is always gracious and helpful. The room we had was small, but nicely furnished and included a fridge and microwave. We found the location very convenient to restaurants and other attractions too. The only negative was the live and recorded music from the downstairs restaurant, making it hard to fall asleep. We'll probably ask for a room on a higher floor next time.

<Content>Loved it Three of us shared a full week in a 1-bedroom Symphony unit, booked through our timeshare company (this is a Shell resort as well as a regular hotel), and were really happy with the whole experience. An old-fashioned elevator operates among the hotel's 7 floors; a quiet, darkwood French restaurant offers fine (expensive) dinners, late-night drinks, and free Continental breakfasts that made us feel quite pampered.The room contained a semi-kitchen consisting of a microwave, refrigerator and sink. The bathroom was very large, while the living room and bedroom were more modest (but not cramped).The best part of the hotel, really, is the personal service. Our room was made up every day -- standard in a hotel, but not in timeshares -- and the desk staff greeted us pleasantly by name each day and helped us with all our bizarre questions.The opera and ballet are just across the street, and the entire area (Hayes Street) has become very upscale, with great restaurants and shops. We would certainly stay at Inn at the Opera again.

<Content>Scary Scary Neighborhood! All in all the room was okay and the staff was very helpful and friendly. However, I was a woman traveling alone and had the inconvenience of having a male friend walk me to the hotel every night from the BART station which is over 3 blocks away. Also...the free breakfast is horrible and they make you feel like you have to leave a tip!

<Content>Inn at the Opera Great The Inn at the Opera is a wonderful hotel. It is small and has a family feeling. The rooms are very comfortable. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. An excellent breakfast is included. The location couldn' t be better for activities in Civic Center, such as performances at the Opera House ( just across the street, Davies Hall or Herbst Theater. Valet parking is available. I have stayed at the hotel many times and always look forward to returning there.

<Content>Great Boutique Hotel Take the time to do your homework on boutique hotels. I've stayed at several but the Inn at the Opera is a great hotel and I found special rates through the hotel website. If you want to be surrounded by crowds of tourists, then this hotel is not for you. It is away from the hustle and bustle of Union Square and the Wharf but these areas are accessible by cable car and other ground transportation. It is not as noisy as other hotels and you get a feel of the locals and the surrounding areas. The staff is very friendly and the rooms, although smaller than big chain hotels, are clean and comfortable. The complimentary continental breakfast was fine and complimentary cookies await you back from your city excursions! There's also a wonderful place to eat (for both vegetarians and meat eaters) at Max's a block from the hotel (a recommendation from Michael at the front desk). I would definately stay at this hotel again. Being away from all the busy landmarks, this allowed us to truly see the city and explore all the surrounding neighborhoods.

<Content>SUPERB SERVICE - very welcoming A very well run and comfortable hotel right next to the opera house. Classical music-related decor and theme, clean and comfy rooms, but best is the warmth of the staff - front desk, housekeeping and breakfast room. Really felt we were staying with good friends who were spoiling us silly.

<Content>Amazing Boutique This is a great boutique hotel with a great location if you plan on seeing the SF Ballet, Symphony or Opera. The staff here are absolutely amazing. Its small, so they have the time to chat with you and spend more time assisting with special requests than at a larger hotel. My room was great, the breakfast was enough to save me a few bucks each morning and overall I had a wonderful experience. I will return.

<Content>My First Trip to SAN FRAN This was my first time in San Francisco and my husband and I really enjoyed it. My husband had stayed at Inn at the Opera before on business, so it was a return visit for him.I was a little hesitant about staying here because of a few past reviews, but my husband had nothing but good things to say.The room was very cozy, and we ate at the restaurant once, it was delicous!We tried to book on the site Hotwire but were unable to find as low of rates as mentioned in a past reveiw. Plus your'e not garunteed the hotel you want ,so we went straight to the website and booked.We were happy with our stay and hope to return one day.The staff was great!We had some minor T.V. issues and the staff had it taken care of in five minutes.

<Content>Cute historic boutique hotel I got an amazing deal on this hotel by booking through Hotwire. It was $52 per night plus tax, which came to $66.46. This is a terrific bargain for a 3.5 star hotel in SF. The location of this hotel was not ideal, for my needs, but it is close to Van Ness, a major thoroughfare with bus lines that can get you to where you need to go. My room was nice, not too small. I really had no complaints but would rate this as a 3 star hotel, not 3.5. If two people are sharing a room, quarters may be kind of cramped. However, if you are looking for a charming and unique place to stay, you will be happy with the Inn at the Opera. Especially if you can get a great price on Hotwire - it's in the Civic Center/Hayes Valley neighborhood for those who are familiar with how Hotwire works.

<Content>Excellent place to start If your looking for luxory accomadations, or a big suite with magnificient views this is not the place for you. But if your looking for a nice comfertable place with friendly staff to kick off your visit to a great city then your in the right place. This hotel is only 3 blocks from the famous F street car line, which makes getting around a breeze. Also nearby is the ballet and the Asian Art museum which is a must see. As far as breakfast goes, it's exactly what you pay for. It's not nay worse then a continantal breakfast anywhere else, and there are plenty of places around if you want something more. The staff couldnt be more helpful and friendly, and the hotel decor very nice. I would definitly saty here again. One more little tip, the citypass is a very good investment, if for no other reason then the 7 day MUNI pass.

<Content>Quaint hotel but quite a few quirks My husband  I just returned last Saturday from celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary at the Inn @ The Opera. We were given a 2 bath deluxe room on the 7th floor...room was nice  spacious but.....our 2nd night we found that none of the baseboard heaters worked! We reported this  they brought 2 PORTABLE HEATERS to the room(this made us believe that this was a known problem to them). We thought we'll make do with this.Wrong. While ironing our clothes the electricity tripped in the room since apparently their system was obviously overloaded.We were left in the dark  cold. We tried to make do  reported this the next day. They came but did nothing  basically left us with the portable heaters again. To make a long story short we tolerated this for FIVE NIGHTS  then they offered to move us to a similar room when those residents left since they said it'll take a while to correct the problem.The move was good (to the 6th floor)but by this time I was personally fed up.While we were on the 6th floor, we heard residents in the room we vacated the same day  which was right above us!Obviously they didn't fix anything, so as I said before, it seems that the problems are pre-existing  they just don't fix it. For the nightly rate charged one should not have to tolerate this.Like one of the viewers said there's a tip bill folder for the complimentary breakfast which they presented with alacrity each day. This was a great annoyance to me.Additionally, the breakfast was boring(mostly produced from boxes  packets)  were cling-wrapped for each consecutive day .The breads were STALE...I even saw some mildew on the bread  the CUT bananas were also recycled(one could see the browned edges).Our new rental car was dented  badly scratched by their valet parking  they pretended to not have any knowledge of how it was damaged...we had to complete a report with our rental car company....luckily we had full coverage on the car.Internet which is located in the lobby area (totally not private)was non-existent...forget about having any connection in your room.The staff are friendly but that doesn't compensate for the aggravation we had to go through.Don't think we'll stay there again.

<Content>Not My First Choice We were there for a week, had to cut it one day short because of family. First, you have to pay for internet service, never done that ever! I booked this trip six months in advanced with one of the best rooms in the place, the room was wonderful (get a suite if you are going to stay there, the other rooms are too small). Staff was wounderful, food at the Ovation was good but over priced, SF has such woundrful food go out and enjoy. Location is fine if you don't wander to far in to the Tenderloin, only blockes away. You need to go somewhere else to eat, if you realy want to experience SF. If it may be hot, there is no air in the rooms, but in SF you seldom need it but be prepaerd. There are so many great places to stay in SF I would not recommend this one.

<Content>A wonderful place This Inn is part of RCI and I got it through RCI. It is located in the Civic center section of San Francisco and a little out of the way. After two days, we got used to being out of the way (almost 1/2 mile to the cable car and Bart, but 2 blocks from the bus). The hotel included breakfast which was fantastic. There were always fresh chocholate chip cookies on the desk and fresh apples in a bowl. The place was clean and friendly. The concierge was very helpful and rented us a car during our stay for one day. The place picked us up in the morning and drove us to the rental place. Fresh towels and the bed were made every day. They even brough bottles of water to my room during the night. Great RCI experience.

<Content>Charming, but . . . This is the second time I've stayed here. Charming, wonderful European atmosphere. The staff is very friendly. You'll feel quite at home. And the price is certainly right for a centrally located quality hotel. Do NOT, however, expect more than charm and personality. The rooms are European, too, in that they are small and very spartan. There's no individual room climate control, so you get whatever heat/AC the hotel thinks is appropriate. (It's January at this writing and the room is too warm! Thank God the windows open.) The walls are thin and your neighboring room's plumbing is right next to the bed, so when someone next door showers in the morning, the noise is deafening. Don't try to sleep late. The Ovation restaurant? What bar doesn't have bourbon? Unbelievable! And the complimentary continental breakfast is poor even by European standards. Even two-star hotels in Italy where I've stayed had more diverse and interesting breakfast options. Finally, a concern about staff training. Yesterday there was a blackout in the neigbhorhood. When the power went out, the front-desk staff panicked. They didn't know what to do, whom to call. They stood at the front desk picking up the phones and wondering why they didn't work. And not all of the emergency or exit lights were working properly. Some of the hotel staff showed more control, suggesting calling the power company on cell phones, etc. They *all* should be trained in emergency response measures, no?

<Content>Nice hotel, but not for a time share exchange We stayed at IATO Labor Day week. Loved the hotel, it's quiet, intimate and clean and is in a good location. We were in a junior suite, which was a bedroom and adjoining sitting room/kitchen (well, there was a sofa, small table, sink, microwave and mini-refrigerator). The virtual tour on their website is an accurate depiction of the room, but note that there is a mirrored wall that makes the junior suite look like it has two beds. We would stay here again, but not through a time share exchange - -since it's not a resort there were no on-site amenities that we usually experience with an exchange.The continental breakfast was OK for a day or so, but they never change the offering, so you'll become bored with it after a couple days. Go around the corner to Citizen Cake instead - - they have great coffee, breakfast and people-watching. We also went to the crepes place across the street from Citizen Cake...that was not as good.

<Content>Great find!! Great value! Rooms are exceptionally small..enough for a bed and room to walk around it. (hard to get used to) However, if you keep it tidy  are not in there all day it is suitable. Microwave in room, very neat  excellent little 'kitchen' area with a small fridge, plates and even wine glasses...very chic!! Maids are VERY friendly do a good job and leave you chocolates behind when they are done...what a nice touch. Remember the hotel is a boutique hotel so it is old..slight musty smell in hallways but not gagging..you get used to it. Great renovations for a hotel this old. Rooms are CLEAN and updated. Front staff is excellent; complimentary breakfast is great at first but can be boring after a few days. Elevator was a surprise but very innovative..you will see. :) Waiters are courteous at first. A 'tab' folder is placed on your table after breakfast with a paper in it indicating a tip is suggested. When you are there for a few days you observe the waiters sense of anxiousness as they await to open the 'tab' folder. Some of the reactions from the waiters are unreal... then they talk to each other in their own language. Not a good feeling at all.

<Content>Charming, but no a/c What a charming hotel... we used to stay there many years ago (we travel for our business) and I had forgotten why we stopped when our agency booked it for us. As soon as I arrived, I remembered! No air conditioning... We stayed there in July 2006 and the rooms were so hot, we asked for a fan and it helped, but still, the rooms were constantly around 78 degrees!We love the hotel and the service, but don't got here in the summer!Another thing that surprised us this time was the room service menu. They only had one vegetarian item. Being a vegetarian, you quickly get bored with eating the same thing. Luckily there are many good restaurants nearby so it's not a big issue, but for a hotel this nice (except for the lack of a/c) they should have a better room service menu.I will go back, but in the winter...

<Content>Absolutely Delightful We just spent the weekend at this hotel and it was charming. We were attending the ballet and chose this hotel for location-right around the corner from the venue. It's in Hayes District ,which houses many top restaurants and dessert/drink cafes. The area and it's architecture is very pretty-in the heart of the Culural Arts/Civic Center District. Upon arrival we were upgraded to a Junior Suite-a very pleasant surprise. The room was lovely with many nice touches. We had a parking package and the valet service was great. There were cookies in the early everning that looked delicious but we were on our way to dinner. Service was great-very willing to please. The continental breakfast was in their lovery restaurant and was very good- Nice array of food and beverage choices. A find!

<Content>So very romantic, great for honeymoon or 25th wedding anniversary! My husband and I fell in love in San Francisco 25 years ago and wanted to stay in a great location in San Francisco for our 25th wedding anniversary. We stayed at the Inn at the Opera for the most relaxing, romantic week of our entire marriage! The staff treated us so special knowing about our anniversary. I want to return every year now!

<Content>Great service My husband and I stayed at the hotel for a week via a time share exchanged. We were delighted with the hotel. The rooms are smaller than most people are used to but we found them very cozy and nicely furnished. I didn't find the bathrooms small. The breakfast we had was better than the usual continental breakfast. It has several kinds of cereal, muffins, bagels, toast, danish as well as hardboiled egg, pineable, watermelon and cantalope, banana and several kinds of juice as well as coffee. More than enough to start the day. Breakfast was in their lovely restaurant, Ovations. Room service was a real bargain and the food was from the Ovations kitchen so it was very good. The front desk acknowledged the rooms were small but they said they try to make up for it with fine service and I would say they did that excactly. Guests were invited to a wine and cheese party during the week so you could chat with fellow guests and meet the management. The hotel is in a very well lite area right across from the City Hall and near the Opera, Symphony and Ballet so there is always something going on and people around. The area in the direction of Market St is not the best but the other direction toward Gough has very nice restaurants and shops. Restaurants that were recommend were Citizen Cake and Indigo. We used a 7 day pass and used it a lot for cable cars, buses  trolleys. YOu don't really need a car but the hotel has a garage if you need one. We took a Wine tour through a company called Supersightseeing and it was less crowded than a Gray Line tour that we ran into. Our tour guide (Steve) was wonderful and very knowledgeable. Good place to see on your own or walking tour is Pacific Heights with its Victorian homes and great views of the City. Stop at Union St. in Pacific Heights that has some great cafes and boutiques. We would definitely return to this hotel if we visit again.

<Content>Charming, small hotel My husband and I booked this hotel based on it's location and positive reviews. We stayed one night and attended the SF Ballet's Swan Lake. The ballet was beautiful and the hotel was only a short walk away. The staff is friendly but the rooms are extremely small. I would estimate about 200 sq feet. Our room on the 4th floor had a window that looked out to the alley but it was nice that we could open it for fresh air because it was unseasonably warm. The bed was comfortable but unfortunately we did not discover the ear plugs in the drawer of the nightstand until the next morning. We were awoken at 1:30am by an extremely loud garbage truck in the alley emptying the garbage bins and found it difficult to sleep due to the noise for most of the night. The bathroom was so small it was difficult to find space to put out toiletries but the shower did have adequate pressure. The complimentary breakfast in the morning is continental style, with very few choices. It is rather strange that the waiters hand out tip portfolios at breakfast, but since they were nice enough to refill our coffee cups for us we left them a few dollars. The parking package we booked via the internet was $142/night. Although the hotel was adequate, we felt the accommodations were simply too small to be comfortable. Next time we visit SF we will seek a hotel with larger rooms, even if the location is not as convenient. We enjoyed a nice dinner at the Hayes Street Grill but be sure to book advance reservations on performance nights because it gets very crowded. I would recommend any of the grilled fish, the french fries and of course the wondeful creme brulee! As with most restaurants in the area, it is expensive but the service was absolutely wonderful which is made it a lovely meal.

<Content>Think small How you perceive the inn will depend much, I think, on the package you can arrange on the hotel's own website. Having stayed at this property during ten different occasions, I hope to provide some insight.We almost always book a room with parking included. Since parking rates are now $25 a night plus 14% tax, you should do what you can to snare this arrangement. Since so many guests do not seem to mind the small rooms, there should be no problems unless you have large suitcases. Each room is equipped with a kitchenette (microwave, small fridge, enough utensils to reheat food)and two packets of coffee, which will be replaced at $1.75 each. This policy has been in force for four or five years. Yes, it should be replaced daily, for free.The service at the desk is very accommodating, and, if things don't work properly in the room, you can count on the help to fix things. Your room is likely to be assigned randomly, even if you request specific rooms. Often the inn is fully booked with performers and/or their guests and the management cannot always guarantee your requests. You should, however, ask to be in a room that is not adjacent to a room with jacuzzi tub, as the noise from the bath in the suite will make sleeping difficult. Street-side rooms have nice neighborhood views but can be noisy if you choose to leave your window(s) open. And since there is no air-conditioning, you will certainly need to do so during the occasional hot days.A complimentary continental breakfast is included(not too inspiring but there is fresh fruit and unlimited drinks), and yes, a folder is presented upon departure. For heaven's sakes, put in a dollar or two. Many other establishments do the same. We've eaten a couple of times at the opulent restaurant Ovation, located past the front desk. Although there is enough choice on the menu, prices have escalated seriously enough and service has grown indifferent at best, to the point where we can no longer recommend it. Try instead Absinthe, Jardini猫re, Hayes Street Grill, or, for the super budgeters, Stelline's.

<Content>None better My famliy stayed at the Inn on the 2nd and 3rd of Oct. When we pulled up to the curb my wife recieved a call that her mother(85)had been rushed to the hospital in Spokane, Washington and did not look good. This was at 10:00am Sunday morning. Not only did the hotel let us check in early, the staff looked into booking my wife on a plane to Spokane. As my mother in laws condition improved over the next few hours so we decided to stay. We were in room 64, a suite, that was absolutly delightful. A sitting/kitchen area, living room / 2nd bedroom, full size main bedroom, and two full size bathrooms. The staff was nothing but excellent in every instance and we WILL return for accomadations when we plan to vacation in the Bay area.

<Content>Why so few reviews of this Hotel? I can't understand why there are so few reviews of The Inn at the Opera. We, (2 couples), found it excellent. We booked through Expedia and got excellent rooms for about 拢55/$96.Some reviewers have said the rooms were small, but that is only by US motel standards, by Europen standards they were a good size.The staff were efficient, courteous and friendly, the rooms were spotless. and towels seemed to be changed as soon as you wetted them!Continental breakfast is extensive, delicious and best of all, complementary!OK, it isn't on Fisherman's Wharf, or Union Square, but that is reflected in the price, and many people (us included), regard that as a plus point, not a minus.You can walk to Market Street and the cable car in 15 mins, and a cab (between 4 people) was only $8 to anywhere in the centre, so you are not out in the back of beyond. Check out any other hotels in town at a similar price, and this has to be the one to choose - highly recommended.

<Content>Old-fashioned attention Great location, friendly and extremely courteous staff, reasonable prices. A little piece of European boutique hotel elegance in San Francisco. Near great shops and interesting eateries. Plan to stay there again next month (March 2005).

<Content>Petty I must complain about an incident that occurred during our stay. First of all, I found the room we stayed in on January 18th and 19th cramped. There is barely any room to walk around the bed and the armoire door does not open fully to view the television. Otherwise, the staff is very well mannered and everything else was satisfactory except for this small incident.   I have to tell you this however petty it may sound as I find a charge of $3.50 unjust. My complaint is the coffee packets left in the room. There is a $1.75 charge for requests for extra coffee packets. I assumed this meant per day only to find (to my dismay) that I was charged $3.50 for requesting another decaf and caf packet the second day of our stay. I told the maid that she must have forgotten to put some more in the room and she could not even speak English very well. I assumed she made a mistake as I frequent hotels and they always give additional coffee packets free of charge each day when they clean the rooms. I did not know I would be charged until checkout. This petty charge really bothered me.

<Content>Older Hotel with Nice Staff but Small Rooms I stayed here one night in October 2004. I made my reservation on the hotel's website and got a room for $109 per night. Unfortunately, when I called from the airport to find out the hotel's cross-streets and confirm that my room was available, I learned that the hotel had erroneously made my reservation for 10 days later. The hotel told me that it was full but that it would find a room for me as the reservation mistake was its fault. When I arrived I found that the hotel itself is located essentially behind city hall, which puts it in walking distance of government buildings in the Civic Center. However, the street has no other businesses on it (it all appeared to be older apartment buildings with metal security gates), and at night it was dark so the walk to the few restaurants on Van Ness (California Pizza Kitchen, Chevy's, a noodle place, and McDonald's) did not seem like a good idea. The hotel itself is rather small. The lobby consists of a small sitting area and then the front desk. The elevator is an ancient contraption that claims to fit six persons. Classical music is played in the hotel, including in the elevator. I was assigned room 68 on the 6th floor overlooking the street. It was furnished with antique-looking furniture, including an amoire and a desk. It also had a sink, microwave and undercounter refrigerator. The bathroom was tiled, had a tub/shower combination, thick towels, and nicer toiletries. Everything in the room appeared to be generally tasteful and in good condition. Other than the fact that the hotel is older and noise travels through the walls just as it would in an older home, the only drawback to the room was its small size. There was literally about one foot of space between the end of the bed and the front of the amoire.The staff was very pleasant both at check-in and check-out.All in all, the Inn at the Opera is a small, kind of creaky hotel, with small, nicely furnished rooms, on a street that does not lend itself to walking at night, and has a very nice staff. I would stay there again.

<Content>Perfect Accomodations! I wanted to give my nieces and their moms (my sisters) a treat for their birthdays. I wanted to have nice accomodations so we could relax and at the same time be conveniently close to the bart stations and the theater. We had two rooms at the Inn at the Opera with each room having a separate bedroom with a double bed and the living room area making into another bed. The beds were very comfortable, each area was very roomy, and best of all we were treated to a breakfast which was brought to our rooms. The staff was the nicest you could ever meet and they helped us with maps, buses, taxis, and directions! We had an amazing weekend and I would go back in a second!

<Content>The IATO is a great place to stay This Location is nicely appointed and comfortable. The staff are ever ready to assist you with whatever may be needed. I got a call from the manager who was offsite, regarding my connection to the internet in my room. The breakfast was very good. I have stayed at chain hotels that are more expensive and don't offer the ammenities that the IATO does. The Parking Package is a great deal. I will stay at the IATO whenever I am in SF.

<Content>Nice Hotel Overal, but .... Overall the Inn at the Opera is a boutique hotel (nice, antique furnishings) but on the small side. However, beware of noise issues here. I heard plumbing from surrounding rooms (toilet flushes, water pressure through the pipes when running a shower/bath, etc.). The noise got quite audible on and off at odd hours. Still, when I got home at night, my room was a true oasis. Hope your room works out for you! Nice, quiet (non-Union Square) locale that is relaxing.

<Content>A Great Location, But . . . The location is perfect for events at the opera house, symphony hall, etc.The hotel itself is not special. It is European (i.e., small rooms, small, slow elevator). The dining room could not accomodate us for dinner when we called a few days in advance. We called the front desk for a cab and had to wait a half hour, causing us to be late for our off-site dinner.When we (and others) returned from the opera (Saturday night at 10:30 p.m.), the restaurant and bar were closed. We all went elsewhere for drinks.The price, however ($99 - Orbitz), was right.

<Content>Great if going to Opera, Ballet, Orpheum Was going to see Lion King at the Orpheum Theater and spending the night. Looked at all the hotels along Market St. and found this one not on Market and by the Opera House. Wanted to be within walking distance of the Orpheum. It's a 10-15 minute walk to the theatre, you don't walk to the theater on Market, but use Hayes. This avoids the panhandlers (especially at night). Restaurant in the hotel was great, service was good and the room, though small, was quiet and comfortable.

<Content>Excellent service in a great hotel I was extremely pleased with the service and attention to detail of this hotel. The staff was very accomodating and pleasing to talk with. The complimentary continental breakfast was great, not to mention very convenient.We felt very safe while walking in the neighborhood and had no trouble finding a good restaurant within walking distance. I would definitely stay here again if and when I make my way back to San Francisco.

<Content>Immaculate Hotel, Safe Area We were impressed with this two star hotel--the friendly and helpful staff, the pretty, clean (rather small) room, the fresh and complimentary breakfast, free daily newspaper (except Sunday --$1.50), fresh cookies every evening. The area (333 Fulton Street) is nice also. We attended the ballet which is practically next door and walked around the area feeling safe and secure (Hayes Street has great shops!)

<Content>Stylish, friendly I stayed in August 2001 and found the hotel beautifully appointed with a turn of the century European feel to it. The room was small but well appointed and situated beside the Opera, ballet and City Hall and not far from the business district. Breakfast was a lavish cold buffet, everything was superband included in the price. Drinks at the bar were expensive though. If I should be so lucky as to return to SF, I would want to stay again.

<Content>What a gem - Inn at the Opea Although the hotel is not close to the touristy attractions (i.e. Fisherman's Wharf, Ferry, etc.), it is an inexpensive cab ride away and is across from the Opera House and Ballet. It is right in the heart of a variety of restaurants and bars within walking distance. The hotel staff was superb - knowledgeable and accomodating. No request was a bother and could be accomplished. Warm cookies await you at the front desk each late afternoon after returning from the day's activities. The hotel is absolutely charming with tight but posh interiors. The rooms were European style so expect smaller quarters (i.e., armoire instead of a closet), but again they were clean and nicely decorated. The complimentary continental breakfast could not be beat. It was a great start to each day. We would stay at the Inn at the Opera again in a heartbeat!

<Content>Good choice We enjoyed our week stay at the Inn. It has the charm and feel of a small euro-hotel. The staff is highly professional and attentive. Valet parking is prompt and secure. Rooms are well appointed and clean. The breakfast buffet is worth the money, and the dining room is cosy. The hotel is around the corner from many small, top-notch restaurants, the City Hall - Opera House complex, and Market St. We'll be back.
