<Content>We will never go back to this hotel Only one good thing about this hotel is the location. It is close to all touristic areas, walking distance. If you look at the website pictures, you will see those beautiful rooms, but it doesnt mean you will get a room like that. The room we had , was nothing like the ones in the pictures. It was more like a 2 star days inn hotel room. Floor was very dirty, it wasnt vacuumed, there were water stains and leakege on the walls. Towels were cheap quality towels. Except one receptionist, rest was very unfriendly and un helpfull. Internet didnt work in the room. To able to go to our room, we had to take an elevator to 1st floor, walk by restaurant, go up few stairs, and than take another elevator to our room. Heating system didnt work in the room, it was freezing cold since it was december, finaly at 6 am in the morning it started to work.Breakfast was included , it is a basic breakfast. It was ok for us.If you really need to stay in this hotel make sure you make reservations for a deluxe room. Deluxe rooms are the ones in the pictures. Good luck

<Content>What Is Not To Like I too was a bit trepidatious about staying here after reading the postings. Were those people staying at the same hotel???I traveled with another family and we were a party of 7 and were all treated as guests. Complaints about the breakfast room being dark were unfounded. The food was the same every morning but there was certainly enough of a selection that you could enjoy. The meats and cheeses were great. We took an early moring train to Rome one day and arranged to leave the hotel at 6 AM with breakfast to go . Thank you to the staff for that accomodation.We had rooms on the 2nd and 3rd floors and the rooms were great. They looked like the the rooms that were advertised on the web. I did email ahead and asked to make sure that we would be getting the rooms that have been upgraded. They looked out on the main Via and yes it does get a bit noisy from the pedestrians below so we just closed the window. The beds are hard but that did not stop us from getting a good nights sleep.It was truly beautiful to hear the bells each day from the Bell Tower. The Hotel is ideally located to all the main sights. The funny comment on our trip is when asked how far away an attraction or destination was from the hotel, the answer was 10 minutes.I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to be in the heart of Florence, close to the Duomo, The Accademia, the Uffizi Gallery, the San Lorenzo Market, the train station...I could go on. Don't miss the view from the rooftop of the Hotel. Just spectacular.

<Content>Great Hotel I read a few of the other reviews from other people. Were they at the same hotel I was? Our room was beautiful and clean. The staff was helpful and friendly. I would definately stay there again. The hotel was in the historic district which was within walking to everything. Few cars allowed. The rooms were very clean and beautiful. The bathroom was huge. When we opened the window to get some air(from the heat) it was a bit noisy but we were so tired at that point it didn't matter. Our room was in the tower so we did have to walk thru some corriders and take 2 elevators to get there. But it was well worth it. It was on floor 4. There were 5 couples on the trip each staying in different rooms. No one had any complaints. Although I will say that the single rooms are still clean and beautiful but they are small with 1 twin bed and a stall shower. So if you want more room get a double. The breakfast may have been the same every morning(which it was everywhere else) but it was excellent. And a really good selection - proscuitto, salami, cheese, yogurt, cereal, fresh bread, croissants, pastries, cookies, juice and eggs. Everything in Italy is so much fresher and better then USA. The salami and proscuitto were incredible. Much better than the imported stuff we pay $25 a LB for.

<Content>Not a luxury hotel We have just returned home today from 2 wonderful weeks in Europe. Three of our hotels were wonderful-and then there was the Brunelleschi Hotel. The hotel is dark, dingy and rather grubby. Our room was reached through a maze of badly decorated corridors with a mixture of laminex and cheap wood paneling. The room itself was an odd 2 room affair with a 1940's bathroom(which was dirty) and it felt more like staying in a boarding school or college dorm. The bathroom sink was blocked when we arrived and they fixed it by removing the entire plug so that we had to peer down at years worth of muck for the rest of our stay.  Breakfast was a sad affair with little choice, and we ate in what looked like a conference room as the breakfast room was full both days. Luckily we only stayed for 2 nights and canceled the third night to say in a nice clean Sheraton in Amsterdam.  Having read some recent reviews about this hotel, I'm going down to check that nothing was stolen from my bag. The location is good, but there are many hotels in Florence with great locations.

<Content>Great location - past its "sell by" date 19-22 Sep 2008 - wedding anniversary w/e - from the UKLocation of this hotel could not be better. Negatives (in order of priority);1. Beds like planks (and we were in refurbished deluxe rooms (we think!)2. Breakfast was poor. Same every morning, bread stale, surly staff, scrambled eggs lukewarm at bestEasy to improve with better management.

<Content>Great location, rotten hotel We stayed at this Florence Hotel as part of our Tauck Bridges tour. Our family of four had two rooms that were next to one another, which was nice. Unfortunately, the beds were as hard as rocks. In addition, it was impossible to control the air conditioning which went from freezing cold to very hot. It was impossible to sleep during our 3 night stay. In additon, the service in the dining room was horrid and the food mediocre at best. We were served our dessert before we got our entrees. It took over and hour for the food to be served at all. Since we were part of a tour, it was impossible to move to another hotel. The service at the desk was not helpful either. We would avoid this hotel at all costs during another stay in beautiful Florence.

<Content>Awful!!! We arrived in Florence on our honeymoon, knowing that there was a nicer section in this hotel and a not as nice, unrenovated section. We had requested to be in the renovated section and told it would be no problem. When we got there, the desk manager informed us there was no room for us in that section, but he'd do the best he could, and hopefully move us the next day. The best he could do was a tiny dirty room overlooking an alley. The next day we left out the Do Not Disturb sign and went about our sightseeing. When we got back, despite the sign, someone had been in our room and made the bed, emptied the trash, and stolen a very expensive ring from my husbands suitcase. Yes, he should have put it in the safe, but it was is a cufflinks box, in a zippered pocket of the suitcase. When we told the night manager Massimo, he was extremely unhelpful, and strongly discouraged us from going to the police to file a report. (Which we had to do for insurance purposes.) When we got back to the hotel ready to finally get to bed, my husband pulled back the covers, and the sheets were filthy! When I went and got replacement sheets, one of them was dirty too! The bathroom had mold everywhere, there were spiders in the corners of the room, and several of our towels had holes in them. When we went and saw the day manager the next morning about the ring, he basically told us it was our fault for not putting it in the safe, and besides, that kind of thing does not happen here. He kept telling us to look under the bed. The staff here was the most unhelpful I've ever seen, and needless to say we were never moved into a nicer room. We actually tried to move into another hotel, but as everything had been booked through a travel agent, we had to stay for the full 5 nights. It was a horrible experience, and one you don't want at any time, but especially not on your honeymoon. The only good things about this hotel are it's location, and their breakfast spread.

<Content>good hotel, excellent location reasonably easy to find, this hotel was in an excellent position in a small square on one of the narrow streets. From the outside it is very impressive, the inside was well presented and we had no problems with the room. We found the staff very helpfull, although they did add some drinks to our bill we had not had, they hapilly corrected the mistake. In terms of location, I don't think there could be much better. Definately would stay here again.

<Content>Location - 10, Hotel - 2 You know you've really got to have had a pretty bad experience in a hotel when you feel the need to log on to Trip Advisor and rate the place within 48 hours of getting home. I have to second the comments about the overall feel of the place - I don't know what part of the hotel they were featuring on the website but the parts we saw, including our creepy, dingy room, and the labyrinthine gerbil cage hallways, looked like they hadn't been cleaned or painted since the 70's. Our room were dated and had awful cheap paneling. One of the twin beds was like sleeping on a slab in a surgical theatre. It required two creaky, anxiety inducing elevator rides and at least several hundred meters walk just to get up to our third floor room. The staff were really unfriendly, but I have found that to be the case in Florence in other places as well. We too were sequestered in an airless, dark meeting space for breakfast, as all of the few breakfast tables were filled. All in all, for $350 per night, this hotel's only positive was the location.

<Content>Generally shabby, unpleasant and overpriced What a disappointment! My girlfriend and I stayed at the Brunelleschi this past week during our ten day vacation in Italy; it was one of five hotels we stayed in during our holiday. Suffice it to say we wouldn鈥檛 stay there again or recommend it, as the hotel certainly did not offer the appointments of a four-star rated facility nor did the room resemble anything like what is described and shown on the website (鈥渓uxurious鈥?this is not). Aside from the neighborhood location there is little to recommend the Brunelleschi. The general condition of the hallways and room itself can only be described as shabby and rundown. The room d茅cor (dingy brown paneling on the closets and walls) was straight out of a bad 1970鈥檚 sitcom (think Brady Bunch meets Sandford  Son). The condition of the bathroom was stunningly bad (mildewed and missing caulking along the bathtub; broken tub fixtures). The beds were harder then any I鈥檝e ever experienced. It was literally like sleeping on a slab of marble. Our room was all the way at the end of the building, accessed by two elevators and a flight of stairs, 鈥渃onveniently鈥?situated next to the service elevator. I can only assume this is the room that they use for short stays (thankfully we were only there one night) or if someone doesn鈥檛 complain (we didn鈥檛 ask for another room since, as stated, we were only there one night). And while breakfast offered a full selection, as a result of not having seating in the main dining area they had to stick us in another depressing, dark and unkempt room that appeared to be used for conferences and other office meetings, which was just one more minus. I was so disheartened by the experience that I was worried the rest of our hotels might be similarly misrepresented (great websites and online photos which belie the real thing), thankfully this was the only one of the five hotels we stayed in that disappointed. (As a point of comparison, we鈥檇 recommend the Albergo del Senato in Rome and the Novecentro in Bologna; both top drawer).

<Content>check the room! My wife and I have just returned after spending 3 nights stay here during our honeymoon in Italy. All I can say is that I understand hotels standards in Florence vary, BUT this is not a 4 star hotel. Although I'm starting to see it depends which side of the hotel you stay in. Our room was very old and smelly and in need of updating. If however you do get a room on the better side then take ear plugs!Staff were very unhelpful, in fact the guy who checked us in was not going to change the room we got what ever we did! and it was our honeymoon and he knew it. I think the hotel was fully booked and he knew we had a bad room!Then we get to breakfast, unless you manage to get one of the 5 tables by the windows you will have to sit in a dark room in which the windows and curtains are kept closed. Only stay here if you can't find anything else!

<Content>Location Location Location We loved Florence The location of this hotel was superb a stones throw from the Duomo. We had a large traditional room with large bathroom, no tea making facilities,but breakfast good. The staff were very nice and helpful. Ask them to pre book museums like the Uffizi as you can then walk in and avoid the long wait. We got the train from the airport then a taxi to hotel. Too much to say I'm a fan i would go back tomorrow and would have no problem staying at this hotel.

<Content>Perfect Hotel in a Perfect City !!! Florence is my favourite city in Europe !!! This hotel was recommended by friends. I owe them one !!! The location was perfect.... very central and walking distance to sights, shops, great restaurants, etc. I never tired of coming into the little courtyard and finding the hotel. Room was stylish and very nice with a large very comfortable bed. The marble bathroom was very spacious. The view from the terrace of the Duomo was spectacular. Breakfast was good - hot and cold buffet and sensible hours !!! The staff were very friendly and accommodating, especially the housekeepers. Can't wait to re-visit Florence and will definitely stay here again.

<Content>Small room Great location within centre of main area. Hotel has charm, is comfortable, clean and we found staff to be helpful. However, the standard rate rooms were very small. Initially we were on a lower floor with the window opening on to a very small courtyard between the buildings so that, combined with the small size of the room, it was dark and claustrophobic. Reception arranged for us to move after the first night to the top floor but directly above former room so no difference in size. But now we were above the neighbouring roof line and so much lighter and could lay in bed and see the top of the Duomo. This made it perfectly acceptable but had we stayed in first room all break we would have been less pleased with the hotel.

<Content>100 star rating! From the minute we arrived (after an 8 hour train trip and 10 days of being on the road) we were treated like close friends by everyone in the hotel. The room was newly renovated with all the amenities one would want or need. The staff was always friendly and enjoyed using their English skills. The breakfast was excellent with plenty of hot coffe and the hours were convienent. Dinner in the small in house restaurant was cozy, friendly and delicious. We can't say enough and highly recommend this hotel. Centrally located...we watched the Easter celebration from our window and had a fantastic view of the city from the roof top terrace and the weight room.

<Content>Bravo Brunelleschi My husband and I loved this hotel, where we stayed in 2006 and I'm very late in writing this review. The location is perfect, walking distance to the Duomo, Uffizi, Pitti Palace, Ponte Vecchio, Piazza della Signoria, Capella Medici, Academia, the San Lorenzo markets, you name it. When we requested tickets to the Galleria Palatina from the concierge he took care of them immediately. In fact he was very helpful and the entire front desk staff was most courteous. I'm probably a little obsessed with airconditioning, but since we live in Texas, we're used to AC everywhere. The Brunelleschi had probably the coldest AC we've ever experienced in a European hotel. My husband was in heaven, since he likes a room very cold when he sleeps. Although our room was small, we had a queen sized bed with about two feet (less than a meter) clearance on either side, the bathroom was huge by European standards. It was about 3/4 the size of the bedroom! Our Travelocity package included breakfast, which consisted of pastries, Italian meats and cheeses, fruit and juice, coffee, espresso and cappuccino. It was good, but we actually liked the breakfast better at our hotel in Pisa. We will definitely stay there again when we return to Florence.

<Content>Terrible reception New year 2007 was meant to be a fun celebration in Florence staying at this hotel, so we went ahead and booked directly with them in ample time in early November. We received a written hotel confirmation and all was well....we thought. When we arrived late, cold and tired on December 30th we were met by an unfriendly and very arrogant reception desk that told us that they did not have our reservation and that we therefore had to find accommodation elsewhere. They did find us another hotel to stay but it was done with no apology, no effort to try to compensate for their mistake. We travel a lot - but have never been met by such a rude and unprofessional attitude. Warning - do not book this hotel through their website!

<Content>Pros and cons... We stayed here for a week just after Xmas 2007. We chose the hotel because of its availability, price (bearing in mind it is Florence) and location.We found positives and negatives:On the plus side we asked for a quiet room, at the top, with a view - and we got exactly that. The room was spacious and clean and warm. View of the Duomo was lovely.Breakfast was fine and the hotel was perfectly situated for all the sites and only 10 minutes walk to the station. We found the staff to be generally friendly.On the negative side the decor does not appear to have been updated since the '70s. Shabby carpets and the wardrobe doors only just holding up. Not quite what we expected from the website or a 4 star.Also - the price of the drinks. We only had 2 and they cost us 28 Euros. In my view that is simply extortionate and there is no excuse.All in all we had an excellent holiday. With a lick of paint and a cheaper bar, it could be a great hotel.

<Content>Great location - near to everything! We have just returned from a three night stay at this hotel - we booked the hotel based on location as the reviews were fairly mixed and we were really pleased with everything about the stay.The location really is superb - we just had a normal double room on the 4th floor and our window view was the Duomo! It did indeed get a bit noisy with the bells being rung but as someone already said - close your shutters and windows and you can only hear faint noises from outside - we liked to hear the chatter of Italians in the early morning and the bells; better than an alarm clock!The room was spacious enough, comfortable bed (the usual two singles combined to make a big double - but combined properly so you didn't fall down the middle). Plenty of extra bedding if you needed it.Fully stocked mini bar with plenty of room in the fridge to store your own stuff; TV with remote, telephone.The bathroom was well appointed, plenty of towels of a decent size too, no bath but a lovely shower.Even though breakfast was included we didn't manage to get to the restaurant to sample it, however, we did have room service on our last day for breakfast. Well, huge portions of fresh fruit and pastries - we couldn't eat it all.The bar was welcoming, we visited here each night for a coffee and a nightcap after being out and about all day and evening - the service was smooth and we particularly enjoyed trying to identify what songs the resident pianist was playing ang singing. There were comfy seats in the bar area and plenty of sofa's and tables in the adjoining piano bar.The museum was interesting, if you are staying here you should really go have a look, there's no excuse not to.Now to the staff - on the whole they were magnificent. The reception staff are well versed in several languages whilst the porters and domestic staff were not.We do not speak fluent Italian by any means and we were met with patience and understanding by most of the staff who were very willing to let us have a go and do us the courtesy of responding in Italian.A couple of the staff were sniffy, however, having said that they were not unpleasant, just frighteningly efficient and obviously too busy to join in the game of seeing what a mess English people make of speaking Italian.As we have already said - the location is fantastic - well within easy walking distance to all the principal attractions in Florence, and we really do mean easy walking distance - walking NOT striding.Two minutes to get inside the Duomo; five minutes to the Uffizzi; less than ten minutes to Santa Croce....... we could go on but you get the picture.There really is no point going on here about all the attractions as there are countless excellent guide books to assist you and all the attractions are so close together distance wise it is so very easy to plan your days. We found the Lonely Planet Florence City Guide 2006 version to be most useful and used it for restaurant recommendations rather than ask at the hotel (we've found in the past that these recommendations have been very hit and miss).Two restaurant recommendation we could make are firstly Acqua Al 2 on Via della Vigna Vecchia (between Uffizzi and Santa Croce) - the food is excellent and they do a sample menu of first courses and sweets which is a complete surprise as it depends on the chef on the day - great fun! The menu is all in Italian though so be warned!Secondly, a completely different experience as this is very traditional with the long trestle type table dining with everyone in together but again, great fun. This restauraunt is called Trattoria Coco Lezzone and is on Via Parioncino, not far from the river, between the bridges Ponte Santa Trinita and Ponte alla Carraia.Although this is traditional the menu was both in Italian and English - it's a limited menu but what they do, they do well.All in all a very good break but we will have to return as three days only scratched the surface. When we return we will certainly look at this hotel again as it ticked all the boxes - value for money, comfortable, helpful staff and superb location.We hope this helps you and please do feel free to ask questions - we have found the comments and answers from fellow tripadvisors to be most helpful in the past in choosing our holidays and are happy to return the favour!

<Content>Outstanding Hotel This is a beautiful, charming historical hotel. The rooms are spacious for european standards and the decor is typical italian style. The staff is very friendly and helpful when you attempt to speak their language instead of assuming they should understand your language.Our room faced the Duomo and we were treated each morning to the chiming of bells from the bell tower. Lovely! The only draw back is that because of the lovely tower of the hotel, tours are brought to the courtyard to view it. If you ring the front desk a staff member will ask the guide not to use the megaphone during their speech.Breakfast is buffet style with a wide assortment of fruits, dry cereals and breads. Eggs and italian style ham and bacon are also available. American style coffee or tea will be brought to your table if requested, or you can order like the Italians do and ask for a cappuccino. The housekeeping is quick and efficent. The hotel bar has a wonderful assortment of cocktails and dessert wines with plenty of snacks and. There are plenty of tables and comfortable chairs to enjoy your drink or just surf the interent on your own laptop.Don't forget to tour the hotel museum, ask the front desk for details. The tour is free but a donation of 1 or 2 euros is appreciated. Also the view from the top of the hotel is absoluting breathtaking. One advantage to staying at this hotel is that it is in the heart of the city, close to just about all the sites one would wish to see, so if you forget to grab a sweater or you want to drop off your shopping bags or more importantly use a restroom the Brunelleschi is ideal !!!!!

<Content>Very Bad Experience we booked at the hotel Brunelleschi Firenze 15 days ago minimum, a double room where it is necessary to escalade to get on the bed to be able to lay down, having only one side accessible, the other against the wall. The televison is from the nineties, no bath-tub, a tiny shower. For a 4 star hotel, it was not one. The reception is far from welcoming as the Italians usually are, especially by the hotel manager. He even said the room does not correspond to a 4 star hotel but did not offer to change it or give us a refund. It really was not spacious for a double room, it hardly was a simple room with a tiny bathroom. Ventilation cannot be tuned!!!very old, and very noisy air, the shutters always closed, because the building facing the window is 2 meters away! cleanliness very disappointing too.I am not going in any of the hotels chain anymore.

<Content>Great location! We stayed for 2 nights with kids. We got an amazing 2-bedroom suite! (Okay it was not cheap.) We had windows overlooking onto the very busy streets and loved the atmosphere. Location is right in the center of the bustling, hustling center yet windows well-insulated that you couldn't hear a thing once closed. We walked from the train station (around 10-15 min) and felt very safe, unlike what another traveler said. The weekend staff was very nice, but come Sunday eve and Monday, there were some very unpleasant ladies at the reception who growled. Why they are there at such a nice hotel is beyond me. We asked them to recommend a good and reasonale restaurant and one of them told us to go to Natalino which turned out to be overpriced and underportioned so maybe she gets a commission. Anyway, hotel is in general great, staff so-so, location is amazing.

<Content>Classy, but you pay for it As the title says this is a lovely but expensive hotel. Room a bit on the small side but large bathroom. Prime location, stylish decor, good atmosphere, reasonable staff, two nice lounges. Only downside is the breakfast which pretty bad for a hotel of this stature

<Content>No better than average This hotel is in a very good location. The public areas are comfortable if a little gloomy. However, my bedroom was very small and in a condition that didn't suggest '4 star' nor did it merit the considerable price. Having stayed the previous night in the 2 star Hotel Casci I can say that the room was hardly any bigger (although the bathroom was twice the size) and I had the same view of a dark well. Yet the Brunelleschi was roughly three times the price. The breakfast was OK but nothing special. The service was competent but hardly enthusiastic and the food at other mealtimes was average at best. I'm sure, for the price, one could find better. One final thing, why is it that 4 and 5 star hotels such as this one so often charge extortionate rates for internet access when cheaper hotels offer this service for free? In any case, the Brunelleschi doesn't have Wi-Fi internet access in its rooms which is strange in this day and age. So you have to take your laptop to the bar or use one of the computers set up in the lounge area.

<Content>Fabulous Location, Hard To Find We stayed here in August and it was great!. The hotel itself looks tiny from the outside but it's big inside. It also has part of a castle in it's basement. We had trouble finding it by car and ended up phoning for directions but once we knew where it was we were ok. Be aware that the road is very narrow so take a small car. The hotel will arrange parking with collection and drop off as required for a small fee which was great. The location couldn't have been better...it was just off the main street, close to the major sights in the middle of town, just a short walk from the duomo - in fact it can be seen from the roof terrace. The continebtal breakfast was great appart from the coffee which was always likewarm. The staff on reception were friendly and helpful. Due to it's location, at night there was some noise from the street performers but you'd expect that in a location like this. Overall a great hotel - florence is a fabulous city so would certainly reccomend this one.

<Content>A very comfortable and enjoyable stay My friend and I stayed at the Brunelleschi Hotel for six nights in a large, twin-bedded room, with an equally large, well appointed bathroom. This hotel was selected because of its location and price - close to the Duomo and not badly priced (about $300 per night for two). We weren't looking for a budget room as we wanted a lot of comfort and elegance on this blow the budget trip. We found the front desk staff to be very accomodating, especially the concierge who arranged many dinner reservations and outings for us. Breakfasts were fine, once we discovered we could order a cappuchino instead of the watery coffee served at the table. The bar was very welcoming, both bartenders made a very good martini, and we met so many interesting travelers there. The rooftop terrace afforded a fantastic view (and I mean fantastic) of the Duomo - what a great spot to bring up a bottle of wine and toast our trip and Firenze!

<Content>Horrible Experience The staff was VERY rude! Our rooms were not what we had requested. They could only change one. Once we had one changed, it was not yet ready. The cleaning lady was extremely rude. She was obviously mad about something! She came in slamming doors and mouthing off. Fortunately for us, we couldn't understand a word she was saying. The man who brought our baggage up never once apologized for her behavior, but seemed somewhat embarrassed by her behavior. The staff at the front desk was rude. We didn't want to ask them anything. They didn't offer any other help with where to go or what to do or how to get around. Their favorite response was NO! The room was ok. Small beds. Hard mattresses. No A/C. We had to keep the windows open at night to cool the room but the outside noise was very loud. Carpets stained, wall stained. Not very clean. We had a driver come and pick us up one morning and when he inquired as to who we were, the front desk was very rude to him telling him there were too many people in the lobby, we could be anybody. The hotel is very old, which I guess is part of its 'charm'. So if you decide to visit be prepared to take different elevators plus still have to climb up several stairs to get to your floor. However, the breakfast was very good. And the location wasn't bad. But, I would not recommend this hotel!

<Content>Special Hotel for a Special Break We both had a special birthday this year and we when we booked asked the hotel for a nice room with a view of the Duomo. When we arrived we found they had given us the Duomo Suite which was wonderful. We had stopped at the hotel previously and on both occasions have nothing but the highest praise for the staff. All in all the best short break we have ever had.Alan and Christine, Worcester UK

<Content>Perfect location We recently stayed at the Brunelleschi for four nights as part of our honeymoon. The location is perfect for exploring Florence. The Duomo, Piazza della Signoria and Santa Croce are all very close by and easily walkable, as are just about all the other main attractions. The room we had was fine and had an outstanding view of the Duomo which seemed almost next to us, almost close enough to touch (fourth floor). Although the hotel is in the heart of central Florence, we found it to be a quiet spot. We'd recommend going up to the roof top terrace which gives great views of Florence. The room was of a decent size with plenty of storage space and a large bathroom and breakfast was ok. We stayed on a bed  breakfast basis, so did not eat evening meals in the hotel. Instead, there are some great (and relatively cheap) places to eat in the Piazza della Signoria.Other recommendations close to the hotel are Boccadama, a wine bar in Piazza Santa Croce, which is great to sit outside and have a glass of wine and/or a meal in front of the Cathedral, and Rivoire cafe in the Piazza della Signoria (hot chocolate a must!).

<Content>Two Different Experiences I have two stories to tell. I originally booked this hotel for two nights in a Junior Suite, Duomo view, then we decided to add a third night at the begining for our stay. They couldn't give us our Suite for the first night, so put us in a triple room. It was dirty, old, tired and not pleasant. It seemed odd too, because the hotel itself looked nice in the lobby, breakfast room and public areas. We complained, but we were moving anyway the second night and hoped the suite would be cleaner. It was like going to a different hotel. The suite was perfect, large, two bedroom, large bath, balcony, spacious and Very clean. We were delighted and almost forgot how bad the first room was. This is an excellent location but if you are driving, which I did, be prepared to go down some of the smallest alleys known to man. My wife was sure we were going to scrape the side of the car going down the last alley, Elisabetta, but all of a sudden there we were in a small piazza and the hotel location was great. I paid to garage park my car, very expensive, about $120 for three days, but I didn't want to mess with it while in Florence. I would stay here again, but only in a Junior Suite, the hotel could be upgraded, they charge plenty for it.

<Content>Great Location/ Good Breakfast This hotel is in a perfect location and the breakfast was wonderful. The service at the hotel was also excellent. The only negative comment is the size of the rooms and the view from the rooms. The rooms are quite small and our room looked at another building. Some of the rooms faced the pedestrian street (Calzuiini??). If you can handle the noise, ask for one of those rooms because they seemed larger and they had a view. The deck on top of the hotel was nice (but too hot to enjoy) and the workout room was a nice addition for a European hotel.

<Content>Second Thoughts I often like this hotel. I suggest a redone room on an upper floor. We stayed here twice in July 2007. Our first room was great for four nights- #412. The second visit at the end of our Italian voyage was for just one night- on the first floor (one above street level). The rumors of paper thin walls were proven true. Mold or mildew on the bathtub caulking- true. Great location and good service and good breakfast included- all true. I'll go back, but I'll demand a redone room on an upper floor.

<Content>Loved Hotel Brunelleschi in Florence. Stopped at Hotel Brunelleschi in Florence in July 2007 during a 3 city break to Italy and could not fault it, the best one we stopped at in Italy without a doubt. Location is great, close to the Duamo. Room was excellent, very clean and decor/fittings etc were superb. Staff very helpful. Breakfast was exceptional for a continental style, check out the selection of fresh fruits and the chocolate croissants!! Would deffinately stop here again.

<Content>Four Star? We stayed here for a long weekend expecting four star quality. Instead we reckoned it was three star at best. On our first evening we chose to dine in the hotel restaurant. We dined alone in the entire restaurant until another couple arrived as we were having our coffees. The menu was very good but sadly the food itself wasn't. The chef tried but the quality was lacking bearing in mind the prices. Clearly other guests knew something we didn't and chose to dine elsewhere as we did the remainder of our break.Breakfast was fine (buffet style)but chaotic every morning, again not what was expected from a four star hotel.Waiters served teas or coffees- fine if you don't mind waiting!The hotel itself was clean and pleasant and all staff were very attentive and accommodating. The situation of the hotel cannot be bettered if you want something central.All things considered we would stay again but would find other bars or restaurants for food and drink.

<Content>Wonderful stay in Florence Hotel Brunelleschi is a lovely hotel in an excellent location in the heart of Florence. The rooms are brilliant , although the bells of the Duomo wake you up early in the morning! All the staff are very helpful and can make good suggestions for eating out - I had the best sea bass I have ever had from one of their recommendations. I would thoroughly recommend a stay at this delightful hotel.

<Content>Confused Having just read the last few reviews for Brunelleschi Hotel, I am somewhat confused....was this the same hotel we stayed in last summer?? We had previously stayed in hotel three years earlier and were quite pleased. However, last year our room was awful. Dingy, small room, brown nylon bed spreads, pillow cases and curtains to match making the room extremely dull and very sixties, worn carpet, run down bathroom, oh and the roll of old sticking plaster just visible under the bed (and covered in dust) sealed our disappointment. All in all, I believed the hotel had deterioted over the yearsI agree, a wonderful location, but would never return. Obviously, looking at travellers photos, there are much nicer rooms, but none offered to us. Very disappointing for a 4 star hotel.

<Content>Superb bly central location Four ladies of a certain age had a marvellous time in Florence this month. Everything about the trip was brilliant. From the amazing weather( blue clear skies and sunshine all the way , with crisp clear nights) to the fantastic hotel Brunelleschi. I had the awesome responsibility of booking my friends a 4 star hotel within easy walk of all the major attractions, and despite constant joking by my fellow travellers it would only have been possible to be more central by camping in the Duomo itself!The hotel rooms were excellent, we did experience some exuberant noise one night but overall very comfortable. The breakfast was beautifully presented and the waiting staff pleasant but not overly attentive. The reception staff were pleasant and helpful, and we loved our forays into the comfortable lounge bar. Our drinks order was accompanied with little delicacies to nibble on served beautifully by the bar staff. The sights of Florence were of course magnificent . The small museum in the basement of the hotel was an interesting diversion whilst we awaited our taxi to the airport.

<Content>Mixed Feelings Stayed here for a week in January. The hotel is gorgeous, though the walls around the guest rooms are extremely scuffed and in need of repainting. First the negatives: Unfortunately, my room looked nothing like the luxurious photos on the website- it looked like something you'd find in an old Best Western and the furnishings probably date to the 1960s or 70s. The room looked out on a dreary alley complete with hanging laundry. The outlet in the bathroom did not work, and the box of tissues was not replaced after they ran out on the 3rd day. The safe did not work after several efforts to program it. The walls are very thin- we heard everything in the room next door, and despite being on the 3rd floor, the late-night noise from the 1st floor bar and live singer was loud enough to wake us. The bed was also rock-hard, so if you like a soft bed you will be disappointed (though my back felt great after sleeping on it). Internet access was more expensive here than I've paid elsewhere.On the positive side, the room was very large by European standards. The bathroom was also large, with a double sink, a very nice touch. It could be hard to navigate around the hotel as each floor seemed to have multiple levels, but I thought it made the place more interesting. The breakfast selection was fantastic. The front desk staff was very accommodating and made excellent recommendations for dining. Most of all, this hotel is in a prime location- walking distance to the Duomo, Uffizi, Ponte Vecchio, and all of the best shops. Overall, I had a very positive experience. The room was a disappointment, but the staff and services were great. I would definitely stay here again, and request an updated room on the opposite side of the hotel from the lounge!

<Content>Great Location Great location. Walking distance to all major attractions. 2 minutes walk to Duomo and 30 minutes to Piazza Michaelangelo. Great shops and restaurants around the hotel. Golden View Open Bar is located accross the river and right beside Ponte Vecchio (10 minutes). A great restaurant to try.PROS- Great location.- Large room size. Large bathroom.- Breakfast buffet.CONS- Quite noise early in the morning (e.g. bell from Duomo rings every hour after 7:00 am, street cleaning, etc.)- Need to switch elevator at 1st floor. Need to walk a few steps to get to the elevator level. Not convenient if you have heavy luggage.- Room is old. Need renovation.

<Content>Perfect Location The hotel is in a perfect location easily accessible by foot to all locations. We arrived our first day by taxi from the train station (20 euro with tip for 4). The trip back to the airport was 30 euro with tip (for 4). Within minutes from the hotel we found a small snack shop and snacked on on wonderful panini with capuccino, then further down the street on gelato. Great dining within walking distance at Golden View Open Bar (fabulous Gnocchi with Gogonzola Cream, Acqua al Due (do the special menu where they choose several pastas, salads and entrees for you...the Blueberry Steak is a must!) Bucco Dell'Orafo (great Ribolitta and pasta and a cream cake ith meringue dessert) and Buca Mario (the BEST Gnocchi with Gorgonzola Cream....fantastic wine and olive oil that you can purchase). The buffet breakfast at the hotel which was included in our package was fantastic...from eggs and bacon to cereal and fruit to pastry and rolls....plus fantastic capuccino....great start to the day. The rooms are good quality, good size bath (2 sinks)...the only negative is the beds are VERY firm. All the major tourist sites are nearby walking distance from the hotel....Duomo, Ponte Vecchio, Santa Croce, Piazza Michaelangelo (a heartly walk), Ufizzi, Pitti Palace, San Lorenzo market, etc. A supermarket is also nearby (I think it's called Sanda). The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful. I would stay there again and heartily recommend to others.

<Content>Great location, great staff!! This hotel was a real find! We loved the location and the front desk staff was the friendliest in Italy!! The breakfast buffet was also excellent! This hotel was in a quiet alley, just steps from the Duomo and the best shopping in Florence! The only negative was the multiple levels on the different floors, making it difficult to get around in the hotel. A minor inconvenience for an otherwise excellent hotel.

<Content>Not a 4 star hotel I really tried to like this hotel and give it the benefit of the doubt since I stayed there on a tour package which was extremely reasonable but this property is not a four star but closer to three. They probably get four stars since there is a bar and restaurant.Cons*We were on the third floor which was very hot as well as the room. There is no AC. Of course when the windows were opened mosquitoes came in. I guess that is why there where at least 10 bloody marks on the wall where mosquitoes had been killed.* Worst water pressure ever in any hotel I have stayed at in Europe*Beds were like sleeping on rocks.*Noise from the bathroom next door was terrible, heard the metal shower hose against the tub and the water going through the pipes was quite loud.*The room was not cleaned well in terms of vacuuming and dusting.*No tissues in the room (I guess the maid forgot since she gave them to us on the third day when we saw her)Pros*Location*Bathroom had two sinks and was large for Europe standards*Breakfast was typical 鈥搚ogurt, fruit, rolls, pastry, cereal, meats, cheese scrambled eggs but get there before 9 though..Bottom line is there are better hotels for the price with just as good location than the B. I would not stay here again.

<Content>Loved it, was almost great My experience at the hotel was a solid 8 out of 10. The location is great and the rooms and bathrooms nice size. I would rate this as a solid 4 star European hotel. You can walk out of your door and into all the action My only knock on the place is the beds are extremely uncomfortable. I had read this in a prior review and disregarded it. However, if you require a $1000 mattress or have trouble sleeping, I wouldn't reccomend this hotel. You will be happy during most of the stay, but miserable at night. I have trouble understanding why such a nice hotel has a concrete slab for you to sleep on.

<Content>going around in circles My wife and I stayed here as part of our honeymoon, we drove down to florence from Venice, which was a mistake. We had planned to drive the country roads, this proved very time consuming so we ended up on the autostrada. In hindsight we should have taken the train. Finding the hotel was really difficult, not a policeman of which there were lots knew where the hotel was, so after driving around the city for almost an hour we finally arrived. The hotel website does give a road map to get to the hotel so study it carefully if you are driving here. The hotel looks stunning, our room was a little on the small side but OK. The location of this hotel is superb on the doorstep of everything.Breakfast was OK, my wife is alergic to all dairy products and we informed the hotel prior to our arrival and they said they would provide soya milk for my wife; when we checked out we were actually charged for the milk !!! much to my surprise.Also their car paring fees were a little on the high side, if you do drive park your car somewhere else.On the whole a reasonable hotel in a good location.

<Content>Bravo, Brunelleschi! For years, my wife has wanted to go to Florence and stay at the Brunelleschi, so this year we made it, for a 5 day stay.Arriving at Pisa airport, you have the choice of a 75 min. journey by train or coach, but as the trains were neither convenient or frequent in October, we chose the coach. Mind, if you do the same, get to the head of the queue quickly, as once it's full, that's it - there'll be another one along in an hour! From the station in Florence we could see the Duomo, and knowing the Brunelleschi is adjacent, and looking at the rush-hour traffic, we decided we would walk. It only took us 20 mins - we are in our 60's - but the hotel in in a maze of small streets and, on reflection, perhaps a taxi would have been better. The entrance and reception are bright, pleasant places, and the lady on the desk patiently listened to my amateur Italian before replying in perfect English. After trawling through the usual agency websites, I had found the best deal to be on the hotel's own website, and had asked for a twin-bed non-smoking room on the top floor. And that's exactly what we got. Room 421 opens onto a small inner hallway and a spacious room overlooking a small inner courtyard - and looking straight at the Duomo and Campanile. We were impressed! The air-conditioned room also had built-in wardrobes, a minbar, a writing desk and a couple of chairs, and was clean and well-decorated. Across the small hallway, which contained another wardrobe with a safe, was a large fully-tiled bathroom with twin bowls, a WC, bidet, and bath/shower. Everything worked perfectly.As we had arrived in the early evening we decided to eat in the hotel's restaurant. This was a mistake, and the meal, although OK, did not come up to the expectations raised by the surroundings. We subsequently noticed that neither the hotel's retaurant or bar attracted many patrons, probably because there are lots of small restaurants in the vicinty - there's an excellent family-run restaurant 'il Paiolo' just around the corner - and they can't beat the competition. However breakfast, included in the rate, was very good, with a great choice of cold and hot dishes, and plenty to eat whatever time we appeared, up to the 10.00 am. finish. Any hotel depends on its staff, and the staff at the Brunelleschi could not have been more accomodating. We never saw the chambermaids or cleaning staff, just the results of their work. The staff in the restaurant and on the desk were unfailingly efficient, pleasant, and helpful.Florence is a very compact city, and the Brunelleschi could not be more central, with none of the major sights more than a 20 min. walk away. However you do have to put up with the endless tour-groups, the trinket-sellers, and the beggars. None of this should stop you going there, and to the Brunelleschi. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.

<Content>Very disappointing! I stayed at The Brunelleschi Hotel last week, thankfully for one night only. On the positive side the staff were very friendly and helpful but unfortunately this did not make up for the Hotel itself (which certainly did not live up to its fours stars). I would note the following points before considering making a reservation: * the Hotel is in desperate need of a refurbishment: entering the Hotel was not particularly pleasant / or welcoming (apart from the staff) - it's quite dark (even on a bright summer's day); the entrance carpets were rugged and old * the rooms: we booked a double room and a single room which were far from spacious; the room walls and carpets were filthy!!;* the bath in the double room was not stable (fixed properly to the base) ; it moved (wobbled) every time you stepped into it (which we had to do to in order to use the shower!* we saw a dirty pair of socks lying behind one of the room chairs (obviously forgotten by previous guests) - the cleaners missed it! * the room windows have no double glazing and therefore noise from the outside was very audible* the terrace, which has views of the Duomo, is small.* Finally: I would not advise driving in Florence - it's a nightmare - but we did rent a car for our holiday because we spent most of our time just outside of Siena (highly recommend the Borgo La Bagnaia Hotel)...it basically took us approximately one hour to find the hotel (thanks to all the one-way systems!). We ended up paying a taxi in the end to help us get to our hotel! the street which the Hotel is on was so narrow that we could not believe that this was a road we could turn into with the car (i think it's called Elisabeth). - As a suggestion, considering the difficulties of travelling in central Florence by car, it would be very wise to get directions from the Hotel beforehand so you don't struggle with the one-way systems like we did!

<Content>Excellent location Lovely hotel housed in a beautiful building. We were a party of 6 and the three rooms we had were all different but equally nice. Staff were helpful and those serving breakfast were particularly friendly. There was a wide choice on the breakfast buffet(unusual for Italy) even when we went in at the last minute - 10 to 10. The only thing was the water for the tea was not very hot but I did not complain so I did not give them the chance to rectify that. The location was excellent . Our room faced the main street and it was noisy when the window was open but the shutters, windows and heavy curtains shut out most of it at night and we slept no problem. The only thing was, being in such a good location, the bells of the Duomo woke us up at 7am!!! It was very handy being able to go back in with the shopping or for a nice clean toilet etc.I would definately stay at the Brunelleschi again but beware of the bar where we paid 拢12 for a vodka and cola.

<Content>Great location We were advised that this hotel was a 5 star, obviously it isnt as 4 stars on the door, who knows.The location was perfect within easy walking distance to everywhere, and so handy to pop back to with shopping!!The breakfasts were very good, I do agree with other comments as probably need to get there before 9am to appreciate the freshness.Had room service one evening the food was very good, tho equivalent food in local restaurants was cheaper.We didnt find any staff rude just a little sullen at times but they did warm to us the more we saw them.The area did 'wake' up from 5am and as I am a light sleeper it did disturb me but no more than in any other city ive visited.The roof terrace is tiny but we were able to take some great photos from there and from the top of the Duomo...after climbing the 300plus steps.We didnt feel we spent enough time there having spent half a day at PIsa then 2.5 days in Florence, definately need to go back for another 3 to 4 days.I would stay again purely for the location

<Content>Lovely hotel We stayed here for my husband's birthday weekend. We're ususally more 3* hotel people so this was a bit of a treat, but it was worth every penny. The hotel is beautiful - such a lovely building and a GREAT location. The staff were unfailingly polite as we checked in and went to the bar. Our room was a good size with an ENORMOUS bathroom, and views of the campanile. Breakfast was excellent...I found the hotel pretty much faultless. And Florence? Just beautiful.

<Content>BAD Brunelleschi Just ok, barely ok, only book here if there is no rooms anywhere else in Florence. My Mum and Dad stayed here on a recent stay in Florence we stayed in the Savoy. On arrival my parents were shown to a tiny little room in the back end of beyond, after giving the Rude reception staff an ultimatum of change the room or we leave they were given a room which was ok, not to bad, due to the nature of the design of this hotel, part of the old ruins or prison or something, it has no views to speak of and lots of corridors. The breakfast was ok but again the staff were rude and everything seemed to be a problem, I had a drink in the bar whilst waiting for my parents and the barman seemed quite nice but according to my parents he was the only one. Beautiful city so don't let this place spoil it for you!Dave Culpan

<Content>Perfect Florentine Hotel Not only does the hotel have its own ancient Roman baths  museum, it is located near the Baptistry  Duomo. Walk everywhere. A delicious breakfast was included-fresh fruit  fresh fruit salad (kiwi, strawberries, pineapple,oranges, etc.), eggs, sausages  cold meats, all manner of cereals, cheeses, breads,yougart, etc. Service was impeccable and staff VERY helpful in every way-from making reservation @ museums, to suggestions for dinner, obtaining a driver for us. Lovely atmosphere. We stayed a week and would stay there again. Don't miss San Marco Church/convent with fabulous FraAngelico frescoes and view his and Savanarola's monk cells, the Chapel of the Magi in the Medici Palace, and Medici tombs with Michelangelo's Dusk/Dawn/Day/ Night in the Medici Chapel --- incredible sculptures. All of three of these wonderful sites are not as well known as David, but should not be missed.

<Content>Loved the Brunelleschi The Brunelleschi is a wonderful choice for Florence - off season. It's in a superb central location so you can walk everywhere. Our suite was comfortable for 3 with a fairly large modern bathroom and good closet and drawer space. The beds were comfortable, the crisp linens were changed daily and the staff couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful. My only caveat about the hotel is that because of it's central location, during the heavy tourist season it might be noisy. The city had filled with tourists by the end of our trip, and we heard the street noise at night. In spite of the noise we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.

<Content>Fabulous Florence hotel We just got back from a trip to Italy. The Hotel Brunelleschi was a great choice for Florence. We had a huge triple with lots of storage and a view of the Duomo. The bathroom was large and new. The concierge was nice and helpful. He made our reservations for the Uffizi and the Accademia museums about a week ahead for us which was wonderful as the line to get in without reservations was a 3 hour wait.The hotel is in a very convenient area of Florence and is nicely decorated and has a good staff. Breakfast was included in the price of our room which was 205 euros per night- a bargain for our location. It is an extensive buffet served in the hotel restaurant. There is also a very nice large quiet bar off of the hotel lobby.I would highly recommend the Hotel Brunelleschi. It is a lovely hotel.

<Content>Great experience! My friend and I stayed for 4 nights. We had no complaints whatsoever. The service, staff, cleanliness, comfort etc were all exemplary. Special tip: bring a picnic lunch up to the rooftop terrace and get a breathtaking view of the city. The view of the Duomo there by sunrise is sublime.

<Content>Very pleasantly surprised... My friend  I booked a 4-night city break in the Brunelleschi before reading TripAdvisor. Having seen some reviews, we wondered if we would regret our choice, especially as we were not due to arrive until around midnight and thought we'd be given the dregs of the room allocations. We therefore emailed Reception in advance to request a quiet room on the 4th floor with, if possible, a view of the Duomo - nothing ventured, nothing gained! On arrival we were very pleasantly surprised to receive a friendly and efficient welcome and delighted to find we had been given a 4th floor room overlooking a peaceful inner courtyard, from where we could see the dome of the Duomo. The room was a bit tired but spotlessly clean, the beds were extremely comfortable and the shower was hot and strong. We reported problems to Reception with the safe and a loose, potentially dangerous heating switch. Both were dealt with swiftly and with a warm apology.Breakfast was excellent whether taken early or late, with lots of fresh fruit, yoghurt, rolls, hams and cheese, but the pots of tea and coffee were kept sitting on a side table and could be far from hot by the time they were served. The restaurant food was generally good although desserts were uninspired and service could be a bit on the lazy side. In the bar, the service was friendly and prompt, with a live pianist most evenings.Overall a great Winter trip to a sparkling and quiet (relatively tourist-free!) Florence, made even better by this brilliantly located and comfortable hotel.

<Content>4 Star Service This January, on my fourth trip to Florence, I chose the Brunelleschi because of its superb location and large rooms by Florence standards. While the complaints about noise are valid, travellers should realize that noise is a constant throughout central Florence, and can only be avoided if you opt for accomodations far outside the historic area. As for service, we couldn't have been more pleased. Our waiter chatted with us every morning at breakfast and seemed truly interested in our impressions of his city. Service at the front desk was exemplary. When I asked where to purchase a carton and packing materials so that I could ship home some purchases, the concierge suggested that a wine carton might do. That afternoon, a wine carton and packing tape were waiting for us in our room. The desk was also helpful in arranging tour reservations, and provided thorough directions whenever we needed assistance. Overall, I felt that the Brunelleschi provided service and accomodations that were better than many other hotels in its price range in Florence.

<Content>a little faded, but charming and different I have just come back from a weekend stay at this hotel with my Mother. I have to confess to having found this hotel from the Da Vinci Code which is slightly embarrassing but I read the reviews on tripadvisor first and was almost put off! I stuck with it though as it was in such a great location and looked structurally more interesting than most hotels. I requested by email a room with twin beds, explaining that I was travelling with my mother. I also requested a room on the top floor as I was told by the reviews on here that they are the renovated nicest rooms. I was given both and had room 405 which I would recommend. It is at the end of a long corridor and is nice, clean, good bathroom, good view of the Duomo and is quiet being tucked away. The Brunelleschi is a nice hotel, it is in a great location being 3 mins from the Duomo. Yes, there is noise at night, but we were so high up it didn't bother us and at the end of the day you are in a busy city and you are situated centrally so it isn't going to be that quiet realistically. We had clean sheets, nice towels, a mini bar, no kettle but I have never been provided with tea making facilities in any hotels I've stayed at in Italy or France so I didn't expect that. There is a restaurant which was closed of an evening but we used it for breakfast. It is open between 7am -10am and if you get there earlier the eggs are hot, if nearer to 10am they are stone cold! We had a much nicer breakfast when we arrived at 7.30am, the rolls were fresher and the fruit was nicer. The reception area is lovely, really unusual. You are staying in a very old building and if you like that sort of thing you will see the charm. If you like modern purpose built hotels its probably not for you. On the first floor there is a large lounge with internet access. This is a lovely big light room, nicely furnished but you won't really be in it, you'll be exploring Florence! I really liked this hotel and would stay there again. There are some lovely restaurants in the surrounding roads and its a lovely place to just meander. The hotel looks so impressive from the outside at night. At night we could hear the wind howling round the tower and it was eerie but charming! It is faded in places, but very unusual and different. The staff in reception just cannot break a smile though! But we found that a lot in Florence. They were either wonderful or sullen. No inbetween! The Uffizi was amazing, but pre-book your tickets on-line. The Accademia was worth a trip to look at David. Don't forget to either take your passport or your driving licence if you want to hire an Audio Guide. They will not le you leave you money or a credit card, god knows why. If you take the Ryan Air transfer BEWARE of a long wait. You have never seen such incompetence at organising people on to a coach! Enjoy Florence.

<Content>Hotel Brunelleschi - Very Good Location, Very Bad Quality for Money We stayed at the Hotel Brunelleschi for 3 nights in early October. Our first impressions as we arrived were good. The hotel is very close to the Duomo and sits in a small piazza which is in a mainly pedestrianised area. Unfortunately from this point onwards things went downhill.We arrived in reception with our luggage after dark and feeling quite stressed after our journey from the airport and having battled through the many beggars at the train station we would have really appreciated a friendly face at reception to make us feel welcome but, alas that was not to be. The grey haired young lady at the desk was very supercilious and quite frankly rude. We were asked for the usual credit card at the desk but we always refuse and offer a cash deposit. When we declined to give a credit card we were treated with distain and sent to our room without a smile or thank you which does grate rather when our bill had already been prepaid online. The room was ok - clean and tidy but dated and shabby round the edges. The aspect was good - we could see Brunelleschi's Dome and the Campinile from one window and being on the third floor we were high enough from the street below to not be too disturbed. However, dont forget this is a busy area so you will hear Florentine life through the night - all part of the great experience of this city. We decided as it was late we would eat in the Hotel restaurant - big, big mistake! We ordered Bruschetta Pomadoro and was told they had no bread! So we ordered Tomato and Mozzarella Salad and a bottle of house Chianti. This was acceptable except for the price that they were charging we should have had very ripe tomatoes and buffalo mozzarella perhaps with a little basil and some crushed pepper instead of the catering pack quality of the cheese and the crisp tomatoes. Still, we were hungry and ate our starter in anticipation of our main meals - Veal, one with mushroom sauce and the other with a lemon sauce. When they arrived we knew this wasnt going to be good. The small sliver of meat was accompanied by a 70's style stuffed courgette end and a barrel shaped single potato. The whole dish was rendered inedible by the saltiest most disgusting sauces we had honestly ever tasted. My companion couldnt eat hers and so the waiter offered to change it for another plate but it would be hard to change as the sauce was already made up visions of bubbling vats entered our heads. As expected the dish returned exactly as before and impossible to eat. I had hardly touched mine but because I didnt directly complain my plate was taken away and charged for. The whole meal with one main dish not charged for came to 52 euros - a complete rip off and quite frankly an embarassment for a hotel situated in a country and region renowned for its fantastic food. We would have really welcomed a kettle in our room too with tea and coffee sachets. Instead there is a worn-out minibar with hugely overpriced alcoholic and soft drinks. Still the advantage of a bad hotel is that it makes the streets outside more appealing and Florence doesnt disappoint. We headed for the Piazza del Republica to Paszkowskis for Irish Coffee and Profiteroles which was delicious and included live music in addition to Enzo our young waiter who was lovely.Later back to the hotel and that night we may as well have slept on the steps of the Duomo, the beds were rock hard with one small pillow per bed. There appeared to be no heating so at night it was very cold, however, at this stage we were grateful just for the clean linen. The towels in the bathroom were plentiful but some had holes in and looked quite thin and threadbare. Our face cloths were not replaced after the first night either.Next morning and breakfast ho hum! Breakfast runs from 7am till 10am which is good for those that like to lay in but I would recommend that you get there as early as possible so that the bread rolls havent become so hard that they will chip your teeth and the bacon so crisp that you think you have eaten biltong! Fair enough there is a wide selection but everything is very school meal like and you wonder for how many weeks the same cereal has been brought out in those horrible servers. I recommend fruit juice, the tinned fruit, the fresh fruit and the pastries as the safest things to consume, however be aware that the fruit bowl is probably left out overnight as the next morning it looked just as it had been left and had not been topped up with more fruit. The tea and coffee was appalling - stewed and served with revolting UHT milk not fresh. The room we ate in was directly away from the main dining area and adjacent to the kitchens very dull and drab. You gained the impression each morning that you were just an inconvenience. As the days went on the staff appeared to have just lost the will to live with only the poor room maids able to muster a strained buongiorno. On the whole I would not recommend this hotel at all. The only good things about staying here was the central location and the incredible flush of the toilet! The overall cost of our stay at this hotel for three nights was 拢445.00 and now I wish I had stayed at a smaller more friendly family run hotel perhaps nearer to the River Arno. Make sure you take comftable walking shoes to Florence. Everything is within walking distance but there is so much to see and some queuing and the expensive taxis are not worth using. So although the area around the Duomo is central it is also busy. It may be worth staying in the areas near Santo Spirito or Palazzo Pitti where there are greener areas and craftsmens studios. Avoid the areas around the station and Piazza Santa Maria Novella and San Lorenzo for accomodation unless you want the full urban culural experience with more hustle and bustle. Try to see the central market near San Lorenzo for a foodie experience and the Museo dell'Opera del Duomo for all those Brunelleschi facts. Although it is more expensive take your drinks outside on the piazzas as it is fun just watching the Florentines go about their daily lives. The name fails me now but there is a lovely little cheap restaurant in the Via Dello Studio a minute from the hotel, just down from Pegnas the grocery shop and towards the Duomo. You can sit outside. We had the most marvellous Proscuitio with melon and Spaghetti Carbonara. Also visit the very small pottery shop off Piazza Della Signoria in Via D'Magazzini opposite a fruit and veg shop selling lovely moscato grapes. Try to go to the toilet before you leave your hotel as public toilets are nonexistent. Our walk around Boboli Gardens was only spoilt by the disgusting conditions of the ladies toilets there.Overall Florence is an amazing city with so much to see but if you stay for more than 3 days try to arrange to see some more of Tuscany. We found most Florentine people friendly especially so the waiters in the cafes and restaurants who are very polite, friendly and professional even in places where the service charge was included. They appreciate you trying to speak Italian and dont come over all impatient when you flounder. We tipped them all because despite the long hours they work and they fact that this was the end of the busy season they were still exceptional.

<Content>Good, bad and overrated This hotel is used by our tour we were on and we stayed there 3 nights last week. The location is excellent, the beds are comfortable, showers, toilets are fine and they have a bowl of jelly candies in the lobby. Otherwise, it was the worst hotel that we stayed at on our 6 city tour. We learned from our fantastic tour director (he was truely fab), that due to the size of our group (42) there are not many hotels in Florence so well located that have meeting or dining rooms large enough to accommodate the group size, so they get stuck with this dump. There are plenty of other decent small hotels in Florence to stay. Also, Florence is small, so even if a hotel seems far from the sights, it can't be more than a 10 or 15 minute walk. Besides, the main tourist attraction is the big church and the Ponte Vecchio and they both attract tourists like a dropped popsicle attracts ants on a hot summer day. Many people on our tour complained about the noisy rooms (trash trucks and people in the street) and got lost trying to find them. The rooms are of decent size, but they seem a bit untidy. The food in the hotel that was included in the tour was HORRIBLE, yet the restaurant management exhibited such arrogance. They have the nerve to prepare dishes with canned pitted olives and use excessive salt. The coffee is plain awful and that includes the espresso, latte etc. The captain thinks that Americans prefer Folgers coffee and claims to make it for himself (doesn't he know that at least some Americans recognize the taste and quality of Stabucks? Not all of us think fast food is good). The buffet eggs were always runny the pastries were over baked, stale or just crap. If you want a taste of real Italian food, don't eat at the hotel and don't ask the concierge for suggestions. Go to the residential neighborhoods and eat where the locals do. Just be nice an courteous.The hotel staff was extremely arrogant and either not knowledgeable or just wanting to rip us off. On the first night there we asked the night desk attendee, a woman, where we could buy a large bottle of water. She responded that there was water in the minibar to which we said that we needed a big bottle and asked again if there was a market or shop nearby. She told us that she didn't know of any. The fact is that almost every wine bar, gelateria etc. sells big bottles of water and many are open very late. We don't appreciate being lied to and hustled.

<Content>Hotel Brunelleschi - Not for me thanks !!!! My Husband and I stayed here about 2 weeks ago as part of our Honeymoon trip. It was in the perfect location as its so close to everything but the hotel was in a very poor state. It badly needs some TLC, the rooms were clean but stuck in the 70's decor wise the staff were OK not overly helpful or friendly and we did speak as much italian as we could. When we arrived at 2pm we were told the room would not be ready until 3pm which is totally unacceptable in my book. Then on checking out when asked if we had any problems we reported a very strong smell in the corridor where we stayed and the lady shrugged it off saying it must be the damp weather !The breakfasts were very poor also, one poor guy sweating and running mad trying to sort everyone out, it was a disgrace.We paid a lot of money to stay and did not expect the shabby old room and dated furniture along with the shabby service.I once read here that if a hotel in Italy is called 4 * then expect 3* and well in this case it could not have been more accurate. There are apparently great rooms in the Tower but I guess you need to be totally minted to get one of those !!My advice, choose somewhere else especially if its a romantic setting your after (which we believed it was)

<Content>Average hotel in great location We have just returned from a three night stay at the Brunelleschi in Florence. The hotel is in a fantastic location only minutes away from both Duomo and Uffizi Gallery. The rooftop terrace provides stunning views over Duomo and the Florence skyline, a great place to sit with a glass of wine.The hotel itself was disappointing. The decoration is very dated throughout the hotel and has a distinctly 70's feel. The general appearance of the hotel is shabby and would benefit from some updating. Our room was just big enough to accomodate a bed and one bedside table. Cleaners came in on a daily basis although the small patch of mud left on our carpet for the whole three days was evidence that they didn't bring the hoover with them.The hotel staff were on a whole friendly and helpful, particularly the porters and waiting staff in the breakfast room. One or two of the reception staff were rather abrupt however. All in all, it's in a great location and if you can find a good deal on the tarrif then it's worth booking for the location alone. Anyone paying some of the more expensive rates quoted for this hotel will however be extremely disappointed.

<Content>Very poor service but great location Stayed here for our honeymoon and will say that Florence is a beautiful and historic city well worth a visit. Unfortunately the staff at the hotel were very snooty and rude and the service was at the kind of level I would expect from a 2* hotel (seriously). Breakfast was poor and we had to queue for a table most mornings. However, the location of the hotel was fantastic and the views of the Duomo from the rooftop terrace were breathtaking. I do not recommend this hotel and will not return.

<Content>Honeymoon in Florence Visited Florence for a week in March with my husband for our honeymoon. Florence is a beautiful city, full of culture, fantastic architecture, friendly locals and lots to do. We stayed at the Hotel Brunelleschi and loved it - the hotel is beautiful inside and quite unique. The staff were friendly (although when we spoke Italian, they replied in perfect English!) the service courteous, and when we visited their restaurant twice the food was fabulous. We were a little disappointed that our bedroom was on the small size, but the bathroom was a good size, everywhere was very clean and newly furnished, and a complimentary bottle of champagne arrived for us as soon as we checked in. The location is superb because you're in the centre of the city and within walking distance to everywhere - just pack the earplugs for the bells of the Duomo! Better than an alarm clock!Florence is an expensive city, (as are most cities) and food and drink not cheap - 2 cafe lattes in a cafe in one of the main squares will set you back about 拢7 (english pounds). Our main bit of advice would be to prebook tickets for the Uffizi if you get the chance beforehand - we didn't and queued from quarter to 8 in the morning for 3 1/2 hours before getting in! And this wasn't even peak season!All in all, a wonderful city and a great hotel. Would have no hesitation in recommending the Brunelleschi, and I would suggest any visitor makes the effort to speak Italian because you'll receive a much better service.

<Content>Excellent hotel, superb location - couldn't ask for more! Thoroughly recommend it. We stayed at the Hotel Brunelleschi from the 23rd to 29th March 2005. We were delighted with the whole experience. We booked online direct with the hotel and everything was as booked. We also arranged via 'e'mail with the Concierge for them to book in advance our tickets for the Uffizi and the Accademia, all thoroughly efficiently and charmingly dealt with. We saw from their website that some of the rooms had a splended view of the Duomo and as we were going to Florence to celebrate our 35th wedding anniversary we 'e'mailed the hotel to ask if it would be possible to have a room with a view!. They replied that they would do their best. Well, what a view. We were on the 4th floor with a double aspect and looked out directly towards the Duomo and the Campanile. The room was excellent, with a lovely bathroom. Linen was changed daily, the bed turned down each evening with a chocolate left on each side with a good night note as well. The breakfast was excellent, a large buffet with a comprehensive selection of fresh fruit, cereals, breads cheeses meats etc as well as a hot selection of scrambled eggs and bacon and sausages - the best scrambled eggs we have ever had in a hotel! All in all we were delighted with our stay at the Brunelleschi. The position is perfect. Two minutes walk to the Duomo, it is right in the historic centre of Florence. The staff could not have been more helpful. We would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone - it made our trip to Florence. When you go to Florence make sure you walk down to the Uffizi on fine evenings at about 9 o'clock as a couple called Ken Mercer and Alice Peres play and sing each evening - they are fabulous - they sing Simon  Garfunkel, Eric Clapton, Paul McCartney etc - its free needless to say, they only ask for donations, but buy their CD's too - perfect memories!

<Content>What a location When we booked the hotel we knew it was very close to Florence's renaissance masterpiece cathedral, The Duomo, which also made it very central for walking around the city, but it was not until we opened the shutters to our bedroom window that we realised how close we were. The Campinile and the Dome were in full glorious view. and by walking up a flight of stairs to the hotel's terrace the view rose from glorious to magnificent. The Hotel itself was excellent, the staff courteous and helpful. The decor tasteful without being overboard. Breakfast and dinner were excellent. All laundry was changed daily and an added touch was the chocolates and little note(buono notte) left each evening when the bed was turned down. We would certainly go again.

<Content>Great Location Stayed at the Brunelleschi in late December. The location was terrific, the breakfast hearty, and the rooms large and above average for Italy for the price. Turn two corners and you are in the piazza next to Giotto's campanile. As an american who speaks fluent italian, and a mother of 3, I never go to Italy to sleep in 5 star resort hotels. This hotel could never be compared to the Four Seasons, but, in Florence, it was the perfect place to start and end each day.

<Content>Horrible hotel We spent 3 nights here in September, and it was the worst hotel. We were on our honeymoon and paid a lot of money for this room through our travel agent. The first room they put us in was over a dumpster, and it smelled terrible. We talked to the desk clerk, and they claimed they had no rooms available except the same room, 2 floors up. Ironically the hotel was empty, with better rooms available when we checked at an internet cafe. (which we paid for run of the house, which they would not acknowledge)The carpets where filthy. They cleaning staff put towels down on the floor next to your bed to cover the dirt. The room was so small. You could not walk around the bed, and there was no where to store your bags without tripping over them. The hotel carpets everywhere where worn, and dirty. The location was great, but for the price, I would go to the Savoy Hotel right around the corner. We called our travel agent when we where leaving to let her know the troubles, and she said she was mortified...and apologized for putting us in a hotel for the price we paid. She called our next hotel to guarentee they would honor the Run of the House room policy.

<Content>HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE BEWARE! Beware!!!!We Made a Reservation with this hotel for our trip to Italy in Oct 2004. I Made and cancelled the reservation in the same day. $475 USWe just received our Visa statement and they charged our card for the night. I called immediatley and was told after a very rude conversation with MARIO ANICHINI the manager. He refused to do anything, stating that they do not have any notice of cancelation so we are out of luck.SO PLEASE BEWARE AND DO NOT STAY THERE OR MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ALL YOUR PAPERS AND CORRESPONDENCE.

<Content>Great Hotel We stayed at Hotel Brunelleschie at the end of September and were very happy. The Hotel is located centrally in Florence, within easy walking distance to Musems, Monuments etc.The staff are great, very helpful. The bedroom and ensuites are clean and very generous in size. The maids closed our curtains, turned down our bed and left a chocolate on our pillow every evening with best wishes for a good night.The only annoyance was that our bed is against the wall of the bathroom next door and you got to hear the toilet flushing or the shower running from the other room, but even this annoyance didn't stop us enjoying our stay.

<Content>Great location, not so nice We stayed there like a year ago. Great location, walking distance of everything you want to see (or almosto everything) but...really agree that the hotel need an urgent redecoration. The room was clean, but everything looked really old. the bathroom was large, and all in white marble. the food average, the staff very friendly. the price, fare considering the excellent location. If I go back to Florence maybe I will consider this hotel again only because the location and only if I do not find a better option.

<Content>Great Location but just an okay hotel Stay was: July 2004 - I had very high expectations for this hotel. A lot of my friends suggested we give this hotel a try after spending 13 nights on a cruise ship. But their stays were at least two years ago. Maybe we expected too much. My room was large and the bathroom was spotless. But I had a few problems: The air conditioner worked wonderfully but it was located in the ceiling directly at the headboard. No biggy, really, we slept under the covers. For the price, this hotel is pretty worn. The carpets were filthy. Not dirty but filthy! And the food in their restaurant was horrible. And last but not least the staff was rude. Would absolutely never stay there again. Sometimes you can overlook a hotel in need of a makeover if the staff is at least courteous.

<Content>A Great Hotel This hotel was wonderful. We stayed there for six nights in July. The air conditioning was perfect, the room was clean and the service was perfect. The staff was extremely helpful in procuring reservations for museums and restaurants. It's only a minute's walk from the Duomo and within walking distance of anything you'd want to see in Florence. They even throw in a free breakfast. This is one of the best bargains in hotels in Europe.

<Content>Comfortable and centrally located We visited Florence and stayed in Hotel Brunelleschi. Hotel is very comfortable andcentrally located. It is minutes walk to theDuomo, Uffizi and the Gallerie de Academie.Hotel rooms are clean and nice. Bathroomsare large and comfortable. The hotel hasits own breakfast, which is average. The in-houserestaurant seems ok too. However, if you arejet lagged and want to eat late, try the Yellowbar on via del proconsolo. They were very familyfriendly and were open till midnight.The one thing that could be improved is theattitude of the front desk staff. They coulddo attempt to be a bit more friendly!All said, I would recommend this hotel.
