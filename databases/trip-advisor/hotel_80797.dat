<Content>Boutique hotel with a great location My partner and I stayed there for 3 days over the New Years holiday. The hotel is in a fantastic location, right off Market Street and close to Union Square. We booked a great rate through Orbitz and paid $160 per night. Check-in was fast. The room was fairly basic but clean. It's very similar in style to the W Hotel brand. The bathrooms are a bit dated and could stand to be renovated. Our room was on a lower floor, near the elevators, and did not have much of a view. We would've preferred a better room but I'm sure the low rate we paid had an impact on our placement. The complimentary wi-fi in the rooms is a nice touch. There's no real lobby bar (or even much of a lobby) due to its layout. We usally like to have a couple drinks at the hotel we're staying out before we go out to dinner or after a long day of sightseeing.Service at the hotel was great. The staff is younger and very friendly. We checked in on New Year's Eve and the staff suggested walking down to the Embaradero to watch fireworks which was a great idea.We had lunch at the Slanted Door in the Ferry Building and would definitely recommend it. It always has great food and nice atmosphere. There's always a wait there so make reservations if you know you want to eat there.On our last night, the concierge made a reservation for us at North Beach Restaurant and got us a town car service for transportation. Great food and speedy service (maybe even a little too quick if you're looking for a leisurely meal). During the meal, my partner noticed he had misplaced his cell phone, possibly in the car. When we arrived back at the hotel, the doorman asked if we had lost a phone and produced it immediately. Very nice touch!I'd recommend the hotel if you're looking for something that's reasonably priced, in a great location, and has a little bit of style. If I stayed there again, I'd suggest trying to book a better category room, on a higher floor, and with a view of Market Street.

<Content>Aother Wonderful Stay at the Palomar We returned to the Palomar and were not disappointed. The staff are all so welcoming and helpful, particularly the front desk staff. I am noise-sensitive and love the courtyard rooms at the Palomar, where you can stay downtown without having your sleep disturbed. HOWEVER, the Palomar now is pet-friendly so do NOT stay on the 9th floor if noise is an issue. .

<Content>Great stay at Palomar! My partner and I stayed at the Hotel Palomar for a conference at a discounted conference rate. Our room was a quiet, thoughtfully appointed refuge from the crazy and loud streets. The nightly happy hour was an added bonus. The staff was attentive and helpful. I have absolutely no complaints. The work space in our room was comfortable and the big screen TV was a treat. Free wifi was a breeze.The restaurant is pricey, but delicious. The fitness center is very small, but has cardio equipment and free weights. Valet parking is expensive ($42/ day), but comparable to other parking options in the area and includes unlimited in and out.The only problem was that the toilet almost always needed 2 flushes.I would definitely recommend this hotel and look forward to staying here again.

<Content>Excellent stay at the Palomar Recently stayed 5 nights at the Palomar in San Francisco and was extremely pleased with the room quality and most of all the service. Stayed in a King Deluxe Suite which was spacious and practical. Beds are comfortable and the bathrooms are excellent. Hotel needs a few little tweaks (carpets a little dirty, toilet flusher malfunctioned frequently) but the service more than compensates for these few inconveniences. My kids were with me and the Palomar went out of their way to make them comfortable (provided a roll out, had a welcome kit for them including cupcakes and fruit, had a goldfish in the room). Location is also right in the heart of the action. Would not hesitate to stay here again.

<Content>Super hotel, super location After spending endless hours searching online for a *good* price for a long weekend in San Francisco, I came across a short mention of the Hotel Palomar in Travel  Leisure magazine. This is a wonderful hotel in a great location. We had a lovely room, a bit small, but extremely comfortable with all of the amenities....even l'Occitane products in the bathroom. Nice comfy bed with crisp white down duvet.....very much appreciated after cross-country flight, then lots of walking in fun San Francisco. We faced the courtyard so the room was very quiet. Even the hallways, elevators,  public spaces were spotlessly clean  everything smelled so fresh. (After all, it is in a city!) Only negative was the snooty restaurant, but there are lots of dining options nearby....Mel's Diner for breakfast and Annabelle's for late nite dinner. And if you can't find something to eat in foodie heaven (aka San Francisco) there's something wrong with you! The parking was expensive  we agreed that you really don't need a car there. Definitely would return. And the price was the best part......$195 a night. Most city hotels there are double that!

<Content>Great trendy hotel in the heart of SF My husband and I are fans of Kimpton Hotels in general. Their rooms are always designer looking, and hey, who can beat the free wine hour? We enjoyed a beautiful room here for two nights. You can't beat the location. Just blocks from union square, the trolleys, and tons of shopping.The staff was unbelievably cool and helpful.The only advice I'd have is not to get a room on Market Street. There isn't anything the hotel can do about street musicians down below, and we had a whole band out there one day as we were trying to take a nap.

<Content>Lovely Boutique Hotel!! The Palomar is one of our favorite hotels in SF, even though, we live 10 minutes outside of the city. We enjoyed a very lovely, modern and spacious room this past New Years. This is a dog friendly hotel, so our 3 year old goldendoolde looks forward to our stay, as well. In my opinion this is nicest boutique hotel in the area. The location is fantastic with just minutes from all the shopping and central sites. If you're visiting San Francisco, then definitely stay here and make sure to dine at the Fifth Floor (one of the top SF restaurants)- it's fantastic!

<Content>Great stay at the Palomar Stayed here for five nights, excellent food and service. A meal in the resaurant is a must and the breakfasts are good, but expensive. Lovely quiet room at the back, no view to speak of but didn't need it as the hotels central location means that more time is spent outside the room than inside! Could not fault this hotel, a perfect place to start a holiday in California.

<Content>a great spot We got a great deal via Expedia and had a suite up on the 9th floor. The rooms were lovely and spacious and the bathroom (especially the bath/tub) was really nice.Minutes away from all the shopping and central sites we will definitely stay here again if we find ourselves in San Fran. The staff at the desk were always pleasant and helpful and advised us on tours and helped with the bookings, and the doorman always had a smile and greeted you like an old friend.

<Content>Nice Hotel, Good Location My partner and I stayed at the Palomar over a long weekend while visiting friends in SF. I had never stayed there before, but knew of the hotel from previously living in SF. I received a great package deal price that included parking. (Booked through Kimpton's website directly.) For the level of hotel, it was the least expensive parking package I could find at comparable hotels in the city. It was a good deal.The staff was very friendly, helpful, and the accommodations very nice. I would recommend this hotel. Be sure to request a high floor, because of street noise. We were on the 8th floor and this was not an issue. The staff at checkout had some issues with our bill and charged an incorrect amount. Be sure to check your bill. However, this was just a mistake by a new staff person. It happens. Given the price and location, I would stay here again and recommend the Palomar. You have easy access to MUNI, BART, and Union Square.

<Content>NOT IMPROVING I booked 3 rooms for our party of five adults, and we checked-in on July 26.My partner and I had already been staying here 2 years ago, and had been monitoring the website for some packages, which eventually showed, with more realistic value than the rack rates.Check-in was smooth, for all of us.Rooms : we felt that they had been upgraded, and were somewhat larger than we remembered. Bathrooms are small, like very small. They provide scrace L'Occitane shampoo and soap. Strangely, shower gel is NOT available. As I asked, I learnt that they did not have shower gel.Bar is a joke. The restaurant is turned into a bar, and you sit around tables.Breakfast is not very good and pricey.Concierge is more like students, whereas 2 years ago they turned up with really good suggestions. They have no SF insights. One morning, I asked for the best steakhouse in town. Back in the evening, no news, so I called, and they had obviously forgotten all about my request. After a while, they gave me an adress, where I had absolutely no reservation whatsoever. Harris' on Van Ness dealt with the issue in the most professionnal way. Another request was met with blank stares.Valet parking is still available. They do not bring your car up any more. You must go down to the garage, and wait for the guy to bring your car. Sometime the attendant is there. Sometime he is not, and you must call the font desk to get the attendant. Most inconvenient.It is still very conveniently located, and we like the room. Other than that, well, look for packages !

<Content>Would stay here again! I enjoyed staying at the Hotel Palomar, and thought the location was great for the touristy part of SF. Half a block to the BART and Muni, which made travel to other neighborhoods and the airport easy, and short walk to Union Sqaure, Yerba Buena gardens, lots of shopping, etc. Staff at check-in were helpful, and the room was nicely decorated, very clean, and quiet as it was on the top floor overlooking the courtyard. Bathroom was nice, though the sliding door was a little weird (as opposed to a normal door leading to a bathroom), and I LOVED the l'Occitane bath products. As others have mentioned, it's a nice touch to have the wine tasting daily from 5-6, though we also never made it because we were out all day. I really enjoyed the Palomar, and would definitely stay there again if I got a decent rate.

<Content>Hotel Palomar - Absolutely Awesome! We stayed here for a short weekend trip, and would definately stay here again for a longer trip next time. It was our first time staying at the Hotel Palomar or at any Kimpton Hotel. We decided on this hotel because it was pet friendly and we had our two dogs with us for the weekend. We booked our room through the hotel's reservations directly because they were able to give us a better deal than all the other travel websites. Would highly recommend that you contact the hotel and see what their best available prices are before you book your rooms via Expedia or Orbitz, etc. The minute we pulled up to the front, we were instantly greeted and helped out. They also greeted our puppies which made us felt very welcomed. When we were checking in, the people at the front desk even gave our pups doggie treats. We had heard great things of a Thai restaurant but we couldn't remember the name exactly so we asked the gentlemen that was helping us with the check-in. He instantly looked up the name of the restaurant for us, and even helped us make reservations for the night! The location of the hotel makes going everywhere super convenient too....it's right in the heart of downtown, Union Square. We had a car with us so we had it valeted for the weekend. The hotel parks the car in their indoor parking lot located downstairs of the hotel, which is great because we didn't have to worry about the car being in an outdoor lot. Oh, and did I mention the complimentary wine hour!?!! The hotel hosts a complimentary wine hour where they introduce a red wine and white wine for their guests to try! Our overall experience was just absolutely awesome. The hotel is super accommodating, the staff were all very professional, and friendly. LOVED IT! Highly recommend it, hands down.

<Content>Wonderful! I love Kimpton properties in general - Stayed here for business. Walking distance to the convention center. Nice updated rooms... flat screen tv.Great service - from the bellmen to the front desk. Had some slow service for breakfast but the waitress was very nice about it.. I actuall fell in the middle of the restaurant and no one came to see if i was ok - but that's ok since it was embarassing.I would stay here again.

<Content>Wear your winter woolies in the dining room This hotel is in a great location but as several reviewers have stated the rooms are very small. The big problem we had here was the michelin star restaurant, located on the 5th floor. The food was lovely but our table was situated near the air conditioning vent and it was absolutely freezing. Three times we asked for the air conditioning to be turned down before the manager eventually came to our table and told us they were aware of the problem but they were unable to do anything about it. I pointed out to him that three people in the table behind us were actually wearing their jackets and he agreed it was not a satisfactory situation. Our tea and coffee was on the house but considering we had paid $500 for the meal I felt this the least that could have been done.

<Content>Lovely - Great value - Some communication issues Great rate on Travelzoo.com - $139.00 for two doubles. Nick-Dal thought room was small, but perhaps has never stayed in a NYC 85 sf shoebox boutique hotel for $350 ... our Palomar room was HUGE! Well appointed, comfortable (except for the pillows; I dislike down, and the foam pillows that were brought up were hard as rocks). Staff was very friendly, but it took forever for them to bring our bags to the room. (Three calls to the desk and one personal trip to look for them; apparently there was one bellman on duty and couldn't deal with several people checking in at once ... we were late for an appointment because of that. When he finally did deliver the bags he said there would be a bottle of wine delivered to our room for our trouble, but the wine never materialized.) Towels were not changed daily, which didn't bother me, but it did bother my travel companion (there was no note in the bathroom indicating that towels would not be changed, as I've seen in other hotels). Didn't eat in the hotel restaurant, so can't comment on that. Annabelle's Bistro just down the block had one of the best Ceasar Salads that I've ever tasted. Hotel offers a free wine tasting daily from 5-6, which is a lovely idea, but we were out sightseeing all day, and never in our hotel at that hour. Would have been a nice end to the day at 9 pm or so. Overall, good experience at the Palomar. Very clean, comfortable, friendly and quiet.

<Content>No closet, no service On busy Market Street, the hotel sits above an Old Navy retail store. The layout is a little odd with the main hotel starting on the 5th floor. The restaurant and bar offer very limited hours, and otherwise are dead space off the elevator. The room was on the small side as expected in San Francisco. But for the price I did not expect no closet (no hooks, no rod, no alcove, nothing ... NO closet). Service was non existant. Our request for towels not only resulted in no towels, but resulted in an unpleasant attitude from the front desk staff. I travel a great deal for work and spend about 200 nights a year in hotels. This was by far the worst ever.

<Content>Excellent Hotel and Location This Hotel is situated at the perfect location right in the heart of downtown San Francisco. You are 2 blocks to Union Square, 1/2 a block to BART, 6 blocks to China Town, 2 blocks to the famous Cable Cars.The hotel is decorated nicely, very clean and the service is quick and efficient. Our check in took about 2 minutes and we were upgraded to a huge room overlooking market street. We were concerned about the street noise, but it was very quiet and a great place to people watch out the windows.The room had a large, King bed with bench in front, a seating area with table to the side and another seating area by the bedside. It had a huge flatscreen tv on the wall with DVD player and pay movies. It also had HBO.The bathroom was very spacious with lots of granite counter space and was very clean. There was a large closet in the room with ironing board and plenty of storage.We used the fitness room in the hotel, which was very small and a bit crowded when 2 other people came into it. It was convenient though, because most hotels in the area make you go to outside locations to excercise, which is really a hassle.My only small complaint was the lack of comfort from the pillows. They were very soft and mushy and made sleeping a bit difficult. After mentioning this in an online survey from Kimpton Hotels, the manager replied right away and apologized for the pillows and said to contact him next time I was coming to town and he'd upgrade my room. I thought that was excellent service.

<Content>Not Bad The hotel was very nicely decorated but the rooms were very small and didn't have a dresser. We stayed four nights/five days which made having only a closet with a few hangers very impractical. The bathroom door did not close all the way. The bed was very uncomfortable. The staff was pretty friendly, but they didn't have directions to commonly requested places such as Sausalito or Monterey readily available (and the directions they did give us were terrible).Good location in Union Square.

<Content>Great Location The location is excellent. Had a room overlooking Market St, 8th floor, and it was a little noisy at night, specially ambulances/police in the middle of the night. The rooms are small. Would I stay again in it, maybe. The best thing of this hotel is it's location, the worst, the rooms should be a tad bigger and better window insulation. The service was excellent overall. Have been in SF many times all over the city and this is one of the better hotels we've stayed in.

<Content>Good, Not Great This hotels location is great and within walking distance to everything. You are right next to Union Square, China Town, and about a 15 min walk to the Embarcadero. The hotel rooms are small but nice. So if you are looking for lots of space, look else where. The room has a desk, bed, flat screen t.v. and an updated bathroom. I did not use the restaurant, or fitness center so I can not comment on those. There was free wireless internet, which was a great perk. I slept well and did not hear any street noise. I would stay here again if I was in the area. Of of course I was here for business and received a rate of $199/night, which was less than half of what they normally charge. But I think $400 is the going rate for 4 stars in the area.

<Content>Outstanding in Every Way By far, the most pleasing stay I've had in any hotel. The Hotel Palomar is a gem in the heart of San Francisco's downtown district, boasting a level of service that blew us away. They took care of our every need, even printing out our airline boarding passes for us upon our check-out. The hotel is spotless, and the Fifth Floor restaurant was an excellent choice for breakfast. Truly, it's hard to come up with superlatives that adequately express how impressed I am with the Palomar. I'll definitely be seeking out other Kimpton hotels in the future.

<Content>Super Spot I stayed here for 5 nights on business. The location was absolutely superb. I took the BART in from the airport and it was barely 5 mins walk which is easy these days with with suitcase you can pull behind you. I also took the BART back when i left. Its so easy and just $5. The room was furnished in traditional old style but was warm and welcoming. There was plenty of space and a good desk which was important for me. The internet access was excellent and free. The bathroom was a little dated but it worked fine and the L'occitane products never fail to help.They didn't have tea making facilities and it took 3 goes to get a kettle up to the room. I guess my Spanish is useless. Other than that the room was great. No noise to speak of even though its in a busy location. The breakfast was in a meeting room as they were refurbishing the main hotel restaurant and bar which was a shame. it was average but they had fresh fruit which is always great. The staff were friendly and helpful and the hotel had a general impression of being tailored for business/tourists. The location was great for getting around. The Apple store was just across the road and Union Square a stones throw. I didn't have any room service but there is a great little french bistro 5 doors down on the right which i recommend highly. i ate there twice on my own and really enjoyed the food. also another block down on the right is a good cafe serving breakfast and nice juices for a quick start.I'd stay there again as was good value, good location and overall a tidy place.

<Content>Just o.k. We are frequent guests of Kimptom hotels. We were a little disappointed in this one. I guess we are spoiled because this was the first one which did not upgrade our room. Perhaps there was no availability. The room was fine but we had requested a quiet room on a higher floor. We got a room next to the ice machine on a lower floor. Unfortunately, we did not notice the ice maker until we were unpacked and too tired to move. That was a big mistake because there was a party down the hall at 10 p.m. and there were many visits to the ice machine! Since we belong to their club, we were greatly disappointed and will not stay at this Kimpton again.I have to give Lauren at the front desk kudos, though. She went out of her way to make last-minute dinner reservations for us.

<Content>wonderful stay! I highly recommend the Hotel Palomar! Four girlfriends and I stayed there last weekend and it was a great experience from beginning to end - nice atmosphere, convenient location, and friendly and helpful employees, especially Kevin the bellhop, Lauren at the front desk, and the concierge (sorry I forgot his name, but he was the one working on May 30-31) We had dinner at Lark Creek Steak (which I also highly recommend) and watched a movie at the Century Theaters which are both inside the San Francisco Centre just around the corner, but the hotel is also a good base for visiting many other sights in the city and has easy access to public transportation like Muni and BART. I definitely plan to return someday!

<Content>Great hotel - excellent location We only stayed one night and we had got a great deal through expedia. We had booked one of the inward facing rooms as we wanted to be sure of a quiet room but on reaching the room we found we had been put into a disabled room which actually overlooked the Apple store. We returned to reception and we were moved without any issues to a room on floor 8 which overlooked the zen garden.The room was lovely - we did have robes hanging in the wardrobe as well as some underwear that you could buy (which I thought was a bit odd). We appreciated the free glass of wine in reception and although the check out time was 12noon, we asked for a later 1pm check-out and this was no problem at all.I was very impressed with this hotel - the location, price and comfort of the room certainly made it the best we have stayed at during any of our trips to San Francisco.

<Content>Great hotel I booked this hotel on a special rate I found at Travelzoo. It was $139/night. It was a great hotel. The room was small but it had all the comforts, great bed, LCD TV, L'Occitane products. I have stayed at the Kimpton in Cambridge MA and had a great stay there as well. Kimptons are great and you can usually find good deals. Have a drink at the Marriott View Lounge across the street from the Hotel Palomar for a great view of San Francisco.

<Content>Outstanding-Loved Hotel Palomar Stayed at the Palomar from May 21-May 25, 2008. Everything was wonderful. Hotel staff goes out of their way to make you feel comfortable. Our room was an executive king on the 9th floor; which was a comfortable size. The property was always quiet, thus making it ideal for uninterupted slumber. Every evening we returned to find our bed turned down and soft jazz playing on the radio. This made for a great prelude to winding down from a busy day sightseeing. As a previous guest stated...the hotel left nothing to be desired. Would most definately stay at the Palomar again. Kimpton Hotels are just FABULOUS!

<Content>Excellent location and great value for money We had two separate stays at the Palomar at the start and end of our holiday, and both were great. The standard rooms are adequatetly sized and there is nothing missing. The location is excellent, the staff are helpful and we couldn't have asked for anymore. It was the most reasonably priced 5* hotel at the time and I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Location and Service Impeccable I stayed here for a convention that was held a few blocks away and was blown away at how incredibly perfect everything was. The price was super reasonable. The service was perfect. The accommodations and amenities left nothing more to be desired (except maybe an indoor pool but not a big deal in my opinion). Not to mention the location was in the dead heart of everything and walking distance to the convention center. I will stay nowhere else when staying downtown SF than the Palomar.

<Content>Just okay We stayed for two nights in the basic, King delux. We paid $233 per night excluding taxes and parking, which ultimately put us at $300 per night. The rooms were fine, except for the tiny bathrooms that had you brushing up against the toilet to enter the tub. The biggest complaints I have are that continental breakfast isn't included and the lobby is so small that their wine tasting from 5-6 lacks any type of atmosphere to make it worth the while. If you could get a much cheaper room than what we paid, it's probably worth it. But at this price, skip it.

<Content>Excellent choice I had to come to San Francisco for a conference at the Marriott downtown. Because I prefer to stay in smaller hotels, I booked the Palomar which is right across the street from the Marriott. I couldn't have been happier with the experience. The staff was welcoming and very helpful, the room was spacious and comfortable. My first night they sent a plate of fresh fruit to my room. And the price was only $10 more than what I would have paid at the Marriott. The hotel is just two blocks from the SF MOMA and at a public transportation nexus (BART, tram, cable cars).My only complaint is that eating in the hotel is quite expensive ($6 Rice Crispies). So I ate out the entire time. For cheap eats to go, I recommend the Alexandria Cafe or the Coffee Bean around the corner one way on Market. Or the Westfield Mall food court around the corner on Market the other way. It sounds cheesy to eat in a mall food court, but this is a very upscale mall and the food was excellent and a full meal could be had for around $10. The King of Thai Noodles on the opposite side of the block from the hotel is also excellent and reasonably priced.I will stay here every time I come to San Francisco from now on.

<Content>Amazing Hotel!!! This was an amazing hotel!!. It was located in the heart of everything. You were a block and half away from the cable car pick up; you were on the corner of all the shops including Walgreen鈥檚. The visitors鈥?center was about two blocks away, and I know I was worried about parking but there was a parking structure around the block which was safe and secure and it costs $30 for 24 hours, which was a great deal compared to everywhere else.Now the hotel..... Amazing, beautiful, and very comfortable. We had a free upgrade to an executive suite which was great. The staff was super friendly. You order towels; housekeeping would be there in 3 minutes. You also have a dvd\cd player in the room which was very convenient if you want to lie back in your room and watch your favorite movie. I am a very clean guy and I got to tell you this room was super clean. The bed was very comfortable and soft. Overall this was an excellent hotel. A++++

<Content>Wonderful stay We stayed at the Hotel Palomar, with our two dogs, for one week. The hotel is decorated in an art deco style with modern touches. It isn't fancy or super luxurious, but it is very stylish and nicely appointed.The best part of our stay here and why we choose Kimpton Hotels when possible is because of the staff. Kimpton has the best trained, most friendly and accomodating staff with service on par or better than the some of the finest hotels in the world. From the doormen, valets, housekeepers to the check-in staff, everyone was incredibly gracious. My sister pre-arranged a transfer to the Mark Hopkins Intercontinental Hotel (we were in town for a family wedding there) and she said they wished they could move back to The Palomar.My only complaint was that getting to the hotel through the traffic and huge throngs of pedestrians made our ingress and egress challenging, however, the hotel is located in a very popular, vibrant location, so I guess it should be expected. Also, my sister had an interior room and I would suggest requesting an exterior room so you have a view.

<Content>Kimpton Hotels ROCK! I tend to stay alot in San Francisco. The Palomar is by far a better hotel than I would have thought. I thought, oh a knock off of the W. This hotel exceeds the W. The service was impecable. Anything we needed, we called for and it was in our room within minutes. The location is fantastic! Right there by Union Square and what amazed me was the while you are right there, you can not hear the noise from below. It is worth the money to stay at this property!

<Content>pleasant stay! unfortunately chosen a wrong rainy season to visit, the the hotel staff and the location are some of the things to make my trip wonderful.having said that, on the other side is that we have enjoyed sf with less tourist, it's like the whole city is yours.me and my partner absolutely loved the decor of the hotel, it's simple, modern, and mostly, very clean; we were upgraded right away to the exec. floor; that is true, sf is such a small city, and it does not matter where you stay; the hotel is in the heart of downtown, union sq. is also all surrounded by christmas display, the hotel is actually facing a quieter street, so it is in the center of the city, yet it is actually very quiet.do not hesitate to ask the wonderful hotel staff regarding any questions, and luckily they are all also with great taste to tell you where is the hottest spot in town.few suggestions: def do the alcatraz night tour, we were all surprised with the spooky atmosphere at night, they also provide partially free guided tour; strongly recommended reservation for all the great restaurant, i mean book them before the trip; the hayes street, the best place to eat, shop, and ppl watching, ignore union street, dated shops but great place to find food; the wonderful food court in westfield mall, yes, a food court, and it is a 5 star hotel like food court where you can find all types of food. again, sf is a small city, do not plan to do one section (i.e. ashbury, soma) in one day, you can easily finish few of them all together, so def plan an escape or two during the trip, either wine tasting or muir woods, they are actually fun!

<Content>Needs an overhaul, but still a pleasant place to stay The Palomar brand is now popping up all across the country; my first experience was with the exceedingly glamorous Palomar in Washington, DC. Last year I booked a room at the Palomar in San Francisco and have since made it my preferred hotel in that city.The SF Palomar is NOT glamorous. It may have been when it first opened but it is now definitely showing its age. The decor is firmly rooted in a mid-1990's aesthetic. Nonetheless, it is well maintained and I still find the lobby (except for the battered sofa) and elevator vestibules to be quite attractive. The rooms could use an update. They are very comfortable but definitely bland. The cream-colored walls really wash-out the rooms and no amount of brightly colored accessories can alleviate the drabness.And that's pretty much the only negative I have for the place. The rooms may be dull in decor--and a bit too snug at times--but the comfort factor is high. The beds and linen encourages one to sleep-in on rainy San Francisco mornings. The bathrooms are non-descript, but they work and I've always had plenty of hot water when I needed it. Housekeeping is gracious (Marina leaves me cute notes) and very efficient. The picture windows in the rooms facing Market Street are well insulated against the noise generated by the pandemonium below. However, those who are particularly sensitive to outside noise may prefer one of the inside rooms; they have an almost tomb-like quality.The location is great. The Pal is right on the corner of Market and 4th, just a very short walk away from the epicenter of the best shopping on the west coast. If you're lucky, you'll get one of the precious few outside rooms. The windows are huge and it's fun watching all the scurrying below; society ladies with Armani bags, protesters, backpackers, Buddhist monks, guys in drag, street performers, investment bankers, and seemingly every other example of humanity all collide together right outside the hotel. Another big plus is that the Powell Street MUNI/BART station is right around the corner from the Palomar's entrance. The Pal is great for museum junkies (like me); the spectacular DeYoung is a MUNI ride away and the Museum of Modern Art is just a ten minute walk from the Pal's doors. The Palomar has an interesting advantage in that it's located next door to the Westfield Mall. During my first few visits to the hotel, the staff would direct me to the Westfield's food court when I asked where I could get a quick bite to eat. I initially scoffed at the idea of getting a meal at a food court but this is no ordinary food court. The Korean BBQ joint is quick, cheap, and so very delicious. Corriander, right next to it, has wonderful Thai food at bargain prices. I truly enjoy grabbing a meal at the Westfield food court and bringing it back to my room to watch a movie (the rooms at the Palomar are equipped with DVD players.) One time I asked one of the front desk people (I shall not name the person) about room service; the person just shook his head and mouthed the words You don't want to do that. That pretty well sums up the quality of the Palomar's room service. The Pal has a very formal restaurant called the Fifth Floor. It's very good but for a truly awesome meal in an achingly romantic setting ask Stephen, the concierge, to get you reservations at Chez Spencer.Which brings me to the Palomar's most shining asset: the staff. These people are no corporate drones; they are charming, wacky, funny, and vibrant. They are also very competant at what they do. I'm away from home quite a bit and almost always travel by myself; it is such a luxury to walk into a hotel and be welcomed back as an old friend. Overall, if you want up-to-date style go to the W. If you need pampered luxury--and are willing to pay dearly for it--go to the Mandarin Oriental. The Palomar is for those who place comfort above trendy luxury and who appreciate a warm, welcoming staff. And the Pal's location just cannot be beat if you're in SF for shopping, clubbing and/or museum hopping.

<Content>nice but generally underwhelmed A great location. A relatively nice place, and hip... in a kinda tired mid-90s way. There were a few too many problems (clogged drain, broken room phone) that went unfixed despite my polite requsts to fix them. The desk people didn't seem to care about the problems despite my requests to fix them. Parking is really expensive, but it's the norm in Union Square.

<Content>overrated I stayed at the palomar end of october. I was in San Francisco for a conference at the Moscone convention center. While the hotel is very clean, the bedding sheets very soft, the hotel certainly does not deserve the 300 $ I was paying for per night. The rooms were small, breakfast available for almost 20$. I stayed for one night a the donatello hotel in union square for 1/2 the price and breakfast was included. Rooms larger, service was excellent.So unless you obtain a cheaper rate and you have a conference at the Moscone convention center, there are definitely better choices.On the plus side, the staff was very helpful and professional. One of the ladies working at the desk ( Flavia) even contacted me on my cell phone to confirm a restaurant reservation!As for restaurants, huge choice . Nevertheless do not go to Zuni Cafe! Minimal choice of food ( 3 appetizers, 3 entrees), located in a bad area of town. I do not know what all the fuss was about. Try 1930 shangai for chinese food. Excellent

<Content>Do Not Stay in the Smoking Rooms at this hotel I am sitting in my second room of the night, after the putrid stench of nestled in tobacco kept me up and coughing for most of the early morning hours. It is 6 AM, I am unable to sleep for my big presentations tomorrow and have generally had to worst experience as a business traveler in a hotel in years (this is for someone who spends 12 weeks a year away from home on travel)Let's see where to start with my list of issues:1) sealed shut smoking rooms, with no fresh air, making you feel like a lab rat in a Anti-smoking campaign commercial.2) When I asked for an ionizer (After a suggestion by a hotel employee upon my second statement of dissatisfaction with the smoke in the room) or something to freshen the air, I was promised one. When I returned from dinner, what i found was someone had haphazardly sprayed the room with air freshner trying to mask the smell, instead creating a second layer of irritants. 3) when at 5 AM i stumbled down with blood shot eyes and obvious agitation at the rotten state of affairs at the palomar and begged the front desk for a second room so that i could just get at least 2-3 hours of sleep before a full day of meetings, I was granted this request (upon my 3rd attempt) finally but told that I had to pack my bags in the middle of the night and move rooms immediately. Let me tell you nothing like packing your bags at the crack of dawn with half sleepy head to make you really appreciate coming back to a place.Needless to say, i just booked my reservations for a second hotel for my second night and will check out of here first thing in the morning.The non-smoking room is not half-bad and perhaps what salvages the one star for this review....but if you even dare to think of yourself as a smoker, stay far far away from this hotel.

<Content>Very good hotel I stayed in the hotel for 8 days. I selected this hotel because of the good reviews. I was especially looking for a quiet hotel, as I'm not a good sleeper, and I was not disappointed. I got a room on the 8th floor, at the 4th Street side; I didn't hear any noise! And the bed was very comfortable. The room was quite spacious, and very clean. The staff at the front desk were very friendly. The location is very good, close to the shopping area, Moscone Center and BART Powell station. My only complaint is about the lobby, which is small and cold. I didn't have dinner at the restaurant. The breakfast was okay, but I prefer a self-service breakfast.C.K. Jansen, The Netherlands

<Content>Nice Hotel As a member of the Kimpton Group's frequent club (or whatever they call it) Hotel Palomar was a no brainer when my mom and I decided to visit San Fran.Like the other Kimpton hotels, Palomar is very modern and I love the decor. Our room and bathroom was smaller than what we would normally expect, but maybe that has something to do with the location.I ordered a $12 sandwich off of the room service menu and the charge to our room was almost $30, I guess with all of the fees and everything. I find that to be ridiculous and the sandwich wasn't even that good!Overall we had a pleasant stay and liked the location.

<Content>Nice boutique hotel My husband and I recently visited San Fran for the first time. We spent two nights at the Palomar. It's a nice, small boutique hotel. The staff was very welcoming upon check-in. Our room was modern and clean. It had a very small shower and a large soaking tub. Nice honor bar and bath products. For us, the location was just so-so. It's VERY near shopping but we would probably stay in Nob Hill next time. The restaurant, Fifth Floor, is very nice and chic. We had breakfast there both days. Great lox and bagels. It's supposed to be great for dinner. My one major complaint about the Palomar is that there wasn't a dedicated concierge on duty. The front desk staff were friendly but weren't able to recommend good restaurants and make compairsons among them for us. Also, there seems to be a taxi shortage in the area so we had problems getting one for dinner. The Palomar lacks the large hotel atmosphere of a lobby bar, music, etc. but we had a very nice stay.

<Content>Nice service and location We stayed here mid week and the service was very good. When I checked in there was no wait and they had free iced tea in the lobby. The hotel is right around the corner from the Westfield/Nordstrom mall and they have a great food court there. We stopped by the bar at the hotel restaurant which is called the Fifth Floor. They were pretty busy and we did not get served quickly. Once we were served the staff was very apologetic and even sent a bottle of wine to our room! The room is very nice and clean and they have these amazing giant tubs. I would definitely stay here again!

<Content>OK hotel, bad neighborhood Hotel comfortable enough though with smallish rooms and tiny bathroom next to bed. My wife and I are city walkers and as a result the Hotel Palomar was a poor choice for us.What to say about Market St and its environs? The local leadership has tried repeatedly to upgrade this dismal area of this beautiful city but the results leave much to be desired. While the hotel's doorman says the area is much improved, we read today that someone was murdered on the streets outside a nightclub a block away just hours after we returned from dinner. Unless you must be near Moscone Center or plan to enter and exit exclusively by car, I would advise staying away from any SF hotel near Market unless you were within a block or two of the Embarcadero.

<Content>Nice Place, Great Location I wouldn't classify this hotel as luxury but it's definitely an excellent choice. The location is fantastic, right near the corner of Fourth and Market so if shopping is your main reason for going to SF, you are going to be right in the thick of it. As a boutique hotel, the lobby is small which is fine with me... if you want to drop of f packages or make a stop up to your room you don't have to meander through a huge lobby, wait for an elevator, etc. The room was small with an interior view (overlooked the escalators in the Old Navy store below) but comfy and the space in the room was utilized very well, loved the bedding and the L'Occitane toiletries. No problems with the shower either... this is a big deal for me... enough hot water and good water pressure. The staff is friendly and professional. There were cold drinks in the lobby throughout the day and they serve coffee there in the a.m. - no coffee maker in the room unless you request one. If you have a car, there is parking under the hotel (really expensive) or you can park around the corner in the Fifth  Mission garage for a bit less (I think it was about $28 a day?). There is a movie theater right across the street (The Metreon) and a Marriott is also across the street. We went up to the 39th floor there at night for a drink and a fabulous view. Great breakfast at Mel's Diner (yes, the one from American Graffiti) around the corner on Mission St. The Palomar has a lounge as well and a restaurant, but unfortunately we didn't get a chance to check either one out. The restaurant had excellent reviews. Our rate at this hotel was about $180 a night which I thought was reasonable. I would stay here again for sure.

<Content>Completely enjoyed our stay Lovely, modern decor in the rooms. Very comfortable bed and bedding. Nice size room for an urban hotel. Bathroom was small and average (but good amenities from L'Occidental). Beautiful restaurant with a very good review from Wine Spectator. Small but high-tech, nice business center. Good location -- walking access to all the bus, trolley, and cable car routes. The staff were helpful some of the time, but the concierge was almost never available. There was not even a concierge on duty at 6pm or 7pm to recommend restaurants. That was frustrating for a Kimpton hotel. We eventually got a restaurant recommendation from the doorman, Matt (who was great!).

<Content>Surperb for business travelers Just returned from a five day business trip to SF. We needed to be close to downtown businesses off Market Street with Govt Rates. Few hotels had availability even several months ago when we booked. It is the height of the tourist season afterall.We chose the Hotel Palomar based on other TripAdvisor reviews. Good choice. We had two rooms--atrium room was very light and quiet. Street rooms are noisy on lower floors; fine above five or six. Atrium room and bath was exceptionally large; other was small and tight with two beds. Handicapped bathroom was without a walk or roll in shower. However, the excess of grab bars made it useable. The staff ARE very attentive. We especially enjoyed and visited with the Head Bell Man, the doormen and the security men on in the evenings. Because we were there a full week they got to know us, and our comings and goings. They made the best suggestions. Concierge service was adequate, but not very experienced or with first hand knowledge. Often they relied on reports or questions from prior guests all stored in the hotel computer. They did suggest a 12 person van tour of the wine country for us that I also recommend--Pacific Tours. Although the hotel was short-staffed in housekeeping, what ever we asked for at the front desk was promptly received or corrected--too few bath towels for two, more soap, change the hypoallergic pillows, etc. Yes the low flush toilets are noisy...they all are. Yes the lobby is minimal--but there is a lovely quiet sitting area on the fifth floor which we used nightly for business meetings. We could even have a drink or order soup or lite fare during our meetings. My mom sat out there with a friend one day while the room was being made up. Yes, the restaurant is pricey. But it is totally in line with any other top flight restaurant in SF. It is rated THE BEST French restaurant in the city. Nearby is Annabelle's which is reasonable and the food is very good. Note Annabelle's has a restaurant and a bar menu that are totally different. Also nearby in the Westfield Mall is a food court with all types of ethnic and uncommon fare at low or more typical SF prices. In the mornings we used the hotel car service to go to our work location. Ideal with our brief cases and computers, we went door to door at low cost and maximum convenience. That should be arranged with the door man in advance. The service is first come first serve on weekdays. Our rooms were exceptionally clean, comfortable, and the location cannot be beat. It is about two blocks from Moscone Center too. I recommend the Palomar to every moderate priced business traveller. They had free wi-fi too.

<Content>Great Location We stayed at the Hotel Palomar after a few days in Healdsburg. Even though the hotel is not in the quaintest or funkiest area of town, I must say that we were very happy with the location. The building is connected to a shopping mall with a fabulous food court for a quick bite. There is a movie theater across the street  all public transportation, etc is either outside your door or a few steps away. We still were able to access all areas of SF easily  meet up with friends for dinners, etc in a few minutes. Check-in was a breeze. All the staff were exceptionally friendly. Our room was modern  clean. Very quiet. (8th Floor) The bathroom was quite small, but sufficient for the 2 days. The housekeeping service was great. We didn't use the gym, business center or dine at the restaurant. We did, however,have great meals at Zuni Cafe  The Slanted Door. All in all, we were very please with our stay at the Hotel Palomar.

<Content>Palomar was so comfortable. I recently met my daughters, ages 20  22, in San Francisco for a few days of fun. I picked the Palomar based on TA reviews, and I was very pleased. Our room had 2 full size beds, and was very spacious. The clean, modern design was relaxing. The bathroom was small, but perfectly adequate. We were on the 5th floor and the sitting area near the restaurant was convenient, and felt like our personal lobby. The location was perfect. Near cable cars, trolleys, buses  BART. We were 100 ft from amazing shopping. Yet, our room was perfectly quiet.One small disappointment was the failure to receive the expected newspaper at my door each moring. I always was up early and picked one up at the elevator. The coffee in the lobby was lukewarm, and when it was empty, they would not make another pot. I would recommend requesting a coffee maker for your room  bypass this problem. Last, the concierge never answered his/her phone our entire trip. We just left messages that were never returned. The comfort of the room trumps all else, and I would not hesitate to stay here again.

<Content>Good Hotel near the Moscone Center We recently stayed at the Palomar when I went to the SF Gift Show at the Moscone Center. The location is great! The hotel itself was quite good. The rate was a special show rate of $185 per night and it was worth it. There was a problem worth noting, however.  We checked in late and the desk staff is very casual, a tad unprofessional, I would say. We had a requested a king bed and that was not available , So they said, we can give you a king bed in a suite but it will cost $150 more per night. I was pretty tired so I said okay for tonight. The suite was a real suite, but really nothing special, certainly not worth $150 more. Anyway, the next day we switched to a standard room with a king bed, which was then avaialble. The whole thing was annoying. We had requested the king bed and even confirmed it a few days before.  I am happy to report that when I checked out, the woman at the front desk, immediately deleted the $150 charge as soon as I explained the story. She was a pleasure to deal with and it left me with a really good feeling about the Palomar. Other than that, the room was very nice. The hotel is very clean and the lobby restaurant breakfast is quite good-not cheap, but these sort of places rarely are. But the restaurant is very comfortable and the service is good.The fitness center is merely a treadmill and a stepper or two, so don't expect much. All in all, a good hotel.

<Content>Excellent Hotel Having stayed in San Francisco over half a dozen times in the last 11 months, I am excited when I find a hotel worth praising.As a Kimpton In-Touch member, I was able to book a room with two beds for a very affordable price. As is standard based on my last experience with Kimpton, the room was very well decorated and comfortable. Considerably spacious for a San Francisco hotel. The location is great and the staff is BEYOND friendly and helpful. I also enjoyed the wonderful restaurant Fifth Floor for a special occasion and was not dissapointed. My only very slight complaint is that the bathrooms are a bit small, though not cramped. Other than that, I couldn't be more satisfied with my experience.I plan on staying at Hotel Palomar for my next visit to San Francisco.

<Content>Great-If At the Right Price The Hotel Palomar, a member of the Klimpton Hotel Group, was reputed to be a luxurious representative of this prolific chain. Although the Palomar was very pleasant, I would not call it a luxury hotel.The lobby is quite tiny and guests take one of two small elevators up to their rooms. There are a few chairs in the lobby, and a coffee urn is left out all day for guests use.The rooms were a nice size with pleasant furnishings that were quite understated and calm for a Klimpton hotel. The bathroom was comfortable, but just like the room, nothing I would call luxurious.The staff were quite nice and tried to be helpful, but the Concierge did cop a bit of an attitude when asked about restaurants and bars even though I gave him a twenty dollar tip. I never did ask him to make a reservation for me.The restaurant is one of the most expensive in San Francisco and was rather stiff for this progressive city. The lofty ambiance of the restaurant did not match the pedestrian design of the hotel rooms.The location is excellent if you want to be near SOMA and Union Square. However, if you know San Francisco, the hotel's location on Market Street means that you will encounter the street people that are an integral part of the fabric of this city. (The entrance of the hotel is on Fourth Street)The health club can hardly be called that since it consists of a few pieces of equipment that are right on top of each other. I think my perspiration was spraying everyone in the room!The Hotel Palomar is a very nice hotel, but it is lacking certain elements that would bring it into the luxury reign of hotels.

<Content>WONDERFUL HOTEL!! My husband and I recently spent six nights at the Hotel Palomar. There was an initial problem with the reservation but it was handled promptly, professionally and much to our satisfaction. As with most Kimpton hotels the room was impeccibly clean and nicely appointed. Daily the room was cleaned perfectly, was done very promptly and caused no inconvenience to us. The nightly turn down service is nice. Although our room looked out over Market Street, we heard no noise, nor did we hear other guests inside. The beds were great and the linens are fantastic. Newspapers that were requested were delivered early each morning. As pointed out in previous reviews the lobby is very, very small (about three adults can sit in it). The staff at the desk was very professional, but we did not have any dealings with them except for check-in and check-out. This hotel is a great peaceful escape after running around San Francisco all day. The location is great and the lobby exits on Fourth Street right at a very busy bus stop. We were able to walk to Union Square several times, the Curran Theatre and Yerba Buena Gardens. The BART Powell St station is less than a half a block away. The Westfield Shopping Center is right next door. I am not a shopping-type person but that is a must-see. What a gorgeous mall!!The only negatives we felt were the size of the fitness room (very small with one treadmill and limited weights). I know you can go to another fitness facilty down the street but it is much more convenient when you can use the hotel's fitness center. We missed the nightly wine gatherings that we have enjoyed at other Kimpton hotels. It is so nice to relax with other guests, but the Hotel Palomar does not offer that amenity. The restaurant dinner menu was very different -- not what most people would eat. It is obvious they know this since the dining room is very small and never crowded. We had breakfast there a couple of times and it was very good. We would definitely recommend this hotel for the high quality and great location that it has. Kimpton does a very nice job taking care of their guests in a subtle way.

<Content>Hotel Palomar Best Part of our California Vacation! We selected this property for a 4-day visit to San Francisco because of the reviews at this website. Several local people suggested that www.tripadvisor.com was the most relevent place to read valid reviews from people used to traveling to this city. The hotel was even better than any review that I saw...my first interaction was with the hotel's front desk staff when I needed a local pharmacy prior to arrival for an unexpected medical problem with one of my teenage children. They were exceptionally helpful and also confirmed that we would have adjoining rooms when we arrived that evening. The valet parking was convenient, the concierge staff always gave us good advice, and even the valet staff was great with getting us around on public transportation. Rooms were unexpectedly upscale, stylish, and comfortable. Maid service mirrored what we found in the rest of the staff. The parent company must do a great job emphazing customer service because it was outstanding everywhere. There was a good French Bistro next door (Annabelle's) that we used twice after long days around the city, and closer to Union Square were many other excellent places for casual and more upscale dining. I travel to NYC 3 weeks a month for work and wish that there was anything like this property there!

<Content>Great location We stayed at the Palomar after researching many many hotels. My husband had a conference at the Hotel Nikko. Palomar is in a great location and we easily navigated the city by foot. Buy the day pass at Wallgreens, it is the best value. We upgraded to the room w/the kabuki tub...don't waste your money. The room overall was a good size and nicely appointed, however, the shower was the smallest I have ever been in and the bathrooms need to be remodeled, they look VERY dated and were not on par w/the price. Staff is friendly, workout facility fine for 1 or 2 people. Overall decent hotel.

<Content>Fabulous place San Francisco is full of wonderful places to stay. Still, I was so glad I booked here. I picked it for it's proximity to the BART and buses, downtown, shopping, restaurants, museums, it's decor, and it's eco-friendliness. I was dropping off a child at college for the summer and after having stayed at another hotel I also like back in January, The Rex, I thought it would be wise to be closer to the shopping and the school's main buildings. I didn't realize the orientation was not very close to us though, and her dorm was actually closer to The Rex; so oops! But it was no big deal. We grabbed a cab from the hotel to her dorm when it was time for her to move in there. Btw: I never rent a car in SF. Have never needed one there as parking is a nightmare and very expensive. As it turned out, and unbeknowest to me, we were there the same weekend of the Gay Pride Parade. What a hoot! The Parade went right past our hotel and we had a pretty good view of it. However, this wasn't why were in town, so I never did actually go out to see it much. However, my kids did and they loved it! I loved this hotel for it's eco-friendliness, cleanliness, spacious, comfortable, well appointed rooms. The staff was wonderful. Can't say much else though. Never ate in the restaurant as we were doing all the college orientation events and a bit of shopping for the dorm room.

<Content>My favorite hotel in SF Have stayed at the Palomar on numerous occasions and they have always met or exceeded my expectations. The location is great, around the corner from Market Street, with excellent public transportation, both street car and BART right outside the door.Front desk staff are pleasant, check in is friendly and efficient. One time I mentioned I was in town to celebrate my birthday, and about 30 minutes later a bottle of wine and some goodies from the hotel's 4 star restaurant we offered gratis.Love the room, nice amenities, high thread count sheets and free high speed internet.

<Content>Great Location - Average Place We just got back from SF and stayed at the Hotel Palomar for 3 nights (F/S/S). The location of the hotel is very good, near Union Stn and adjacent to Moscone Centre. We checked in late (around midnight) and found the front desk staff to be rather informal and questioned our reservation requirements. Although I had requested an Exec Room we were not provided one, and were given a standard room with feather pillows when my profile says synthetic due to allergies. In the morning asked for a different room. We were provided an Exec Room and the pillows were replaced to meet our request. At 315 sq ft, the Exec Room is small for 2 people, and pretty basis. D茅cor is straight out of Ikea. The hotel itself has no real amenities and the lobby is very small - so small that when we checked out, people crowded into the street out front 鈥?which by the way has street people and a bus stop. There is no bar, coffee area etc. on the main floor lobby level. We would stay again here, but only if the rate was very good as it does not warrant 4 star pricing. We rate this place as 3.5 stars - due to lack of amenities in the hotel itself, inadequate lobby, and lack of attention to details of reservation made. One final note: we stored out luggage for a while on checkout and it took 30 minutes to have it retrieved 鈥?so watch your time.

<Content>Quick and easy travel Stayed here with friends just prior to the 4th and All-Star Game week. This is a wonderful and cute boutique hotel. Easy to get to from Airport on BART (Powell St.) station..Hotel is located next to the Old Navy store...its all connected to Westfield Mall. Walking / transit is at the door. Will stay at this hotel again. Great rates on non-busy event days. Very comfortable. Loved IT!!!

<Content>Stylish in a great location My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Palomar for 3 nights. We loved the stylish decor and the convenient location right near Union Square. The staff at the Palomar was excellent and they made us feel like VIP clients. The room was clean, spacious and had an excellent view of all the hustle and bustle outside the hotel. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to any of our friends or family for a chic stay in San Fran.

<Content>Celebrity treatment at Palomar My husband and I stayed at the Palomar (4th and Market) July 4-8, 2007. We loved it! It is in a perfect location to catch public transit (Bart and Muni) - no need to pay high valet prices for a rental car. Easy to Bart in from the airport as the station is across the street from hotel. All staff were above and beyond - friendly, out going, accomadating and genuinely nice! This is the first time in ages we have stayed at a Hotel where there is nothing untrivial to complain about. The rooms are clean and modern - not too big or overly fancy but perfect for a comfortable place to stay and relax after a long day of sightseeing. Ask for a queit room and they will put you against the hotel's inner courtyard - no view but we heard nothing at all! We recommend Mel's diner (only a block away) for breakfast or a late night snack. Frisson in the (244 Jefferson) FInanical district is the best meal we had in the city. Impeccable service and fab food. Concierge at Palomar will make all your reservations. Limon in the Mission district is also a must - very crowded but food (Peruvian) is to die for.

<Content>Great boutique hotel I stayed at this hotel for a 2-day offsite session for work. The hotel is part of the Kimpton chain, and it upholds the Kimpton reputation of a small, boutique, chic hotel. The room was spacious; the decor was modern and chic. I was extremely impressed with the housekeeping/maid service--they actually CLEANED the room instead of just making the bed. The location is terrific--steps from Market Street, Coffee Bean  Tea Leaf, and the best shopping in SF.Bell staff is friendly and helpful. Oh, they let pets stay at the hotel. If you aren't bothered by the sight of seeing a dog walking down the hallways or in the elevator, then you should be okay.I would stay there again.

<Content>Kimpton's average boutique hotel I am a Kimpton hotel fan and I took advantage that this hotel was only 2 blocks away from the conference I was attending at the Moscone West centre. Unfortunately, there is a bus stop right in front of the hotel.This hotel is a great location for shopping enthusiasts. I would say that the Macy's in Union square is probably the second largest next to New York's Herald Square. The 315 sq ft King/Double Deluxe room is too small for two people. The decor and comfort is slighty above average but really nothing special about this hotel.The valet parking at most of the hotels in this area are the same ($42 per day with in/out privileges).

<Content>Not good for families We were very excited to enter the Hotel Palomar. It's very sleek and in the middle of everything. Upon arrival, they gave us a room across from the Restaurant. They told us it wouldn't be a problem, we wouldn't hear a thing. Tell that to our children who heard the reception going on in the lounge. The other problem is the way the rooms are set up. They're very sleek with great design -- unless you want a dresser, and extra nightstand or a closet large enough to put your clothes. When we asked for a dresser, we were told we'd have to upgrade to a suite for an additional $200+ a night. After a bit, they did offer to put a dresser from storage in our room, but weren't sure it would really fit. In addition, the bathroom didn't have a lock -- which is fine for a couple, but a family of 4, 2 of them being curious boys, that doesn't work. Lastly, the towels. The first night we asked for 2 more sets since we were a family of four. We kept on having to ask for more towels. The request wan't automatically made for us. There is coffee service in the morning -- but no food, unless you want to eat at the VERY formal restaurant. On the up side, the staff was VERY nice and helpful.

<Content>always a pleasure This is at least my third time staying at the Palomar and I enjoy it every time. The location is excellent for the conferences I attend at the nearby Moscone Center, as well as for shopping Union Square or catching the BART or the cable car out of the Powell Street terminus.The staff are invariably friendly and helpful. This includes the reception, cleaning, maintenance, and the doormen.The hotel is clean, well-run, stylish, and very comfortable.If you can get a discount rate, it's also quite a bargain!

<Content>A nice stay Stayed for four nights over Memorial day weekend. The first night we were on the 5th floor and there was quite a bit of noise below us. We never identified what was below us, but it wasn't a guest room. Maybe part of the kitchen? The front desk took care of the problem the next morning.The rooms were spacious and clean. We didn't think the bathrooms were up to 4* standards. Both rooms had a basic tub with a shower curtain. The hotel was in a great spot for shopping, SF Moma and other attractions.The concierge was very helpful and the staff were always very friendly.We enjoyed our stay and would return. If you're not just there for the shopping I would stay over by Pacific Heights. There are quite a few good restaurants and funky shops over there.

<Content>A terrific, stylish shopper's hotel A few years ago I visited San Francisco and I walked by an extra nice hotel and noted the Palomar name. Last month I finally got around to staying there.From SF International Airport to the center of town you can take a cab, a shuttle, a bus or BART. I chose the Bay Area Rapid Transit System (BART) as my method of reaching central San Franciso because all I had to drag on wheels was my carry-on bag. The fare was $5.10 or $5.20. It takes half an hour. As you go up the esculator from the Powell Street station you can see the sign for the Palomar. Can't beat that. Half a block walk and you are there. Map it online ahead of time. I was early for my reservation but the staff got me directed to my room. It faced away from the street and over a glass atrium. It was also a bit cramped. I could be in any hotel in the country with this view. I went back to the lobby and asked for a better room. For $20.00 a night more I got a slightly larger room that overlooked Market Street, a main San Franciso street. Granted I did hear some street musicians through the window in the evening but stuff like this stops at around 10 PM. I had three quiet nights of sleep.I can't say enough nice things about the staff. Want an opinion about a restaurant? You can get several. It happens that the historic, reasonably priced John's Grill is only a couple of blocks away. As for the room again. It was clean.No walk-in shower but a nice bath. Nice, light cover for the bed so you can see how clean it is.Kind of weird to have two desk chairs. Great if you are going to have a couple of visitors to your room.Reading lights for bed reading could be better (as with most hotels).Mattress was comfortable as were the pillows.NY Times delivered to the door. At check out I was told I could have gotten a SF paper if I had told them.I have to admit that the room didn't have any cutting edge design features like I have seen in Park Hyatts or Westins but it had a nice contemporay look and I felt it was a notch higher than the standard HIlton, domestic Radisson or Sheraton.

<Content>Great Boutique Hotel My wife and I stayed for one night at the Palomar after seeing Jersey Boys. We have stayed here several times and have enjoyed each stay. The hotel is well-located and well-appointed. This is a boutique hotel so if you want the large, overdone lobby stay across the street at the Marriott. The Palomar staff is friendly and helpful. For a great breakfast, go around the corner to Mel's Diner. You'll get a filling breakfast at a reasonable price. The hotel is very close to shopping and the Moscone Center. We highly recommend the Palomar for its comfortable beds, upscale furnishings and decor, and friendly staff.

<Content>Great location I stayed here for 1 night with my boyfriend and his sister. We had a room with 2 double beds. It was pretty pricey but I think that was due to the Cinco de Mayo weekend. We arrived 1 hour earlier than normal check-in but they had no problem checking us in. We settled in and went to get lunch; when we returned, none of our key cards worked; went to the front desk and they had to re-scan/re-enter the info on them-I think it may have been because we checked in early and the cleaning crew went in while we were gone; very minor :)The room was gorgeous, beds amazing and location was perfect. The only negative I had with the hotel was the room service; they had a very limited late night menu (4 sandwiches or 2 soups to choose from). When our food arrived, there was no silverware for the 3rd person and no spoon for the soup she ordered. We also ordered breakfast in the morning which was delicious but once again, minor things were missing (no syrup for the waffle, etc). I would definately stay there again but probably would not order room service.

<Content>Positive experience at the Palomar My daughter and I just returned from a 1 night stay at the Palomar, and we really enjoyed it.We got a great rate from the hotel's website--$140 for a Saturday night (plus parking, which is expensive). The staff was really nice. When we first arrived, a bevy of 3 or 4 people ran up to help us. The staff paid special attention to my daughter, who's 7. The desk clerk actually encouraged her to jump on the bed, and the doorman jokingly chided her for not wearing a jacket. Despite the good service, none of the staff seems to particularly expect tips, and they seem genuinely thankful when they do receive them.The room was quite large and attractive, and the beds very comfortable. We were on the 8th floor and had a very nice view across Market Street and up toward Union Square. The L'Occitane amenities are nice, too.The location is really fantastic--BART and MUNI stop downstairs, great shopping is steps away, and SFMOMA and other museums are just a short walk away. I don't like this hotel quite as much as another Kimpton Hotel in SF, the Argonaut, but the Palomar's location is superior (unless you want to be at Fisherman's Wharf).The room was quiet in that we didn't hear a peep from neighboring rooms or the hallway. However, at 8pm a band set up across the street, and it was quite audible, even through the double-paned windows. We didn't mind, but if you don't want to hear Jimi Hendrix tunes until 11 pm (plus the occasional siren and other street noise) ask for an interior room.I only have a couple small complaints. 1. The bathroom has a pocket door. These seem to be popular in SF hotels, but I don't like them. 2. The lobby, although attractive, is small. Unlike other Kimpton properties, I don't think this one has a free wine hour in the evening. 3. I'm a Kimpton In-Touch member, but didn't get the usual welcome amenity.

<Content>Not Bad, better than I thought! We stayed @ the Palomar for 2 nights in February. I read a lot of theprevious reviews, so had some reservations, however i was quite pleasantly surprised.Rooms: We booked our room, surprise-surprise, via the hotel's own website, which was the cheapest (incl. expedia, priceline, corp. rates, via travel agents, etc). Our package even included 2 bottles of soda, popcorn and a $20 hmv coupon to buy cds/dvds. Our room faced the internal court yard, so it was quite quiet in the evening. In addition, it was quite large, well appointed and looked like it was in pretty decent condition (not like some of the other reviews). I can only conclude that the conditions of the rooms vary.Location: This was main reason we stayed at the Palomar, since we were only spending 3 days in SF, 1 min. walking distance to Union Square is very important. Just check out where it is located on the map. Only complaint, which is a bit hard to avoid in sf, is some of the rif-rafts around the area, but I understand it's even worse closer to Union Square station. Anyways never really had any problems.Service: It was okay, not great not bad. The doorman was extremely nice and helpful, however they took more than 15 mins to retrieve our luggage, which almost caused us to miss our transfer to the airport.I would consider going back to the Palomar due to the convenient location. The service was acceptable. I have been living in Asia for over 12 years now, so I normally don't expect the service level in N. America to be anywhere close to those in Asia.

<Content>great service! We stayed one night here with our three kids in two adjoining rooms. The location is very busy, if you like being where all the action is, this is the place for you. It is right in the heart of Union square near all the shopping. The staff goes way out of their way to help you in every way. They treated us like royalty all the time. My kids liked the bellman so much they kept telling us to tip them more money cause they were so cool. Beds are super comfortable if a bit small, why do hotels have double beds when a queen would fit? Bathrooms were very fancy. The only thing I did not like was the view, there was none. Our rooms looked into the office building next door, that was a litte weird.

<Content>my home in SF My favorite in SF. I've enjoyed at least 10 stays at the Palomar over 8 years. The only reason I ever stay elsewhere is if I can't get a good rate there. It's often not cheap, but it's worth it to keep checking for a low rate. To be fair, a big part of why I love it is the location--right at the BART station, and 5 blocks from our HQ. But it's also because they really go out of their way to take care of their guests.On my most recent stay, my day had gotten off to an awful start. Woke up to find my flight to SF cancelled, and I had to be there for an annual departmental meeting at noon. I arranged a replacement flight, but my cab no-showed, and I missed it. Another taxi to another airport, bad traffic, not enough time to check in; but I managed somehow, only to end up in the very back row next to a woman with a coughing brat in her lap. I got to the Palomar at 11:15am. I stopped in, figuring I'd at least drop my bag and use a men's room. The clerk at the front desk asked how she could help me, so I asked if it were possible to check in, explaining that I knew it was very early, etc. While she was checking, she asked how my morning was going--so I told her the story. Well the room they had set aside for me wasn't ready, so she upgraded me. And I had half an hour to relax in a deluxe room before going to the meeting. Now I hadn't been to the hotel in over a year, and I had booked my room on their website at the cheapest special rate they offer all year. But I was able to go to my meeting in a good frame of mind because the Palomar took care of me. Will I stay there again? You beat--every time I can get a rate that won't alarm our auditors.

<Content>Loved it! great value We stayed 3 nights waiting to leave for Asia and loved this small little hotel. The location is great. The breakfast is a bit expensive but the waffles are delicious! The room was a bit small but large enough for a couple on holidays and the price/value was wonderful, we would definitely stay there again!

<Content>Fabulous Place to Stay This place was the best!! The rooms were very large and comfortable. The beds were great! The hospitality was second to none. I have stayed at Ritz and at the JW Marriott both 5 star and exquisite. The Hotel Palomar is in their league in hospitality and may even rival these folks. We had 2 rooms that were joined and there was at least 1000 sq of living area between them.The 鈥楧oor-man鈥?had great recommendations for breakfast and dinner every day and with out exception all were of great San Francisco flavor. The Hotel is right by the trolley car system and for $1.50 you can travel through out the city. Hotel Palomar is located right in the heart of Union Square so shopping was close. We forgot the charger for our camera and found that there was a full discount camera store within a one minute walk. The hotel front desk located the store and printed us a map when we arrived and we were able to solve the problem for $29 within 30 minutes of arriving.Over all a great place we give 6 stars out of a 5 star system.

<Content>Overpriced Just stayed at the hotel March 14-15. The beds were extremely comfortable and provided a great night's sleep. The location is also a huge plus....close to the cable car and right next to bus/street car stops and lots of dining nearby. However, the hotel definately does not have the 'luxury' feel, though you may pay a luxury price for it. The rooms were small and the bathrooms were tiny. We had a view of market street which was great, though they originally tried sticking us in on the interior of the building, facing the roof, so we called the front desk to get into the other room. And keep in mind, if you reserve online, don't expect them to uphold any special requests you may make. We requested a room on the highest floor possible, yet we were given a room on the 5th floor (the lowest floor in the hotel.) Our second room was on the 6th floor and given to us 10 min after check-in, so they obviously had rooms available on higher levels. All the staff was very friendly and usually helpful. The 'business center' had computers with internet connections, though know in advance that the internet there costs extra, which should not be the case for the price you pay for a night's stay. The parking was $42 a day with valet, which is comparable to other hotels in the area. All in all it was a 'nice' hotel, but the price does not reflect what you get in return.

<Content>New decor makes a difference We spent 5 nights there at the end of February -- Wednesday thru Monday. It must have been our 4th or 5th visit to the Palomar.The hotel is nearing completion of a substantial remodeling of the sleeping rooms. The previous zebra motif has given way to soft modern colors and lines. The rooms seem both calmer and larger than previously, but also more luxurious. Only complaint is that the desk chairs were not really desk chairs, and more stylish than useful when being used for that work thing. The bathrooms also seem to have been refurbished, and a new range of toiletries is on display.Overall, it was an excellent experience. Staff are a little impersonal, with a somewhat forced welcome back when you come through the door. But, they did what was requested, and everything worked just fine. Out the front door and around the side is the entrance to the Bloomingdales in the expanded Westfields center. Diagnoally across the street is the Metreon theater complex. Across the street is the Marriott.So, the location is quite good, the hotel is quiet and upscale. Staff do their jobs. It was a good thing. We'll definitely use the Palomar again. Like so many of the Kimpton properties, it's a classy but affordable act.

<Content>Very nice, probably the best hotel I've ever stayed at This was the second time I have stayed at the Palomar, however only for a single night at the end of our San Francisco vacation in 2005. My previous stay there was for 4 nights in 2003.This is probably the finest hotel I have stayed at. The staff's attention to detail was impeccable. The bell hops, valet drivers, and front desk, all were very hospitable.The room was modern, well appointed and generally very comfortable. I enjoy boutique style hotels, as the Palomar is and it did not fail to disappoint. This room had a Market St. view which was also nice.My only regret was that we only stayed for a single night!Getting a discount rate on such a great hotel was excellent!Valet parking was a bit hefty, however I know parking is expensive in San Francisco.I hope to stay at the Palomar on my next visit to San Francisco!

<Content>Unfortunately not that great I REALLY wanted to love this hotel. The website made it look great and the reviews I had read were very positive. However, despite the reasonable room rates (I paid 179/night), this is just not a hotel I would return to.GENERAL: The problem with Kimpton hotels, in my opinion, is that they are theme hotels rather than true luxury hotels. The theme of the Palomar is fancy hotel. It emulates luxury, but doesn't actually achieve it.LOCATION: The hotel is located very centrally on the corner of Market Street and 4th St. The particular street corner is ridden with somewhat sleazy types, and the building abuts an Old Navy store.LOBBY: I generally enjoy large, open spaces, and the lobby, though well-appointed, was the opposite.ROOMS: TINY!!!!! The very friendly receptionist had even upgraded me to one of the larger rooms, and that was still an extremely small room. The room was nicely appointed but, again, TINY!! The bathroom was so tiny that, sitting on the toilet, my knees nearly touched the cheaply painted-over sliding door that separates the bedroom from the bathroom. The bedding was awful. The pillows were tiny and not firm enough.SERVICE: This is the hotel's one big plus. Everyone from the receptionist to Virgil, the very friendly and knowledgeable concierge, to the bellboys, were professional and courteous.RESTAURANT: The restaurant, Fifth Floor, has received rave reviews on Zagat and elsewhere. It bills itself as a gourmet fine dining restaurant with a star chef. I have eaten in some of the finest restaurants domestically and internationally, and this restaurant just wasn't that great. The service was terrific, but the food, though flavorful and inventive, wasn't worth the $173 price tag (for one person!!). Entrees priced between 40-52 dollars!!!SUMMARY: If you are in dire need of a boutique hotel in San Francisco, go to the W. It's near the Palomar, but it is a first-rate version of itself rather than a second-rate version of another hotel (which is what, sadly, most of the Kimpton hotels are).

<Content>Lovely hotel, huge room First, I don't understand the comments about the rooms being small. I booked the cheapest room, and it was huge! I just presumed all the rooms were that size. I asked for a quiet room, and didn't want one overlooking the street, as I guessed that would be noisy, and also wanted a non-smoking room (I think the whole hotel is non-smoking, but I didn't want a room that someone had smoked in). We were given a room at the back of the hotel, with apologies that it overlooked offices, as that was the quietest. The room was super quiet, once the door was shut we couldn't hear a thing. It was a huge room though. We didn't really watch tv, but if someone did, they might find the tv too far away from the beds, especially for watching a movie. We kind of felt that a lot of the room space was wasted, but it was certainly a large room. The bathroom also was huge. Lovely fittings in the bathroom, and we liked the 'arty' touch throughout the hotel.The location was great. I purposefully wanted something not right on Union Square, as that sounded noisy. I liked this location just south of the square, as it was easy to get to for transportation, stores, a grocery store down the road. We walked everywhere from the hotel. We're good walkers, but still we walked up hills, over to China Town and on to North Beach, across to Nob Hill, and took public transportation to the Haight, etc.No coffee maker in the rooms, but excellent organic coffee in the lobby, so I'd just go down there each morning and bring some up. Free internet access in the room was handy. Also, various newspapers available on each floor or outside your room. I liked the smaller size of the hotel and would definitely return.

<Content>Great location and Friendly Staff First of all, we got great rates on Travelovity - $250/pp round trip from Orange County to San Francisco plus 2 nights stay. Maybe because it was in February?The hotel is close to the mall and all the shops around Union Square. It is really close to cable cars and electric cars. Virgil the concierge was very helpful. Ask him about the restaurants in an alley called Belden. Matt th bell captain, Josu and the rest of the front office staff were nice too. The only complaint I have is that our bathtub drain wasn't functioning properly. We had water up to our ankles when taking showers. We let the front desk know about the problem before we left the hotel one morning. We got back late in the evening and the problem was not fixed. The maintenance people had gone for the day. Josu tried to help us but couldn't and instead offered for us to move to another room. But it was about 11 pm in the evening and it was our last night so we decided to just tough it out. Next time I will just ask to be moved to another room right away. The rooms are on the small side but the beds are really comfortable. I definitely would stay at this hotel again!!! Next time I will try the Fifth Floor Restaurant in the hotel which has been described as expensive but worth it.

<Content>Location, Location, Location! After reading multiple reviews online (mainly this website) I booked a room for our family of four at the Palomar. We were a family of four with two older teenagers, and I was looking for something that would accomodate varying personalities. My husband is older, hates shopping, favors museums. My daughter wanted to SHOP, SHOP, SHOP! Our son would probably have preferred to have been left home, and I just wanted everyone to be happy. The Palomar seemed tucked back from the traffic on the main road, but it was within easy walking distance of several museums and LOADS of shopping. Chinatown was also within easy walking distance. The staff at the Palomar was SO courteous--always greeting us with a smile, opening doors (It may have helped to have the attractive 20 year old daughter along.) The room was not large, but luxuriously appointed with down comforters, really nice sheets and towels. I thought at one point that I should have booked TWO rooms, but we weren't IN the room that much, and we really didn't mind the rare family closeness. As a matter of fact, when we look back on the trip more than a year later, we talk about the night we stayed in and ordered a movie on the television as one of our favorite times on the trip.  We booked one of those tours to Alcatraz, Muir Woods, Sauselito, and the bus stopped right in front of the hotel and picked us up the morning we were going to Muir Woods. We found the location perfect for our needs. My husband and I would wake up early and head out for one of the Starbucks within easy walking distance. Later we'd wake the teenagers and go DO something. Later in the day my husband would rest in the room while I shopped with one or both kids.  The location was wonderful, the room VERY nice, the staff extre mely courteous and helpful. I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Great Hotel! I booked my stay at the Hotel Palomar through a great deal my travel agent got for me. The property has a great location right in the heart of downtown San Francisco. Check-in was handled flawlessly and my room was comfortable and spotlessly clean, if a bit small. Considering that I was not planning on spending a great deal of time in my room, this wasn't an issue. The decor is modern and tasteful and the staff was never too busy to handle any request. All of the four-star touches one would expect were present and service was impeccable. In addition the Palomar has free wireless internet.Things that might be issues for some travelers would be room size (small - would have been even smaller with a second person in the room) and view (mine was of the Old Navy skylight). That being said, these weren't big issues for me as I wasn't spending a lot of time in my room, and the positives far outweighed the negatives.

<Content>I would stay here again! Truly pleasant! I went to San Francisco for the weekend. I wanted to be in close proximity to the Warfield concert venue on Market. I did my homework and researched all the hotels within close proximity of the venue. So I chose the Palomar, because I wanted to stay at a boutique hotel, it was walking distance to the venue and the pictures and reviews were great. I have stayed at a Kimpton hotel, but not in many years. As I pulled up to the valet, the doorman immediately assisted us by radio-ing the valet attendant to check in our vehicle. He also introduced himself, extremely polite and friendly gentleman. He helped us with our bags and showed us where to check in. Check in was a breeze, the staff was knowledgable of my reservation. The lobby was beautiful, clean and stylish. This was the small intimate setting I was looking for. Although it felt formal, it was not stuffy, and neither was the staff. I was not interested in staying in a monster size hotel only to feel like just a room number. I was also presented with a gift, a Palomar tote bag. This was unexpected and very thoughtful.I booked the room through the hotel's website and they fulfilled my special requests. The room was clean and I approved of the decor. The ceilings were at least 10 feet high, which is a nice touch. All it all, it was perfect. I left for dinner and when I returned, the little trash that I generated was already removed from the room, new towels were provided, and robes laid out on the bed. Check out was just as easy. I was more than pleased with the high level of service and condition of the hotel. I look forward to staying at this hotel again, hopefully sooner than later.

<Content>Location, location, location! I am a fan of (almost) every Kimpton I have stayed at, and Palomar was a special treat. The normal great amenities of a Kimpton (fabulous beds, etc). The standout was the fantastic staff--out of their way helpful (security walking me to an ATM at 2am, terrific bellmen). Great dinner recommendations.What made this so fantastic was this jewel on Market Street! Everything was so close, Union Square, shopping on Market, the Galleria. I love the Hotel Monaco, but this was pretty sweet!

<Content>very nice location Stayed here the same weekend we stayed at the Hotel Monaco. Had one night at each due to Hotel Monaco being booked. It was a great location for shopping and close to Bart which we use to get to the city. Our room was very large and clean.The two double beds were very comfortable. As always the mini bar is a great set up in a kimpton hotel.I'm a intouch member through Kimpton hotels and recieved a welcome back snack from management in the evening. Very nice touch! Also turn down service with chocolates love that. Robes in the room,plenty of towels. Would of liked a room with a view of Market not the container store but only complaint not too bad. Love the Kimpton hotels!

<Content>Not 5 star and overpriced We stayed here in August 2006. The hotel has a great location and Union Square, Cable cars and most of the other tourist districs are within walking distance. However the hotel and restaurant is expensive for what you get and the room was of average size. We upgraded to take advantage of the Hot Tub, but unless your in San Fransciso for more then 4 days, you won't get time to use it so don't bother......

<Content>Pleasant, business-oriented hotel Booked this one through Amex for a conference. Completely pleasant, but nothing out of the ordinary. I didn't have much time for shopping, but can see it has a totally awesome location for the big shopping chains (Saks, etc..). The one very good thing was it's close proximity to the tram that takes you out to Ocean Beach, which was absolutely beautiful. The staff was lovely and helpful; forgive me, I loved that it was next door to a large Container store, which being from Canada I'd never seen. Smallish room, not unlike Manhattan hotels.

<Content>Great City Hotel Experience! I wasn't quite sure what to expect from this hotel, as I had never even heard of it before. My friend booked this hotel for us on a recent stay, and I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. From the moment we walked into the chic, hip lobby, I was struck by how kind and courteous the desk staff was. The atmosphere is upscale and hip, it would appeal to anyone who demands the best in service and style, for the business or pleasure travelers alike.The room was very clean and spacious, with fabulous leopard patterned carpet and some wonderful Aveda toiletries waiting for us in the attractively decorated bathroom. Everything was in good working order in the room, and the bed was extremely comfortable. The bellhop brought up our things very quickly and our every request was met in a timely and courteous manner.My favorite part of this hotel was the amazing mini dinner that we had in the Fifth Floor Restaurant. The restaurant was full with holiday party goers and other guests, and we didn't have a reservation. However, the hostess accomodated us with no questions asked and we were seated as soon as we got into the crowded room. I had the chicory salad and sour dough encrusted mackeral, both of which were outstanding, well-prepared, tasty, and beautifully presented. The service in the restaurant was as impeccable as it was at the front desk/room attendants, courteous, prompt and professional. This is some of the best food I have ever had the pleasure of eating in a hotel restaurant.Overall, this hotel is a real find in the City, for its upscale and low-key elegance, wonderful cuisine, and super service. I would come back for the service alone. All the staff, from the valet to the front desk, was deferential and more than happy to accomodate our every wish. This hotel is fairly new, but I'm sure that it will become a SF landmark in the years to come. If you want a wonderful, city chic hotel experience, this one is for you! Happy Staying!

<Content>not really a 4 star My husband and I have stayed in a few different hotels in the Union Square area, and were disappointed by the Palomar. While it has an excellent location, the hotel itself leaves a bit to be desired. Rooms seemed tired, small, with pillows that were covered in either lint or white dog hair. Staff did not seem interested in hospitality- they seemed unresponsive when we stood at the front desk waiting for help (had to finish a personal conversation before helping). Walls are thin. If you like a boutique-hotel feel, then this is the place for you (enjoy the leopard print carpet!) but if you are looking for a more comfortable, 4 star hotel, look elsewhere.

<Content>Average stay at central hotel We stayed at this central hotel, was very average, but close enough to centre. Service was fairly decent, but just found some basics were missing for a hotel that should be 4 star. Easy to take the 'streetcar' to the wharf and to take No.30 to Chinatown. It was nice trip, whether was hot in early November. we couldn't wait to get back to the peace and tranquility of the hotel. Expensive to eat in hotel, we went out to Chinatown. Restaurants are average in SF. Airport - watch out for the shuttle bus! Do not be conned to take one, even if they appear to be in a nice shirt and tie, the drivers are dodgy, be aware. It cost $35, when it shoud have been $32, better to take a taxi, it is actually cheaper! ($32). Finally when you book online via travelocity you get a good deal, and also get tonnes of spam, just be sure you use an email you dont care about. Travelocity, naughty naughty, you spammed me, and sold my email to make money did you not? Tut tut, will not book through you next time for that, so I hope you learn next time. Overall I would say this is an average hotel. probably the best hotel we have ever stayed in on holidayand I am extremely fussy! Perhaps not the most convenient if all you want to do is walk around abit.

<Content>A nice property We stayed at the Palomar for quite a while, 9 nights while attending a conference in the city. Access to the hotel via the BART system from the bay airports is easy as there's a stop across the street. Check-in was fast and pleasant, the lobby small, but well turned out.Our room was was nicely appointed. Though, while artfully done, the finishes, textiles and carpet all looked a little tired and in need of a touch up. One annoyance was the lack of a proper dresser or bureau the only piece of storage furniture being the TV armoire which also housed the mini bar, books, etc. The bathroom was just ok.A couple annoyances, while access to public transport is nice, there is a prominent stop right in front of the hotel so quite often during the day the sidewalk is packed with people waiting for the bus, also the housekeeping service started out ok, but slowly became more inconsistent as the week unfolded.The front desk staff were very helpful, attentive and able to answer most questions I had about the city, etc.Free WiFi, a pay option at most hotels of comparable quality in the area, was nice as well.This is a great location for shopping in Union Square and area restaurants, etc.Also, this is the quietest hotel I've ever stayed at in SF, particularly with having a 6th floor room on Market St.I would probably stay again, though only for less than the $219 reserved through the hotel website.

<Content>Over Priced, Lacking Customer Service We recently returned from a distressing stay at the Palomar. We were so excited to be staying there because of their reputation for customer service and the positive reviews. We booked over the hotel's central reservation line. They gave us a rate which was pricey, but included parking and breakfast. When we checked in they said that I was mistaken and that only parking was included. I tried to clear this up but was told there was no manager on duty and to call the central reservation line (they confrimed a note on my file on their computer system, that my understanding was correct but said they could do nothing to help me, and that I would have to sort it out at the hotel.) So, no one was available either at the hotel or central reservations to help sort this out.In the end, I wrote a note for the day manager. She was unavailable in the morning, but then left a voice message in my room saying that I was wrong. When I talked to her in person, and asked her to check the file, she found that there was indeed a note saying that the breakfast AND parking were included. If anyone at the front desk had bothered to check the notes on the computer reservation, they would have seen this (they refused to do this). However, it was too late, by the time it was sorted out it was well past breakfast. In the end, they offered a discount on a room service charge for the previous night. But, it did not save the siutation. I felt very disrespectfully treated, and ended up in tears. The customer service put a real pall on our stay, and I ended up spending a couple of hours of our precious vacation time trying to get them to honor the commitment their own reservation department had made. Very disappointing. A discount on a room service charge in no way made up for the disrespectful treatment, or their own lack of coordination between the hotel and their own reservations department.Overall: The other staff (concierge, bell and wait staff) were very friendly and helpful. The frontdesk and management were not helpful at all. The hotel itself is unique, but worn around the edges. They allow pets, and there was dog hair on the ottoman in our room.The location is very nice. The view from our room was to an internal courtyard that faced other rooms, we could not open the window to our room. The restaurant for dinner had organic local foods and was wonderful. I agree with the previous reviewer...the pocket bathroom doors to the small rooms allow no privacy.Overall, I was so disappointed with the customer service and rudeness. I would not recommend that anyone stay here. It is a decent property, but when things like this happen and there is no commitment to correcting misunderstandings it makes the whole experience upsetting. Paying this amount of money for a room, we expect far better customer service. Also, we expect that what the promises of the central reservation department will be honored, and not argued about at the front desk. For the price, there are better hotels with better customer service.

<Content>Got to sleep on the floor We had a terrible experience. We had booked a double / double room, when we checked in, we asked for a cot for our son as the two teenagers sleeping in a double bed had not been successful so far on our trip. We asked if we could get either another room, or get a cot and were told that would be no problem giving us a cot. At 9:30 when we got back into the hotel from dinner, there was no cot. Upon calling to see when it was to be delivered we were told that they had run out and they would send blankets up for one of our sons to sleep on the floor. I don't know what happened between the 3pm check in and the 9:30 phone call - and we never did get a satisfactory answer, even after going past the front desk to the night manager. Other than that, the hotel was purely mid road at high end prices. The location was fine, but nothing spectacular. The room was ok, but not exceptional. The pocket door to the bathroom offered very little privacy such that others in the room could hear everything! Everytime the houskeeping staff cleaned the room, they only left two towels, so we were constantly calling the desk to get tow more towels sent up as there were four of us staying in the room.The Concierge was fantastic - he always had a great suggestion as to a fun place to eat or how to get around. He was the best part of the stay.We would not stay at a Kimton hotel again, we will go back to Renasainnce or Fairmont where we are always treated well, and they seem to want our return business. Plus we don't have to sleep on the floor.

<Content>Great Location  Stayed at the Palomar for 4 nights before heading off to Las Vegas. I found the staff very friendly, we arrived just as the world cup was starting and wanted to catch the games, the staff gave us a list of all the games/what time they were on and what channels they were on. Did find the food expensive but we didn't eat there so can't comment on if it was nice or not.Location is the winner for this hotel, lots of shops nearby and a few bars/restaurants. We went to fishermans wharf a few times and that means a taxi ride from what i remember it was normally about $12.The only down fall i found was the size of the rooms they were tiny. Would have preferred a larger room.

<Content>Perfect Location in San Fran Our familiy of six stayed 4 nights at the Hotel Palomar in connecting rooms. The rooms were above average and service was superior, especially the bell desk staff.The bar was nice for a drink. We would recommend eating breakfast elsewhere as the service was slow and food expensive. We ate at Lori's Diner after the first day and found the service and expense more in line.The Union Square area is within 1.5 blocks. We would stay here on our next trip to San Fran.

<Content>Wonderful hotel, wonderful staff! Since it was our first visit to San Francisco, we decided it would be fun to stay at two different hotels. We chose the Palomar and Harbor Court hotels, and according to TripAdvisor, they were similar in traveler satisfaction. That was certainly not our experience, and we wished we had stayed at the Palomar the entire trip.The Palomar has the best staff of any hotel we have ever visited. Everyone, from the bell desk to concierge was friendly, professional, and knowledgable. I booked a Executive King through the hotel's website and when we checked in we had been upgraded to Room 816, which was a beautiful room with large windows that overlooked the street. I was concerned at first that the noise from the street would be bothersome but it wasn't. At night we didn't hear anything and slept great. The bathroom was very nice, with thoughtful amenities like a magnifying makeup mirror and ample room to put personal belongings. The room was very comfortable and the decor was beautiful, but also fun, with leopard print carpeting. The bed was very comfortable with high quality bed linens. There were four bed pillows, something we really appreciated. A pretty room means nothing to us, though, if the hotel staff isn't what it should be. The staff is great, we felt welcome and pampered from the minute we walked in. I used the concierge (Yeme) several times and she gave us great advice and was so very nice. We also asked directions several times and the bell desk was helpful and accurate.The location is great, and we didn't rent a car while we were there. We walked everywhere, or took public transportation which is easily accessible. A couple of tips that are very important - if you plan to visit Alcatraz, be sure to buy your tickets through blueandgoldfleet[]ahead of time. There were many people trying to get tickets and they couldn't - sold out. Also, if you want to take a wine tour and plan to use a tour company or limo, it would be best to choose the company ahead of time and make reservations. The company we wanted to use (recommended by Yeme) was sold out for the weekend, so we had to go with someone else. It was ok, glad we did it, but the other would have been better. Best meal we had was at Scomas, on Pier 47. Great seafood!We were so pleased with this hotel that we will definately come back to it next time we go to San Francisco, which I hope will be soon. It is a beautiful, wonderful place!

<Content>Best Bathtub in the world! I stayed in a suite at the Palomar recently with my nephew and we had a great time. All the amenities you could want, great room service (which we used and abused) wonderful decor. We chilled with a friend, watched dvd's, drank champagne and spoiled ourselves rotten. The best part by far for me was the Fuji soaking tub. If you can swing a room with one of these tubs do it! (luxury kings and suites) I'm a big girl and some hotel tubs don't cover all my parts but this tub was huge, I was completely covered up to my neck. I could swim in it. You know when you're two and the tub is the funnest place in the world? That's this tub. They should provide toys. I took three baths in 24 hours.

<Content>Nice Hotel I recently stayed at Hotel Palomar for eight nights while on business.Rooms: Average sized for San Francisco. Aveda products. Clean sheets. Beds are not as comfortable as those at the W.Service: The staff at this hotel is very friendly and helpful. Great staff.Gym: Tiny gym. Three cardio machines and a universal system. They offer a $15 day pass to a local gym.Food: I only had breakfast at the hotel. The food was good.I would stay at the hotel again; however, other hotels might have more comfortable beds. Its a nice hotel, its just not the best hotel in San Francisco.

<Content>Great Stay at the Hotel Palomar My boyfriend and I just got back from a two night stay at the Hotel Palomar. This was my first trip to San Francisco and I chose this hotel based on previous reviews. I have to say thank you to all of you who posted your reviews on this hotel because they were right on. This hotel was great. Here are some tips of advice for those of you who are considering this hotel for your stay in San Francisco:I used the advice from a previous review on the parking structure at 5th and Mission and it worked out great. It was only a block from the hotel and half the price ($23 a day) of what it would have been to park at the hotel. For those of you who want to shop, this is the perfect location. Every store you can think of is within walking distance. But, be prepared for the ever changing climate. Although it was very sunny both days, it can be very deceiving. Make sure and bring light sweaters or jackets and comfortable shoes. Cabs can be a little pricey, so be prepared to do a lot of walking. We took the trolley once down to Fisherman's Wharf and that was enough for me. We had to wait for about 25 minutes to get on at Powell and Market St and unless you get a seat, you'll be holding on for dear life. It was fun for the experience though.If you do go to Fisherman's Wharf, I highly recommend Chic's Seafood restaurant. It is on the second level on Pier 39. Our meal was fantastic and reasonably priced. As for the hotel itself: We had a king bed room. It was a bit small, but all we did was sleep there so it didn't matter to us. Our room also did not have a dresser, but for two nights it wasn't a bid deal. Also no coffee maker in the room, but it forced us to get up and out of bed to get fresh coffee in the lobby. Our bed was incredibly comfortable which made up for the compact size. Our room was always very clean and stocked up with fresh towels and Aveda products every day. They even had turn down service which added a nice touch. Even though the hotel is in a busy area, our room faced the courtyard, so we didn't hear any street noise at night. The hotel staff are all very friendly and accomodating.Overall, this was a fantastic trip and a great stay at the Hotel Palomar. I would definitely recommend this hotel.

<Content>Hotel review The Palomar is not quite a 5 star hotel, after all. I would class it at a 4 at best. The lux king was small and those rooms are located on the noisey side of the hotel which I wasn't told when booking. The reception desk was nice and helpful, but do not expect a 5 star hotel.

<Content>Great Stay @ Palomar Palomar is a small boutique hotel, part of Kimpton Hotels located on Market and Fourth St. The hotel itself is not that big, it's only 9 stories high, however, it was very homey and inviting. Positives:- Location is perfect, a few blocks away from Union Square, less than a block away from Sony Metreon and San Francisco Shopping Center. - We are big on Customer Service, so that is the first thing that we noticed when we arrived. Everyone was friendly and very approachable. They always greeted us with a big smile and was willing to help. - During our check in, we were upgraded to a Suite without even asking. Perhaps because we are members of the Kimpton? They also greeted us with a welcome bag which consisted of a bottle of distiled water and an apple. It's not a big thing, but it's a nice gesture.- We have stayed at many different hotels in San Francisco, but we have never encountered hotel rooms so quiet before. We were on the 8th floor and we could not hear the busy streets at all. We were expecting to hear a lot of noises, (I even had my earplugs ready) so this was a nice surprise. Some of the problems we encountered during our stay:- I usually don't use shampoo and conditioners provided by Hotels, but Kimpton usually provides great amentines, so I decided not to bother to bring my own. The shampoo (Aveda) really dried up my hair. Not a big deal really, for I was smacked in the middle of downtown, an easy walk to get my regular shampoo. - The pillows were small. We are used to having either queen/king size pillows on a king size bed, but these pillows provided were the standard pillows. They were so small that they looked out of place on such a large bed.- The bathroom was nice, and the tub was big enough, however, the water in the tub took forever to drain. In fact, the water reached my ankle when I was taking a shower. We let the hotel know about this, but we were encountering the same problems the whole time we were there. The toilet wasn't flushing properly also. We had to flush at least twice or three times each time. Overall, we had a great stay at Palomar, and most likely will return.

<Content>A Gem in San Fran! We found this hotel by chance via Expedia and booked it give the positive reviews on TA. This hotel is a great 鈥渂outique鈥?style property situated right in the heart of San Fran. All the places we wanted to see were easily accessible from this hotel either by walking or by tram/train/streetcar/bus all of which are within a block of this hotel. Outside the hotel you will find pan handlers and homeless people however, this is to be expected anywhere in San Fran (you can also expect this outside the Four Season鈥檚 which is only a block away).The property is very clean and stylish without being too over the top. The room was on the smaller side but very clean and comfortable. The bed was great along with the linens and towels.We rented a car and took a day trip to Napa which is highly recommended. The wineries were great and the food was amazing.Being the 4th of July, we expected warm weather and were somewhat surprised at how cold it is in San Fran. The weather reports said the temperature would be around 20 but with the wind/fog it was more like 10. Other than the cold weather we enjoyed this hotel and would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Wonderful hotel We stayed at the Hotel Palomar for two nights in late June. My husband and I stayed in a room that overlooked Old Navy and my daughters, ages 14 and 17 shared a room that faced the street. Both rooms were quiet and all four of us loved the hotel. The rooms were spacious, the bathrooms large with plenty of room to put personal toiletries, and the staff was friendly and helpful. The location is very convenient, near to various forms of public transportation. The beds were comfortable. I can only say great things about the hotel, would stay there again, and recommend it highly.

<Content>Thumbs Up For The Hotel Palomar I've just returned from a wonderful, long weekend in San Francisco and have only good things to say about the Hotel Palomar. From it's ground zero location in downtown SF, to its' friendly, polite and professional staff and wonderfully stocked rooms. My room on the 8th floor faced busy Market St. yet couldn't have been more serene. It had a beautiful view up Stockton Street and the fog rolling in every evening. My apologies to the wonderful staff for my poor memory with their names. I do remember that some of them had name tags that also included an artist name of their choice. One very polite employee who showed me my room had the name M. C. Escher on his name tag. Everyone smiled and was polite and professional. SFMOMA and Yerba Buena Gardens are steps away as is Union Square. The hotel has a small workout room which was nice. They also have day passes to Club One which is a fully stocked gym and an easy walk from the hotel.Restaurant Recommendations: LJ's at 101 4th for martinis and delicious dinners, Thai House at 599 Castro and 2223 Restaurant on Market at the same number. Both are bustling, stylish places with great food at reasonable prices.Recommended Site to See: the Asian Art Museum at 200 Larkin St.

<Content>Great property and great location This property is refined and welcoming, with excellent staff and a fabulous 5th floor resteraunt. The location is tremendous, allowing us to dine in Union Square, attend a musical and walk to the Cubs-Giants game. It is right around the corner from the Yerba Buena gardens and within walking distance of the aquarium. Shopping within a block includes crate and barrel, AX emporium, Macy's and United Colors of Benetton. Rooms are well decorated, mini bar nicely stocked and the turn down service is a nice touch. We celebrated my birthday at the 5th floor and considered it one of the best dining experiences we have had anywhere in the world. Highly recommend.

<Content>Very Good Hotel My girlfriend and I recently stayed at the Hotel Palomar for a getaway weekend. The hotel was very nice. The bathroom was great - it had a seperate deep soaking tub. The location is perfect - it is 2 blocks from Union Square. The bed was very comfortable. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Room service was excellent. The one negative thing I would say about the hotel is that it does not have a comfortable lounge area to get a cocktail. The lounge is part of the restaurant Fifth Floor and is a bit too stuffy and formal for me...but that is just my opinion.I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Great hotel  Just got back from a 6 night stay at the Palomar and was thoroughly pleased with the terrific service and the great location. The entire staff was extremely helpful, courteous and very friendly. They were always prompt in fulfilling all our requests and would routinely check back with us to make sure we were satisfied. The location is great for shopping; next door to the San Francisco Shopping Centre and two blocks from all the boutiques and big department stores that line Union Square. There was never a lack of great restaurants or entertainment venues close by (Sony Metreon, Yerba Buena Gardens, Museum of Modern Art). We'll be visiting San Francisco again in October and will definitely be staying at the Hotel Palomar.

<Content>You'll probably enjoy this hotel! This hotel is right above the Old Navy store on Market street, just blocks from Union Square shopping, and one short block from the Sony Metreon.The staff was helpful and friendly. We were able to arrange in-room massages via the concierge, no problem. The room service was prompt, tasty and reasonably priced for that kind of thing.There is a convenient self-service business center (for Internet access, etc) and a small health machine facility, both of which looked quite new and up-to-date, and well-maintained.My only slight disappointment was with the restaurant. I arrived at the hotel in the later afternoon, and the place hadn't opened yet. I wanted a snack and a drink, and had to settle for something from the mini-bar instead. Not a big deal, given the location in the midst of some of the finest dining on the West Coast, but be prepared for limited opening hours of the in-house watering hole.The room was clean, comfortable, and quiet enough for a restful stay. I would stay here again any time.

<Content>A fantastic location I couldn't fault the location. My family and I satyed at the Hotel Palomar for 3 nights and found plenty to see and do within easy walking distance of the hotel.I don't feel that the hotel deserves it's 5* status, the carpets were dirty and rooms rather dark. The rooms were also not decorated to my taste at all (leopard print caprets-yuck!) but don't let this put you off...the beds were so comfy it was hard to get up-down matress toppers are a genious invention!We ate at the reastrant (Fifth Floor) and were very dissapointed having read many rave reviews. Yes the food is lovely but it is incredibly pretentious with overly attentive staff. I'm sure there are places to eat with a much nicer atmosphere for a fraction of the price (though it was the best steak i've ever eaten!!)I'd be tempted to stay at the Four seasons next time, or one of the hotels we passed on Union Square, which all have equally excellent locations.

<Content>One of the best hotels in SF We stayed here for three nights in a suite - two adults in the king bedroom and our adult son in the living room. Wonderful space, pullout couch was excellent (he's 6'2 and he was very comfortable). Bathroom huge, shower terrific, big two person soaking tub with jets. City noise outside, but that's to be expected - hotel is very quiet internally.We had a car, and valet service was good.Service, in general, is the problem here, and it's just spotty - not mean. Examples: asked for a coffee maker in room, was told it would be there, never saw it. Coffee in the lobby was very good, though, so we gave up. Alos, manager emailed me in advance asking for input, so I told him we were would like to have enough towels and bedding for our third person; he agreed. I mentioned it again when we checked in, but we ended up having to ask yet again before we saw pillows and a couple of ratty old (but clean) blankets for the pull out. Oh, and the down comforter on our king bed was an old worn blanket, too, encased in sheets.Generally, the space was well planned, clean, spacious, and comfortable, with good lighting. This a great location for walking to the MOMA, Yerba Buena gardens, Union Square and shopping, Chinatown, the Embarcadero, and lots of wonderful restaurants.

<Content>An Absolute Gem The Palomar is simply one of the most comfortable, cosy hotels that I have ever experienced, and I travel a lot for business. I usually stick to the large chain hotels because you can rely on consistency, but I was so happy to have chosen the Palomar for my last trip. My double room ($259 per night) was vast (love the leopard print carpet), with a good-sized bathroom. Although only steps away from Market Street, there was no noise to disturb my sleep in the huge bed. When I arrived in my room, the TV was playing soft music and calming pictures of waterfalls - just what I needed after a gruelling 10-hour flight from London. All the fixtures were stylish and clean, with thick robes in the closet and chocolate every night on the pillow.I would definitely stay here again as a tourist, my only negative points are as a business traveller. Room service breakfast does not start for hot food until 7 am weekdays/8 am weekends. While this is fine for tourists, for those of us who have 8 am Sunday meetings it's not ideal. I found the room service food to be the only aspect of my stay which let the place down - dinner on my first night was really disappointing. Expensive and badly cooked. The room service food does not come from the restaurant kitchen, and it shows. Also, there is no business centre in the hotel, although it is possible to send faxes from the front desk. There is no coffee machine in the room either, another negative for the seriously jet-lagged.But these points did not make me regret not staying in the Marriott across the road. I'm not used to the kind of personal attention that you get at the Palomar, and it was a very nice change.

<Content>Great, Clean Friendly Hotel Part of the boutique hotel line of Kimpton, the Palomar is a nice choice in SF. Even though the rooms were on the small side, they were clean and well laid out. Location: In Union Square... easy walking distance to different parts of downtown, but keep in mind that it is relatively close to the Tenderloins and not the best hood in town. It is very close to the Marriott.Room: Small sized room with TV, DVD player, small table (which functioned as a desk) and tiny bathroom (with tub and Aveno products though). Free wireless internet. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. Service: Very friendly. The front desk and maids were all very nice and friendly.I would definitely stay again.

<Content>Great Service! I recently stayed at the Hotel Palomar for business and even had a meeting there. The staff was very professional and friendly. My guest room was very neat and clean. The meeting room, de Young Boardroom, was a perfect room for a meeting. The food service staff was very friendly and not in the way at all during our meeting. I would defintely recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great place Stayed here for three nights in late March. Terrific location just steps from Market Street and easy access to all public transport (including the BART station literally round the corner - 30 minutes direct from SFO for $5.15).Second Kimpson Hotel in San Francisco (the other was the equally excellent Argonaut) I've stayed at and they're very impressive. The Palomar had it all - friendly greeting at the front desk, immaculate room (very well appointed including DVD player and large TV) with perfect housekeeping and a very comfy bed. Turn down service and chocolate too. Almost no noise from the street - all the rooms are on the fifth floor or above.Bit more pricey than your standard tourist hotel, but well worth those extra bucks for the extra quality.

<Content>Always a pleasure Recently stayed at the Palomar Hotel during a weekend birthday celebration. The front desk staff is exceedingly pleasant and thoughtful and they make every effort to make the check procedure as fast and easy as possible.The room is well appointed, with every amenity. The beds are comfy, the sheets soft and everything is spotless. They offer free wireless internet, which lots of hotels charge $10/day extra for.The exceptional thing that happened is that I had mentioned being in town for my birthday. About an hour after checking in, there was a gentleman at the door with a complimentary half bottle of wine and a box of truffles from their restaurant, The Fifth Floor. It was so wonderful and thoughtful and truly made the day special.In terms of location, you can't do much better in San Francisco. It's a two block walk to Union Square, all the shopping is in close proximity, and there is a BART station a half block away. There are many hotels in this area, and I have stayed at a few others, but for a total package in terms of price, location, amenities and service, would definitely give the Palomar top marks.

<Content>Absolutely Positive Stay at the Palomar The location of the Palomar is perfect for stepping out any time of the day or night - you're less than 2 blocks from Union Square, lots of shopping, restaurants and people. The Ferry Market is a 15 minute walk, highly recommended - and if you don't want to walk anymore, public transportation, cable cars and taxis are literally a step away. Ultimately, the staff makes a stay at a hotel matter - and they were all above and beyond my expectations. The hotel partners with a limo service that was fantastic - which is another great suggestion in touring the city and beyond. Money well spent. The doormen will arrange the service for you.I booked a king and upgraded to a suite on the 9th floor - which was divine. If you need the room to spread out and enjoy the view, do it. And after walking all over the city all day, the jacuzzi tub and the shower take away all your aches and pains. And if you don't have the energy to get back out for dinner, or you want a good breakfast to start off the day right - the restaurant's food is great. A little on the high-end price wise, but it's convenient. The bed was wonderful, the room service was great and it was quiet and peaceful when I retired for the night. There wasn't one single negative thing to report about the Hotel Palomar. I will always choose this hotel in future visits to San Francisco.

<Content>Great Hotel! I stayed in the Hotel Palomar over President's Day weekend, and it was a lovely hotel! The rooms were quiet and meticulously clean, spacious (a rare find in San Francisco), and well appointed, with a very comfortable bed. The staff members were gracious, helpful and polite, and were very accommodating when we arrived at a late hour. In addition, the location is desirable and close to BART, which was very convenient for travel. Overall, a very tasteful, sophisticated, private hotel.The only qualities of which I would take note, not bad but are definitely a matter of preference:1) Pet friendly, which is fine, except for the incessantly barking dog across the hallway. However, management handled the problem promptly. 2) Very quiet, and guests keep to themselves. In other words, if you are looking for a lively spot rather than a private getaway, may not be the best place.3) The bar is not open on Sunday evenings, and service is a bit slow.4) The concierge was not terribly knowledgeable. So, if you are not familiar with a city, and are relying on the concierge for suggestions, you might consider doing your research prior to arriving.

<Content>Nice people, nice hotel Reading the last review, I feel obligated to post my recent experience at the Hotel Palomar. Maybe I'm not quite as picky as other people, but I found the customer service at the hotel to be excellent, as compared to the 200+ other hotels I've stayed at in the last 12 months. Apparently the hotel was good enough to win the Conde Nast Traveler's 2005 Gold List of World's Best Places to stay, so I guess I'm not alone in thinking that it's a nice place to stay.Being a road warrior, I'm also an Inner Circle Elite Member, so it's possible I get treated a little better than the average customer, but compared with my treatment at other chains (Intercontinental, Marriott, Starwood), I found the customer service to be more than adequate.Checkin:I arrived early at the hotel (approx 1 PM), and didn't expect to be given a room, but the desk clerk found one for me without a problem. Based on my Inner Circle status, I asked if I could get upgraded. Again, based on past experiences with equal status at other chains, I was more than prepared to accept a negative response. The desk clerk upgraded me to a jacuzzi suite, no extra charge. She was very friendly, smiling, and welcoming, traits that I unfortunately see a paucity of in the hotel business.Room Service: I believe that room service at most Kimpton hotels is not quite at the same level as larger hotels, because they are boutique hotels, which are smaller in scale by definition than main chain hotels. That said, I think the quality of food I've ordered at Kimptons hotels exceeds their rivals.I did have breakfast at the hotel restaurant, and though expensive, it really was not any more than rival hotels (esp. for San Francisco). Service was fast and good, so no problems there.Room: Clean, with relatively new appearing furniture (again, maybe I'm just not as picky as others - but I do stay in enough hotels to be able to judge quality of room accomodations). The bathroom had a jacuzzi with separate walk-in shower with Aveda toiletries.Overall: Considering I booked the room with a Travelzoo discount of 150 (with $25 discount towards restaurant meal), I would most definitely stay there again. And the friendly, welcoming staff was the icing on the top which is the feature that would lead me to stay there again.I think that the same Travelzoo offer also has free parking for those driving, and may be running through March (on the weekend). They also have Hot Date Hot Rate specials (like all Kimptons)

<Content>Stay somewhere else - luxury hotels should make your stay better not worse We stayed on a Friday night in Feb 2006I will start with the issues that reflect less preferential then on to my quirks...1) When you order room service at 10:30PM then  a) the person that answers the phone should know the offerings b) the person that is to call you back (supposedly  knowing the offerings) does so within 30  minutes c) When you call back after 30 minutes then you should  get someone to answer the phone within the first 10 rings d) during this call (after 13 rings) the person  should handle the problem promptly e) there should be more than the scant offerings of  one (the only one) pot pie and a chefs salad  f) When you order and they say that the food will  be there in 30 minutes it should be there in  less thank 1.5 hours g) The salad should be cold and not populated with  brown lettuce, stale/dry cold cuts, and white tomatoesOn to my quirks...Quirk #1:I do NOT want a bell hop to touch my luggageI do NOT wnat a bell hop to 'push my trolleyI do NOT want a bell hop to even know my nameI am paying for the facilities of the hotel - the trolley is part of these facilities - I should not have a bell hop tell me that I cannot use the bloody trolley. If I say I want to ferry my luggage to my room myself using the trolley then that s my perogotive - LET ME.Quirk #2:I do NOT want a valet to touch my carI accept that I generally have to tolerate this andso, when I do so, and I pay for parking as well as tipping the valet - then, when I call down for my carat 7:30PM then 1) The concierge should answer the phone2) When I call the front desk and ask for my car they shouldn't tell me take a number3) It shouldn't take 25 minutes for them to get my car (NOTE: only one other car was brought in that 25 minutes and the next day - they had it within 5 minutes).Quirk #3:We selected the hotel because it was pet friendly.A pet friendly hotel should allow me to leave my pet in the room if I feel that doing so was safe and I am willing to take the responsibility. There was no indication of the requirement for attending my dog at all times until check in (not quite bait and switch as they don't tell -how- friendly they are). We had to take the dog with us - to our event requiring that we leave her in the car, further requiring that we drive rather than take a taxi, and eliminating the need to go to the drink-and-dance party as remaining 100% sober is the only way to drive.When I travel to europe, to a little burgh along the Rhine then I get better service knowing that thereis no service available rather than feeling that theservice is available and isn't.When I travel to Singapore to a luxury hotel none of the issues raised above had been near visible - much less than occuring.When I travel to Mobile Alabama I get treated better...In the future I will opt for the motels further away from the location of the event and take three rooms for the price of the luxury hotel be able to walk to the resturaunts for evening meal - leave my dog in the room and pay nothing for parking, need no valet, use the trolley all I want with no bleeding bell hop to tell me that I cannot ferry my own luggage to my room.

<Content>I wish I could have stayed longer The Hotel Palomar is fabulous. First of all It's in a great location - right off of Market Street in the heart of San Francisco. It is within walking distance of a multitude of shops, restaurants, the Sony Metreon and the Moscone Convention center. The staff is courteous and the hotel itself has a wonderful decor. The rooms are on the small side, and the view left something to be desired, (we had a view into the Old Navy Store downstairs) but I would stay there again tonight if I could! I wish I had dined at the restaurant, (because the aroma coming out of there was great) but I didn't have time.. Next time.

<Content>Fabulous as always! I have stayed at the Hotel Palomar on 3 occasions. A group of friends and I take an annual trip to San Francisco to have some girl time and to do lots of shopping. The staff at Hotel Palomar is outstanding. I have never felt more welcome in any hotel before or after this. We have considered staying at another hotel, since the nightly rate is fairly high, but I have to say we cannot switch! We are completely spoiled rotten now!! The location cannot be beat. We are able to walk to everything we need. Once we check in, we never have to get the car out of the garage! If you can possibly swing the price, stay there! You will not be disappointed. From the moment you check in, rest assured, you will be well taken care of.

<Content>Leopard skin carpet... Awesome! I stayed at this hotel for a summer weekend in 2005. Overall it was a great experience. The room was funky and very clean. The bed was huge and comfy. It was a bit on the pricey side, but you really can't beat the location as a tourist. Steps from Union Square, street cars, the pier. Walking distance to the baseball stadium and shopping for miles.I'd definitely reccomend it for first timers to the city. Parking is a bit of a pain in the butt down there though, so be wary of that.

<Content>Perfect Place to Chill What a find, and a price to match! Everything about this hotel was perfect from the friendly clerks to the soft sheets and comfy bed. The service was impeccable, treated me like family immediately, and even gave me the location of the closest inexpensive garage. The room was large, particularly by San Francisco standards and I was treated like royalty. The only place I will stay in SF from now on....

<Content>Service as it Should Be The Palomar is a striking hotel. Everything is subtle and refined and very comfortable. You know you have arrived somewhere special from the moment you walk in. One staff member, however, was absolutely sublime. Ana, the front desk manager, is the star player on Palomar's well-oiled team. She represents the kind of customer service that is nearly non-existant these days. Many front desk managers I have encountered in my travel try to pomp themselves up and end up coming off completely offensive and ineffective. Ana was exceptional--often greeting us by name and inquiring about our satisfaction. She was ever-humble and responsive. I know of many Four Seasons managers who could learn much from her style.

<Content>Be happy to come back Visiting San Francisco on business, I did not have enough time to the good things the hotel had to offer. No time to visit the famed French restaurant on the fifth floor... The room I had was spacious, nicely decorated. Bed was firm, had down pillows, and I loved their turn-down service. Their business center on the fifth floor was unattended but well maintained. Even if you travel without your personal computer, you can check email, browse web or print material there. It was also ideal for browsing nespapers in the morning. What I loved most was their DVD/CD player. I wish to come back for a leisure visit so that I can take fuller advantage of this hotel...

<Content>Wonderful Hotel: Won't Disappoint This hotel will not disappoint. The room we were in had soothing decor with plenty of space, and the bed was more than comfortable. Our room faced the inside square, so there was never any noise. Every staff person we encountered, from the people at the desk to the wonderful doormen, was friendly and helpful. We even had a room service dinner one evening when our team was playing - excellent! The location is in the midst of almost anywhere you want to go. This one is a gem! As dog lovers, we could not help but notice that you can have your pets accompany you here. In addition, you can call up a masseuse for your dog and have a 30 minute or 60 minute massage! Unfortunately, our dogs did not accompany us - perhaps next time.

<Content>Pleasure Staying at the Palomar Excellent service. Room was comfortable and quiet despite being above an Old Navy Store and on Market St., but a bit small, with no drawers for a long stay. We ate at Fifth Floor for dinner and it was heavenly. Conviently located to everything and concierge Virgil is the best!!! More swanky than luxurious, but we enjoyed it.

<Content>Loved it! Much better than the 'W' This is a super hotel. We recently stayed one night (after one night at the pricey W in San Fran) and the Hotel Palomar was far superior! They are located very close to one another -- convenient location -- but the Hotel Palomar had nicer (and larger) rooms, friendlier service  better amenities (free wireless access in-room). The Hotel Palomar also had much cleaner rooms (the W's were far from spotless). All this, and the Hotel Palomar was $129 less! The Palomar is a Kimpton hotel, and if this is representative of their hotels, I will look for them from now on. Skip the overrated W and enjoy this lovely hotel.

<Content>Great location, good looking albeit small hotel I stayed at the Hotel Palomar for 6 nights during Labor Day week for a small vacation. This is my first stay at a boutique hotel as I usually stay at chains. The location is only a block away from the Market street cable car turnaround, a block away from Union Square, a block away from a huge movie theater complex and garden area, and about 3 blocks away (well within walking distance) of Chinatown. You can't ask for a better location for a hotel, tons of shopping and restaurants nearby.All the employees were very friendly and accomodating. The room was on the small side but looked great and was clean, the bed was very comfortable. The interior decoration of the hotel is just awesome, really trendy and hip looking.All in all, I enjoyed my stay and can't beat the price for a downtown hotel.

<Content>Great Service  We had planned an 8 day trip to explore SF and chose the Palomar largely due to the high rating on Trip Advisor. I had requested a high floor and a city view. We ended up with a fairfly high floor but no city view probably due to my travel agent (Liberty Travel) stinking. We had a non descript view but it was super quiet which ended up being fine since there was plenty of noise in the city when we went out. I have nothing to compare this to in SF so please keep that in mind. The room (deluxe king) was small but nicely arranged. Use their luggage rack as there is not enough drawer space but who really cares. The bathroom does have that sliding door but it ended being fine. The bed was super comfortable although the TV reception was lousy due to neaby construction. The concierges there are great. Super friendly and helpful. The whole staff really makes you feel like you are the only ones in the hotel (wait.. were we?). Actually there was a big Intel convention down the street so I think the hotel was fairly crowded.The hotel is a couple o' blocks below all the major shopping in Union Square which is fine. We are natural food eaters so we lucked out that there was a Whole Foods about a 10 minute walk South. No problem since too much room service gets expensive. They give you free use of Yoga equipment for use in your room or, as in our case, for use in the numerous SF yoga studios. Plenty of nearby great food and every recommendation we received from the concierges were spot on. If you want to catch a movie you will be one block from the largest Loews? multiplex ever created. A million screens. Housekeeping was quite excellent. I was worried when I read a less than stellar review just before we left but our experience was in line with our fairly high expectations. Clean, great service, great location.. Enjoy..

<Content>Tips if you stay at the Palomar First of all, the Palomar is at a great location. Lots of great shopping around, the Metreon for a late movie, the SOMA (best brownies at their cafte), and right on the cable car line.1) Best hotel rate can be found on their web site. We did the great rates deal for $139/nite plus taxes.2) Request a handicap room, if available at check-in. These are larger rooms. They will fill your request if no one reserves them. Otherwise, a room with a view to the zen court is quite nice and very quiet. 3) Hotel parking is $42 + taxes with in/out priviledges, but if you park down the street at the Metreon public parking lot, it's $22/24 hours with NO in/out priviledges. But in SF, you won't need your car! Everything is accessible by foot, cab, cable car or bus. By the way, the $11/1 day pass for the cable car/metro is worth it. But start early, as the cable car line is always long. The cable car start/ticket booth is across the street from the Palomar.btw, the hotel has a very good driving map of the city showing the one-way streets direction. Very helpful if you're driving down there.4) If you're driving in the city, you will need a car to get to the Golden Gate bridge view site, so do this first thing when you're driving into the city. Parking is $5/all day at the view site, so I suggest everyone do what we did - pass your all-day parking pass (which you put in your windshield) on to someone else when you're getting ready to leave the parking lot! Some jerk sold me his for half-price (cheap *******!), but you should just pass it on. It's an all-day pass, so everyone should be able to make use of it!

<Content>Lovely hotel in fantastic location A really great find! This hotel had a really personal feel and friendly staff, we managed to get a good rate directly through the hotel and they extended our stay when we requested, and honoured the same rate for the second night. The turn-down service was a nice touch and we were made to feel very welcomed by the staff. It is in a great location, on fourth and market street and lots of good shops, and not far from union square and transport to other parts of the city. We would most definately stay at this hotel again. One tip is not to bring your car to San Francisco if you can avoid it! We felt the valet parking was quite expensive and we had real problems getting to the hotel, even though it is in a great location it is surrounded by a confusing one-way system and we had to go around the block several (stressful!) times, passing the hotel but unable to get to there!

<Content>Great if you get a hot rate BF and I stayed here July 4-6, taking advantage of the Hot Dates, Great Rates on their website. Room was $139 a night and a good value for that price. Location was fantastic, right by Market Street, about a twenty minute walk to the Embarcadero, Giants stadium, ten minutes tops to Union Square. Decor was modern (no flowers), room was small but furniture was solid and bed was heavenly. No view, but also no noise. The turndown service was a nice touch - they even selected music for us. Clean and stylish. I like that they give you the option of replacing your towels and linens in an effort to conserve energy and water. Front desk was fantastic, doormen were super-friendly.

<Content>Absolutely Wonderful!!!! Just came back from an awesome weekend in San Francisco and stayed at the Hotel Palomar. I have never been more impressed with a hotel and their staff as I presently am with the Hotel Palomar. It is a beautiful and contemporary boutique hotel located almost 2 blocks from Union Square, close enough to public transportation and major attractions. The rooms are generously proportioned with fantastic accents and the beds are soo warm and comfortable. Especially with the down comforters....The staff went out of their way to help celebrate my partners birthday and even left a gift in our room. Whenever we return to San Francisco, we will not stay anywhere but the Hotel Palomar.

<Content>Good Hotel but nothing to get excited about This is a good solid boutique hotel where you will have a comfortable stay. There is no wow factor - so if you are looking for spectacular views or grand lobbies, this is not the place. The location is good - about a block from Union Square. The rooms are decent sized - we had a executive king on the 6th floor. At first they gave us a similar room on the seventh flr which was facing a wall - terrible view. But upon request, they gave us the one on the 6th flr with a view of market street - much better.The bed, pillows, linens are all very high quality and comfortable. Service was for Room Service (good food!), Valet parking and Housekeeping.The doubleglazed windows really do block the street noise out.We could however hear the street musicians everyday on market street right below our room. They stop before 10:00 pm. And the music was actually very good and added to the general atmosphere. The lobby is very nondescript, and breakfast was blah.

<Content>A total class-act; nicest place I've stayed This was a superb location and the accommodations were first-class all the way. We booked through Priceline packages and had requested early check-in and late check-out. They were most accommodating. Although the parking was steep ($42 with tax for valet parking in/out privileges) it was worth it. We used the in/out privileges several times each day and received superior service each time. The hotel is elegant, well-appointed and the very best thing is that there is absolutely no street noise of any kind, which is incredible considering the location. We had a fifth floor room that was closest to the lounge and there was some localized noise from that, but I popped my earplugs in and never had another issue. My hubby wasn't bothered in the slightest. Maid service was beyond reproach and occurred twice daily with evening bed turndown. The restaurant was fine - we had brunch there one day; never seemed busy and it was costly. I am glad for an option to eat there, but it wasn't anything special. Without question, this was the nicest hotel I've ever stayed at and I'd recommend this to anyone; I hope to be able to stay there again.

<Content>Perfect boutique hotel We stayed at the Palomar from July 1st - 4th and had a fantastic time. From the moment that we stepped out of the taxi, we were greeted by the doormen. The bellman promptly brought our luggage to our room and instructed us on the use of the AC, etc. The staff was always friendly, and especially the concierge, Virgil, was most helpful and cheerful when we had questions. He always made us feel like special friends. The room was very sleek and clean, the beds and blankets,were mostcomfortable, and the Aveda toiletries were nice. We also enjoyed the nice music and in room CD's. The housecleaning staff was efficient, and came in every afternoon to fill the ice bucket and to do turn down service. They also always left a nice Ghirardelli chocolate candy with us. :)A nice extra was the complimentary yoga basket to use in the room. It was a nice way to unwind after the plane ride. We also enjoyed the complimentary coffee and tea in the morning in the lobby. The only downside was that since it was downtown, the nights felt unsafe to walk around, but as soon as we got to the hotel, the doormen were there to open the doors.Check out was a breeze, and the bellman was there to take our luggage to the taxi. A perfect get away at an intimate hotel. We will definitely return!

<Content>Very Nice Stay My wife and I went to San Francisco  Napa for our 10th anniversary. We stayed at the Palomar at the back end of our trip - and it was well worth it. The staff made us feel special and took really good care of us. We only stayed two nights, but their hospitality made us feel like we were long-time friends and frequent guests. The bell staff was very efficient and they brought up our bags right away. When we were getting ready to leave for the airport, they helped us box up and seal a case of wine we were checking as luggage on our flight. For our anniversary they gave us a nice bottle of red and box of chocolates. They also obtained great dinner reservations for us. Our room was really nice and spacious. Turn down service was a nice touch - they left more chocolates. My wife loved the bath accessories, hair-dryer, etc. I really liked having the nice stereo, etc. in the enterainment cabinet. It was nice to listen to music on a decent sound system in your room. The hotel is in a great location if you going to use Market Street as your home base for your San Francisco stay. Palomar is close to the Pier/Wharf areas, the Financial District and the chain shopping (Macy's Nordstrom, etc.) We booked using a online special rate that included a parking credit - but most of the rental car agencies have return counters close to the hotel. Thus we could have returned our rental car two days earlier and used the parking credit for credit at the Fifth Floor restaurant (one of SF's best.) If we had any complaints, its that the staff did not always give us the best or clearest directions to the various sites/restaurants that we were going to visit. The directions were mostly vague ... walk up 4th three blocks, turn right - its on that street kind of thing. Because of that it took us 10-15 minutes to find the hotel, find one of our restaurants, etc. We liked the overall look and feel of the hotel, the location, and our stay. For the price we expected a good experience and we got it.

<Content>Swanky hotel at a great price I went to San Francisco on business and found the Palomar after unsuccessfully booking at the Marriott across the way. This was my first experience at a boutique hotel. The main thing that attracted me to this hotel was the modern style and attention to detail without the expensive room rates. When I arrived, I was not disappointed. The lobby, though small was minimalistically classy. There was something different about this place.....The check in was fine, and the front desk staff were quite friendly.My room was wonderful. Lots of characteristic swank, very modern, sharp and clean. I was impressed with the CD/radio, the decor, and the AVEDA toilettries which all indicate Kimpton's desire to offer high quality affordably. I had a bit of trouble during my stay - a false alarm and a premature check-out botch. However, The staff were quite apologetic and did what they could to accommodate me. I was moved to a different room and discovered that the decor was essentially the same from room to room. Not surprising, but probably the secret to allowing them to offer what they do. The hotel has a restaurant/lounge that - as it turns out - is frequented by locals moreso than hotel guests (at least so I think). This would be fine, but the fact that the lounge was located on a floor adjacent to guest rooms makes me wonder if this was the wisest form of planning. Still, the noise level rises only around happy hour and is not otherwise a problem. The fitness room is compact but the essentials are there. Business types may frequent this hotel, and this is why I found the fitness room to be used very rarely by hotel guests. The novelty of the hotel may wear off, since it's a lot of surface wow and not too much depth in amenities. But this is not a resort, and as far as hotels go, this is a winner if you match style and class with the manageable room rates.

<Content>Here's the good and bad about the Palomar... My girlfriend and I visited San Francisco for 4 nights and after looking around online a lot, we chose to stay at the Hotel Palomar. Here's my thoughts on it:- Once you have done your looking around online and found what you think is the best deal, go to the Palomar website and see what they are charging for the exact same type o room. If you call the number for reservations or go to the Kimpton Group website you can see they have a best rate guaranteed deal where they match the rate you found plus you get late checkout times and a room upgrade if available. The room upgrade is probably a little iffy according to other reviews on this site, but it did work for us. We booked a King Deluxe (their base room) and were upgraded to a Executive King room which is slightly larger and faces out rather than looking at the inner courtyard. The room is still not overly large (350 square feet) but the view was nice (Market Street, with Macy's etc. in view). I should mention that I wrote an email to the reservations people at the hotel asking for a room upgrade as well so not sure if the upgrade happened as a resut of the Kimpton guarantee or my email. Still, well worth a try. We got ours for $200 U.S. a night including all taxes which while not a huge steal was decent.- Hotel location is pretty decent, located right in the middle of the shopping district and centrally located for any touristy things you are plannin on doing. The one thing I would say is that while the immediate neighbourhood is good, SF has a big problem with homeless people and you will often see them in front of the hotel. This is true everyhere in the downtown area so not a big deal but still a little unsettling. It was always relieving to have the doormen open the oor for you as you approach and escape into the lobby.- Service was fine for us, though we didn't ask for very much. We checked in late in the evening with no problem and the bellhop was very friendly and informative. The desk staff were polite but never seemed to go out of their way to say hello as you walk by or anything. Maids were friendly and said hi and smiled whenever they saw you.- Design and decor was great. It is a beautiful hotel if you are into modern style and some nice luxury touches. There was nothing in our room that turned me off the place. I hate when you stay at a hotel and it seems nice but then you notice scuff marks on the wall or cracks in the bathroom tiles and so on. The king bed was super comfortable though if you or your partner are a restless sleeper it might be problematic as it was somewhat springy and when my girlfriend would turn over, I would bounce a little on my side. That said, it was a great sleep with wonderful linens and pillows. One of the best beds I have slept in, in a hotel. The TV was fine and the Sony CD player was very nice with some music and a light jazz station coming in very clearly. The bathroom does lack a little bit in privacy as it is a sliding door that does not latch or close. It is not see through or anything but when the bed is right beside the bathroom door you may hear more noises when someone uses it then you would prefer. If you aren't shy though, no problem!- Overall it was a pretty good experience. If we returned to San Francisco I would probably stay there again, though I would be tempted to stay in a different part of the city. We were there on vacation and it proved a decent home base from which to go out each day. Hope you found this useful as I know reading the reviews helped me decide!

<Content>This hotel has ROTTEN service, stay at your own risk. We arrived to check in after a lengthy car trip and were told that because of a strange event our deluxe king had been downgraded to a small room with a sofa bed. When we asked what the strange event was, we were informed by the manager that expedia customers are not guaranteed the room they book even when they prepay. I asked if they still had deluxe kings available if I were to book with them directly and they said yes. We told the manager this was unacceptable, he said nothing. No apology, nothing. When we got Expedia on the phone and they talked to him, they said he was unpleasant. What stunned us was there was no apology, no recognition we were about to be massively inconvenienced, nothing. No comp, nothing. Stone-faced and unwilling to concede we were customers. It is as if we are doing them a favor staying at their hotel. We decided to go elsewhere and will never stay at a Kimpton hotel again.Unfortunately, poor service seems to be a hallmark of Kimpton. We stayed at the Vintage Plaza in Portland -- no wake calls, forgot to call town car, bad room next to heat exchanger. Kimpton is style over substance, with a sniffy attitude froms staff. Bad service is not isolated at Kimpton. Do them a favor and stay there or do yourself a favor and stay elsewhere.Awful, awful, awful.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel This hotel made my boyfriend and I feel like superstars. They were incredibly attentive from the moment we arrived....even allowing us to check in to our room 3 hours early. I even had a pair of pants dry cleaned in 4 hours. The room was very nicely appointed and clean. The decorations and ambiance were very modern and well done. The 5th Floor restaurant was SUPERB. We ate some of the best scallops ever there. We sat at the bar for a couple of drinks, the bartender and waitstaff were all very nice. When the bartender overheard my boyfriend and I discussing how we were going to make a reservation at a restaurant he immediately called and made the reservation for us. We didn't even have to ask! Upon check out the hotel arranged for a luxury town car to take us to the airport. We were extremely impressed by the service and location of this hotel. It is right in the center of everything: shopping, dining, tourism. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who is visiting the San Fran area.

<Content>Thoroughly pleased, fantastic location I booked a one night stop-over stay in the Hotel Palomar based on the positive reviews on this website and I certainly didn't disagree. We were greeted after a long journey in a friendly and professional manner by all members of staff. The room, although interior facing was nicely decorated and extremely quiet. The bed was the most comfortable bed I'd ever slept in a hotel which meant we had a wonderful nights sleep.The location of this hotel is brilliant if you want to be close to Union Square. It is just two blocks away and all flat walking, so no steep hills to climb!The only negative was the pricey restaurant in the hotel. We ate there being jet lagged and needing an early night but $23 for a couple of scallops, although very nice, was a little over the top!

<Content>First class all the way My wife and I loved our 4 night stay at the Hotel Palomar. They honored my request for an exterior facing room, higher floor. Limited views of Market Street and nearby tall buildings/Marriott. Very spacious room, great layout and calming interior design with in room CD and all the tech equipment you could want. Phenomenal service, great location between Soma and Union Square shopping, a stone's throw from the Moscone Convention Center, half a short block from the Bart Station. We ate at the hotel's posh five star restaurant, The Fifth Floor, which was a splurge but worth every penny for a memorable evening of out of this world cuisine, romantic atmosphere and doting service (the much more affordable breakfast was also very good, with quick and convenient service). A great home base in a world class city.

<Content>Great room, not-so-great service I was scheduled to be here for a convention for four nights. When I arrived, they told me that they were full because another party had decided unexpectedly to extend their stay, and so they booked me and about ten other convention attendees at another hotel. Though I thought the lack of a room was inexcusable, the situation was handled reasonably well by the front desk staff. However, when I went back the next day for my room at noon (they had said I would be scheduled for an earlier arrival), the Palomar told me that my room was still being cleaned and to come back in a half-hour. Three hours later, at 3:00 pm, I was again told to come back in a half-hour for my room. Finally, at about 5:00 pm, I was given a room key. The room itself was smallish but very nice. Sleek, yet attractive and comfortable. Great amenities, including some cool CD samplers. Very nice bathroom, though the tub grout could use a good cleaning. They upgraded me to a room with a nice exterior view and sent a bottle of wine for my troubles, plus coupons for free breakfast every day. But I had to push for those.The restaurant is intended primarily for dinner. They'll serve you breakfast, but only grudgingly -- the waitresses in the morning have tons of attitude and were very cold.

<Content>central location the palomar was a nice hotel. nothing special, the decorating was a bit generic. the service was excellent, everybody was very friendly and helpful. being so close to union square, it really was right in the middle of tourist central, but it made a good central location from which to explore some of the quieter neighborhoods of SF. if you are coming to shop at the big name stores, you probably couldnt do much better than the palomar for location and value. it is conveniently located close to a bart stop, which i wish i had known on the way there b.c our cab from OAK was $60 whereas the return trip on the bart was about $5 per person.

<Content>Highly Recommended Stayed at the Palomar Christmas, 2004. Lobby felt more like an office building than hotel, though it still had appeal. Rooms were excellent. Chic decor. Well appointed and designed, cheerful and modern. Great little CD stereo with cool music assortment provided. Asian/Zen inspired touches in hallways that culminated in a impressive looking bar and restaurant on (and called) Fifth Floor. Well rated, offering french-modern cuisine. Excellent wine list (not just CA wines, strong on Burgundy). Good food. However, over priced. Small but servicable gym. We've stayed at places costing twice as much that haven't matched the Palomar (Klimpton owned).

<Content>nice and different The Palomar is not what we expected. It is very modern and has an understated European luxury feel to it. While the room was immaculate, it seemed small and the bathroom door gave little privacy. The Staff was very friendly and helpful. Our room on the 4th floor had an outstanding view! The restaraunt is hidden and there really is no lobby to speak of, so waiting for friends to arrive was not convienent. On departure they offered a Lincoln Town car to take us to the Airport for the same price as a Taxi. A nice touch to end our vacation. All in all, not a bad place to stay. But I felt out of place as a tourist. It seems more like a high end Hotel for the Business traveller. The location was very conveinent to the cable cars, street cars and subway. DavidinHartford.

<Content>Nice Rooms If you are looking for large rooms in SF, then Palomar may be a great value. While it is expensive during the week, they have great weekend rates and the rooms are huge in comparison. We had a suite and our friends had a standard room, and we were both very happy with the accomodations. We found the staff very helpful. The only knock I would have is that the restaurant is overpriced. We would definitely stay again. Can't beat the location if you want be near Union Square.

<Content>nice hotel we stayed in the palomar in november 2004 for a week. we visit the usa on a fairly regular basis and never book a hotel without checking the reviews on tripadvisor. having read the reviews we decided to book our stay.we were not dissapointed, the rooms are very nice, the bed was the best we have ever slept in, the staff were pleasant and helpful, and the hotel is centrally located, union square being only a few minutes walk away. we never dined in the restaurant but did have breakfast one morning, the food was great if a little pricey, we would definitely stay there again. well worth its four stars.

<Content>We loved it! Great location, great staff, great decor. Shower pressure could be better. It's true, it is a hassle to have to go downstairs to grab coffee. We were pretty surprised by this too, but we really didn't mind much. It was actually kind of nice to get out and stretch our legs in the morning.The staff is incredibly friendly, helpful, prompt, and polite. They had good recommendations, and were very accomodating with any requests.We didn't get a chance to try the restaurant.We stayed in a Deluxe King room on the 5th floor for an average of $167 per night. Not bad for the days around New Year's Eve. No street noise, great decor, big room. CD player and free newspaper in the morning were nice touches.My biggest complaint was the water pressure in the shower. It may have just been our room, but it should have had a lot more water pressure. Otherwise the bathroom was comfortable and clean. Really didn't like the Aveda shampoo and conditioner at all, IMHO. Smelled more like salad dressing than shampoo, but that's just me. Dries out your hair pretty badly too. I'd bring my own next time.Also, I was very grateful to the reviewer who mentioned the parking rates are $36 per day. I believe they have now been increased to $37. At first we thought this was outrageous, but when we called around to other hotels, we found that this was actually fairly standard for the area.Lastly, the location is IDEAL! Right next to market street, Union Square, shops, restaurants, etc.We would definitely stay there again.

<Content>LOVED the Palomar!! Just returned from a 3 night stay at the Palomar and it was fantastic! Who cares if they have a coffee maker in their room? Everything about the place was great. We took a morning flight so we got to the hotel way before check-in time. The front desk said no problem, we can put you in an inside room now or store your luggage while you explore the city and we'll give you a city view room later! Took the latter suggestion and when we arrived back our room was ready. The room was not the biggest I've ever seen (what in San Francisco is) but was very stylish and clean. The bed was as good as sleeping at home! The Aveda bath products were a great treat! Everyone on staff at the Palomar was courteous, polite and VERY helpful. The location is perfect for Union Square shopping and exploring by public transportation. I wouldn't think of staying anywhere else when visiting San Francisco!

<Content>Great location, great fun... My recent stay at the Palomar has revived my love for the Kimpton Group hotels. Recent stays at a couple of their locations were a bit disappointing in terms of overall condition and maintanance- no doubt it's difficult to keep up with high room turnover- however this was not at all the case at the Palomar. I never had occasion to use the Concierge but the desk staff was always pleasant and accomodating (a noisy fan in my first room was easily resolved by a move to a new room) with a friendly greeting each and everytime I came or went. The location is unbeatable- being close to Union Square, the business district, public transportation if you need it, etc.- and the rooms themselves are quiet and very comfortable (high marks for the fun and kicky decore) with great housekeeping. A very pleasant expereince compels me to give this hotel very high marks.

<Content>Great design hotel I respectfully disagree with the coffee complainers who have posted recently. If you want that, stay at the chain hotels. This place is for people who appreciate good design. It is residential in feeling, and unbelievably comfortable in that dark-wood, cocoon way. I felt very hip staying here! The front desk staff and bellmen were friendly and helpful. Breakfast in the Fifth Floor restaurant was quite good, if a bit expensive. Can't beat the location, either. For dinner, try Annabelle's a couple of doors down. It is very good.

<Content>Style over substance A friend suggested we stay at the Palomar because of its location and restaurant. This has put a strain on our friendship. The Kimpton Group, which manages the Palomar, must believe that style is the only thing needed to satisfy its customers. The front desk staff was less than helpful on virtual every request. Don鈥檛 bother with the concierge they never return your calls. The coffee being served in Styrofoam cups in the lobby was a nice touch. I can accept a high price for a very small room if it is accompanied by good customer service. That was not the case at the Palomar.

<Content>Friendly staff, loved the decor, where's the coffee? I agree with all the other reviewers: this is a great little hotel with very friendly staff. My wife arranged for us to have a room with an extra-long bed, which was a treat -- go for this if you're over 6'4.A few folks note the absence of a coffee maker. This is a huge mistake. I want my caffeine without having to trudge to the lobby. We stayed on the 5th floor, where the pretentious restaurant is. We slept in till ten, and the restaurant was already closed, contrary to advertising. So I threw clothes on, went to the lobby, and there was a crowd around the coffee carafes, and regular was out.If you can provide me with a CD player and music to listen to, you can provide me with a coffee maker. Every Holiday Inn Express has one. It does not detract from your ultra Zen hip coolness to have a friggin' coffee maker in the room!The hotel does not serve lunch and you can't get coffee on demand. This is a great hotel, but it is not full service.

<Content>Nice, but give me in-room coffee and reasonable wine prices We stayed at the Palomar Nov. 18th-19th. Booked their great rate of $129. The hotel is very beautiful, and the rooms very nicely appointed. My husband enjoyed the tall room with the extra long king bed and high showerhead. Our only gripes were that there are no in-room coffee makers (probably too tacky for their decor), and the wines-by-the-glass were extremely expensive. We don't want to have to get dressed and traipse down to the lobby for morning coffee, or deal with pricey room service in the morning just for a cuppa joe. Sorry. (The Relais-Chateaux hotels have the common sense to put coffee/tea service in the hallways, at least.) And while I appreciate their hand-picked wine list, they could offer more reasonably-priced selections. It's California after all, land of countless great wineries and of course 2-buck Chuck! Pretentious wine lists don't impress me. I'd consider going back if those two issues were addressed.

<Content>Palomar Hotel was Wonderful!! Stayed for 3 nights and loved the hotel. The location is perfect. We walked to Fisherman's Wharf, Chinatown, the Ferry Building etc... The Bart Station is right under the hotel too. Very convenient to take the Bart to Oakland Airport and a lot less expensive than a town car. (60.00 vs. 5.15). Rooms are ultra-hip and spotless. We had an Executive King on the 5th floor, and the street noise was barely audible. Great view of the Flood Building, and Stockton St. Very comfortable bed, pillows, chair etc.. bathroom has ample counter space and great Aveda products. Their gym is small but adequate. We really enjoyed the Serenity Channel and the Yoga Channel. Great coffee in the lobby every morning too.  We would definitely stay at this hotel again. The staff treated us royally and couldn't do enough for us.

<Content>great stay in the city..... Palomar is a small hip hotel. Make sure that if you bring a car that you get the parking package or else it is 36 bucks a day. Location is ok, a short walk to Union Square. A little nicer than the W hotel. Fifth Floor restaurant was very good but not mind blowing, bring a load of money to pay for it.

<Content>Would go back in a heartbeat! Picked up the Hotel Palomar thru Priceline and what a surprise. Very pleasant greeting at the door and the front desk and the lobby was small but nicely decorated.Our room, on the sith floor, was very well furnished with a nice mix of textures and colors and a very comfortable bed. I would definitely go back to this boutique hotel and pay the standard rate. It's also located about 1 block from the cable car turnaroud (and BART station) on Market Street. This also puts it about 3 blocks south of Union Square and one block north of the Moscone Center.

<Content>Super friendly, attentive staff I'd seen the Palomar featured on the cable show Great Hotels, and made it my mission to visit there. It was better than I expected. Every person working there was extremely friendly  made me feel as if my comfort was a priority. The contemporary decor was wonderful  exactly suited to my taste. After my 3-day stay, I knew several employees by name  look forward to returning in a few months. The Hotel Palomar will always be my hotel of choice in San Francisco. I only have one minor suggestion - guests could use just a little more drawer space for clothes. A small chest of drawers would solve that  not take anything away from the lovely rooms.

<Content>Very nice, Zen place. We stayed at Palomar for three nights. It was very nice - loved the leopard skin carpet, as well as the rest of the modern-yet-warm furnishings. Very complete room except for the noticeable absence of a coffee maker. There was, however, free coffee in the lobby until 10:30am.Good location for shopping or tourists. Free wireless internet was great, but the TV did not offer many channels. The serenity channel was kind of a kick, and my girlfriend liked the yoga channel. This is kind of a Zen place. (there was even a copy of The Teachings of Buddha next to the Bible!)The clock radio could not seem to get decent reception of any channels. The honor bar was well stocked, but pricey (no surprise there). Once again we were happy to find Aveda toiletries, and we took as many home as we could!We found the staff rather helpful, and they were super friendly. Every staff member that passed us would offer a greeting. (certainly mandated by the management)One word of caution: parking was $36 per night!Have dinner at LuLu's if you can - they have a well-stocked bar, and our bartender was great (a blonde, bespectacled woman). Avoid Annabelle's Bistro - we had a bad experience there.

<Content>A real disappointment Palomar reviewWe were put in a very small room (Cruise ship cabin size) rm 519.Cheerful staff, but not really helpful. We asked for additional towels, but they never arrived. The front desk did not have any change for tips (no change for a $20). The Fifth Floor lounge is supposed to close at 12:00 on Friday, but was not serving any more after 11:00pm. The in room safe is located in the small closet, need to remove bag stand and any luggage in closet to access room safe. Could be considered an extra level of security.$36-per day parking charge is the highest I have ever paid. take BART then cab it. There are the usual assortment of bums and winos on Market Street, but not in front of the hotel.This place is not worth the money-definitely not a 4 star property in my opinion.The view of Old Navy from our cabin was a new take on window shopping , some interior rooms had a view of a garden with fountain.comfy bed, very sm bath, pocket door, nice furnishings in room.Other rooms seemed a little bigger than ours. We did not have time when we checked in to request another room. I don't know if it would have helped.Newspapers available only if you ask they are not offered or provided with room service breakfast.

<Content>Cool hotel, Immature employees The hotel, in itself, was awesome. The room was cute with a nice view and a great location. However, the front desk could care less about you. They made rude remarks about guests in front of me. Hung out talking to each other and ignoring guests. Also, DO NOT use the concierge. We tried 7 times to get alcatraz tickets through them and they never left us a message to confirm whether they succeeded in arranging the tickets. Finally, they told us we were booked and could go anytime. But when we arrived to the pier, we were told that we had a specific time and that we missed our boat. Consequently we had to wait standby for two hours. Terrible service!!!!

<Content>Outstanding Service My family and I travelled to Sonoma to attend a wedding. We stayed one night at the Palomar. The rooms are beautifully decorated. The beds are incredibly comfortable. The bathrooms are gorgeous. However, what most impressed us was the level of customer service the staff provided. Although we only stayed a short time, the staff could not have been more gracious. They allowed us to check in early, booked us a tour of the city, acquired baseball tickets for us, made us dinner reservations, and rented us a car to drive to Sonoma County. I cannot compliment the hotel enough on the level of service and quality of the employees. I recommend the hotel to everyone I know who may travel to San Francisco. I would never stay anywhere else in that city. Bravo and keep up the good work.

<Content>Loved the Palomar, hated the neighborhood We stayed at the Palomar for two nights in August, 2004. The hotel is very comfortable and the staff is outstanding. They go out of their way to assist with directions or whatever you need. However, the area around the hotel is unappealing. Many homeless on the street were upsetting to my kids, who are 11 and 15. Really didn't feel very safe on the streets around there. Wouldn't recommend for families. Complimentary tea and coffee were wonderful in the morning, but it would be nice if they also offered hot chocolate.

<Content>Nice hotel, but not for the price My husband I stayed in the hotel during valentine's day weekend this year. The staff was friendly and decor is very nice and modern. I was told when I booked my room, I'd be given an updated...well, it didn't happen. When we got to our room, it was small. The entrance to our door was right next to another room. We could here those people coming in and out of their room...and we could even hear them play there music loud. The bed was not comfy at all. The pictures of the rooms and bathrooms on the website looks better. I must say though, the hotel is conveniently located near Yerba Buena Gardens, Sony Meteron, Union Square (shopping) and the cable cars. If you don't care about room, but would like something close to everything, then come here. Otherwise, I don't think it's worth it.

<Content>Beautiful hotel, AWFUL service We stayed at the Palomar after several days in wine country were we stayed at the Carneros Inn (see my review of that great place!). The hotel is beautiful. Our room (a luxury King) was very comfortable with a large jazuzzi tub for two, a view of Market Street and double insulated windows for quiet. We ate at the Fifth Floor where the food is interesting and thoughtful, I would recommend eating here but staying elsewhere. The problem with the hotel is the service. We called for turn down service twice and only got it upon our third request when the housekeeper knocked on our door at 5pm in response to a 7:30 service request. Okay, fine. Later, when we ordered room service quite late at night, it took 50 minutes, arrived cold and the server did not a pen! Our tub would not drain and they never came to fix it so we would have to wedge a comb under the drain lid to keep it up to drain. When we checked out, we asked for a taxi and was directed to a Town Car that would have cost $20 more than a yellow cab. Some people like that but we found it a bit presumptous. Stay here if you like hip surroundings, just need a room and nothing else.

<Content>Swanky, but very Comfortable We stayed at the Palomar for two nights on our way to Maui and were so pleased to have picked this place as our stop over. The employees were so friendly and helpful. The rooms weren't huge but were plenty big and were decorated very chic. The hotel bar was great, the bartenders were very entertaining and the drinks were poured with a heavy hand :) It had a great location, just steps from the trolly turnaround. I highly recommend this hotel!

<Content>A Hotel that Wreaks Perfection Any traveler that appreciates boutique hotels MUST visit the Palomar when in San Francisco. I spent two nights there after researching boutique hotels on the internet and this one just kept coming back to me as the one to choose. What a great decision!!! For starters great door service, very friendly, informative and helpful front desk, georgous decorated rooms (we had a standard King), a tiny lobby but beautiful and classy, pet friendly (I brought my Yorkie and he received his own water  food bowls), the breakfast was a bit pricey but gourmet, the location is right in the heart of everything in San Francisco and yet you can't hear a sound from inside the rooms knowing that just outside is the hustle and bustle of the city!A simple yet lovely Zen Garden accentuates the inner courtyard of the hotel from window view. Great decor!!!! WE LOVED IT!!!!! Everything was fantastic! Next trip we plan on trying out one of their suites. This hotel is a must stay!

<Content>The Palomar is amazing... The Hotel Palomar was everything I had hoped for- so much that I鈥檓 not sure to begin! I found the Palomar through an air/hotel package for a great price, and we visited from July 15th to the 18th. Our flight arrived earlier then the official check in time, but the staff allowed us to check in, which was nice. Located right off of 4th street in downtown SF, the Palomar proved to have an amazing location right off of Union Square. The lobby was sophisticated and a bit on the small side, but that is not a complaint! The employees were gracious and professional every time we passed them on our way out or in, no matter the time. The room was on the trendy side of gorgeous: spacious with comfortable beds, a great size bathroom, and several amenities (cd player, fax machine, and cordless phone, added to the money safe and locked bar). Our view was toward Union Square, but the lights weren鈥檛 a problem when the curtain was closed, and we couldn鈥檛 hear any noise from outside. The bar/restaurant was a great addition as well (martinis were wonderful). The day we checked out the hotel kept our bags until out flight left to allow us to sightsee with ease, and reclaim out baggage quickly. Simply put, our stay was perfect. The Hotel Palomar was one of the best hotels that I have ever stayed at, and I will be staying there again when I return to San Francisco!

<Content>Feb of 2004 I loved it. Simply put it was a great hotel in the heart of SF. You are by the Bart Station and the Trolley cars. You are near a Walgreen鈥檚 so if you are missing any of your toiletries or looking for that small snack you can go there in a heart beat.The Lobby is small but it makes it up for its decor and service. The rooms were great. I had plenty of room with a nice view of the city. The noise level was that of a city so I was fine. They had ample closet space and within the closet was a user friendly room safe. The bed linins were soft and the pillows not rock hard or super soft. I had a wonderful good night sleep with their comfy bed. It was very nice to have a mini stereo system that allowed me to play my CDs and they offered Yoga straps, blocks and mats if one wanted to practice yoga along with the program they play on the Hotel TV channel. The bath products were Avada so very user friendly and not to mention great product line. The mini bar was well stocked with great products if one chooses to indulge. The maid service was prompt and changed my linins and towels each day. I ate the 5th restaurant which is rated one of the best in the city. Great food with lots of creativity. They had an extensive wine list which one should not miss. The food was not only presented well but taste was absolutely to die for. The fusion of east and west was well established and melded well. Believe me I have ate my fair share of bad fusion food.Overall this is a great hotel. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Loved the Palomar Have stayed 8 days at the Palomar, and overall, it was a wonderful experience. We had a suite, and my son loved that, because he had his own TV!!! There is a fabulous bathroom with a jacuzzi, and the bedroom furnishing is lush with faux animal skin carpet and emerald green velvet... There were double paned windows, so sound was never a problem. Staff was friendly and helpful. Area was close to many things, though I personally did not feel the safest walking around at night(then again, in which city does one these days?) Would absolutely stay there again...

<Content>Perfect luxury location for Moscone events When forced to attend a conference at the Moscone, this little hotel is perfect. It is two blocks away from the convention center, has excellent wireless service, a staff that continues to try to please customers and is small enough to avoid the bulk of conventioners. Of note, room service does not start early enough to be useful on the weekends. However, the restaurant is user friendly. I was quite pleased with the attitudes and demeanor of the staff. Highly recommend.

<Content>Made my 30th Birthday Special The Palomar was my first destination when visiting the West Coast in February 2004. We stayed for 5 nights and I celebrated my 30th birthday there. We did not eat in the hotel so cannot comment on the food but found it be ideal for our needs, perfectly situated, modern and clean and the staff were excellent. We turned up out of the blue one day with a couple of bicycles we had hired and they kindly helped us to store these for a couple of nights. Staff recommended places to go and eat and were pleasant and helpful at all times particularly when it came for us to hire a car, they provided a map and directions to our next destination - Lake Tahoe. Our last night we booked to stay at the far more expensive Parc 55 hotel and it was appalling. Situated right on the edge of the rough part of town, Tenderloin. If you want a large grand fancy lobby with crap service, small dirty rooms and staff who are uninterested and barely speak English then I strongly recommend Parc 55. If however, you want a clean, stylish and tranquil place to relax then the Palomar will be right up your street. I cannot recommend the hotel highly enough. I wish so much we had booked in here for the last night of our holiday and would not hesitate to return.

<Content>Four star location, one star service The palomar is an elegant hotel with a good central downtown location. The restaurant is rated highly by a number of gourment magazines and rooms are pleasant if on the small side. However the front desk staff have no interest in helping customers outside of routine check in and check out. Service is more akin to a 1 star hotel.I would rate the hotel 4 stars for location and 1 star for service

<Content>Fabulous Hotel, Zero Complaints! Stayed at the Palomar for three nights (06/02-06/05) and had a wonderful experience. The location is perfect: close to Union Square, Market Street, and Transit. Very stylish hotel with modern decor and comfortable beds. We had a eighth-floor room facing Fourth Street, but noise was never a factor! The service from check-in to check-out was flawless and pleasant. Mel's Diner, one-half block away, is a reasonably priced and good option for breakfast. If you bring a car, the Fifth  Mission Garage is a half-block away and is only $20 a night. Well worth the extra $$$, since there are definitely some crummy hotels in this city!

<Content>The Palomar is the BEST! This is the best place we've stayed in SF and we go up there frequently! The biggest problem I find in SF hotels is the street noise, especially in the older boutique hotels. This place is whisper quiet (we had a courtyard facing room). The room itself was very nice. Dinner at the Fifth Floor was as good as I had hoped for! Another bonus is ease of both getting there and getting back out to the freeway. This can be a huge pain in many locations. The Palomar is now at the top of my list for our next trip.

<Content>Nice botique hotel This hotel is great! The rooms are avg. size, very clean, stocked with all the ammenities you need. Staff is very helpful. Location is near shopping, cable car turn around and convenient to public transportation which is so reasonable. If you get a room away from the street it's very quiet. Their top rated restaurant has fabulous food with astronomical prices. Wait staff is enthusiastic tho a tad young. Omly drawback that being on Market St. you see a lot of pan handlers.

<Content>Great Suite! We stayed at the lovely Palomar the weekend of 3/14/04 - it was a belated Valentine's Day gift from my husband. In that I love boutique hotels, this was another pleasant surprise in the heart of downtown San Francisco (my fav being the Pan Pacific). These rooms were much larger, and although the bathroom was not as elegant as the Pan, the Fuji bathtub was wonderful - so good for soaking the feet after hitting the streets all day. I filled it to the brim knowing that I was depleting the world of water!! It was very very relaxing. The room was a bit too contemporary for me, but did not detract from my stay.I have two complaints about the room. The way our suite was set up, you couldn't sit on the sofa and look directly at the t.v. You had to lay on the sofa to be head-on with the t.v. Also, there are no coffee making faciliites. In a room that is over $400/night, you would expect to find such a convenience - after all...you get that in the $59/night Best Western!My big gripe with the area, not the hotel, is that you are in downtown San Francisco, and there are few good restaurants around, so it's either order from room service or go to the bistro down the street (and by the way, room service gets its food from the bistro down the street). So if you are going to stay at the Palomar, keep that in mind. You will either have to go to the financial or theater district or go elsewhere. If you DO get to Fisherman's Wharf, eat at Scoma's - they have the best (albeit expensive) seasfood going!I'd stay at the Paloma again, but before I'd go back, I'd stay at the Hotel Monaco - it's sister hotel (both are pet-friendly by the way).BY THE WAY - SKIP THE COURTYARD ROOMS. All you see is 3 other interior walls and you look down through a glass roof into Old Navy. This is a gripe I almost forgot. We got to the hotel early and stowed our luggage and went to get lunch (see note above about eateries in the area) and do some shopping. We hiked all the way to Chinatown before finding any place for lunch - the hotels in the area do not have coffee shops! Anyway, the front desk told us to be back at 2 pm, and we were, and our room still wasn't ready. The staff said that the people were still checking out. They had us wait in the 5th floor loung, very very dark- no coffee pot, no water, no nothing but couches  lounge chairs. 45 minutes later, I sent my husband to complain. The front desk said the couple had spilled something on the carpet  they were cleaning it up, and did we want an interior room instead. DO NOT GET AN INTERIOR ROOM (see note above). If we had been given our exterior room, we would have been able to sit there and watch the St. Patrick's Day parade on Sunday. The view stunk. All in all, maybe I won't go back there again. I think I'll stay down by the Wharf where there's tons of restaurants  things to do (but I STILL loved that bathtub)!

<Content>Great room, poor service, and fraudulent advertising I stayed at the Hotel Palomar for 6 nights in March. I found a deal for 137/night on Orbitz and I saw on Palomar's website that they offer to match any internet rate and to include with that a free upgrade to the best available room (offer has since changed to best room in next 'tier.' While they honored the rate, the refused to honor the upgrade, even though a quick check on the web showed that better rooms were available. (I read about this exact problem right here on trip-advisor reviews, so I wasn't surprised). They basically said that the room I got WAS an upgrade, because it was an exterior room, instead of an interior room. This is just ridiculous, because their website, on which they promise the upgrade, makes no mention of this distinction. And besides, the deal we were offered said best available room, not slightly better room. When I discussed this problem with Brian Fenwick, the general manager, he was rude and unhelpful (another review on this website makes this same point; take note, Kimpton Group!!). He claimed that the website booking system was incorrect about better rooms being available and that I WAS, in fact, in the best available room. Before speaking with Brian, I had a friend call the front desk and try to book a suite; she was informed that they had several suites available. When I told this to Brian, he said that while the rooms may be available to others for booking, but that they were allotted, so he was unable to upgrade me. This is nonsense. I'm not sure what is more disturbing: that they wouldn't honor the upgrade, or that Brian would tell a bold-faced lie and say the rooms were unavailable. Besides this unpleasantness, the hotel was fine: a nice big room, service once a day (although they say you should get it twice), and a big clean bathroom. Just don't expect the web upgrade deal to be honored.

<Content>Love the Palomar I have had the pleasure to stay at the Palomar on numerous occasions. While my husband was working in San Francisco it became our second home. The rooms are large by city standards, and the staff is friendly and helpful. The location is perfect, and they have one of the best restaurants in the city. I always recommend this hotel to friends if they are going to stay in the San Francisco.

<Content>Very Classy Our whole family recently stayed at the Hotel Palomar in one of their 2-bedroom suites. (January 30) We had a gift certificate from Kimpton Hotels, and decided to splurge with an overnight in San Francisco (though we only live 45 minutes away) when we went to see The Lion King.We were cheerfully greeted by the doorman each time we came and went. In fact, on Saturday, when the staff was different (and less friendly, by the way) my 10-year-old daughter mentioned that she missed that nice door guy.Our room was beautifully decorated and very comfortable. The furnishings, carpet, lamps and accessories were tasteful and sophisticated. All of the artwork on the walls was gorgeous and interesting, and we even had a live palm in the dining area. Two of the kids donned their swim suits and sat in the bathtub as though it were a hot tub. Having such a deep Fuji tub was definitely a treat! We loved looking down on Market St. from our huge windows throughout the suite. There were two free apples and two free bottles of water waiting for us, as well as a VERY well-stocked mini-bar and fridge that we had to quickly keep the kids away from!The exercise room has a nice view of the rooftop garden and an interesting view through the glass ceiling of the Old Navy store that the hotel sits on top of. Although we didn't eat there, the restaurant was quite striking with a very appetizing menu. Someday without the kids...I was very happy with the location and the level of service. We only stayed one night, and I left wanting to stay a few more. I would definitely recommend this as a classy and comfortable place to spend time in San Francisco.

<Content>Palomar is Perfection! From the moment we arrived at the Hotel Palomar we knew we had found a wonderful hotel. The staff went out of their way to assist us with recommendations for the area as well as getting us settled into our room. Any questions we had were quickly answered. We stayed there 2 nights, January 20-23, 2004. The first night we stayed in the deluxe King room which we found to be spacious and beautifully decorated. Aveda bath products made for a relaxing shower. The second night they upgraded us to a room with a jacuzzi. Because we were out during the day they even moved our luggage for us to the new room. The jacuzzi was large enough for 2 (as was the shower next to it) and it was sooooo relaxing. Each room has a CD player, TV, mini-bar, and lots for business travelers (such as fax  internet). The beds have puffy down pillows and a down comforter so it was very cozy. Everyone from the doormen who opened the door as we rounded the corner towards the hotel to the front desk workers went out of their way to make us feel welcome and pampered. The hotel location is perfect as well since it is just 1 block from the cable car and underground and the buses and street cars stop right at the corner. See's candy being about 1/2 block away was nice too! The Hotel Palomar was the perfect spot to see San Francisco and made for a romantic get-away. I would happily return and heartily recommend it to anyone looking for a place to see the city while being treated like royalty.

<Content>The lowest level of service that I have ever had to deal with  The Kimpton Group did a great job with the decor of the Palomar hotel. I stayed at the Palomar when it first opened and was extremely happy with the staff, and accommodations. Recently, I visited the Palomar again and it will be the last time. Brian the so call General Manager was the most unprofessional person in the hotel. He is rude when addressing me by my first name and I made appoint to ask him not to do so, however he used my first name once again. Later, my girl friend was in the lobby and overheard Brian discussing with his staff the fact that when he has his own hotel company he wouldn't take business similar to myself. I spent over $2,500 in four days t the Palomar and that we be the last penny that the Kimpton Group will see from me unless they remove people like Brian.

<Content>Great location, but beware! After extensive research, we chose the Palomar hotel for a three day stay just before Thanksgiving. Rates run $175-400, but if you look on sites like Expedia you can get a deal (we paid $119/night) The hotel's own website says that they will match any rate you find on the web, and give you an upgrade to the best room available if you book through them....Do NOT believe them! They honored the rate, but would not upgrade us, even though upgraded rooms and suites were available (we checked through the website). The room was clean and fairly small, but the bed was comfy, and we didn't spend any time in the room anyway. Also, VERY IMPORTANT....parking is $36/day plus $5/day tax=$41/day to park your car.....more than the cost of the rental car! Front desk clerks double as the concierge and are generally useless....they can read off a list of suggested places to see/eat, but have no knowledge of their own. Bottom line.....not bad for $119/night because you are steps from Union Square and a short walk to Chinatown, but if you are used to 5 star service/quality, this isn't the place for you.

<Content>Mediocre service but nice rooms If you are a non-smoker like me, make sure you check in early. We booked a non-smoking room with late check in. When we arrived they checked us in but did not tell us we were being put in a smoking room. We got to the room and found a distinct odor of stale smoke in the furniture and bedding - and the windows did not open. Since the hotel was sold out, they refused to move us until the next morning, and the staff were not overly apologetic about the situation. They said non-smoking rooms are not guarenteed to any guests- had I known this I might not have stayed there!! However, to be fair, once we were moved our stay was much more pleasant. The beds are extremely comfy and the rooms are very classy. Unfortunately there is no real lobby to speak of, and I often felt like a number rather than a valued guest. I was in San Francisco for a special occasion with my boyfriend, and was disappointed by the service. I would recommend this hotel to others but would advise you to check in early for a room with a decent view and a room that does not smell like an ashtray.

<Content>Excellent It was our visit from to SF from Scotland and thought the hotel location was fantastic, as were the rooms. The fuji spa tub was definitely required after a whole day pounding the sreets of SF. The only minor gripe was the non availibilty of coffee making facilities in the room and the too formal lounge/restaurant which appeared slightly intimidating for those on vacation. Otherwise, we would recommend this hotel to anyone as it contributed greatly to a stay in a city that we completely fell in love with.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel! Great Location! We just returned from our first trip to San Francisco. We loved the entire trip and the Palomar was wonderful. We stayed in their smallest rooms, which were ample in size for a downtown hotel. Service was excellent. We had the breakfast package, which I highly recommend. Breakfast was at the Fifth Floor Restaurant and it was superb! Lastly, the location of the hotel was great. We were practically across the street from Union Sqaure and Chinatown was only a few blocks away. I highly recommend this hotel!

<Content>great hotel My wife and I stayed at the Palomar for 5 nights starting the Saturday of Labor day weekend. I had done a lot of research and thought this hotel would be the best for us. We were not disappointed. The hotel is in a fantastic location right on Market street and close to everything. The service was great and our room was wonderful. We had reserved a luxury king and were upgraded to the suite. The room was very nice. It was great having the bedroom separate from the rest of the room and the fuji tub is very nice. We did opt to get a car while in San Franciso and while the parking rate of $36/day is a bit steep it was well worth having the freedom to explore the Bay area by car. The valet was extremely helpful w/ directions and telling us the best way to get around. We used the car to go to Muir Woods, Golden Gate Bridge and Park, Montery Bay, Carmel, the 17 mile drive and to Napa. We would highly recommend going to San Franciso if you have never been. The weather is perfect and the city is awesome. If you do go you cannot go wrong staying at the Palomar.

<Content>Luxury hotel with down-home service After conducting extensive web research, I chose the Palomar for my stay in San Francisco last week on vacation. I found a wonderful deal for the room, but I was concerned my husband and I would be stuck in the broom closet. Thankfully, my fears were unfounded. Staying at the Palomar was overall a lovely experience, during which we were treated as first class guests. I will say, though, that I missed having a real lobby area, and the concierge service was spotty, since the concierge also doubles as a front-desk worker (believe me, the desk can be quite busy at all times of the day). However, all the staff were quite friendly and tried to be helpful in any way. The room was well-decorated, the beds were comfortable, and the towels/bath fixtures were sumptuous. Be sure to take advantage of the Fifth Floor restaurant -- the hotel holds a few tables for hotel guests, so there's no need to try for an impossible-to-get reservation before you go. While pricey, the dining experience is worth it!! The location is prime, close to all public transportation, yet somehow the interior of the hotel managed to be completely sound-proof to the extremely noisy street. Very relaxing environment. Check around on the major travel websites for deals on this hotel, and you won't be disappointed.

<Content>Palomar: Polarized opinions I don't expect much from a hotel except for a room and bed. The Palomar failed to meet that standard by refusing my reservation and referring me to the Marriott on day 1. No big deal, it happens. The next day at 3pm the front desk took 45 minutes to check me in because they were still oversold. I basically blew 2 days begging my way in to this place, and still couldn't get a king bedded room. The staff appears to be doing everything for the first time, learning as they go. They really should get their act together. No internet access in my room, when I asked the concierge for the local Yahoo dialup number he offered to change my room (not again!). He didn't get me the phone number, must've been too difficult a request. Nice rooms, comparable to a W, more or less. With such polarized experiences with the Palomar, I'd suggest you stay elsewhere in SF, it's a great city with lots of other hotel choices!
