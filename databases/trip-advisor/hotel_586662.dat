<Content>Average Hotel but Great Location This hotel is in a great location. There is a tram stop within two blocks and an excellent coffee shop (non-hash) a few doors down. The Rembrandtplein, with all of its cafes, bars, and shops, is only two blocks away. The central location of this hotel will enable you to explore most of Amsterdam on foot.The hotel staff was nice enough to check me in early on a Friday morning. Each room does have free internet service but mine did not work and was not fixed until the following Monday. The front desk staff did not seem to be in any hurry to get it fixed and all they would do is write the service call in a book at the reservation desk.The room itself was really small but the bathroom was very adequate. I had a single bed and it was really small. The television worked well and had two English stations. The housekeeping service could be very late in the day and sometimes did not come until 5 p.m. The front desk staff were professional but certainly, in now way, outgoing or overly friendlyThe best quality of this hotel is definitely the location.

<Content>Hip Hotel in Great Neighborhood I was really impressed with this hotel. We just got a standard room and the room was plenty big for us. There's two types of shower heads - rain shower or regular. I was also really amazed at the kicking night life all around us. However the hotel is on a quiet side street so we didn't hear anything in our room. We were a bit of a walk from the red light district but close to the museums. The only complaint I had is that there is no alarm clock. We had an early morning flight back. The front desk forgot to call our room and we nearly missed our flight. So be sure to take an alarm clock.

<Content>worthy of its grading A quick pre-xmas break to enjoy the sights and lights and chill. A great success, not least because of the enjoyment of the Eden....certainly not a let down. Well worth paying for the upgraded superior room because of the additional space, although wardrobe space was very limited. The room made the hotel feel like a 4 star, as did the ground floor public spaces. Luckily not too busy as our original non-smoking room reeked of smoke. As before the corridors and carpet were tatty and the coffee and creamer satchets not fully replaced on day two which was a pain. Also we were unable to use the printer in the reception area to print our e-tickets for the journey home...a big let down, as was having to pay for wifi. On a positive note the room was very clean and my partner certainly enjoyed the big bed and the Villeroy  Boch bath was a delight, as was BBC1 on strictly final night!!!. Recommended?, a big yes. Easy to get to once you've mastered the tramstops ( would suggest too far to struggle with a big suitcase ), and boisterous Rembrandt Square is close ( two minute walk ) but not too close for late night discomfort. Trams run into the small hours so thats a bonus with the location. You can walk to Central Station via shopping streets but leave the cash at home, its much cheaper in the UK, even duty free was more expensive than UK supermarkets. Just remembered, the aircon maxed out at 28 degrees so the larger than average room did feel a bit too cool for December, and they could have done with more tourist brochures in the reception area about what to do in Amsterdam although there was a Concierge available.

<Content>Comfortable beds! We stayed here for 3 nights and were very pleased with the size of our rooms, nice clean comfortable beds and pillows. The beds are typical of those in Europe - 2 single beds pushed together. This not only gives a nice large bed, it also means you don't have to fight for the duvet as you get one each. We'd booked the deluxe rooms and they were a reasonable size, at the back of the building and were very quiet. The bathroom was a good size too. The rooms were clean, but the housekeeping after that was not very good. We had to ask every day for extra tea/coffee etc as the amounts left in the room were very frugal, especially as the weather was so cold (we had snow) and wanted to warm up with hot drinks. We were only given one robe and no slippers. We requested them at reception twice, but they never appeared - very frustrating when you've paid for a deluxe room! On the Sunday we had a picnic breakfast in the room with our friends (not too many places open for breakfast on a Sunday in November,  breakfast at the hotel is extremely expensive) so there were quite a few crumbs on the floor. They were still there after the room had been serviced (even this was not done till 5.00pm).The concierge was very helpful and attentive.The hotel is well placed for exploring both the canals and the architecture. We had lots of long walks, even in the snow. There are plenty of very good places to eat, or sit and have a drink and watch the world go by.We'd still stay at the hotel again, as everything apart from housekeeping was good.

<Content>Great location, Clean, lovely rooms  Booked via Booking.com 鈧?40/拢110 + 鈧? City Tax on arrival. Ideally we wanted something much cheaper, but with a month to go before the trip it was hard to find somewhere without a minimum two nights stay that met my most important criteria. The place had to be clean!When we walked into the reception we were greeted by a lovely lady who was very friendly and helpful. When we opened the door to our room we were extremely happy. A very large and very comfy double bed, modern decor and a flat screen TV on the wall with lots of English Channels. The bathroom is great too with big bath and very powerful shower.The location is great. 5/10 min walk from Flower market, right on Thorbeckplein which is a buzzing area with nice restaurants and cool coffee shops.Didn't have breakfast as it wasn't included so this may not suit those on a real tight budget.I would recommend this hotel for those persons who don't mind paying that little extra for a professionally run hotel with and excellent standard of clean accomodation.

<Content>Pleasantly Surprised I was pleasantly surprised by this hotel. Upon walking into the lobby you immediately think to yourself This place is going to be tacky, old and dirty, and then when you walk into your room, you realize it is decorated exceptionally well, as the place is very nice.Here are my pros and cons:PROS:-modern decor- very soft beds with plenty of pillows and blankets- nice lighting- quiet (I cannot hear anyone around me)- minibar- plenty of storage space- flat panel tv -friendly service (concierge is very helpful with luggage and recommendations around the city)CONS:- room shows extensive wear and has banged up walls- odd art in the room (painted arrow above the bed?)- room is a little cramped/has a narrow entrance- breakfast buffet is 17.00- no free wireless in room (but there IS free ethernet, but you must sit at the desk to use)- bathtub didnt drain well - must be cloggedOverall I was very impressed. It just needs a few coats of paint, free wireless in the rooms, and a cheaper breakfast, and it would be just about perfect in my eyes.

<Content>Very pleased with hotel and location We stayed here for a total of 4 nights. The location was excellent. It was not located in the middle of the overcrowded, cheesier, dirtier areas. It felt a little quieter and secluded. However we only had to walk 1/2 a block to feel like we were in the middle of everything.The staff was extremely nice and helpful, answering our questions, accommodating our requests as best they could.The concierge was EXTREMELY helpful with everything, from recommending excellent, non-touristy, restaurants with amazing food, to helping book tours or events.The rooms were small but very clean. The bathroom was very modern with a really nice shower and water pressure. Everything was new. Flat screen tv (although only 1 or 2 channels had english, but we watched soccer mostly).The hotel was what we needed for the trip and judging is one of the better ones for the price.Make sure to bring an alarm clock or a phone with an alarm as there are no alarm clocks in the room. You can get wake up calls though.There is free internet access at kiosks in the lobby as well as free printing which was a big plus.I honestly can't think of a better location. It was on a beautiful street (front entrance), accessible (within a half block of trams, rembrandt square, restaurants), but quiet enough to sleep at night.Negatives: small rooms, no iron, no alarm clock, restuarant is expensive.Would definitely stay here again!

<Author>kittykat1978
<Content>OK hotel - location central but tacky I stayed here for two nights with my boyfriend. We booked it, partly based on the reviews on Tripadvisor, but we were slightly disappointed. The hotel itself is fine, the staff are friendly, it's clean etc. The rooms are very modern. it's a bit like an airport hotel, however, very identikit. We booked it off klm.com and got a good price, 260 euro for two nights. Our first night we had a bit of a problem as our bed was actually two single beds pushed together, which I found pointless and annoying. We were exhausted from travelling and had unpacked so we just left it like that but requested a double bed for the next night, which was no problem (however we had the hasle of repacking etc the next morning which we could have done without). The location is very central but it was pretty tacky. A bit like Leicester Square, lots of tacky bars, cafes and dodgy looking clubs. Five minutes walk away you are in the Southern canal belt, however and it is easy to access all parts of Amsterdam from Rembrandtsquare. If I was coming back to Amsterdam, in order to soak up the atmosphere of a place, I will stay in an old style hotel (a canal house) somewhere in the southern or western canal belt - definitely wouldn't return here, although there was nothing definitively wrong with it, just lacked style and atmosphere.

<Content>Good location, good hotel Was taken here for a surprise weekend away. Room was a good size with modern, clean decor, well-laid out bathroom maximising limited space. Comfy bed and limited noise from other rooms.If you're a light sleeper ask for a room on the canal side. We had a room on the tram side and while initially worried about potential noise we didn't actually hear a thing sleeping for about 12 hours each night.Didn't bother with breakfast at the hotel (continental 9 euros at the bar, 17.50 euros in the restaurant) as found some fantastic cafes just down Utrechtsestraat (head south from Rembrandt plein) - would recommend the one with a wooden painted sign of a pink spotted teacup - great coffee and fantastic bagels served by friendly staff.Easy to walk anywhere in central Amsterdam from the hotel - the tram will take you to Central Station in about 7 minutes but it's only about a 15-20minute walk.If you're on a budget this probably isn't the place to stay but if you're looking for a good quality hotel in central Amsterdam then this is a good choice.

<Content>Good hotel - good location This is an extremely well located hotel and we didn鈥檛 find the rooms to be that small 鈥?I鈥檝e stayed in MUCH smaller elsewhere. The bed was very comfortable and the room was clean.We arrived early but one room was ready (we had booked 2) so we were able to leave our bags in there while we went off to exploreWe didn鈥檛 have breakfast there as it seemed pricey and we found a very good caf茅 down by the flowermarket that had something to suit all of us for much less.All in all - a good hotel in an excellent location and more than sufficient for our needs.

<Content>Good hotel - although not perfect We checked in around 9pm and were greeted by a very friendly and professional receptionist. Our room was nicely decorated in a trendy modern style but had signs of wear - the white walls in our room were marked and could have done with re-painting. The hairdryer in the bathroom only worked if you fiddled with the wires which was a bit worrying.The bed was extremely soft which I don't normally like, but slept well. Our stay was over a weekend and there was little noise - however opposite appears to be a major construction site. If noise concerns you I'd check with the hotel if this is a problem on weekdays.Our only problem was that we found that one of the towels had a terrible stain. I struggle to believe the maid missed this. Anyway, I called to have it replaced - but none ever appeared.Despite the minor problems, I still felt this was a good stay. The hotel is in a good location and overall it offered good value for money.

<Content>Location excellent - price excellent We stayed at this hotel for four nights and found it to be very central and a nice modern hotel. The rooms were a little small but cosy and the breakfast was fine. It was only 200m from the lively Rembrandtplein and a stones throw from all the main attractions. No complaints.

<Content>Could do better In a city where year-round excess demand means hoteliers can get away with murder, the Eden Rembrandt still represents poor value for money. Rooms are cramped (but then I suppose you have to expect that in crowded Amsterdam) but the little details that make a good hotel were missing. It was difficult to get the coffee and tea replenished each day, bathroom facilities were poor, service in the bar could be painfully slow, the reception advertised public transport passes but never had any in stock each time I asked for one - and I was staying on business for a week!!

<Content>comfortable and good breakfast I stayed here for 3 nights with my elderly parents and we all agree it was a very good experience. We arrived early (check in is from 3) but were able to leave our luggage in the luggage store. The concierge is very pleasant with a good sense of humour. The rooms were fine if a little on the small side but the beds were extemely comfortable. Breakfast was included for us and was excellent. There is a wide choice ranging from ham cheese and croissants to cereal, bacvon and eggs and unlimited tea/coffee. The location is good, just minutes from the trams in Rembrantplein or you can walk a bit further to Muntplein, depending on where you are going. The location is quiet and we were not disturbed by noise on any of the nights we stayed. Would stay here again.

<Content>Very comfortable; central location This is a very nice hotel that American travelers will identify with - by that, I mean it was air conditioned and nicely appointed. Modestly sized for European hotels, it was very comfortable for one or two people. The room was very clean.The decor is modern. Interestingly, the shower area had a glass wall that was shared with the sleeping area. Modesty is preserved through strategically placed glass frosting, but if you're traveling with a non-intimate friend you might be a bit uncomfortable. Also, the bathroom had a bottle opener on the wall, which I thought very considerate (it probably avoids damage to the surfaces - who among us have not found novel ways of opening bottles?).The room included an in-room safe that fit a 15 laptop (much appreciated), and a mini-bar (which I didn't use). A flat panel TV with several English channels was included. Free internet was provided, which is unique in European hotels.The location is very convenient between the Amsterdam Centraal Station and the big museums (Van Gogh and the Rijksmuseum). It's about a 20 minute walk or so from the station, but there is a tram station about 50 yards from the hotel on Rembrandt Square. Tram line 4 and 9 go between the rail station and Rembrandt Square. The hotel is just off the square. It doesn't look like much from the street, but appearances are deceiving. There is a restaurant attached, which I didn't use.All in all, a very nice hotel that American travelers will find familiar and very comfortable. On a personal note, they allowed me to check in at 10am, which I very much appreciated. This was not arranged ahead of time.

<Content>Realy nice hotel, enjoyed staying there Really nice hotel. Modern, excellent beds, great location (even though is was near rembrandt square ti was very quiet), really helpful staff, breakfast ok, the bathroom was with glass walls so a little bit embarassing if you want your privacy. The price was a liitle bit high but i guess that's the standard price for amsterdam. The staff responsible for cleaning the room didn't do their best. I would definately recommend it.

<Content>Above Average For Amsterdam This is a well located hotel- with good rooms- we have stayed in much smaller in Amsterdam. The decor was modern- we didn't find the bathroom a problem at all.Good comfy bed- really soft- not the best though if you like a hard bed.We did not use any of the facilities in the hotel- on check in we were made aware of the Restaurant- but nothing else- so don't even know if there were any others.One day the maid turned up at around 5.30pm, as it happened we were in the room and asked them to come back in 10 minutes- which they never did.All in all- a good hotel- good location and sufficient for what we wanted, although the reception was a bit bland- and I would say it was the rooms that made it a 4 star- not the staff or reception.

<Content>A great place to stay I stayed in this hotel for a short break (just two nights) with a friend. It was easy to get to from the cental station and the location was fantastic. It is about 10 minutes walk to Damm Square, but has lots of shops and restaurants very close to it. It is right on the canal side and has a lovely bar to enjoy a drink at either the beginning or end of an evening. We booked a superiour room and it was clean tidy and had a lovely large bathroom. The best thing of all though were the beds, probably the most comfortable I have ever had in a hotel!!! It was my first time in Amsterdam and I would love to return for a longer break and would definately go back to the hotel Eden.

<Content>Great modern hotel The hotel is in an excellent location with very clean modern rooms and very comfortable beds. There was a big street party when I was there with a lot of loud music but you couldn't hear a thing inside the room. The staff were very friendly. The only downside was a very slow check-out but I would certainly stay there again.

<Content>Awesome boutique hotel close to gay scene Stayed in this hotel for 2 nights during Amsterdam Pride. It was well worth the price. Comfortable and modern and extremely convenient to gay events happening this weekend. But it would be a great location for anyone as it is close to the sights and can be reached easily via tram from Central Station. Will stay at this location again when I return to Amsterdam in October. Enjoy!!

<Content>Great hotel, loved it Booked the hotel based entirely on online references. We could not have been happier with this updated, well appointed hotel. Near the flower market and many trams, it was quite easy to use a central jumping off point. I believe we had free wired internet in the room and kiosks available./wireless availabe in the lobby. The room was large, quiet, and very modern. We were thrilled with it. Of course we didn't spend much time in the room, but when we did were extremely comfortable.

<Content>Great Location, Nice Hotel This is a great hotel. I have stayed here a couple of times and have had a really good time. The standard rooms are quite small (although the upgraded rooms are huge) but have everything you need including free internet, comfortable beds, and great shower (no bath). There are direct trams from central station and it is right in the centre of Amsterdam. Rooms are clean and fashionably furnished (some looking very slightly warn).Breakfast is good but if it isn't in your room rate be warned it is about 17 Euros which is heafty. However, there is a nice coffee shop along the street.Will definitely stay again

<Content>Pleasant Hotel In Fantastic Location Have just returned from a four-night stay at the Eden Rembrandt Square. The hotel was in a great location, just far enough from lively Rembrandt Square to be quiet at night time. We walked from Central Station as the weather was lovely, but if it was raining, you might prefer to take the tram which drops you off less than one hundred meters from the hotel's front door. The room was an adequate size and comfortable, with flat-screen TV with international channels. The glass doors into the bathroom and glass partition between the shower and bedroom are not a problem if you are staying with a spouse or partner, but may not be to everyone's taste. There is also a frosted panel across the middle of the glass. The beds are fantastically comfortable, and our room was quiet at night. The only things I could complain about were that housekeeping was a little noisy in the morning, and they only left one small bar of soap during the entire four-night stay, although other toiletries were replaced. We didn't really have any view from our room, looking into an internal courtyard, although this was compensated for by the fact that no street view meant no noise from outside. Staff were friendly and helpful, and the hotel provides a secure room to leave luggage in once you have checked out.

<Content>overpriced and over rated we stayed here a few weeks ago.the reception area and staff were ok, the rooms were smalland quite bsic.we had a great view of a brick wall with a few windows of other rooms to look in to. not very nice.we tried to get an iron and ironing board to press shirts to go out, but could not get one for love nor money.managers were not interested, although the door porter tried his best.we had to bribe a porter to get us one and i gave him 10 euros.id say this hotel is all nice looking as you arrive but goes downhill rapidly after that.all fur coat and no knickers springs to mind on this one.we moved after 3 days, (id had enough) to the krapanosky.

<Content>excellent Wow..from the minute we walked in, like entering 'hotel Babylon' Lovely reception, helpful staff, lovely rooms and gorgeous beds, bathroom doors not a problem, sharing with a friend and neither of us understood why people complain about them. Plenty of tea and coffee, lovely toilettries, nice towels, room cleaned next day, ice machine just outside door. Helpful concierge. Easy and friendly check out, even organised us a taxi to the airport instead of the train. Just off rembrandt square, so great for shops and bars, also quiet on a night time, due to good double glazing.Would we stay again..........deffinatley. Had a lovely stay.

<Content>Nice hotel let down by attention to detail and communication between staff My partner and I stayed at this hotel just after Easter 2008. It's extremely well located in the heart of Amsterdam just off the bustling Rembrandt's Square.The place has a modern, minimalist style - with understated entrance lobby and nicely furnished rooms in the current trends of white walls, walnut furniture, slate tiles, and suede-effect soft furnishings. Our room was amply equiped - complete with small but functional flat-screen TV, fridge, internet access (assuming you've brought your own device). Also included were tea/coffee making facilities, something not that common on Amsterdam hotels. Our first call was to housekeeping to get some extra crockery - given that we only had one of everything! Okay, it's a small point - but it's a double room for goodness sake. Eventually a single small coffee cup arrived but it was late so we made do! Our 2nd and 3rd calls to housekeeping the next day - followed by a trip to reception after an hour's waiting - were because we'd been left no extra coffee and creamer supplies. Finally we got a couple of satchets of each handed in - perhaps there's some sort of tax on this in Amsterdam?The fridges in the rooms have electronic controls on EVERYTHING - which means it's totally impossible to even move them around a little to accomodate anything of your own that you want to cool. Never mind, we thought, there's an ice machine on every floor - but unfortunately no ice bucket in the room! Like so many hotels - even in the 21st centuary - the people who design the bathrooms obviously never have to use them. Is it really so much to ask for that the shower spray be contained in the bath or tray rather than flooding the floor? Or that you can sit on the loo without having to lean to one side to avoid the loo-roll dispenser? Or for sufficient ventilation and extraction that you don't feel like your shaving in the humidity of a a tropical rain forrest!However, the Eden Rembrandt manages one further design feature that I've never seen before - with its glass bathroom doors. Despite the partial frosting, anyone else in the room is not only treated to some interesting views when walking past the bathroom, but to every sound eminating too! We discovered and even better feature on night time visits to the loo - when the shadows on the wall opposite the bathroom cast a cinematic view on the opposite wall - leaving nothing to the imagination.We both liked the Eden, but it would be so much better for just a little extra thought and effort. Would I stay here again? Perhaps - but without these various niggles it would be a definite.

<Content>Twas quite nice I stayed here with my boyfriend for 2 nights. On check in, the receptionist was very friendly and helpfully, explaining all fees and charges. The room was nice but quite small, it being a 4* hotel we expected more in size and quality. There was no real doors on the bathroom, only glass, shower like ones. This really got to me and I think its a terrible idea, the bathroom is a private place and you don't want your fellow traveller knowing what you get up to in there, even if it was my boyfriend! Our room was not cleaned so we didn't get clean sheets or towels. This is probably because we didn't put the make up my room sign until 3pm but I personally feel this is ok seen as its a 4* hotel, they obviously don't agree though!Overall an enjoyable stay, just don't expect too much from this one!

<Content>The worst Hotel i've ever been To begin with...the check in staff. The are de Kings and you a slave, so be careful. Snobs, non efficients and not willing to serve you. At least during the night shifte. If by any chance you feel the need to speak to the Duty Manager at a improper hour (let's say by 00h30) they say it's not possible. Nevertheless you can read at tne in-room info that there s a Duty Manager 24h a day. Not true.Imagine yourself reaching an hotel by 00h30 with a sleepy child with the reservation made for a double bed and a baby cot. And when you get to the room, there's no baby cot. Not nice, no ? Even worst, the reception staff just tells you there there is not a chance to get one that same night ! Is this the service you expect in a 4 star hotel in Europe ? I couldn't accept it.The breakfast is just so poor, i didn't feel willing to eat. The bread finishes and you must wait a lot for them to replace. If by any chance you are the kind of people who lkes to come back to the hotel by mid-afertoon, and are expecting to have your room made, you are at thr wrong hotel. It happened twice in a row. By 15h30 and by 18h30.I dond't recomend this hotel to anyone, nevertheless being well located.

<Content>Excellent Hotel 4 of us stayed here for 2 nights in April. The location of it is brilliant, its about 30 seconds from Rembrandt Square and the tram stop. The bars and coffee shops on the square are really friendly.The rooms are good, everything you could need and very modern. The air con was an added bonus as it was super hot the weekend we were there.Overall i would definately go back. Dam Square was only 3 mins on a tram - fantastic.Any questions - please email me.

<Content>fabulous hotel, excactly what was required Have just returned from a 3 night stay in the Eden Rembrandt which was superb.On arrival staff were curteous and helpful and we checked in swiftly at 12 midday.The room was modern and spacious with a fabulous big bathroom as pictured in other photographs. However the view was not much to be desired and we were unable to have a room with a double bed, even though we had booked a deluxe room. We had friends staying in a standard room which was very small, no bigger than your average chain hotels.The hotel was situated in a lovely part of the city which was approximately 20-30 mins walk outside Dam square. There were a good few local bars and clubs nearby and the walk into Dam square gave us the opportunity to explore different areas of the city.Overall a good stay. Staff were attentive and polite at all times. the hotel was away from the bustle so a good nights sleep was had. A little pricey but would stay here again for a short stay. However for a longer stay i would go for somewhere with more on site amenities.

<Content>Recomended Good location, helpful staff, well maintained decent sized rooms, very large bathroom with underfloor heating.Not the cheapest choice but we felt were received good accomodation for the price.Plenty of cafes, restaurants and bars and a tram stop all within a 1 minute walk.Other reviewers have commented negatively on the glass bathroom doors. The glass is frosted and the large bathroom size means that from the bedroom we could only see the feet of someone in the bathroom. If feet embarrass you, the glass doors are a problem, if not, don't worry about the glass doors.

<Content>Loved the location! The location of the hotel was great! The first room we had the one mattress was so bowed our backs were very sore for the first 5 nights. We asked housekeeping to switch it out and it never happend. They definately did not change the sheets daily or vacum the rooms daily and I found it very odd they didn't have face cloths. Most of the front staff were very nice and accomodating. The last 5 nights that we stayed there they did upgrade us to a large suite with one queen size mattress which was great! Note to travellers make sure you don't remove the things from the mini bar and use it for your own use, it's eletronically monitored and will be billed to your room even if you don't eat or drink it! When I checked out the front desk clerk was good about not charging me for the items that were not consumed just moved out of the fridge. Other than that it was a great location and I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Amsterdam, beautiful city.

<Content>Convenient Location Nice Hotel, convenient location, all of the main attractions shops, museums and red light district within walking distance. There is an excellent tram stop in Rembrandt Square about 150m away. There were also some problems that I would like to highlight. The carpet in our room was stained, the seats in the breakfast room were stained and a mouse in the bar\lounge area scared the crap out of my wife.

<Content>Perfect City Location Stayed at this hotel for a long weekend in March. Wanted to be near the gay and lesbian area and it was perfect location for that. If your not into that scene don't worry you would not know it was even there.Hotel very nice, bathroom is not the best for travelling with friends as it is a glass box and as a result very see through when dry or wet. However, not really a major problem. Just worth noting if you want your own privacy. Beds are very comfortable and the free internet access in the lobby is great.Would definitely recommend this hotel. Hope you have a fab holiday.

<Content>Nice hotel, but houskeeping needs improvement This hotel is in a very good location, between the Amstel River and Rembrandt square, on a main tram line and a short walk to the Metro. There is a wide selection of restaurants and cafes in the vicinity, but it is far enough from the main tourist areas that noise was never a factor. We did ask for, and received, a room away from the street which also helped.We had a double room that was fine for two with a good sized bath, working area, safe, kettle, fridge, free internet and comfortable bed. The front desk, bar and concierge service was excellent. We did not eat at the hotel. The breakfast was 17 euros and the hotel restaurant was both fancy and expensive. There is a caf茅 that opens at 8 am Monday to Friday and 10 am on weekends 25 meters from the hotel, toward the square, where a continental breakfast cost us about 4 euros.The only issue we had was with the housekeeping. We had to ask twice to get towels. Not to have clean towels, mind you, just to get any kind of towels. We had to ask to get toilet paper. We asked for, and never received, clean glasses. We had to ask for coffee cups and creamer. At a 4 star hotel we should never have had to spend so much effort trying to get basics for the room.This is a nice hotel. It generally has good staff who provided 4 star service, but the housekeeping experience makes me want to rate it 3 star.

<Content>hardly a 4 star Stayed here for a long weekend with 3 friends - I'll start with the pros: Its in a really good location especially for nightlife, the Escape nightclub is barely a minutes walk away and is really good. Plenty of other bars in the square as well (De Kroon is one of the most gorgeous bars I've ever been in). It's just a five minute walk to the main shopping street, and roughly 10 or 15 minutes from Dam Square and the Red Light District. All in all location could not have been more spot on. However the hotel itself was disappointing. Our problem started when checking in, the receptionist was unfriendly and seemed annoyed by our presence. The rooms were tiny, barely room to swing a cat and the bathroom was ridiculous - water everywhere after taking a shower and no privacy whatsoever, had to turn on the TV really loud to have a pee in comfort!! There was also zero wardrobe space, but the beds were great. The staff in the bar were really nice but again we had problems with the receptionist (not sure if it was the same one we dealt with when checking in) when I called for more towels. The housekeeping staff had cleaned the room and taken away the towels without replacing them - I phoned reception politely asking for towels and was told (gruffly) that towels would be sent. A half hour later 2 little hand towels were delivered. I explained that we had no towels in the room whatsoever and could we have the full set (bath towels, bath mat, hand towel etc) and the receptionist sighed and said 'you have towels', I explained again, she sighed again and said 'fine'. 1 hour later we were still waiting, my friend phoned and was talking to a different person and we got exactly what we wanted in 5 minutes. Does that sound like good service for a 4 star?? Don't think so. But the free internet in the hotel was handy.

<Content>Excellent Room, Perfect Location Great modern hotel at a really great price. This is nice without being too lux. Everything you need, nothing you do not. The beds are super comfortable and the room was quiet and air-conditioned. The shower was awesome, but the bathroom lacked any real privacy (lots of glass). We just took turns popping down to the lobby to check emails on the free computers or using the free wifi to allow for more privacy. It's a minor detail and I would not hessitate to stay here again or recommend this to anyone traveling to Amsterdam. We also really enjoyed the location. It was about 1/2 block off Rembrandt Square which is filled with resturants, bars, coffee houses and what seemed to be one of the hottest clubs in town (we didn't bother to wait in line) All the resturants we tried on the sqare were very good. You're a short walk to the shopping district and the tram stops in the square so you can get just about anywhere. I can't say enough good things about this hotel...it's the best mid-priced hotel I've stayed at in a long time.

<Content>Perfect location loved this fab hotel!! What can i say, this has got to be one of the best hotels i have stayed for in a long time!We arrived at 9am and check in time wasn't until 15:00 however the receptionist was extremeley helpful and had our room booked as a priority to clean meaning we could check in at 11:30.The room was absolutley stunning very clean and well presented and the bathroom was fantastic very modern and excellent bath and shower. We decided not to have breakfast included as there are loads of cafe's within walking distance one i would highly recommend id the 3 sisters cafe/bar this was a fraction of the price of what the Eden was charging and there was lots of choice.The location of this hotel is the best right within easy walking distance to the Rembrandt square the DAM square and the ever lively red light district is only a 7 minute walk however if you wanted to get the tram these are situated about 30 seconds away from the hotel and ruun every 4 minutes. I would highly recommend the Eden Rembrandt and look forward to visiting in the very near future.

<Content>Very comfortable beds! Stayed here for two nights in February. Found the hotel to be modern, clean and comfortable. It's in a good location close to the main tourist places, but it is also quiet. The rooms are decorated in a modern style with solid grey, black and white colours and are not as small as some European city hotels. The bathroom was a decent size, with grey tiles and a good shower. The hotel has free wired Internet access, but no wireless. Breakfast is expensive at 鈧?7.50 per person. It's a buffet service, so you could eat a lot to get value for money, or go along to one of the cafes in Rembrant Square just down the street for a coffee and pastry for about 鈧?.There are plenty of bars and restaurants nearby and most of the major sights are with walking distance, or can be reached via the trams.We tried the restaurant next door (Flo), which was good but quite expensive (see www.diningcity.com/amsterdam for reviews of this and other Amsterdam restaurants), and also had dinner one night in the Cafe L'Opera in Rembrandt Square which was good value for money and a nice place to pass a couple of hours.Would recommend this hotel to people visiting Amsterdam as although it's not cheap, it is good value compared with other higher priced hotels in the city.

<Content>Great Hotel Great Hotel in a very convenient location, nice rooms and very friendly staff. Forget the taxi from the airport (52 euros) use the train (4.80 euros) which is underneath the airport and then a number 9 or 4 tram (1.60 euros) from straight outside the station to Rembrandtplein, the stops are announced on the tram, and then continue walking straight on for 200 metres or so to the hotel. Very easy to find. Got a great deal through www.hotels.nl on a non refundable basis, great bars and restaurants in and around Rembrandtpleain and have breakfast down by the flower market just a 5 minute stroll on Single (canal)

The room we had was very spacious, clean and well appointed and all the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful. Highly reccomended.

<Content>Had a lovely time! Me and my boyfriend stayed here as a 30th Birthday treat and had a great time.The room was immaculate, and the bed amazingly comfortable to the point that we did not leave it until lunch time on the first morning! And was just as hard on day two.....Great location too. We paid for a cab from Central St on arrival but felt rather ripped of as it was 鈧?0 and was only a 5 minute ride. On the way back we caught a tram which was much cheaper (actually it was free as we did not realise you had to pay the driver when you got on!) and just as quick.Would definitely recommend this hotel and will hopefully be going back in the near future!

<Content>very easily an A this hotel compares easily to any medium-upscale hotel in the US, hence, by far better than what i'd expect for that price in europe.for american travellers see it is as a brighter lit W-hotel.definitely value for money--ambience, location [the # of bars, lounges [and coffeeshops--for those into that] within walking distance is huge, easy access to RedLightDistrict and Heathrow ;staff was also great.will recommend.

<Content>Great stay I recently stayed here for 5 nights with my partner and i was very impressed with this hotel. the staff was pleasent except for one who was rude when we were checking in. the bed was the best i have ever slept in. the room was very nice. the hotel is very central and within walking distance of everything. the only fault i have with this hotel is that its very expensive once you get there. it was 3.50 for a can of coke and 5.00 euro for a small bottle of water from the minibar. i would stay here again.

<Content>Just OK. Stay - 2 nights / 2 days.Location 鈥?Just down the road from the Rembrandt Square, about 20 minute walk from the main station.Room 鈥?Very modern interior until you looked at the detail. Our bath plug didn鈥檛 work so we had to pull it out completely to let the water drain after a shower, the plate in the bathroom was chipped, the bathtub was plastic, so it had quite a few deep scratches in it. A lot of furniture in a smallish room.Food 鈥?Breakfast was OK, didn鈥檛 eat at the restaurant as there are about 50 others in a 500m radius.Staff 鈥?So-so. Had a small problem checking out as the bill was prepaid (or so I though). They hit us with a deluxe room extra, and extra city taxes that I wasn鈥檛 aware of. Housekeeping didn鈥檛 replenish our tea/coffee or milk supplies.Overall 鈥?I think this hotel is going for a chic and modern approach but doesn鈥檛 quite make it. I won鈥檛 stay here again.

<Content>Better Than Expected! We were actually staying at a The Bridge Hotel a few blocks away and visited our friends at the Eden Rembrandt. The next day we checked into the Rembrandt and never looked back. We loved this hotel considering the location, the price and the rooms (while small) were very, very comfortable and well appointed. The bathroom was spa-ish and the bed linens were of quality. Overall a very comfortable hotel and we can't complain that our room had not been cleaned on one of the days as the hotel manager, after having it cleaned sent us a bottle of spirits, chocolates and a very nice letter of apology.Peter, one of the concierges (whom I often do not have an opinion on one way or the other) was simply a really nice, helpful person who you could tell loved his job and loved helping people!Being a very experienced traveler, I would certainly recommend this place if you don't mind being in the middle of it all.

<Content>Good hotel, great location A good hotel bang in the centre of Amsterdam. Rooms are clean and modern and I will be staying there again. A couple of things to note: My room had mosquitos (common for AMS this summer), they were fully booked so could not give me another room but did eventually find some fly spay so problem solved.Breakfast is expensive at EUR15, just take a walk down the street and have a better breakfast in one of the cafes.

<Content>Magnificent Holiday This hotel is really splendid. Everything is brand new, modern and funky. The cab driver dropped us off at the wrong side , to it's sister hotel(cant remember the name) and the receptionist had to let us through the back way, but once were at the correct place everything was fine. The room was a spacious kingsize on the 2nd floor (I think they may have upgraded us!) though the price in January is so cheap!The bed was so comfortable we didnt ever want to get out of bed, and the only thing we didnt like was the bath/shower- it had no partition or curtain, so we had to remove clothes from there before showering.All in all, we had a great time, the staff were friendly and helpful and we are going back there this coming January!

<Content>Discounts unsurprising... My partner and I stayed at the Eden Rembrandt, and booked it through an online hotel-booking service at a very good price.However, there were problems almost immediately. On arrival the receptionist was totally insensitive to the fact that our bank cards were not working, and was also very brisk with an Italian couple who were struggling to book a city tour. Such service continued through the week, with staff either treating us with indifference and laziness, or even blaming us for situations that clearly weren't our fault. I won't go into details but it did put a slight dampener on an otherwise great holiday.The room was very well furnished with comfy beds and free internet, if a little small and with not much of a view, but there was no shower curtain (so the bathroom was almost permanently flooded with water) and our tea/coffee facilities were rarely replenished - maybe they were trying to get us to pay the SIXTEEN EUROS for breakfast?Hotel's location is pretty central, and most of the city centre is within a 15-20 minute walk, but if you are staying here then be sure to print off a map, as it's not easy to find if you just get off the tram at Rembrandtplein.So, other options? I stayed in the city 4 or 5 years ago and the Tulip Inn Dam Sq was a nice and friendly hotel - right in the thick of things, if not quite as sophisticated (but at least you don't feel like a naughty child every time you dare to approach the reception desk or the concierge). Might be worth a look.All in all - well, I can see why most of the TripAdviser-ites ended up here with discounts, because as it stands this hotel would find it difficult to build up a repeat business market. 4-stars is more than a little ambitious. You could be lucky and have a lovely time here, but from our point of view the staff could definitely do with a kick up the...

<Content>Loved the Eden Rembrandt My husband and I stayed at the Eden Rembandt for 2 great nights. I thank all the Tripadvisors reviewers for their tips and reviews. We knew that the rooms although modern were small in size and that the bathroom (as seen in the pictures that were posted by reviewers) were unique in the the doors were glass and in our particular room, one could see a person showering.We arrived early (11:30AM) knowing that we would have to put our luggage in the luggage room. Instead, we were fortunate in that a room was available immediately for us. I made sure that it was a room facing the back of the property as I had learned on this website that they were much more quiet than the front rooms. We were not disappointed and we were also spoiled by the fact it was on the 5th floor. The hotel is perfectly located in Rembrandt Square and it is not necessary to have breakfast at the hotel. We found ample restaurants in the square which served breakfast for a fraction on the price.We enjoyed a great meal a the Indrapura restaurant also found in the square. The food was delicious (had a rice table meal) and the service was very courteous. I recommend this restaurant if you feel like spoiling yourselves.We checked out at 12:00 on our final day and the hotel held on to our luggage till the end of the day.We felt very safe, comfortable at the Eden Rembrandt and we would stay there again .

<Content>Family Vacationer, Be Aware It's a nice hotel. But, one thing that bothered me was the fact shower stall wall was half transparent and quite visible from bed room area. As I, a mom, traveled with my 14-year old son, it was not a comfortable arrangement. I had to ask for another room for the next day citing the room was too small (actually it was true too). The other room's shower stall was not so quite visible, but still bathroom door was a glass only whose middle part was opaque. You could see the person from the bed area when he/she steps out the shower or tub. I did not know the Rembrant Square was known for Gays. We happedn to have stayed at this hotel on Gay Pride Parade Day, which did not help with noise, crowd, and trash.Other than that the hotel was nice. Just not for a family.

<Content>Excellent Location The hotel is less than 50 yards from rembrandt square. It took about 15/20 minutes to walk from central station, but you can get tram 4 or 9 to the square.The room has a TV with some english language channels, a hairdryer, tea and coffee making facilities, a mini bar, safe, toiletries, phones and air conditioning.Room is average size, the beds were two twins pushed together making a big king size, very comfortable bed. Clean and tidy room. All other reviews are correct, the bathroom has a frosted glass door.Rembrandt square has plenty of bars, restaurants and coffee shops to easily just stay here the night.Red light district, dam square, the zoo, anne franks house, rijksmuseum are all within easy walking distance.Check in at 3pm, check out at 12noon but the hotel will store your bags for you. All staff we encountered were pretty friendly/professional. Didnt eat in their restaurant so can't comment on that. I booked direct with their website and paid 109euros per night (for 2 people)

<Content>Great hotel, great location, great customer service This review is many months late, yet I wanted to take the time to thank my fellow TripAdvisors for their great reviews of this hotel. Based on their writings, I chose this hotel for a one night stay for my Amsterdam in 24 hours tour. I was not disappointed. The location is just great, just enough of a distance away from the noise, yet conveniently located to the tram lines. I arrived prior to normal check in time, but my single room was ready and I was allowed in. Ultra modern and chic is how I would describe this hotel and I agree with the others, the bed and pillows are just FANTASTIC! If I find myself in Amsterdam again, the Eden Hotel would be my choice.

<Content>Okay, but will try somewhere else next time The hotel itself was fine, if a little tired looking in the public areas. We booked it because it had air conditioning. There was the first problem. Ours did not work, but the management was not the least interested in checking on it. We returned on the day we asked to have it fixed to find the window in our room opened at the top--their solution. Check-in was at 3, but check-out was at 11. We arrived early in the morning and were allowed to store our luggage. I have been to many other countries, and even if the check-in is later, rooms that are vacated earlier are cleaned and made available as soon as possible--not here. Everyone was made to wait until 3. The lobby was full of people waiting to check-in at 3. There were two concierge. One was helpful; the other was absolutely rude to people. At the desk, the female who appeared to be in charge never smiled and seemed offended at everything that was said. If breakfast is not included in your rate, it is 16 E per person! Our room was quiet, but even with the windows closed, our friends were very bothered by outside noise. The room was average size, but there was not much privacy in the room. The bathroom area is all glass, and while it was not see through, the glass did not keep noise and light out of the room. Whoever awoke earlier could not shower without waking the other person. The bed was good and comfortable. The area was convenient. Two trams stopped practically in front of the door--convenient from and to the train station. It was just a couple of blocks from the flower market and minutes from the Singel and Dam Square. Next trip, I will stay elsewhere.

<Content>Canceled my stay at this rude hotel I booked this hotel and when i was supposed to arrive a strike broke out at the Amsterdam Airport. We called the hotel to inform them that we couldn't make our first night because we would have to take a night train since all flights were canceled. They were so rude and confused that it was added stress to our already difficult situation. The manager told me to talk to her attorney when I asked if we would be charged for the missed night. Everyone was hostile immeadiately for no reason. Very strange management. We canceled our remaining nights due to this rudeness and picked another hotel which ended up being in a better location and cheaper! Be careful with this hotel

<Content>Great Stay My partner and I had a great stay at this hotel. I was able to obtain a really good rate and was given one of their large rooms with a large bath (two separate showers, one in the bathtub and another one located next to it, neither being enclosed in any way). Most of the rooms, however, appeared to be smaller and contained smaller baths. Our room was very quiet and the hotel is air conditioned.The location is very good, just off of Rembrandt Square and within walking distance of most attractions. A tram stop is located just a block from the hotel.The public areas of the hotel are nothing to speak of; however, I don't spend time in the public areas anyway. The staff was friendly and helpful. The breakfast room is shared with a sister hotel located just behind; consequently it can be a little hectic but it was certainly adequate.I would highly recommend this hotel if you are able to obtain a good rate and are not interested in a full-service hotel.

<Content>Disappointed I have never written a hotel review before but after staying in this Hotel I felt responsible to alert the others. This hotel is not rated correctly; it must be 2 to 3 stars max, but absolutely not a 4 stars hotel. Front deck staffs are most unfriendly and likely there is management problem, every time I pass by the front desk a guest is arguing and shouting about something with the front desk staff. When I complained about the bathroom problem and requested to change the room I was asked to pay 20 Euro extra for upgrade room. The carpet is dark gray so you can鈥檛 see the dirt but your feet feel sticky from walking in the room. If you are smoker you must pay additional fees for cleaning (written inside the room), house keeping are the most annoying ever, if you have the no disturb sign hanged it is useless, as they barged into the room regardless of the sign, like you are not there. Noise is major problem from the rooms around you and top of you. You will hear people and TV sounds. If you Last but not least the breakfast is cold that鈥檚 ok but too old you can tell from the milk, bread, etc. if you are looking for a view then this is not the hotel you want to be in.

<Content>What a Hotel!!! We booked this holiday as a weekend getaway pretty much last minute. We read all the reviews out there but still went with an open mind as we have discovered in the past that not everyone likes the same thing!!. We were certainly not let down. We arrived early morning and as the check in time was 2pm we decided to have a wander round. The hotel is really easy to find from Central Station, just follow the round ahead over the canal and down through Dam Square. You will see the Madame Tussauds Museum on right. Keep walking down there until you come to just before the flower market and you will see the sign posts for Rembrandt Square. There is a monument in the middle that cannot be missed. If you stand with the monument to your right look straight ahead and you will see just off Rembrandt Sq the Eden Rembrandt. The reception staff were exceptionally helpful and as we were early we asked if we could leave our bag there. This was not a problem, they were very helpful. When we were able to get to our room we were told that we had been upgraded which was a bonus. The room had a separate toilet and bathroom with power shower. Very modern decor thoughout. We had a corner room so there was a table and chairs in the bay window, dressing table and a massive bed. There is a plasma screen in the rooms (if you are boring enough to stay in and watch it!!!, why you would want to when there is so much to do in amsterdam?) Beware the minibar! If you pick anything up you will be charged on check-out. The trays are all sensored! There are tea and coffee making facilities and they are replenished if you stay for 2 nights or more.The hotel is in an excellent location for any of the main squares, the flower market and all the museums. I would recommend this hotel to anyone and would certainly go back again! The sooner the better.

<Content>Terrible service I strongly recommend NOT staying at this hotel.I made a reservation online, via hotels.nl.I was explicitly told that I was getting a queen-size bed or two single beds put together.When I arrived I was given a little hole fora room, with a tiny bed that was not even atwin. When I showed the woman at the receptionmy reservation, she replied that Well, you madethe reservation through hotels.nl, not throughus, so you really need to contact *them* to getthis straight. That was, of course, entirely absurd. It is the hotel's responsibility to make sure that whoever makes reservations ON THEIR BEHALF does so accurately and properly - not the paying customer's responsibility. I waspromised a double bed and coughed up my credit card number to guarantee it. I was not given a double bed when I arrived.Ergo, I was not given what I paid for. The least they could do was (1) accommodateme immediately by switching me to a roomwith a double bed and apologizing, and(2) contact hotels.nl to make sure thisis not repeated in the future. That iswhat would have happened in any professionallyrun establishment, certainly anywhere inthe US. Instead, what I got was attitude,as if the situation was my fault. The reception staff were completely unhelpful, arrogant, aloof, and at times downright rude. I ended up getting an upgrade after talking to the manager, but even that took about 15 minutes of arguing, and the upgrade was really no upgrade - it was no more than what I had originally reserved. In general, the hoteladvertises itself as four stars when in reality it is 2.5 or at best 3 stars. The rooms are small, poorly lit, and barely clean. But by far the worst aspect was the completely substandard and unprofessional service from the staff. I've stayed at hundreds of hotels in my life, throughout the world, and I NEVER, never saw such rude and unhelpful staff. I could not possibly recommend against this hotel in stronger terms.

<Content>Nice Hotel - Good location Just back from Amsterdam on a work trip and stayed at the Eden. My review is tempered by the fact that someone else was paying the bill. If it had been my own 拢120 for a single room, I may have slightly different views concerning value for money. However, the points I note should be taken regardless of the cost of the room.PositiveStaff absolutely fantastic...English speaking...very helpfulLocation great.....Right on the Remrandt square with some nice bars and Damm square and then the other areas very closeRoom very nice....It's small but very clean. The bed was fantastically comfortable and the bath was deep  wide.....great stuff. A nice flat screen tv as wellNoticed two internet points in foyer...didn't use them but saw they had a printer, which is very useful for longer trips (I was there one night) if you need to print directions, timetables etc.Negative....Air con didn't go down low enough...was very warm There you go...I recommend highly for business  for pleasure if you have fairly deep pockets or can get a good deal

<Content>Stop wasting your time. Book this hotel now. A modern hotel which is only 50 m from Rembrandt Square. The bathroom is terrific. It is large, modern, elegant, whith allsorts of soaps, shampoos, bodycreams...The bed is really confortable. Just opposite, on the wall you will find a plasma TV whith ten channels. I was really tempted to give in and let that my sleep would prevent me from going out, and that would have happened if it was not for the famous Amsterdam鈥檚 enjoyable night, which was the case. I am from Madrid which has also its own reputation about nihgtlife but I can assure that Amsterdam does not fall behind in that race.I will recommend to take a look on the table where you will find a a kind of a letter to the guest (as a matter of fact it seems like a menu of the restaurant) where you will find (in alphabetic order) all the services the hotel can provide (some with extra cost, for instance if you need a doctor). I think Internet is also free in rooms. On the other hand, the only disadvantage that I would like to mention is breakfast. It is not included in the price of the stay and in addition it is expensive. You will find better breakfast for less than a half.

<Content>Nice hotel, small rooms I stayed at this hotel about 4 times in 2006 for business. From a tourist perspective: It is a great place, funky decor, funky rooms - some rooms can be small. Good locations to the Opera house, flower market, and the independen artist market. They have a great restaurant (consider one of the tops in Amsterdam right next to it - called ELO).From a business traveller perspective:Internet in the rooms work great, they did not have WiFi. Location is not the best if you need to have access to Train station - it requires a taxi ride to get to the train station.In General: staff was always friendly and very helpful with everthying. I would stay again with my wife for fun, but; would not book it for business travel.

<Content>AMAZING - best hotel in amsterdam This hotel absolutely made our trip! It was just off of Rembrandt square, ideal location and on an EXTREMELY quite road considering how close to the night life it was! The room was absolutely spotless. The bathroom was amazing and the shower was outstanding - a rainfall shower AND a regular showerhead. The bed were THE MOST comfortable bed we have EVER EVER slept in. The whole hotel was absolutely fabulous. I have been to amsterdam 5 times now and this was THE best hotel I have stayed in (and I have been with more expensive). Ideal location, beautiful room. Don't listen to any bad reviews of this place (if there are any), this hotel is THE hotel to be in when visiting amsterdam!!!!

<Content>Excellent Hotel, Superb Location We have just returned from a 4night stay. The hotel was fabulous. We had 2 rooms (265  270) both rooms were spacious and they were extremely clean. There was tea, coffee and hot chocolate provided in the rooms. The hotel also provided towels, shampoo, handwash and a hairdryer(not good for long hair as it overheats quite qickly and cuts out). The beds were very comfortable and hard to get out of in the morning. The location is superb, everything is just a short walk away . If you plan on going a little further a field the tram stops a few metres away from the hotel. There are plenty of boat trips around the canals or you can go by bike in and out of the many side roads.Overall i would recommend this hotel to anyone and on my next trip to Amsterdam i will be definitely checking back in.

<Content>Very nice hotel and great location Very nice hotel in a great location in Amsterdam near Rembrandt Square. Room size was decent, beds were very comfy. Only thing that may bother some is the bathroom, which is separated from the bedroom by glass, not a solid wall. So as long as the couple is friendly, everything is fine - but if it's two on a business trip, may want somewhere that offers more bathroom privacy.

<Content>Pros and cons Very modern hotel with air conditioning. Kind of industrial feeling to the hotel. Lots of tour groups stayed here. I stayed in 2 different rooms over a total of 6 nights. The beds were very comfortable.Housekeeping didn't get to my room until the 4th day of my stay. Overall, the hotel was clean, but I could have used some fresh towels and sheets by day 4.I was charged for using the minibar, even though I didn't touch it.Overall, I prefer staying in the area around Vondelpark or in the Jordaan.3 star rating.

<Content>Great location Great hotel in a very central location, particularly if you don't fancy wandering too far to eat in the eve as Rembrandt Square is surrounded by restaurants and bars. Rooms are very modern and stylish but agree with other reviews that the bed are too soft! The concierges were extremely helpful.The breakfast in the hotel is pricey (12 euros for continential) if you're not inclusive but just yards down the road is the Opera cafe which serves a great selection and the staff are all very friendly - as is the cat!

<Content>Problems at the Eden Rembrandt Several problems during a recent stay would make it difficult to return and recommend to others.This hotel is unable to arrange shuttle bus transfer to the airport. Concierge said disagreements with the several companies made it impossible so I could take my bags (no bellmen) about a block and over brick streets and trolley tracks to another hotel and arrange airport transfers through them.Then I asked could they call a cab. . .they didn't do that either. . they had a private car service they used which they never were able to tell me an exact price but around 40 to 42 Euros. .. Car service was very nice but cost a flat 45 Euros which was over three times what a shuttle bus would have been.i don't know of any hotel anywhere claiming Four Stars and not able to arrange airport shuttle service.Air conditioning was elusive. . .first room's unit blew warm air on the coldest setting so they moved me to a second room which seemed to function at times. i went down to report and came back to find window open. Other than noise from outside this was okay but could be a problem when temperatures heat up.And CNN had been removed from the hotel system replaced by the Travel Channel.Hotel has nice design but doesn't seem to know how to operate.

<Content>Good location, clean hotel, nice and quiet I booked this hotel after reading reviews on this site and Expedia, with a real priority for me being its cleanliness and quietness. It didn't disappoint on either count and had the added bonus of being in an excellent location - far enough away from the slightly too brash touristy bits but near enough as not to be a long walk from anywhere useful.The modern room was nice and the bathroom was excellent, although some might be surprised at the European practice of having no shower curtain so the bathroom floor gets a bit wet.I'd definitely book here again.

<Content>Great hotel but a couple of flaws Spent 5 nights here including the annual Queens Day festival which was a great spectacle to witness. Hotel is very central which was great for sightseeing as we were able to walk everywhere. Close to Rembrandtplein and noise from partying during festival could be heard in hotel room (but that would be the case where ever you are in the city on 29-30 April - don't go to Amsterdam on any festival day if you aren't prepared for a party atmosphere).Loved the modern room, including flat screen tv, fantastically comfortable bed and 'wet-room' shower.Only gripes were (1) breakfast - hugely over-priced and refills of tea/coffee were extra so only ate in hotel once and (2) room not ready on arrival or on one day during our stay but on both occasions house-keepers acted straight away once reported to reception desk.Overall, loved Amsterdam and would certainly recommend hotel and stay there again (but find breakfast elsewhere)

<Content>Good Location The Rooms - clean but compact. Only using as a base so not that bothered by the size. Bed was very comfortable - and linen and towels in good condition and clean. Facilities in rooms was good. Breakfast - not so good. When we arrived for breakfast we were seated and immediately they came with orange juice. We thought we would order from the A La Cartre menu - but we were not asked and their continental breakfast was soon brought to the table. When our friends joined us we explained to them to make sure the waitress knows you want to order from the A La Carte. This they did and placed their order, but it never arrived.No apologies from the staff.Next morning we had breakfast in a nearby cafe - much better!The Restaurant Flo attached to the hotel seemed very popular so we tried it. It was good but the quality was reflected in the prices.I suppose you get what you pay for. Reception check in/out was smooth and efficient.For a 4* hotel I would of liked to have had the facility of a bar to sit and have a drink or coffee - the only bar was in the restaurant with pull up stools.I would go back there - but not my first choice.

<Content>Not great Stayed here for 3 nights at Easter. Booked a few months in advance, but due to it being Easter the best rate we could find was about 拢130 a night, so not cheap! Location is good, right next to Rembrandt Square. Rooms were nice, but small  I found them to be lacking in character. They've tried to make them modern but really it feels very much like a standard business hotel.The first morning we tried to have a shower  found that the water was freezing cold. We rang down to reception  apparently it was a problem with the whole hotel. We accepted that, problems happen. However, the next evening I tried to run a bath  found the same problem again. I reported this to housekeeping but they didn't seem overly concerned. I said we would expect a discount  they agreed.Anyway, when we checked out the reception hadn't been told about this so we basically had to raise it all again. The Assistant Manager gave us a 5% discount  said we should contact the Manager by email for a further discount. I sent 3 emails  finally a week later got a reply with a further 5%.Overall, its a pretty nice hotel, but even with the discount I found it to be overpriced. Okay, the bed was very comfy, but the lack of hot water was a really big problem. Also, the teabags were not replaced on a daily basis  the shampoo  shower gel in the bathroom were not replenished. Not good enough - I would stay elsewhere next time.

<Content>Good location, comfy beds Rooms were great although the bedroom area was a little on the small side, the bathrooms and comfortable beds really made up for this. All sights within easy walking distance - 5 mins walk to the flower market and 15-20 mins to Museumplein. Near to metro, trams and canalbus stops. Just round the corner from the hotel is Utrechtsestraat which contains some of the best restaurants in Amsterdam. During our stay there was a lot of unexpected construction work (both to us and the hotel) which the hotel kindly compensated us for. Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Good Hotel, Great Location Stayed March 31 - April 3. Booked through hotel website and got a very good deal. Very nice hotel in an excellent location. Yes, rooms are small, but such is the norm in Europe. From Central Station take the 4 or 9 tram to Rembrandtspein. Stepping off the train, walk in the direction the tram is going and the hotel is about 50 yards on your left. Took the advice of previous reviewers and requested a room on the fifth floor, facing the back - Room 564. Much quieter than the front room on the third floor which my travel mates were staying (Room 380). Construction was occuring during our visit too, but given the hotel's location, one really can't complain - it is the city. My flight was cancelled so arrived a day late and extended the reservation an extra day before arrival by phone - Kathy in reservations was very helpful and accomodating. Same thing for the weekend front desk attendent - Crystal - very pleasant and anticipated our early check-in. Would stay at this hotel again and recommend to others.

<Content>Romantic engagement in Amsterdam! We booked at the very last minute for a romantic easter break. It was difficult to find any available rooms at this busy time, but found a double room at the Eden Rembrandt Square Hotel. Much more than we would normally spend on a hotel, but rooms at a premium due to Easter. Walked from central station in about 15 mins, quite easy to find, very close to Rembrandt Square where bars, cafes, clubs, restaurants etc. An ideal distance away from the Red Light District and surrounding areas so can walk at night whilst staying in a nicer, more relaxed area. Room modern and nice, which would be expected from a new hotel. Can't comment too much on hotel facilities or food as only used room and didn't eat any food, staff friendly enough though. Room with comfortable bed, flat screen TV, mini bar (automatically charged!), nice bathroom with features such as warm mirror, frosted glass door, central bath taps. Lots of storage space. My main complaint was the noisy room as room faced main road. Traffic not a problem and didn't hear any construction noises as in previous reviews but quite a lot of noise from people leaving bars and clubs on square. I would stay again and would give a higher rating except for the very high charge due to easter. Next time I am more likely to stay on a hotel on a nearby canal as more romantic and less noisy. All that said a wonderful break in Amsterdam, a wonderful city with plenty to do for all ages and tastes, definitely a romantic place, my boyfriend even popped the question and bought me an Amsterdam diamond! Enjoy

<Content>Can't recommend I too stayed at this hotel during their restaurant construction. I was quite upset that there was no mention of the construction on their website when I made my reservation or when I checked in. As an aside, I had been scheduled to stay two nights, but due to a storm, my flight was cancelled and I only stayed 1 night. I gave them more than 24 hours notice that I wouldn't be there the first night, but had to pay for the room anyway. Again, when I wrote to tell them that I would not be there the first night, they didn't mention the construction. When I complained to the manager in the morning, I was told that they would give me a 50% discount for the second night. When it came to pay the bill, they would only take 45 euros off of the bill (nowhere near 50% of the second night.) When I pointed out what they had originally promised me, they acknowledged that they had said that but could only deduct 45 euros.

<Content>A fantastic find We knew we were in for a treat when our taxi driver told us that we were staying at a very nice hotel, in a good location. He wasn't wrong.The hotel is just off Rembrandt Square, in the heart of everything. Trams run directly from the square to the train station and the rest of Amsterdam. Everything that you need to see is within walking distance. If you feel like being more leisurely, as we did, you are close to canal boat stops.The square has lots of cafes and restaurants of varied styles and prices. Check out De Kroon - fantastic views of the square, Cafe L'Opera for it's great conservatory and Cafe Schiller for its art deco. There's also Cafe Smokey - the name says it all.As for the hotel itself. Well, we couldn't fault it, despite being there during renovations. The room was a good size for a short stay. The bed was large and extremely comfortable. The decor was modern and there was an lcd tv with English channels. The bathroom was fantastic with heated flooring, a brilliant shower and very well presented. The cleanliness was imaculate.Our room was on the 5th floor at the front of the hotel.The one downside of the location of our room was the noise from drunken revellers in the square. However, this was only a problem on Saturday night, and we did realise in the morning that our window wasn't quite shut properly which may have made things worse.We ate in restaurant FLO which is attached to the hotel. The food was fantastic, well worth the rather expensive price.

<Content>Good but not great As most of the other reviews have said, the location of this hotel is very good. It's just off Rembrandt Square which has some bars, restaurants, a nightclub and a nice selection of less commercialised coffee shops near by. There is a tram stop about 200m away but if the thought of trams seems a bit scary as it did to us, the hotel is about a 15-20 minute walk from Central Station. Our room was at the front of the hotel with the trams going past between 6am -12am. The noise isn't much of a problem until they ring the bell to warn people to get out the way. Unfortunately no amount of double glazing will keep that noise out so I suggest asking for a room away from the front of the hotel. We were then woken at 8am (admittidly it was a Monday) by workman on the building site directly opposite which we had failed to notice upon our arrival on a quite Sunday afternoon.The quality of the room was very good value with modern fittings and clean although we did not spend much time there. Flat screen tv with a few english channels amongst others and v. comfy beds. The mini-bar is automatic so charges you even if you move something then put it back. Desk with chair and nice arm chair with foot stool but you should know that the bathroom door is mainly frosted but doesn't give much privacy so I wouldn't recommend for people who aren't that close to the person sharing the room! Lovely powerful shower and reasonable hair dryer.My main bug bear with this hotel is the housekeeping. On our first morning, we left the Do Not Disturb sign on the door until about 11am when we left for the day and turned it round to say Please clean our room. We returned from a day of sightseeing at around 7pm to find our beds have not been made (2 singles as I don't think they have doubles). I kept my cool and politely explained to the receptionist (who was a little abrupt unlike many of the natives) that despite being out for 8 hours during the day, our room had still not been serviced. She apologised and said she'll get someone straight on to it. Thinking our problem was being resolved, we went out and enjoyed the evening only to return at midnight to find the room was still untouched. I was too tired to make a fuss at that time of the night so we made them ourselves and went to sleep. Normally, I would have really kicked off about that because when you pay to stay in a hotel, you don't expect to have to make your own bed. However on this occasion, I just wanted to get out and enjoy the sunshine without getting myself in a bad mood and we were leaving later that day so there was nothing really to be done about it. (I'd already paid in full via Expedia so no use trying to get money off the bill!) Having said all of the above, we were only in Amsterdam for 2 nights and although incredibly irritating, it did not in any way ruin our trip. If you are just going for a few days, I would recommend this hotel to my friends and would stay there again myself due to the location and high spec rooms but just remember to get a room away from the front of the building and probably not a good idea if you're staying for any length of time.

<Content>Have recommended to all my friends We booked this holiday through [----] and thought at such a reasonable price it all seemed to good to be true, especially when comparing to some other hotels in the area.I have to say once we arrived we were not disapointed, from the airport to the hotel it took a 20 minute inexpensive train ride and then a 10 minute tram ride- i would recommend buying your ticket fromthe tourist information office in Amsterdam as they speak English thoroughly and you end up saving a bit of money.The hotel receptionist were very welcoming and informative and once we entered our room we were thrilled.There was a large and i mean large bed, a lcd tv, the bathroom was amazing and our room overlooked the square.- it was immaculate.Our hotel was central so we ended up walking to all the museums which were about a 10 minute walk away, the choice of food is amazing and i thought great value for money.Luckly we had arrived during a music festival so the streets were buzzing at night with live bands and orchestra's as stages had been set up all around Amsterdam. We went on the bank holiday so i dont know if this takes place every year, but i think its something you need to experience.I went on this holiday with my partner we found it very romantic and the hotel really made the holiday.

<Content>What a complete Joke!! do yourself a favour and don't stay. This place masquerades as a decent hotel, however don't be fooled!! As someone who is unfortunate enough to spend 75% of my life in hotels (some people even call me Alan Partridge) I certainly know what I am talking about on this subject. I have now stayed in this hotel from Monday to Friday and one weekend for a month. I have been in a number of rooms in this time. The first room I had was excellent, very good decor and a really nice bathroom with a bath and separate shower. This week was fine, however since then things have got progressively worse. The noise from the Trams and the drunks at night trundling past your window at 3am is a little irritating. Most of the other rooms I had although well decorated are all very small. The standard breakfast that costs an arm and a leg is exactly the same EVERY morning, a baguette, croissant, one slice of cheese and once slice ham served with of ONE glass of orange and one coffee or tea. You do have the option of some nicer stuff but all of that costs extra on top of the already very expensive basic price......even a top up of orange costs extra!!! You are probably bored by now, however the worst is yet to come. After working very late and arriving at 2am in the hotel I was very ready for bed. I managed to drop off at about 2:30am only to be awoken at 4am by drilling and hammering!!! In their infinite wisdom they decide to refurbish the restaurant directly beneath my and a number of other rooms and at 4am!. I called to complain twice but was fobbed off being told they could do nothing. After only getting 2 and a half hours sleep I eventually gave in and got up at 8am. I complained in the morning to the Manager and was treated with contempt, eventually she agreed to change my room..........to a much smaller room although at least it was now non smoking like I had originally asked for!! As I was already late for a customer meeting the hotel staff agreed to move my suitcase and clothes in the wardrobe for me, when I returned in the evening, you guessed it my clothes where gone. The hotel has now lost ALL of my clothes, I am left with one pair of jeans and one shirt!!! If you are coming here for a drunken weekend where you don't really intend sleeping and when you do sleep you do not intend to get out of bed for breakfast then you will probably have an OK time, everyone else should stay away!!!

<Content>Budget luxury My boyfriend and I stayed at the Eden last year. We actually arrived on the opening night! As we walked through the revolving doors at lunchtime to check in workmen were still frantically dashing around drilling light fittings and and hoovering the sofas. To be honest it all added to the excitement and the lobby was pristine by evening.The rooms were compact and functional, plenty of cupboard/drawer space. The bed was HUGE and super-soft. Wall mounted LCD TV and cool decor made the room feel very hip and boutique-y. Only major draw back to the room was the fact that the bathroom walls were glass, yes, glass. And only partially etched so actually not very private at all. Scarier than that was the fact that the bathroom door was salon-style so no noises were contained! We got used to it quite quickly, but we did feel quite uncomfortable at first as we really hadn't been together that long.Our room had particularly noisy air-con which I found really irritating, and on complaining I found the reception staff to be quite flippant and unwilling to help. Porters and cleaners on the otherhand were very courteous and responsive.There was an empty space where the mini bar and safe should have been, but I must stress that we were amoung the very first guests and that didn't detract from the experience.We didn't eat at the restuarant even thought it opened 1/2 way though our stay. The menu looked pretty good, some interesting fish dishes.Great location, fantastic urban-cool feel. If we ever go back to Amsterdam, the Eden is my 1st choice.

<Content>Construction Noise Nightmare Well, I'm at the Eden Rembrandt Square Hotel as I write this review, and after a very long sleepless night, the noise is still ongoing from the hotel's renovation construction work. They stopped work at around 11pm, but started again at 4:30am, so the hammering has just not stopped really.The room is fine, very good in fact, very clean, with nice bedding and toiletries. Free high speed internet access by a cable is on a small desk, which is also very good. The room also has a kettle with coffee/tea packets, and a minibar as well.The lobby restaurant is closed due to the renovations.My opinion is that unless you can sleep through any amount of noise, you are probably better off waiting until this renovation work is completed. I know I won't be comng back here again until it's done.

<Content>Good location, lacks something? Stayed at this hotel in Feb. When we arrived we recieved a bit of a frosty welcome. The room was modern and well decorated, the plasma tv on the wall is a nice touch. I think that the beds were nice but maybe a bit too soft, I actually booked this after reading the reviews on tripadvisor and It did live up to the good reviews. All in all it is a nice modern hotel with good facilities. There are plenty of bars and restaurants around and we went to Rain on rembrandt square one night and had a great time.In general I would reccommed.

<Content>Tiny single room the only disadvantage I spent the nights of March 8 and 9 in the Eden Rembrandt Square while in Amsterdam on business. My room was tiny - the bathroom was almost equal in size. However, the bed was comfortable and the contemporary decor was pleasant. The multilingual staff at reception were bright and helpful. There's nothing wrong with the FLO restaurant downstairs but there are plenty of attractive eating-places nearby if you want a change. I would come back but I'd hope for a better room!

<Content>Very good value for the money I have been coming to Amsterdam for well over a decade for business, and this little hotel is one of the best values in Amsterdam.I was there for one night on March 2nd before a flight to NYC. Booked with a local hotel agency for under E100 for the night.The bad news - ludicrous single beds, a bed so small that you are literally afraid to move b/c you will fall off, but they did warn about the single bed at the time of the booking and offered to upgrade to a double bed for an additional E25.The good news. Everything is clean and new. Flat screen TV and a bathroom with a bathtub and easily as large as the (small) room itself. Definitely not a fancy 5star place. But, an extremely solid value for the money. Also worth noting that the restaurant attached to Eden, Flo is one of the top rated restaurants in Amsterdam, and while its culinary ambition (reach) exceeds its grasp, it is certainly head and shoulders better than any hotel and most stand alone restaurants. An additional plus is that you can charge the meal to your room, so it's convenient to settle all the bills at once.

<Content>Smart hotel and value for money Just returned from 2 nights in this hotel. The loction was excellent and very easy to find. It is close to all the main tourist spots. The staff are very efficient with time to help custumers which is a refreshing change. The concierge Mohammed gives freely of his time and he is enthusiastic about his city. Check in is 1500 hours but bags are stored securely for you and tickets are issued.Rooms are clean and well designed. For 110 euro per night this was a bargain and I would return again without hesitation.Restaurant was a bit pricey at 12.50 e for continental breakfast but there are loads of brown bars who can provide a good breakfast for less.From wake up calls to arranging taxis for us to the airport the service was flawless. Beds were very comfortable, area was very quiet. No complaints.I am hesitant about giving this hotel such a gleaming review as it will make my chance of getting a booking here again even harder but credit where credit is due.

<Content>Great Location  My husband  I have just returned from a 3-night/4day midweek break to Amsterdam. Our experience of this hotel is in keeping with the majority already posted - lovely comfy beds, quiet (we were on the fourth floor at the front), clean, efficient etc. Free internet access made on-line check-in for our flight home a doodle, though not able to print out as pc didnt have adobe.We had breakfast included (they call it a 'french' breakfast), which was a sufficient cold continental - 2 savoury  2 sweet breads plus ham  cheese with coffee/tea. [If you are after a 'proper' cooked affair, go find irish bar 'Durty Nellies' (off the Red Line District) which is fab].We felt the only thing lacking was a hotel bar - the restaurant FLO did have a bar, but it doesnt really invite you in (eg. nowhere to sit except at a restaurant table) after a night out.

<Content>A Little Dissapointed! So everyone goes on about the beds....not too many people mentioned that its two single beds pushed together in ALL the rooms. Thats why I was dissapointed. We were also on honeymoon, but didn't even get an upgrade even though we mentioned this when booking. Room quite small. I work as a front office manager in a hotel and am forever upgrading people!!Would not stay there again because of this...everything else was great, especially the staff.

<Content>Great find in Amsterdam! What a great hotel in Amsterdam!Like the other reviews have said, this place has the comfiest beds ever! Rooms are clean  modern, and the bathrooms are fab - ours only had half a door though, and that was made of glass, so would recommend only for couples or people who know each other very well! There is a proper door on the toilet though, so at least some things can stay private.As well as the comfy beds, the hotel is really quiet at night even though you are just off Rembrandt Square, so is great for a good nights sleep.FLO Amsterdam, the hotel's restaurant is also good - not cheap, but the food and atmosphere was great. Would recommend making reservations though as its packed even on a Monday night.One thing to note - if you are paying in cash for your stay, they require a 50euro deposit on arrival, in addition to the full cash payment upfront. You get this back on departure (unless you've drank it from the mini bar!) but its just something to be aware of.Overall was a great stay - great rooms, friendly, helpful staff, and good food.

<Content>Great Hotel Myself and 3 friends stayed at this hotel from 26-28 January 2007; got a great price (room only) on easytobook.com. Our second choice was the Amsterdam American hotel, but we liked the fact that the Eden was easier to get to from the Central Station and the rooms are nice and modern. Free internet access in reception was handy for checking in on line when returning home.This hotel is in a great location, just off Rembrandt Square. It is also easy to get to from the Central Station after taking the train from the airport with a ride on tram 4 or 9 to the square. Trams are inexpensive and frequent and run to a very accurate timetable.20 minute walk from the hotel to Dam Square, plenty of restaurants nearby but one thing to note: most restaurants close at 11pm so by the time we arrived and went to find a restaurant, a lot were closed or closing. Also recommend reserving a table at a restaurant if you find one you like as the ones we liked (Indonesian, Thai, Malaysian) were all full on the Saturday night as apparently, Dutch people eat out early and spend all night in the restaurant.Felt very safe walking about in the evening especially back from the Red Light District at 1am as lots of people were about.Would also recommend the Canal Bus Tour and the Van Gough museum for something to do.Plan to return to Amsterdam either in the summer or within the next year and will definitely stay at this hotel.

<Content>Location, Location, Location Have just arrived back from a 4 night stay at this hotel, booked via BMI BABY  apart from having to pay an extra 5% 'city tax' per person, per night when we checked out, we were very pleased with our stay.The location of the hotel is excellent - 5 mins left to the Jewish History Museum  5 mins right to Dam Square. The hotel is on Rembrandt Square which I can highly recommend as there are plenty of quality restaurants  bars all set around the square  the area was very safe at night  much more upmarket  less crowded than the Leidesplein area.I can highly recommend L'Opera for food, it's also the perfect place to enjoy a coffee while watching the world go by  is very popular with the locals who dine here before seeing a show at the theatre.You must also visit the Chinese beauty salon next door to L'Opera as I can thoroughly recommend the full body massage, manicure  pedicure after a long day of sightseeing.There is plenty to do within a stone's throw of the hotel - 'Three Sisters' Pub, 'Rain' Bar/Club, 'Rembrandt Cafe', 'Subway' Sandwiches, Cinema  High Street Shopping - HM, Body Shop, Diesel, Skechers  the Magna Plaza Shopping Centre are all within a short walk away.The hotel staff were friendly, helpful, the rooms are modern, clean, spacious, the beds are the softest I've ever slept on, the luggage room is safe  well organised  the concierge speaks every language imaginable.I couldn't fault this hotel, the staff, or the location, the only negative, is that Amsterdam is currently going through a major refurbishment, due for completion 2008, therefore, many major attractions are not fully open, or surrounded by scaffolding (ie. Dam Square, Jewish History Museum, Van Gogh Museum, Rijks Museum, Central Station  many of the cobbled streets are being renovated).Enjoy your trip, we did!

<Content>Great Hotel Experience First we read reviews posted on TripAdvisor, and they were generally very good. The write-up on Expedia encouraged us to look more closely, and the price/package was good, though we were only there one night on a flying visit. Check in was at three (we arrived at 1200 midday) but the concierge stored our bags while we stepped out. The Hotel is one minute from Rembrandtplein and the same to the stop for Trams 4 and 9 for the Central Station via the Dam. Reception was efficient and professional, in keeping with the Hotel's modern ambience. Our room was surprisingly large, lots of room to move/spread out, a nice armchair and flat-screen TV with excellent menu of TV channels, films etc. Minibar with intelligent (rather scary) fridge that automatically knows what you've removed. Kettle, drinks, glasses (sparkling clean). The room was immaculate, though there was a vague tobacco smell (we asked for non-smoking). Bathroom super, gleaming, shower cap, ample space to lay out make-up stuff (my wife says all women appreciate a bathroom with shelves, good lighting etc). Check-out is an indulgent 1200 midday - what a boon.Beds super-soft, delicious. Room quiet, warm, sanctuary. This hotel deserves to be a well-kept secret, and we would like to return. Summit hotels (the chain) have hotels world-wide. Hope they are all as good. Native English-speakers should IMO never take for granted the skill and application of Dutch staff in meeting their needs so effortlessly. Congratulations to everyone concerned.A small concern, a disconcerting step up to the bathroom from the main suite, and step down when leaving it. It caused us both to stumble slightly, but you'd probably t used if you stayed a few nights, I suppose.

<Content>Eden in Rembrandt Square I am a regular Amsterdam visitor for business. I was always staying at Swissotel Amsterdam due to our company aggreement. However due to lack of space, I had to find an alternative for my first four days of my 10 days visit in November 2006.I have checked the reviews on tripadvisor and made a reservation to the hotel from the hotels website. The reviews on TA were describing something like a hotel in heaven. In this respect I was a bit disappointed, not because of hotel or the facilities it has, but just the tooo gooood comments increase my expectations. First thing I would like to tell, this is a real good hotel. As I have been to Amsterdam several times, I can easily name it, as a best buy you can get in Amsterdam. But dont expect the hotel of your dreams, just a nice, reasonable, modern and comfortable oneThe hotel is located at Rembrandt square, a very nice and convenient place. It costs around 10鈧?from the central station by taxi or you can take the tram 4, 16 or 25 from the CS to Rembrandt Square and walk 30 meters to the Hotel. The rooms are so comfortable. The bathroom is very nice and good quality soaps, shower gels are making a long bath very enjoyable. The beds, are marvellous. I can tell that I had one of the nicest beds after so many years. The only bad part is you wont even want to wake up. All rooms are equipped with an LCD tv with nearly 20 international channels and also pay tv channels.One very good thing of the hotel is that they offer a free internet connection. There are two desktops in the lobby and wireless network. If you carry your laptop, you can easily connect and also there is an LAN connection in the room free of charge. It is not easy to find free internet connection in Amsterdam in many places. After my stay at Eden, I passed to Swissotel again, but I suppose next time I will totally stay at Eden..

<Content>The best hotel I've stayed in in Europe I stayed in this hotel for 4 nights on December 2006, and had the best time. I read the reviews here and booked the hotel because of them and the excellent price we got. but I was sceptic on how accurate the review were. well, they knew what they were talking about!!!1. The beds, oh the beds. I didn't understand why people here were so excited about the beds, until I got to the hotel. It was the most comfortable sleep I can remember.2. The rooms are clean, they provide shampoo etc. and refill every day if necessary. the rooms are always clean and tidy. 3. the hotel is in a great location, almost on remberandt square which is full of restaurants, bars and coffee shops, but just far enough for us not to hear ANYTHING in our room. it's 30 seconds walk and a whole different world. there are trums there to anywhere you want, though it's best to just walk :-).the Dam square is 10 minutes by foot and the road is through all the shops so it's nice...4. The reception and concierge were very nice. we could leave our luggage in the hotel after check out. there is free internet with 2 computers in the lobby for the guests (were never busy) and even a printer. the internet for your laptop is not wireless (only in the lobby) but it's free, which was great in order to stay in touch with the family back home.5. The breakfast was included so it was nice (we payed for extras like omletes which are not included). if i hadn't gotten it in the room price, I probably would have eaten out. but with the extras it was tasty and sufficient.6. at the hotel you get quite a good map of amsterdam, so don't buy one if you don't have to.7. There is a great bath!!!8. As advised here I asked and got a room on the 5th floor. The room was very big (double bed, desk, chair, room for 2 huge suitcases). There are only double beds. there is a safe in the room which was great.all and all, this is THE place to stay in Amsterdam.

<Content>Believe what you read - highly recommended Just back from a four night stay between Christmas and New Year at the Eden Rembrandt Square Hotel. Central location, just off Rembrandt Square where there are loads of pubs, restaurants and clubs. Don't worry about noise, we didn't hear a thing although we were on the third floor.We had two rooms booked and there was quite a difference. Our room had a bath and shower and overlooked a busy call centre (had to keep the curtains closed!). The second room had disabled features and was more spacious but there was no bath. Bathroom and beds were great. The only fault I found was that the rooms were rather dimly lit as there was no central light. Just eat plenty of carrots and you'll be fine!!!Tip - there are four items sitting on the shelves (crisps, nuts and wine). Don't touch them as it trips off a wire and you'll get charged!!!

<Content>Great location From main train station is about 15 euros, don't pay more. Great location, next to Rembrandt Square. I am writing this sitting in the lobby of this hotel. Room is very small, but with newer, modern amenities. Plazma TV, excellent bed and bedding, onlike other European hotels bed is sitting high. Bathroom is nice, but no shower curtain. There is a french restaurant, but we found a nice italian restaurant not far from hotel. Guess we will try french tomorrow. Stuff is helpfull, but there is no bar in lobby. Room is so small, you can't lay down a small suit case on the floor. Furniture is nice and we don't care about walking space in the hotel room. Recommend and will stay again.

<Content>Terrific beds!! Stayed here for 2 nights as part of a 5 night stay in Amsterdam. When we arrived outside the Hotel we had our doubts but once inside we were much happier. Location is pretty good for seeing the city.Our room had a view of the back yard which was pretty miserable  made the room look dark. The bathroom was terrific - ultra chic and the bath products were great. The beds are fantastic (one of the reasons we chose this hotel having read other reviews!!).However, overall we thought the hotel lacked character.

<Content>Great hotel Great location Like most people here we loved this hotel. It may not look much from the outside or have great views from the rooms but it more than makes up for it in other ways. The Rembrandtplein is a great place to stay quieter than the busy city centre, yet has plenty of bars and restaurants locally. It is a pleasant 5 minute stroll into the busier heart of the city. The hotel itself is great I found all the staff to be very friendly and helpful and nothing seemed to be too much trouble for them. The room was great well appointed and finished to a very high standard. And as a few people have mentioned the beds are so comfortable, in fact when we got home we went to buy a new mattress as we felt we had been missing out on real comfort for so long. As someone mentioned the toilet doors are fine if you are a couple but may not provide enough privacy for some situations. Overall I would highly recommend this hotel and when we go back next year we will be staying there again.

<Content>great room at the Eden We just got back from amsterdam yesterday after a fantastic 5 day break. I booked the hotel from reading the previous reviews and I was delighted with the hotel...Our room was so comfortable..We had a lovely comfy bed and a great bath which filled in seconds. There were also a selection of movies that you could choose from to watch for approx 鈧?2 per movie..which is handy for watching after getting back from the pubs. I found all the staff very helpful and when I rang reception to see if they had an adapter they send one up straight away....We had dinner on the last night in FLO, which also was delicious... I would recommend this hotel and I'm sure I will be back...

<Content>Very nice The hotel was very modern, from the flat screen TV, the furniture and the glass shower, which could be almost seen through when someone was taking the shower (hopefully someone you want to see). Comfortable beds, but for some reason two mattrasses in one bed. Looked really clean and nice. Just a short tram ride form the central station, right in the middle of the city. Short walk to almost everything.

<Content>Pleasant stay at the Eden Rembrandt Had a very pleasant stay at this hotel. Location is perfect, within walking distance of everything, located just outside the Rembrantplein, its a short walk to the Leidseplein, Museumplein or Dam Square. You can walk to any destination within the center in no more than 20 minutes if you don't get lost. The rooms were very nice. Very clean, very modern. The shower wall was a little trippy with the frosted glass covering a major part of the shower but all in all the bathroom was nice and you still had your privacy. If you want to watch TV at the end of the day, I think you will be very pleased with the quality of the TV and screen. Beds as have been discussed, were very very comfortable. They were two twins pushed together but it really felt like one double bed.The staff was friendly. The bellman who handled the luggage while we waited for our room were very attentive and did an excellent job. The front desk is a bit unorganized, they have a couple of bugs to work out but it didn't have much of an impact on our overall experience. The maid service was great, they even folded some of our clothes. Overall this is a nice hotel and while not cheap, its not as pricey as some of its competition. Its not the Ritz Carlton but that's probably not what you are looking for anyway. I think you will be happy with this selection and I would stay here again.

<Content>Don't do it unless you like having your belongings stolen!!!! We booked this hotel on the basis of the great reviews on Tripadvisor (which in the past has always been spot on). However, we had items go missing from our room (designer jeans  aftershave). When we reported this to the manager they were dismissive  really did not want to know - stating that the hotel cannot accept liability  we should have used the mini-safe! We had of course used the mini-safe for valuables but how can you put ALL your belongings in a space that is 30x30cm?? All in all the staff were unhelpful  unresponsive - although they did offer a free breakfast - not really a substitute for 拢200 of stuff disappearing from your room though!I have never had any problem like this before  until recent years have stayed in some much less salubrious accomodation. The standard rooms are very, very, small and the first room we were shown to was not clean - pubic hair on the bed - yuck!AVOID, AVOID, AVOID!!!

<Content>Great Stay Stayed at this hotel for our Wedding Anniversary at the beginning of October. Booked after reading other reviews. Everyone right - beds extremely comfortable and room well equiped. Great location for exploring Amsterdam and not at all noisy. Hotel not attractive to look at but inside fine. Concierge helpful in booking restaurant, Zuid Zealand (excellent and expensive).We would defintely stay here again if visiting Amsterdam.

<Content>Awfull, never again It smells of smoke the moment you get into the lobby. The room was on non-smoking floor but very tiny and had a problem. The only room that was offered in exhange was smoking. And even though it was the hotel's fault the duty manager wanted to charge extra... If you really want to have nice time in Amsterdam, look elsewhere.

<Content>Very Very Nice and Modern!!! Facts:-Very modern, clean, comfortable room. (We went there with our friends, so we have seen that not all the rooms are the same in size, Our friends told us that we had the biggest room. It was a corner room, no. 594, fyi.)-I just loved the bed! It's incredibly comfortable.-Bathroom has a glass door, but the toilet has a seperate door inside, so nothing to worry about :)-Coffee,tea maker in the room-Plasma TV in the room-Safe in the room-Nice and always helpful staff, helpful concierge. (Ask the concierge to reserve a taxi to take you to the airport (if u plan to go by taxi) , which is a little bit cheaper than the normal taxis. This one costs 48鈧?-Very close to Rembrandtplein, which is a very popular square. There are clubs and bars in Rembrandtplein but because of the location of the hotel, you hear nothing! U can have very quiet sleeps.-Very close to the main attractions of the city. But the area is more upscale compared to Dam and surroundings. So is a great place to stay.-Price: Nothing is really cheap in Amstedam, hotels are overly priced. Eden Remb. Sq. Hotel is not cheap either. We paid 520鈧?for 3 nights for a double room,breakfast not included. But we were really very happy about the hotel ! Strongly recommended!!!

<Content>very good up to check out I liked this hotel - good location, mostly friendly staff.nice if smallish room. However, the experience was spoiled at checkout by the rather rude duty manager. When I booked you could tick an option for breakfast sepertae from the room rate but I didn't take on day 2 and wanted them to deduct from total. She was completely inflexible and quite rude in I couldn't care if you stayed here agin sort of way.The breakfast isn't worth the 9 Euros.I would have recommended this hotel wholeheartedly until checkout and my encounter with Ms.Koggel!

<Content>Great location, fab beds! We got back yesterday from our weekend stay at the Eden Rembrandt Square and loved every minute of it.The location was great, not literally on the square but almost which made it great for not hearing anything outside whilst we were sleeping.We arrived quite early and the girl on reception was very helpful, giving us our room number for later, checking in our luggage etc. We had a few hours to kill before our room was ready so we wandered around for ages and visited the Anne Frank house.When we returned to the hotel, a different person was on reception who was not as helpful and insisted on answering the phone whilst we were talking to him! He didnt have any record of our booking even though we had already been given our room number. Not too much of a problem, he gave us another room straight away and we ended up with a room with disabled access with actually left us with a bigger room. The concierges here were very very helpful and very friendly if you need anything.The rooms were very comfortable with lovely beds and pillows - after a long day walking they were very hard to get out of!!Flat screen TV's were a nice touch with a couple of BBC channels to watch while we got ready to go out in the evening.Not too sure about the glass doors to the bathroom! They looked good but the toilet was located just inside the door so I could pretty much see what my husband was up to!!Overall, a good clean and modern hotel in a great location with helpful staff. We are already wanting to book to go back here!

<Content>They get the important stuff right Our first trip to Amsterdam, didn't know what to expect, what a pleasant gem of a hotel! Would definitely stay there again. Although the lobby has all the ambiance of a Red Roof Inn, our room had all the comforts of the Ritz Carlton. 5-star bedding and pillows! Room was suprisingly large by European standards. Arrived at 1030AM exhaused from flight and curtly told our room would not be ready until standard 3PM (turned out 3PM was more like 430PM and front desk staff could use a weekend retreat at charm school, but this is the only negative). Asked for a room on the 5th floor, per suggestions from previous reviews on TripAdvisor, and was not disappointed. Wound up with a junior suite, with no attempt to upcharge us. Free high speed internet access made checking emails a breeze. Americans may wish to consider bringing a roll of TP as the Kleenex in the bathroom was a bit tough to handle. Can't figure out why there was no shower curtain, by design, but it all worked out. Chambermaid staff was first rate. Location of hotel was 50 yards off Rembrandt Square, which is just as active and interesting a location as anywhere else in town. Experienced the Invasion of the Orange People, as soccer fans descended upon the square in ever increasing droves to tailgate (a difficult task without cars) before the game. Expected deafening levels of revelry and debauchery after the victory; if they occurred, we did not hear a thing in our room. Avoid the restaurant adjacent to hotel for breakfast; they got everything wrong on our final day there. The cafes on the square much more charming with better food.

<Content>The best beds This hotel has a three star rating but it is far better than any three star we stayed in. After a very long flight to Europe, we were so pleased to have a couple of nights to recover from jet lag in this place. The location was great, very central, clean, quiet and by far the best beds we have slept in. Would stay there in a minute.

<Content>Eden is a must The Eden was in a great location near Rembrandt Square. This Square has plenty of restaurants  bars. It is a busy location but not as touristy as Dam Square. It is close to all the major attractions. Overall, our experience was excellent. We were able to check in by 11:30am after our overnight flight from Boston. The rooms are not huge but very typical for Europe. The beds were very comfortable, we now need to buy a feather bed! We actually had problems getting out of bed each morning. The bathrooms were very modern  well done, except for the bath/shower not having a glass enclosure. The concierge were very friendly  helpful. We did not eat in the restaurant or have the breakfast. There are so many great cafes  restaurants there is no need to spend the money at their restaurant. Amsterdam is a must  so is the Eden!

<Content>Very nice hotel, good value There were only a few reviews when we booked this hotel, all positive, and since then there has been many singing its praises, and we will join in the chorus.Since the hotel was so wonderful, let me begin with the problems. We actually had a little problem finding the hotel, there are no directions from the hotel website, and the duplicity of names of streets and hotels (there's a Best Western Eden around the corner) resulted in a couple of loop-de-loops around Rembrandtplein despite asking for directions. The hotel is not visible from the Square.The hotel is the only one I've come across in Europe so far that has enforced its check-in time, so don't count on checking in early and resting after a red-eye.The bathroom is beautiful, but the doors are loud and somewhat unwieldy. In addition, our bathroom was partitioned from the bedroom by a translucent / transparent glass wall. This would be wonderful if I were on the trip with someone that I want to see naked showering, but inconvenient if I were on the trip with someone that I did not want to see naked (i.e. my mom).The hotel is between Rembrandtplein and Waterlooplein, and surprisingly quiet given its location. The room was beautiful and well done, despite the minor bathroom complaints. There are many nice and cheap places to eat around the hotel, and as other reviewers have noted, the hotel restaurant is pretty good though slightly pricy. Ditto for Indrapura, an Indonesian restaurant, across the Square.There is free Internet access at the hotel (a big plus), and a good selection of teas / coffees (and some delicious hot chocolate) in the room. The staff was extremely pleasant and helpful.All in all, a good value for 200 USD, a great value considering that it's in a good location in Amsterdam.

<Content>classy but resonable!! got a taxi from the schipol, with a great woman Monika, she gave my partner some perfume and did us a deal on the taxi if we booked our return with her, which we did and it worked out a good deal. the hotel from the outside doesnt look much but when you step in...wow very nice..clean...modern and everyone is so nice and helpfull! checked in no probs a went to our room on the 5th floor.....exceptional, very comfy beds and love the glass looking into the en-suite shower and bathroom area.walking around was fine we had a trip on the canal-bus which was very good and our guy was soo funny with his WOWS every other word!went down to the RLD and had a walk round found a few good bars and shops very entertaining, although missus was a bit shocked ha ha ha.went to the rijkesmuseum not as good as i was expecting, but the heineken museum was a good laugh especially the send a clip of you singing home section very interactive and well worth the 10 euro's.some great food especially recommend the Teppanyaki nippon if you like japanese, just ask concierge he will guide you in the right direction and book you a table...we were gonna go to the osaku hotel but he mention this place within walking distance and we werent disappointed. coco's aussie bar was good aswell with happy hour 5-6 and 10-11pm on the cocktails.in all a very enjoyable 4 days and we will definately be going back there and staying at the eden again. very helpfull and very clean. definately go for a 5th floor room and non smoking if you can they are the best.

<Content>Great Hotel - Excellent Location !!! My partner and I just returned from a weeks stay at the Eden Hotel Rembrandt Square. The hotel is located just off Rembrandt Square which is an excellent location as you can walk to everything !The hotel is brand new, the rooms are modern and very very comfortable. The beds are wonderful and the rooms have the triple glass windows so noise was not a problem. Bathrooms are spacious but if you get a room with only a bath, there is no shower door or curtain so it can get a little wet. The hotel does not have room service so just be aware if you like your breakfast in bed. The hotel staff is very accomodating and friendly. The concierge's are very good and helpful. I would definitely stay again at this hotel. It is an excellent product. The hotel restaurant FLO is a very popular restaurant in Amsterdam and reservations are required. The staff had a little attitude one night when we went in, but having dinner there was a great experience.

<Content>A great hotel in a great city I've recently returned from a 3 night mid-week break in amsterdam. We booked the eden rembrandt square hotel after reading the other reviews.The rooms were excellent and the beds were sooooo comfortable that getting out of them each morning was a shame. I'd recomend catching the train from Schipol airport to Centraal station and then getting tram 4 or 9 that will take you to rembrandt square - the hotel is just off the square next to FLO. We made the mistake of catching a taxi from the station and getting ripped off by the driver, who charged us 20 Euro's for a 5 minute ride which should have been more like 8 euros. If you're going to do this - haggle before you get in the taxi.We didn't have breakfast at the hotel - instead there are quite a few bakeries around the square and a fansatic show next to the supermarket which sells fresh fruit salads etcI'd recomend searching out some of the samller places to eat along the canals just off the main square - the service and quality is much better.We couldn't fault the hotel and when ever we needed something additional i.e. ironing board, it was delivered promptly to our room. Amsterdam is a great place to walk around, we did 20 miles in 3 days! We will most definitely be going back and will stay at the eden again.

<Content>Great rooms We originally booked via the net into the neighbouring Eden Best Western and were exteremely dispappointed. We enquired about an upgrade and were told that Best Western is located back to back with it's sister Hotel; The Eden Rembrandt with whom it's shares it's administration. We were handed over to the Rembrandt and were amazed at the difference between the 3 start Best Western and the 4-star Rembrandt for only an additional $40 per night. The rooms were EXTREMELY comfortable and airconditioned (a rarity for 4 star hotels in Amsterdam). The rooms appeared to have been recently refurbished. Whenever we returned after a days shopping and sight seeing, the room were always clean and neat. As regards breakfast, try avoid taking a breakfast inclusive rate. You can do far better at one of the numerous eating places throughout the city. the Hotel is well located and only 200 metres from Rembrandt Plein. Although it is a further from popular toursit places such as Leidse Plein, the red light district and Dam Sqaure remember Amsterdam is flat so walking even long distances is easy especially in a city as pretty as Amsterdam. Located about 5 min walk from the Hotel is athe city's gay area full of trendy and extremely busy bars and restaurants. Similar quality accomodation in an only slightly more central hotel will cost a lot more.

<Content>Good value hotel - watch the parking! We stayed at the Eden Rembrandt Square overnight in August. It's in a great position - easy for the centre and bars, whilst still quiet at night, unusual in a lot of city centre hotels. The rooms, whilst not enormous are good with really comfy beds, great shower and good facilities.The receptionists could have been friendlier but the concierge staff were all great.Our only grumble is that we parked in the car park recommended on the website on the Waterlooplein and followed their instructions to get there. The website says we will be offered a 10% discount as a guest of the hotel.We did park there and unfortunately our car was broken into and all our luggage stolen, although I am not blaming the hotel for this.Obviously we still had to pay our car park bill but when we asked for the discount at the hotel, both the receptionists and concierge said that they didn't offer a discount at the hotel and named another car park which was a greater distance away from the hotel.The Waterlooplein is not a cheap car park and although reasonably convenient to the hotel, having all your luggage stolen is not.

<Content>Excellent Value We stayed for 2 nights and had a great time. Hotel is modern, clean and quiet. Rooms are comfortable though some lights did not work and the open glass toilet/shower is a bit OTT.Amsterdam was really lively and lots to do. For a good value on-the-run lunch try La Place next the VB Dept Store at the Munt Tower - an amazing variety of freshly prepared food and self service.  Would also recommend de jaren at 20-22 Nieuwe Doelenstraat - it feels like an ex university bar but the upstairs is very modern and the food was excellent and mostly organic and reasonably priced. The downstairs is a trendy bar with a great selection of newspapers and you can sit outside next to the canal if the sun is out.

<Content>Great price, nice rooms, small breakfast My brother and I stayed here 29th - 31st August. Location is just off Rembrandt Sqaure which is about 15 mins walk from Cental Station. Everything is within walking distance, Dam Square, Red Light District, museums, bars, clubs and restaurants. Its a nice clean location. The hotel seems pretty new and is very modern in design. We arrived around 2pm and although check-in was specified as after 3pm we were shown to our room. Polite reception staff and concierge. Room was very modern design, nice shower/bathroom. The beds were VERY comfortable - the most comfortable I've slept in. Nice plasma TV on the wall with some UK channels as well, mini-bar (expensive) although the view was of the back of hotel its not something I'm that bothered about. Basically, the hotel photos and traveller photos are exactly how we found the hotel - the rooms, shower/bathroom and even the picture of the breakfast.Breakfast was a bit of a let down. The staff were pretty poor. They were uninformed and service was slow and you often had to ask for service. This is a complete contrast to the rest of the hotel staff. Strange. The actual breakfast was included in the price but all you get is OJ, Tea/Coffee, Pan au chocolat, pan au raisin and a plain baguette. This is quite filling although all hot food was extra. Scramble eggs with smoked salmon is lovely! Not over priced at 4 euros but it would have been nice to have hot breakfast included in the price.There is free internet access in the hotel reception (nice touch) and the concierge was helpful and knowledgable about the area. He does go missing quite a bit though.There was a luggage storage room if you needed to store luggage after checking out and before leaving the hotel.Overall I would definitley recommend this hotel. If you have a look on the web you can get very cheap deals. 2 people for 2 nights cost us 193 Euros (including 4 hot breakfasts). 50 Euros pppn for a 4* hotel in the heart of Amsterdam is great value!!! Though I fear this may go up as the hotel becomes more well known. I think the cheap prices are because it is new and needs customers. Get in while you can.

<Content>A great find We stayed in the Eden Rembrandt from the 29th Aug to 1st Sept. We had booked the hotel on the internet based on reviews we read on this website. We were upgraded on arrival as we were celebrating our anniversary. The room was very comfortable, with a large, luxurious bathroom. We were very happy with the service received. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel so cannot comment on it. Would recommend this hotel for comfort, central location and service.

<Content>Overrated  Stayed here for 3 nights end August on the basis of reviews on this site and was slightly dissapointed. The location of the hotel is good, however the room was a triumph of style over substance. The bed was 2 twins pushed together, I had requested a double when I booked, their web site states twin or king. When I queried this with reception the girl said that they don't have any king sized beds! The room itself was dingy, the aircon noisy, the carpet stained. The internet connection didn't work. The bathroom looked good, but the fittings were flimsy, there was no shower screen = slippy slate floor. There was nowhere to hang wet towels, and even some unpainted MDF on display. On a positive note, the staff were (mostly) friendly and helpful, Flo Bistro next door serves good seafood, although is very busy,  service was slow the night we visited.My overall impression was that this hotel has opened too early. I think this hotel would be a great budget hotel, or a reasonable 3 star if they finished it, but I won't stay again.

<Content>Staff needs training I stayed in August in the Eden Rembrandt Square. I booked a Non-Smoking room. During check in I was advised that no non-smoking room is available although I booked the room several month in advance. The receptionist just told me that this is only a request and nothing more. Not very friendly. Room a very trendy and nice and clean. Don't expect to much from the breakfast. They treat you like in a prison camp and you have to pay in addition for anything above jam. Even for cheese and that in the Netherlands.

<Content>geat hotel Me and my boyfriend stayed here 25-28th August, this hotel was as good as the other reviews stated, we arrived early and the room wasnt ready so we left our luggage there and went for a look around to find that everything was within walking distance of the hotel - dam square, too many bars and restaurants to choose from and the red light district which is a must - very surreal. when we got to the room it was worth the wait, the room was lovely, very clean and modern, the beds were the most comfortable ive ever stayed in and the bathroom was great, with geat shower - strange glass door which was a little frosted and didn't lock, which might be a bit stange if your staying with a friend or family.tip - the mini bar in the room was very expensive so we bought water/drinks from the shop and kept them in the fridge to keep them cool, we then realised that whenever we took our drinks out we got charged as they must have thought we were taking their drinks. we told reception of this and they sorted it for us, the staff were very helpful, there was an ice machine just outside our room so we just used that in future to keep our drinks cool.amsterdam was a geat place to stay, and when i come next time i will definately be staying at this hotel again.

<Content>Great Find, Great Location In the midst of a horrible heat wave, we arrived at the Eden a day early unannounced seeking air-conditioning. They were gracious and accommodating, giving us a very nice upgraded room because we were staying for 7 nights. The square is great with loads of restaurants, bars, exchanges nearby. You can stroll a few blocks to the Flower market or catch trams to anywhere right in front of the hotel. Nice rooms with great bathrooms...though it took awhile to figure out how to work the shower! Safe, Flat Screen TV with English channels, very sleek and contemporary stying. Although it did not have an internet available, if you let them know at the desk, they take you through a door to their sister hotel (Best Western) and give you a card for free internet access. You can get as many as you want during your stay. Very nice restaurant attached to the hotel. You may take breakfast there (we didn't), go to the bar or dine. Apparently it is one of Amsterdam's new ritzy places to eat, so you need to make reservations. If I go back to Amsterdam, I'll stay here again. Great bargain for a major city.

<Content>Reasonablle,good location. Stayed 8th - 10th Aug 2006, 2 adults + 2 teenagers.Booked 2 rooms through expedia, flights booked with Thompsonfly(--). Hotel in good position close to main attractions, very accessable by tram/ taxi from cent station, metro line at Waterlooplein 200m away. Hotel modern, comfortable and clean. Both rooms we had were very comfortable  clean but different although next to each other, ie 1 room did not have a bath. On arrival found reception/ concierge very helpful but after change of shift found the reception unhelpful (appeared stressed) concierge missing ( one couple waiting for bags for 25min before he was found!). Restaurant attached to hotel overpriced and service poor much better available around Rembrandtplien.  Rembrandtplatien - located centrally to all attractions and well served by tram/ canalbus, good restaurants  bars in area.Anne Frank museum a must takes approx 1 1/2 hrs, pre purchase tickets available for evenings or expect to queue for 1hr +. Hotel overall more 3+stars than four, more suited to buisness people, couples not family. Views from hotel non existant, will not be using hotel again.

<Content>A Great Suprise!! Would definitely stay here again we stayed one night here just last week because the houseboat we were renting was not ready yet. This hotel was such a wonderful surprise! very clean, very modern, the beds and pillows were COMFORTABLE, nice flat screen TV, the bathroom is very modern and has a great rain shower.the staff was very nice and helpful. we had a piece of lost luggage that we were still waiting on from the airline, and they took it in for us ever after we had checked out.ALSO fast internet access for those interested.LOCATION is excellent. In Rembrantplain, close to some great bars and good company. Price is very reasonable for europe prices.only inconvenient thing is when coming back to the hotel late at night - you have to wait for the receptionist to open the door for you. it's not a big deal, except when there is no receptionist in sight!i would definitely stay here again.
