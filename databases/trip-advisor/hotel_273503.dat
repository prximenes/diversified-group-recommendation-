<Content>Good value for money, fantastic location! I stayed at the hotel for 4 nights while I atteneded a congress in Frankfurt. The location was great, as it was less than 5 mins by foot from the contral train station. I walked to the exhibition center everyday, as it was just 15 mins away. It was one stop away from the main shopping street (i think it was called Zeil). I loved the breakfast, although they didn't serve a massive variety, all foods were very tasty - the sausages, bread, eggs and homemade yoghurt, which I loved most. The staff were always friendly and helpful. The room was very basic but spotless, super clean and warm (I went there in winter). I enjoyed Frankfurt very much partly becoz I had great sleep every night. I will go back to the same hotel again!

<Content>Excellent location! My husband and I stayed here over the Christmas holidays in 2007. We booked online for about 46 euro a night.The location of this hotel is EXCELLENT - directly across from the train station, directly across from the starting point of all bus tours, and within walking distance of all major sites and attractions. As well, there are many eating establishments around the hotel, including an Irish pub right on the corner. The room was large, with a balcony, and included a small sitting area. The washroom was large. The only problem, however, was that the safe did not work, and you were required to leave your key with the front desk staff when you left. I believe internet was either free, or only a small fee.

<Content>Not a bad choice at all Stayed at the Continental from the 22nd Oct- 25th October and paid EUR 55for a double room with breakfast. Here is my opinion....In favour:-Fabulous Location, come out of the central station, its right opposite you, cross the road and the tram line and your in the lobby !-walking distance for shopping, restaurants and sightseeing. Superb location no doubt !-rooms were very comfortable. I got one on the 6th floor. Quite spacious and comfortable.-polite reception staff -rooms have tv, minbar, safe and I had a balcony overlooking the central station too.-very good breakfast-tea/coffee free during the day until evning at the reception.-free use of the internet to check your mails for 20 minutes each day.-brochures, sightseeing details, maps available at the reception and the staff knowledgeable.-great food available at the food stalls in the station, very reasonably priced and just 30 seconds from the hotel. So no problem what so ever for food.Not in favour:Not much against this hotel, but I should mention a few that I personally felt irritated me...1.The shower cubicle in my room was very small, and had one sliding door missing which meant I had to be careful how I used the handshower orelse Id have water all over the floor.2.Being on the top most floor, the balcony was lined with red lights. This was very very irritating because when you decide to go to bed, the whole room is filled with a red glow. Well, we were very tired, so it didnt matter much.3.Pillow was very very soft.4.Repair works taking place of the 5th floor which was very noisy. But I guess it must be over by now.Other than these, which aint major, I think the Continental is a great place to stay in. I dont know if the sizes of the rooms vary, but check your room out first before you unpack.

<Content>Good Deal! I didn't have a booking in advance so I walked around the main train station and got into the hotel as a walk-in customer to stay for 6 nights. The charges were reasonable, clean room, good breakfast, friendly staff, and the hotel is located at a very central location. In few words it's a good deal.

<Content>Good Value close to Transit This is a pretty good hotel just steps from the Frankfurt Hbf. Even though it was a bustling neighborhood, the noise level never got too loud and I was able to get a good night sleep. The breakfast was OK, but you might be better off finding something to eat elsewhere. The room was clean and the hotel staff was very friendly and accomidating.

<Content>Good place to sleep. I stayed here for two nights. I stayed in a single room that was recently renovated. The room was clean and quiet (the room was not facing the street). The continental breakfast is good (not a hot breakfast). The hotel staff were friendly and helpful. A major train station is across the street and the metro is nearby.

<Content>Decent Budget Hotel I stayed here for 3 nights and found it to be a good value for money hotel right next to the main station. The staff where very friendly and the hotel seemed clean all over. Couple of minor things that may annoy some people, the rooms although clean where very dated, 70's style. There was only one tiny lift to service the full hotel, this could involve a long wait, a tough walk or a squashed experience. All that said I would happily stay here again and would recommend to friends, it cost roughly 40 euros a night so where I come from you dont expect much for that...

<Content>Good value I stayed at this hotel for three nights in a single room in November 2007.I travelled on the train from the airport and the Continental was the first hotel I saw from exiting the station. It's very easy to find!The staff at the reception were friendly and easy to understand. My room was small but adequate for a single. It was very dated and could be done with modernisation. The TV didn't work and the radio (which was built into the frame of the bed, really old!) didn't work either. The breakfast on offer had a good choice of everything you would expect from a hotel in Europe: bread, cheese, fruits, yoghurt, meat, cereal, juices etc. The hotel is located on the fringes of the red light area and there are plenty of kebab and take-away food outlets around the place. It didn't bother me but some people might not feel comfortable at night (as with every other city). It's within walking distance to the river and the main shopping area.A good hotel but nothing special!

<Content>Excellent value Well situated for all public transport links. Clean, comfortable, warm room. Water was hot. Frequent towel changes, TV had some English channels. Read some reviews mentioning noise. We had a front road facing room and were never bothered at all. Reception staff spoke good English and were friendly and helpful. Good, comprehensive continental breakfast with a few hot dishes. such as Frankfurters (well you are there ) and very nice scambled eggs. No bar but see later in review.Hotel sells a two day pass for the trams ,buses and underground for around 7 euros. Great value. and the transport system is good.Irish bar O Reillys few yards away. Shows lots of sport including premier league matches. Friendly chatty staff. Also does food. Went to Frankfurt for the Christmas market which we enjoyed and may return next year. If so, the Hotel Continental will be our first choice.

<Content>Talk about space! We arrived an hour before the check-in time and had no trouble checking in at this time. A chap that was also checking in a bit earlier had to wait a few minutes but the staff were courteous and professional.The room we had was enormous! It looked as though it had been recently refurbished and was very clean. The bath room was also very clean, although it was a little small, considering the size of the room itself.During our 2 night stay, breakfast on the first day was lovely with a good variety, considering we came down 20 minutes before they stopped serving it. There was a good selection of cereals, cold meats, and chesses. There was also Frankfurt鈥檚, boiled eggs and frittata. Unfortunately the second morning there was not a great deal of cold meat and now frittata left, even though we were down earlier than the previous day.The location of the hotel is good, although a little warning about the sex shops would have been nice, but the area didn鈥檛 feel unsafe. Our room was not at the front of the hotel so there wasn鈥檛 much noise. I think the front rooms would have been noisy.If you are in Frankfurt, make sure you go up the Main Tower, a highlight for our trip!

<Content>disappointing The hotel is conveniently located across the road from the hauptbanhof, but that's the only postive thing I can find to say about it. The room was small, dated, and not very clean. There was no safe in the room for valuables. Although I had a room at the back of the hotel, it was still noisy at night. The breakfast was poor quality and little choice.

<Content>Terrible place to stay I stayed in this hotel in July 2007. During my stay it was warm in Frankfurt (30C or 90F). The room was even warmer (35C or 100F) and no airconditioning. The only possibilty to get some fresh air is to open the windows and get exposed to the extermely noisy street (cars, trams and trains). Although the price was low (euro 40), apart from the problems with the temperature, service was terrible. As soon as I had checked out the room and realized the conditions, I went back to the reception and kindly asked for another room, at the back side of the hotel (less exposed to noise). However, despite my impression that the hotel wa nearly empty, that was flatly refused, without any explanation. It took until 3AM before the noise was reduced to a normal level and I could open the window to let in some fresh air. I was glad to get up at 7 AM to go the airport to catch my plane

<Content>Basic but value for money It's easy to complain about the busy (west end) location, the spartan breakfast and some other minor stuff, but come on, for 鈧?3 a night (single room) you don't hear me complain. Basic qualities like tidyness, shower, bed, staff, room size etc, are quite alright and above all, it is clean. You don't get this kind of value for money in many places.

<Content>Great Value I visit Frankfurt 5 or more times each year from the USA. The Continental Hotel I have found to offer the best value. It is not a 5 star hotel and one should not assume it is. However, the overall quality is great. I often arrive at the hotel after an overnight flight around 9 am. The front desk clerks do their best to make a room available within a short time. I am not sure why any website lists a hottub with the hotel. That is clearly an error as the hotel does not have one. In a time when the US dollar is low the Contiental is well worth a visit. I also suggest those who may wish to stay there look at multiple booking companies. Not all offer the same rate.

<Content>Budget hotel, try your luck! I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights with my husband. Advantages: Cheap  mostly clean (although some mould on the bathroom floor in the corner). Good size rooms. Well located opposite the main train station in frankfurt, in between the river and the main shopping  business areas.Disadvantages: very basic, no minibar as advertised and if you run into any problems you probably won't get good service. On the second day of our trip the toilet stopped flushing (Saturday evening) and after the manager came up to see it he said we would have to stay in the same room for the second night because they were fully booked. Also they made no effort to move us to another hotel and pay the difference. Believe it or not he suggested that we use the toilet as it was and used the shower water to 'push' our 'stuff' down the toilet... The room I stayed in (412) was dated and a lot of things didn't work (the shower didn't work unless I continously pressed the button - a bit difficult to co-ordinate). Saturday night was very noisy- couldn't sleep from 1-4am because of the street noise even though we were on the back of the hotel. Breakfast was very basic - white toast, sausages, cold meats, cereals and spreads. I paid about 拢45 per night including breakfast which would have been ok if the second night was not ruined by the toilet issue.Go there expecting good value for money only if nothng goes wrong.

<Content>Nice hotel Very nice hotel just steps from the main train station in Frankfurt. The front desk staff were courteous and spoke fluent English. There was a free public access internet terminal in the lobby which was a nice touch. The elevator was very small (1 person with their luggage) and quite slow. The room, a double, was quite spacious by European standards, had 2 comfortable beds, was very clean and well maintained. The bathroom was reasonably sized with a good shower with lots of hot water. The breakfast, included in the rate, was very good with a variety of hot and cold dishes (and served until 10 am which was nice). The hotel uses traditional keys to access the rooms which are surrendered when you leave in the morning; I was a bit surprised that the front desk staff did not ask for ID when requesting the key for re-entry. The front desk also offered a free safety deposit box (no safe in the room) and they gave me the key to the box. The hotel is not far from the red (really pink) light district but I didn't feel unsafe walking around the area at night. There weren't too many bars and restaurants in the immediate vicinity of the hotel, but still there was enough to do within walking distance such as the row of museums on the opposite bank of the Main river. All in all, a good hotel and I'd stay there again.

<Content>Good Choice My husband and I stayed at the Continental for two nights and we both had a good time. We were very surprise when we arrived at the hotel because we had very low expectations after reading the reviews Although it is true that it is not located in the prettiest part of town, it is well located (train station, river, and historic places are very near). Breakfast was great!, and the staff members were helpful. We highly recommend this hotel鈥?br/>

<Content>You dont have to be mental to stay at the Continental!!! I stayed at the Continental hotel for two nights, whilst on a stag do in mid July 2006, and it was ideal. The hotel is superbly located approx 100 yards from the main train station, and although it is on a busy road, traffic noise was low - although we didn't spend much time in the room. The room we stopped in had no a/c, so the window was wide open through the night, but that did not keep us awake!!!We arrived in frankfurt at 11:30am, and approached the hotel to see if we could check in early, and they gave us our keys with no hesitation. Room was standard, little dated, and the bathroom was small although it did have new fittings and a good power shower.Beds made and towels replaced after our first night.Good choice at the buffet breakfast, and served from 06:30 - 10:30 (I think), although no hot food, and you can eat, and drink (tea, coffe, juice) until your heart content.There is no bar in the hotel, but two within 50 yards of the front door!. Shops and cafes, etc are approx 100 yards away.In summary, great location, a good plentiful breakfast, and suitably priced, and I WOULD recommend it for a short stay (The reason I specify short stay, is that if you like to spend time in your room you may want a few more luxuries - but not at this price!!)

<Content>No air-conditioning, No hottub The heatwave in July was unbearable in this otherwise nice hotel room. The fan provided barely made any difference in the steaming room. Good location, but the hotel description mentions a hottub. There ARE NO HOTTUBS in the hotel or in any of the rooms. If you get a room on the wrong side of the hotel the noise from the street is very intrusive. We asked to switch rooms right away. Seedy neighbourhood with a few good pubs nearby. Continental breakfast is pretty good. Standard hotel. Good luck!

<Content>superb and very good location Pros (1) the location beside the main railway station, the Haupbanhof, means that transport to all parts of the city and Germany is incredible (2) there are good and cheap restaurants, pubs an snack bars all in a 5 minute walking distance (3) also very near to some Halal restaurants and snack bars, good for Muslims (4) rooms are clean (5) bathrooms are brand-new, very impressive (6) all staff speak very good English (7) lots of cheap supermarket for buying snacks  drinks.Cons (1) a little too pricey, but just a little (2) bed and pillows were a let down (3) my room had no air-condition, no minibar, no fan (4) room can be quite noisy, because of the bars near the hotel  because in summer you need to keep the window open for ventilation.

<Content>World Cup Booked this up in December 2005 for the World Cup. Pricey at the time but then this was merely because of the football and usually much cheaper. Reviews before were mixed so I was pleaseantly surprised by the size of the room and facilities- large room, looked refurbished, good bath, shower and toiletries. You could close a door of the bedroom off from a separate entrance, cum luggage /dressing area. Massive room for a 3 star. View from room disappointing but most rooms overlook the station. Location top notch - 10mins to all main attractions and 2 mins to station- great if you use the train from airport. Considering the Savoy and Le Meridien are adjacent you can see how well it is placed as a cheaper option.Breakfast was fine. Limited choice but no limit on portion. All standard fayre, mainly cold bar the frankfurters, but more than adequate.Nice open air bar behind to try Apfelwein if you dont want to walk far after a hard day.Very impressive and would definitely stay again.

<Content>Disappointed A bit disappointing having selected hotel from reading previous reviews. It would be good if the rooms saw a duster now and again, a number of guests along with ourselves were not too happy with the condition of rooms. Door handles falling off, light bulbs not working. Basically the hotel looks a little shabby and could do with a fresh lick of paint. Biggest problem for us was that it is impossible to get a hot drink in the hotel after 12 noon. However if you want a cheap hotel this is centrally located, not what I would class as 3 star.

<Content>Continental, Fankfurt I recommend the Continental Hotel. Very friendly, multi-lingual staff, good price, most rooms good (although some a little eccentric as they retain 70s decor together with 40w bulbs). A good, helpful atmosphere and only a hop and a skip from the railway station.Charles

<Content>Central and clean The hotel is very conveniently located within about 2 blocks of the main train station. The desk staff is very nice and helpful, providing directions to nearby restaurants and attractions.The room was very clean with nice darkening drapes, comfortable bed, plenty of storage room and a sparkling clean shower.Breakfast is included and was a nice buffet downstairs with both cold and warm choices.An excellent value for a downtown hotel.

<Content>good standard we have stayed at the continental on buisness for the past four years,and again in april this year.This is a good no frills hotel about 3 star standard.We always ask for a front double room, which is big, with a little dressing room, come seating area, frankfurt is a very, very, expensive city, like London,so avoid trade fair dates, unlike us, we have no option,rooms trebble during this tme. There is no restuarant for evening meals, just a breakfast room,good breakfasts,though not a huge choice, no bar, but can supply drinks from fridge,but loads of bars and resrtaurents right outside hotel. very efficient staff, very friendley, and helpfull,very clean , nice atmosphere.
