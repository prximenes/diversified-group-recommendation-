<Content>Wonderful stay at this hotel! We stayed here after finshing a cruise in Venice, we were not disappointed. We took a water taxi (80 euros) from the port to the hotel and with a 30m walk we arrived at the front entrance of the hotel. I have to recommend the taxi service, especially with luggage, Venice is not a place to be carrying luggage around!The hotel has a perfect location from which to explore Venice and we could not have asked for better. It is close to the Rialto bridge and an easy walk to St. Mark's Square.Check in/out was smooth, so smooth in fact that they managed to talk us into a shared gondola ride for 25euros each...well what else can you expect in Venice.The concierge was very helpful, the room was excellent, as was the included continental breakfast. My wife really appreciated the turn down service as well.We took the water taxi to the airport (100euros), organised by the hotel for us, worth every penny again and we walked 5 minutes to the terminal. They offer a bus (for a charge) but it really is too short to take the bus.Venice is pricey but we found the shopping to be excellent and the food to be well priced, don't forget most places charge to eat inside. Have some cannolo and coffee and enjoy!

<Content>Beautiful Venetian Style Hotel - Gorgeous! This hotel is fabulous, if you are looking for a venetian style hotel then look no further, The rooms are so opulently furnished, and the bed was huge !!!! A Super kingsize whopper. With beautiful egyptian cotton bedlinen. Beautiful curtains, large wardrobes, safe, and the bathroom was fabulous too! including a huge flat 'rain shower' plus a lovely bath, sound system if you are listening to the TV/Radio and a telephone in there too! The hotel itself does only have a little bar, and a lovely breakfast room, where the breakfasts were interesting and filling. A beautiful buffet service and incredibly helpful staff.The location is brilliant, just a short walk around the corner to the Rialto bridge, a perfect location, whilst it did not overlook a canal, it made up with everything else. If you like small hotels, with lavish furnishings this is the one, it is beautiful!

<Content>Enjoyable stay at a La Commedia A lovely hotel - small and refined yet with a friendly, relaxed atmosphere. The rooms have a classical modern style with elegant furnishings and a lovely luxury bathroom. (It's just as it's pictured in the brochure/on the internet). It's conveniently situated close to the Rialto bridge and St Marc's square and is an ideal base from which to explore Venice. The complimentary tour to the glass blowers on the Island of Murano was very enjoyable and we also received a complimentary gift of local biscuits as we were celebrating our birthday's during the stay. The hotel were happy to accomodate our 6 month old - providing a cot in the room (without extra charge) and a high chair at breakfast. The buffet breakfast was all very nice - although the selection could perhaps have been a bit more extensive/imaginative. Overall though this is a very good quality hotel and comes highly recommended.

<Content>Excellent Hotel Stayed at Hotel a la Commedia for 2 nights in November. Really excellent hotel, very modern, spotlessly clean, friendly staff etc etc. Location was perfect, 3-4 mins walk from Mark's Square, 1 minute from Rialto water bus stop. Would recommend to others and stay here again.

<Content>A diamond in Venice My partner booked a surprise stay at La Commedia for three nights.We followed tips from other reviews on how to get from the airport to the hotel.Take the alilaguna public boat,orange line from stop 1 and get off near the Rialto Bridge.The walk to the hotel is only a few hundred meters,and is very easy even with luggage.We have stayed in similarly priced hotels in cities like Paris,Rome and Florence so I had some preset ideas of what the hotel room would be like.They were all completely wrong and the quality  cleanliness was far beyond my expectations.The decor is superb,we stayed in room 404 which had fantastic exposed beams,high ceilings and an expansive marbled bathroom.Staying in such luxurious surroundings certainly sets the tone of your stay in this amazing city.Breakfast was up to the standards of the rest of the hotel and the staff,particularly Emmanuel the waiter,were immaculately dressed and professional.As for Venice itself,a fascinating ancient place with views and photo opportunities on every street. Yes,it is very pricey especially with the current state of the euro but if you are prepared to wander off the main tourist streets there are plenty of places to eat and drink at reasonable places.If you are planning to visit Venice this hotel delivers on every level and even the most discerning customer would struggle to find fault with it!

<Content>Simply Amazing! VERDICT:A La Commedia is a luxurious hotel in the heart of Venice. With spacious, comfortable and well appointed rooms, this hotel is highly recommended.BIGGEST COMPLAINT:Poor recommendations from the front desk staff for dining, directions, etc. Dining recommendations were very pricey and touristy. Directions were often confusing and not what we asked for (ex. asked for vaparetto stop, given different boat service stop).ROOM:We stayed in a junior triple suite that was very spacious and comfortable. The room was exceptionally clean and nicely decorated. We had lots of windows to let the cool Venice air flow through. Housekeeping and turn down service were great. The bathroom was the most spacious we had in Italy, with a nice tub/shower combo.AREA:Safe, well lit area with lots of shopping and restaurants close by; although you will have to walk a bit to find the non-touristy restaurants, grocery stores, etc. It's a short walk to the Rialto bridge, St. Marks Square and other attractions. It's off of a pretty quiet side alley, so noise wasn't an issue for us.SERVICE:As mentioned, housekeeping and turn down service were nice, but we were dissapointed with the front desk staff. We didn't like their recommendations for dining, or their directions for getting around (we did better just using a map and time tables).FOOD:Complimentary breakfast bar was good, but not much variety from day to day.GETTING AROUND:Be prepared for lots of map reading, Venice is quite complicated to get around. Walking wasn't really a problem, but the vaperetto routes and stops are confusing at first. Signage is very poor and the employees were not so willing to help out.VENICE RECOMMENDATION:Two days is more than enough in Venice. We had a 4 night stay, and by day 3 we were sick and tired of all the crowds, overpriced food and lack of things to do (besides site seeing). Venice is still a must see, but 2 days is plenty!

<Content>Loved and appreciated the La Commedia on my first visit to Venice Loved this small intimate, very stylish Hotel. Was situated in a perfect position near the Rialto bridge, so close to everything. The staff were extremely courteous and helpful, sent us to a delightful nearby trattoria, Paridiso, took a great interest in us, what we were doing and going. The breakfast was excellent, and the lovely roof garden and bar added to the atmosphere. The rooms are lovely, a very stylish and comfotable and most welcoming stay. Would very much recommend. Thank you all at La Commedia you made our stay in Venice !

<Content>Pefecto! Myself  my new husband stayed here for our honeymoon from 13th Sept 2008 for 1 week. We had just had a week in Lake Garda (where we got married) staying in a supposedly 5 star hotel. I have to say that A La Commedia was soooo much better than our hotel in Lake Garda. From the moment we arrived we were treated really well, it helped that our room had been upgraded for our honeymoon and that they brought us a complimentary bottle of Prosecco, but the staff were friendly  helpful at all times. The hotel was in a fantastic location  it was great to be able to pop back during the day to drop off shopping or sit on our balcony watching Venice go by. The roof terrace is beautiful, peaceful, stylish  does a mean Bellini cocktail. I cannot praise this hotel enough  we will definitely be returning in the future to celebrate our anniversary.

<Content>Great position This is a very well-run hotel. Everything is in good order and goes smoothly. Efficient, polite staff, clean and well-furnished rooms, both public and bedrooms. The hotel is close to Rialto bridge, with a vaporetto stop and also airport boat terminal. In the other direction, it is 10 minutes stroll to St Marks square, past some interesting shops. Rooms on 4th floor best, particularly 404. If you want a genuine Venice experience, you might not be happy here. The hotel could be anywhere, so if you would like to be in an old Venetian palace, on a canal, look elsewhere.

<Content>AMAZING! This hotel was the best one that we had during our tour of Italy. We were on our honeymoon and booked it using Gate1travel. I saw the amazing reviews on this site and every single one of them was true. The staff was amazing, the room was georgous and very clean. The bed was still firm, but more comfortable than the other hotels we stayed in and the hotel even sent up a complimentary bottle of champagne to celebrate our honeymoon!I loved Venice and this hotel was in the very center of it. We were able to get to any part of Venice easily and even though Venice is a city where you have to get lost in order to find anything, we had no trouble getting back to the hotel (tipsy or not!) because it was located next to two major landmarks and all signs pointed to those landmarks.I already know that we will be visiting Venice again and this hotel will be our first choice for our home away from home.

<Content>Ritz Carlton-Like Now. Here me when I say this: I NEVER do reviews like this...but since I used Trip Advisor while planning my trip, I thought I would give back. My wife and I were celebrating our 1 year anniversary this past week. We stayed in Venice for 3 nights at this hotel. I am a well traveled individual (having traveled to 30 countries in my short 29 years). One of our favorite places to say is the Ritz Carlton...and I must say, our room at this hotel was very close to that same quality. We had room 110 (which I am convinced is the worst room in the hotel...bottom floor next to the elevator). The location of the hotel was perfect. The location was so perfect that we would come back to the hotel for anything and everything...to drop off a small purchase, to grab a sweater, etc....The water bus drops off at Rialto Bridge and the hotel is a 45 second walk away.Also. The breakfast was great. Chocolate croissants every morning, with fresh fruit, juice, hot chocolate, O.J.....We did not find that the hotel staff were the best at recommending restaurants...so find your own places to eat.The photos on the hotel website are very accurate as to what the room looked like.

<Content>5 Star!! Stunningly gorgeous hotel! Great location, not far from St Marks Square, but far enough away to provide a great nights sleep. Rooms are large, spotless, updated, and luxurious. Staff was extremely friendly and breakfast was excellent! We would stay there again on our next trip to Venice!!

<Content>Beautiful Hotel This was the nicest room we had in Italy. The suite was spacious and modern. The room was beautifully decorated and spotless. It included all of the ammenities we had missed in other hotels in Italy. The staff were excellent and extremely professional. The roof top terrace is a great place to have a drink and relax after fighting the crowds of Venice. I would highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Perfect - La Commedia Our first trip to Venice and following research on Tripadvisor, decided that this was the hotel for us. We were not disappointed.Fantastic location just 2 minutes from Rialto Bridge and about 10 from St Marks square. We were in a junior suite. The standard of fixtures and fittings was excellent. Bathroom had excellent shower, bath, b-day, and all beautifully tiled; it had a really clean feel to it. We took our own travel kettle as we like a hot drink when we first wake up in the morning, and the mini-bar fridge was perfect for storing our own milk in.The double bed was a little on the hard side for us, but this is more a matter of personal preference. A room safe was available and the wardrobe was spacious and well lit with sufficient clothes hangars for the 2 of us. There were 2 televisions in the suite, with satellite channels and although the in room menu suggested that BBC was available, it was not and we had to make do with the American CNN.The standard of cleaning in the room was excellent. A roof bar is a new addition to the hotel. Here, there were fantastic views over the roof tops of Venice and it made a nice place to relax at the end of the day before sunset.The hotel provides breakfast only. This was a typical continental style with the usual selection of yogurts,cheese, ham, muesli and bread.There were always tinned peaches and some fresh melon and pineapple available.The hotel offered some trips and we decided to take the evening Gondola ride. Normal price for this 40 min round trip is 120euros up to 6 people. The hotel offered it for 25euros each which we paid and as expected they bundled us together with 4 others and off we went. We were disappointed because in spite of us having collectively paid 150euros (6 x 25) the Gondola looked completely indifferent, and offered us no commentary at all about what we were seeing.If we return to Venice, we will have no hesitation in booking this hotel again. For us, it ticked all the right boxes.

<Content>Absolutely Fantastic We returned to A La Commedia again this August after first staying in September 2007. This trip was a very memorable stay because my partner asked me to marry him....which of course was yes!!We had a junior suite room 309 which was a lovely room, very spacious with a little terrace of it's own-only fault no patio table and chairs!! the room had air-con, a lovely bathroom, plenty of space and was cleaned daily with fresh towels. The staff are always ready to help and make your stay here very pleasant. They will book water taxis, advise where to eat, places to visit etc.The terrace bar is open from 4pm and offers food, drinks etc, Leonardo the barman is a great guy and speaks good english!!There are places to sit and great areas to chill and sleep away the late afternoon away from bustling crowds!!It is situated near the rialto bridge down a little side street, so it is quieter than hotels by the grand canal.A worthwhile visit to the hotel again and a memorable stay.

<Content>you can't go wrong this is a great hotel. I usually can't say that about most hotels. It is very elegant, the front desk staff is very formal and well mannered. The rooms are decorated sumptuously in that opulent Venetian style. The bathrooms are all marble and chrome with bidets to boot. The breakfast is pretty good, the usual cereals and fruits, pastrie s and meats.The location is very good. Although difficult to find the first time. I recommend this hotel highly. The only negatve is that they do charge for the internet in 1/2 increments and there is only 1 computer.

<Content>Perfect Honeymoon, complete luxury My husband and I stayed as part of our honeymoon trip to Italy and we loved every minute of our stay to La Commedia. The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful and the room that we stayed in was nothing but complete luxury. On our first night we had to move to another hotel due to an electrical probably however it was to an upgraded hotel and on arrival back they upgraded our room and gave us a complimentary bottle of champagne, which went down a complete treat!!Everyone should visit this hotel, it's a dream come true!

<Content>Nothing short of spectacular!!! This is possibly the best city centre hotel that my wife and I have stayed in. We stayed for three nights on our honeymmon and wished we had stayed longer before heading off to Rome and Amalfi.The location is excellent, a mere stones throw from the Rialto and a pleasant walk from St.Mark's square. The staff were exceptional and the room fixtures and fittings were first class.What made the stay was the stunning roof terrace which has beautiful ambiance and great service. The feeling, as you sip your Bellini, is that you're on a private roof terrace as the terrace is sp spaced out that you're not crowded in with other guests.We ;look forward to returning.

<Content>wonderful hotel We recently spent four days at La Commedia in Venice. It was a beautiful hotel. The rooms were good sized (for European hotels especially) and clean. The hotel staff were friendly and knowledgeable. It was by far my kids' favorite hotel on our Italy trip. The location is great too - very easy walk to San Marco or Rialto bridge over to San Palo area.

<Content>Fabulous roof top terrace This hotel is a gem! Just 100 meters or so from the hustle and bustle of the Rialto Bridge and the Grand Canal it sits in a quiet cul de sac.Only 20 or so rooms - all recently modernised and much larger than average. Fabulous roof top terrace with views of terracotta roofs and the Campanile in St Mark's Square clearly visible. Helpful concierge, front desk staff all of whom speak excellent English.Vaporetto stops for both the Grand Canal and the Venice Airport only 50 - 100 meters walk making it the ideal location. Although no in-house restaurant there are literally a handful of choices on your door step - one as soon as you walk out the front door.Room amenities and furnishings were beautiful and breakfast more than adequate.This hotel is a great find!!!Margaret WMelbourne, Australia

<Content>Beautiful Hotel in a perfect location Hotel a La Commedia is a beautiful 4 to 5 star hotel in the heart of Venice just a couple of blocks from the Rialto Bridge. We just returned two days from a 14 day trip to Italy which included a day stay at La Commedia. Here are my top observations:1) If you arrive by train take the water taxi (6 euros each), stop at the Rialto Bridge (not the Rialto market) and walk away from the bridge in the opposite direction. You have to carry your bag(s) over that step bridge but once over you'll come to an alley, walk down and the hotel is two blocks away in a small courtyard.2) Hotel is new, beautiful, clean, well appointed and very comfortable.3) Hotel is very expensive (especially if your reserving two adjoining rooms) but hey..your in Venice!4) The staff is outstanding in every regard. Great English, very friendly and they treat you with real coutesy.The referred outstanding restuarants and made the reservations, walked us to the water taxi. Took care of everything. First class in every respect. Great place for families.5) European breakfast buffet included which is very handy for maximizing your day.6) 7 minute walk to Saint Mark's square. Again, the location is perfect. Surround by shops and stores and Gondola's they whole deal.7) Great bathrooms, showers with good water pressure, the whole works. After traveling the country side, this was an oasis to land in and then go on to experience the city. Have an end of the day cocktail on the roof top terrace. You will love the view.Loved it......Dont' hesitate. this place is terrific.

<Content>Faultless Hotel in an Ideal Location! Hotel A La Commedia is an absolute find. The location is excellent, close to the Rialto, but quietly tucked away from the main thoroughfare. The rooms and public areas are spotlessly clean and appointed with state-of-the-art comforts. All staff were friendly and attentive, with a refreshing attention to detail. We requested a balcony and were given a room with two!We will unquestionably want to stay at the A La Commedia on our next trip to Venice. My only worry is that, by then, this hotel will have become so popular we can't get a reservation!

The room was excellent and the standard of the hotel was superb. And it was the perfect location to move around the city. If we come back to your great city I will be sure to book this hotel again.

<Content>Wonderful Stay  We just returned from a 10 day trip to Venice, Rome and Florence. La Commedia was the perfect spot to start our vacation. The hotel is conveniently located a short stroll from the Rialto, San Marco and other areas. There was an ATM, pastry and small market (water, cola, etc) a few steps from the entrance.The hotel boasts of modern rooms and bath and they deliver with the added elegance of an old world feel. The bath had beautiful tile, gold mosaics, a tub with two shower options - handheld and rain head. The bath was deep and perfect for a soak after long days walking, Plenty of storage space, safe and mini fridge with reasonable prices for a hotel in Venice. The service at the front desk and breakfast area was above average. We booked a triple jr. suite for my mother, me and 11 year old niece. We had room 622 at the end of the corridor with two twins and a full size sleeper sofa which was very comfortable. The twin beds were comfortable however the pillows were very hard. The room had a desk and two chairs plus a long, narrow balcony overlooking a small quiet street. The balcony did not have a table or chairs which would have been a nice touch but we found ourselves looking over the ledge to the street below and rooftops. We paid $349 Euro per night plus tax inclusive of breakfast for three. We felt the rate was very reasonable for the space and amenities. Breakfast was ample with fresh pastries, yogurt, cheeses, meats, cereals, juices and an option for hot plates such as eggs, bacon and sausage (again, very reasonable costs). Coffee and hot cocoa was excellent and the service was fantastic. The staff treated my niece like a princess and applauded all of her efforts to speak Italian with the few phrases we taught her before leaving. We had very enjoyable meals at Aqua Pazzo and their sister spot a little further down on Piazza Santa Stephano which was a short stroll and felt so much more local than the other areas. We happened upon a music academy and could hear music from the windows and watched children at play on bikes and scooters as we enjoyed a light snack at a little cafe. We have stayed at much more expensive hotels in Venice....having stayed at La Commedia we have found a home in Venice. I would not hesitate to stay again or recommend this little gem to other travelers.....wonderful, wonderful stay. My only regret was not staying longer.On a side note, thanks to TA posters, we did the Secrets tour at the Doges Palazzo鈥?we very much enjoyed the tour and would recommend to other visitors.

<Content>Unbelieveable! I booked this hotel after doing lots of research and it was the best choice I could have made. Everything about it was fantastic. I wanted to make it special as I knew I was going to propose to my girlfriend at some point during our 2 night stay there. The hotel knew I was going to do this as I asked them for ideas, and when we arrived, they has upgraded us to a junior suite. The room was amazing, spotless, big, comfortable, quiet, etc. One of my biggest concerns about any hotel in Italy is the room size, but this hotel did not disappoint, aparently even normal rooms are good sizes. Location was excellent, I found that the Rialto side was more peaceful than the San Marco side. The service all the way through was 5 star, would highly recommend.

<Content>Fantastic location There is nothing bad to say about this hotel. Its in a fantastic location, great service, beautiful rooms and good breakfast. When booking we found most hotels were expensive in the middle of Venice so while this is slightly pricey its not too bad in the grand scheme of things and definitely worth every penny.I would have no hesitation in booking this hotel again.

<Content>This is THE hotel to stay when in Venice We stayed in this hotel for five nights of our honeymoon, after leaving Rome.We had a Junior Suite which was extremely impressive to say the least. It was a spacious, relaxing, and comfortable room, which was decorated with great thought. Our suite was kept immaculately clean, with a nightly turndown service, with chocolates and weather forecast on our pillow.Breakfast is the usual continental, but we noted that eggs and bacon could also be ordered for an extra charge.The hotel is in a perfect location, just around the corner from the Rialto Bridge, and about ten/fifteen minutes walk from St Mark's Square. There is also the Alilaguna stop very nearby.The staff in the hotel could not have been nicer or more professional. We were also given a complimentary bottle of champagne to celebrate our honeymoon.We had a most enjoyable stay in this hotel and we were very sorry to have to leave. We would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.

<Content>Fantastico! We have just returned from 3 wonderful nights in Venice staying at the a la Commedia. We can only agree with the other reviews of this hotel and say that it is trully fantastic. The standard of our deluxe room was very high with a superb marble bathroom with rain-fall style shower and deep bath. The turn down and maid services were excellent with chocolates left on our bed each evening. We also had a nice little balcony above the bustling street below. The staff were very attentive and knowledgable and the hotel have trips organised to Murano (the glass island) which is free and a shared gondola ride for which there is a charge. The bar area is small but nice and the buffet continental breakfast has lovely chocolate croissants and home made museli. Again the staff in both the bar and at breakfast were extremely friendly. They even gave me a bag of biscuits on my birthday which was a lovely touch. There isn't a lot more we can add that the others reviews don't cover. You will not be dispapointed if you book to go here.Venice is a wonderful enchanting city with lots to see and do and lots of places to eat to suit all budgets. Things to be aware of are that it is very busy with tourists of all nationalities. It is also very expensive. We paid on average 7.5 euros (拢6.15) for less than a pint of beer and 5 euros (拢4) for a cup of tea. You won't find anything much cheaper than that in the city. Meals can be expensive also but there are many options.

<Content>What a Gem! We had the pleasure of staying here for two fantastic nights. 11th - 13th March.We booked through Citalia (who were fantastic).A La Commedia is in the most amazing location (2 minutes to Rialto Bridge and 5 mins from St Marks Square). There are a selecting of restaurants close by and designer shops next door!The rooms are spacious and the decor is divine. The finishing touches to the room are spectacular.The reception staff were helpful andgave great advise about the area. I would like to go back this year and will look to stay here first.You won't go wrong at this hotel.** Charming, Stylish and a real pleasure **If you want a bath in your room always request this as they will allocate a disabled room!

<Content>Simply Fantastic location A really fantastic hotel in a stunning location just two minutes walk from the Rialto bridge. The hotel is modern, spotlessly clean and welcoming and the staff were very friendly and willing to help. Our bedroom was delightful and very luxurious, a real haven of warmth and comfort. The hotel bar was great for an evening cocktail and the staff helped sort out both a gondola ride and a taxi trip to Murano to see the glass factories. Overall, highly recommended as a great hotel in a superb central location.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel in the perfect location Great Hotel in Venice. It was a little pricey but well worth it. They gave us a spacious room with two bedrooms and two bathrooms. I was expecting rooms in Europe to be small but I was impressed. My only complaint was that since they gave us the corner room we could here the noise of people walking around early in the morning. It was ok at night because everything died down really early at night in Venice. I would recommend this hotel if you are going for a romantic trip. The hotel staff was was very helpful and friendly. The location was perfect because it was a very little walk from the vaporettos (water bus).

<Content>Fantastic and truly memorable experience! The Hotel A La Commedia made our recent stay in Venice a truly memorable and special one! The hotel鈥檚 location and facilities were excellent, and all staff extremely pleasant and helpful. Our 'standard' double room was more like a mini-suite - the quality of the decor and fixtures/fittings in the bedroom  bathroom was superb! We especially appreciated the excellent maid service, and were delighted to find the chocolates on our pillows on the 1st night of our stay! A lovely 鈥榚xtra鈥?touch! Breakfast was also delicious with an extremely extensive range of choice!We would not hesitate to book again in the future, and have recommended highly to friends and family.If you travel to Venice, trust us, there is no better place to stay!

<Content>I doubt the management at this hotel I am a travel agent and I booked a honeymoon couple at this hotel for a 3-night stay in July, 2007.I booked the hotel through a hotel reservation system which has existed for a long time and is heavily used by travel agents.After 6 months, I still have not received a commission from this hotel. It seems that the management holds scant regard for those who work hard to give them business and fill their rooms every night.Is this how the hotel treats its guests?

<Content>A dream Hotel in the perfect location I am a regular visitor to Venice and visit at least 3 times a year, I have just returned from a 4 day visit with my sister, we stayed in a hotel which was new to us. Hotel a la Commedia, perfect in every way, rooms were modern with a traditional twist, spotless and clean and a bathroom to die for. Location was spot on also, just off the Campo San Luca 5 mins walk to Rialto Bridge and 10 mins from San Marco. It is situated in a quite little corner, away from the noisy alley ways. Breakfast was superb, everything you could wish for, and served in a smart breakfast room with pleasant staff. We had drinks in the bar also served by smart and efficient staff, and the prices were not extortionate. The bar was furnished with comfortable chairs and was beautifully decorated, with flowers and christmas floral bowls. I could have sat there all evening. Reception staff were excellent, helpful,polite but also very friendly. I would recommend this hotel to everyone. I have already booked to go again and take my husband for a special birthday treat. Looking forward to the next visit. My last and final comment is that I cannot praise it enough !!

<Content>TOO NOISY!! UNRESPONSIVE MANAGEMENT It's not worth the money, we had two torturous evenings. Taken in by the charming photographs and other travelers' reviews, we booked the expensive and small suite for over 400 euros a night. It was terrible. Located under the bar, all night you could hear people walking around, moving chairs, and the like. Indeed, the noise echoed through our small suite. We spent two nights tortured by this noise -- which did not cease until well after 1:00AM which was especially deadly on our departure morning which required a 4:30AM wake-up. When we complained about the noise, we received shrugs. It seems that the noise occurs when all managers with any power are gone and as we spent our days touring Venice we never talked to anyone in control. I sent an e-mail when I returned to the US to advise management of the issue and have yet, three months later, to recieve even a courtesy reply.

<Content>Chic and sophisticated Two years ago we stayed in Venice, in November, in a very nice but elderly hotel. We were bitten by mosquitoes because the place was so hot!This time the hotel was only about a year old and you could regulate the heat -or coolness- even in the bathroom.The hotel is beautifully furnished and we had a lovely room. The staff were extremely helpful and we found it to be very convenient for our needs. It is just round the corner from the 82 and 1 vaporetto stops, and there is a daytime Alilaguna stop, which was very useful when there was a vaporetto strike on our final day.It seemed to be a quiet, safe area with a theatre a few yards away and good shops. The Rialto market is not far. The breakfasts were excellent and when we arrived, quite late in the evening, we were able to order snacks in the bar, just opposite reception. All very useful.The staff were able to recommend restaurants and transport on the day of the strike.If/when we visit Venice again we should not wish to stay in any other hotel.

<Content>A La Commedia - A fantastic hotel We booked 3 nights with the hotel after reading the reviews in Tripadvisor. We weren't disappointed as the hotel is lovely and in a great location. Our room was quiet with good soundproofing on the windows. The staff were all excellent and spoke very good English (and by all accounts several other languages!) The room was very plush and the bathroom was beautiful. We requested a quiet high room away from the lifts and got that. We would definitely stay again.

<Content>Great Venetian Hotel Very nice hotel in a great location. There were three of us staying in a junior suite. We stayed for 5 nights and couldn't have asked for a better stay. The men at the front desk were so accomodating and friendly. While one female breakfast room was on the grumpy side, the young man who worked there was wonderful. When he came across us on the rooftop one afternoon, he immediately went and got out pads for the lounge chairs and asked if we would like blankets and pillows for a nap. Yes, the beds were on the stiff side (but after our stay in Paris, they actually seemed pretty comfortable). I wouldn't hesitate to stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Perfect location, nice hotel, bad beds This hotel is well located and quiet with lovely bathrooms, very clean and nice rooms. Beds and pillows were like boards, however, and I was glad we were only there for 2 nights.Limited public areas and surly breakfast service were the downsides. Also, staff was not helpful prior to check in with requests.Might stay here again for a short stay at the right price.

<Content>A Fantastic Hotel I did a lot of research online looking for a hotel to stay at for four nights in Venice. Trip Advisor was a major influence in my decision to contact Hotel a la Commedia and ultimately book a junior suite there. We just returned from our trip, and I am so happy that we chose this wonderful hotel. The hotel may say Four Star Deluxe, but the service is Five Star, with a tremendously gracious, classy, professional group of gentlemen behind the front desk. They speak excellent English, and are very helpful and nice. They even confirmed all of the dinner reservations I had made before we arrived from Tuscany.We stayed there with another couple, us in a junior suite, they in a deluxe double. Both rooms were quiet, very clean, spacious, and comfortable. The beds are firm (which we like) and the bathrooms are spotless (the shower is to die for).Be sure to have a cocktail at the rooftop bar or in the lobby, the bartender is a great guy.I give this hotel my highest recommendation. Bravo La Commedia!

The staff was incredible, booking perfect reservations for dinners and helping us with transportation. I arranged in advance to have flowers in the room for my wife, and everything was done to perfection. This is one of the finest hotels I have ever enjoyed, and I highly recommend it. The location is perfect as well.

<Content>Venice 2007 Excellent location for most sites. Staff very willing to assist. Emanuele especially so. Breakfast plentiful. Rooms extremely comfortable and maintained to a very high standard. Only criticism was that the reception booked four water taxis to take ten people to the airport for the same flight, said that it was impossible for them to change from four taxis as they had already booked them, as the fare to the airport was 110 euros, we thought it could have been made much less pricey to share.

<Content>Great hotel Great hotel. Rooms very luxurious. Great location. Lovely buffet breakfast. Staff all friendly and helpful. View of a wall from our room but very quiet and we weren't expecting any views anyway. Liked the flat screen tv but agree with previous comment that would have liked the dvd film to change during the week(not that we were in much to watch tv)Also agree that coffee in St Marks square expensive but worth it!!!!Receptionist booked us on to a gondola ride with 3 other people for 25 euros each which saved us having to haggle with the gondoliers. Handy to get the Allelungha boat to the airport. All in all a great stay. Venice really is amazing.

Great location - near the Rialto bridge and a short walk from Piazza San Marco. Breakfast was generous and staff again, outstanding - helpful and quick service. Would stay here again, and again. Will recommend to friends and family. Love it, want to go back today!

<Content>Stay here at your own risk! Travelling with friends (we are 50 somethings) we wanted a nice hotel in Venice. Booked and confirmed 2 seperate rooms a month in advance at Hotel A La Commedia. The hotel looked beautiful in the pictures and is very convenient to the Rialto Water Taxi stop and St. Marks Square.Upon arrival we were told we were being upgraded to a 2 bedroom suite # 115 with a sitting area for the same price as the two rooms we booked. This isn't what we wanted as one of our travelling companions was fighting a nasty flu bug and we didn't want to catch it, but we tried to go with the flow and make the best of it. Little did we know that that this part of the hotel is directly over a nightclub that doesn't start to get cranked up until 11:00. And doesn't quiet down until after 2:00am. The floor was shaking and the walls were rocking! We called to complain and were told the hotel is full and we could not be moved. They acted so surprised to hear my complaint. I asked to speak to the manager and was told he would be in in the morning and the staff would make him aware of my concerns. I checked with the front desk twice the next morning and the manager was never available to speak with me, although there was a gentleman in a hotel jacket who was lurking around while I was having my discussions with the front desk but did not engage in the conversation. However, once I would walk away he would then go speak with the front desk person. So much for customer service. All this for only 840 EU a night! Having read a TripAdvisor review from someone who just stayed there it is obvious that this is a common or even nightly occurence.When I went to settle the bill, the front desk man offered to buy us a drink at the hotel bar for our incovenience. We had no other charges at the hotel. I told him don't bother, just write up the bill, let me check out and you can deal with my friends at American Express in 30 days. I will do everything in my power to make it as difficult as I can can for them to ever receive payment. The suite room was beautiful, the bathrooms over the top. But there is a basic flaw in the soundproofing and design of this hotel and it is obvious that they take advantage of short term tourists who are at their mercy.Show them they need to change their ways. Boycott the the Hotel A La Commedia until they fix the problem or are upfront with their guests about the condition. You couldn't pay me to stay in this Upgraded Suite unless I was deaf as a stone.

<Content>Well recommended Decided to stay at the Hotel a La Commedia at the end of September based upon other Tripadvisor reviews and it did not disappoint. As it was refurbished in 2006 the hotel is modern and contemporary, staff helpful and friendly, breakfast very good. It was also extremely easy to find, just off the main canal near Rialto bridge. Excellent value for money, well recommended.Recommend an evening drink upon the terrace bar on the top floor of the hotel. Although it lacked atmosphere as there were not many people using it at approximately 10pm we felt it was relaxing to have a night cap and take a look at the roof tops of Venice, which was an a different view to what you see when walking around during the day.Extremely minor recommendations would be to include bath robes and change the DVD on the film channel which was the same for the whole three nights we were there. Our room was on the 1st floor which was located above a shop, so during the day we could hear music coming from the shop. However, as the shop closed late afternoon it didn鈥檛 bother us too much.

<Content>Beautiful but room 114 oh so noisy! Have just returned from Venice and the A La Commedia and as an avid trip adviser user cannot believe the review I have just read regarding room 114 why didnt I look at this site before I left!However, first of all arrived at the airport and thought blow the budget we will have a private water taxi what a great way to arrive in Venice absoulutly a must do and worth every cent of the 90 Euros you feel like a film star as you zoom under the Rialto bridge.Hotel is ideally placed for everything 2 minutes from the Rialto and about 5 from St Marks provided you dont get lost which of course you will do repeatadly, but this is all part of the charm of Venice.We stayed for 3 nights in the Hotel and it is fantastic the staff are brilliant and the terrace bar stunning, HOWEVER.............on our 2nd night the bar underneath room 114 was a little loud but nothing in comparison to the following night when returning to our room at 11.00pm it was like being in a nightclub......the walls were vibrating I kid you not!..........in addition there were around 50 people standing in the square singing and dancing and the bar also has some sort of car horn going as well....phoned reception and was told Hotel was full and so cannot move you it will stop around 2am!......tough.......phoned again at 1pm and 1.30pm and the hotel apparently told them to turn it down................3am it eventually finished!...............spoke to the manager the next day and blew my stack after no sleep, he assured me it was a rare event to go on so late and as a token wrote off our 90 Euro bar bill. However the Torino bar is directly under rooms 114, 115 and 113 and 213, 214 and 215 etc going up the hotel, if you are allocated any of these rooms refuse it unless you are going to the bar or an Insomniac..............for the 2 nights after we left the bar was advertising music till 2am so this is not a RARE event it is a regular event. Other than that Venice is as you expect it to be beautiful and timeless but so expensive..............Hotel will offer to book you a Gondola for 120 Euro you can get it for a around 75 if you haggle and restaurants there are 100s probably 1000s and we didnt have a bad meal. Coffee in St Marks Square is as you would expect a wallet clinching experience but one that has to be done so don't fight it, we went to Florins as its the oldest one in the square the waiter was miserable and 2 coffees and 6 biscuits was 35 Euros! St Marks Bassilica is stunning as is the Doge's Palace.There are lots of beautiful squares to have coffee and people watch, we also went to a Vivaldi concert in San Stefano Church which was amazing.We walked everywhere as the weather was great and its the best way to see this fantastic city. So enjoy the experience and don't worry about what its going to cost you have to do it all regardless of the cost and what's more they know it!

<Content>A Tastte of Heaven on Earth This was our fourth trip to Italy and we had gotten used to the small rooms and hard beds. Nestled in a quiet area but extremely close to the St. Mark Square and the main shopping attractions is this extremely sophisticated modernized and spotless clean hotel with incredibly spacious rooms and a nicely decorated and equipped bathroom that is very inviting after the hustle and bustle of a day in Venice. The list of amenities is long as are the perks that the rooms enjoy including a huge plasma tv screen, a CD player, large comfortable beds, adjustable room temperatures, and a very cozy atmosphere. On the day we were supposed to check out, my husband and I went for our last shopping spree in the very tempting elegant shops of Venice. We left my elderly mother behind with a promise to be back in time for the check out as the hotel was booked solid. Due to a protracted payment procedure at one of the shops, we were one hour late for the check out. Not only was the staff accomodating and incredibly gracious to my mother, they also started helping her in trying to reach us on our cell phones, making every attempt to soothe her frayed nerves. When we came back and profously apologized, they were even more gracious and welcoming. We promised to share our experience with the Trip Advisor fans, and we are happy to do so. Definitely, a place to go back to, even if pricey. It is worth every cent.

<Content>Fantastic Venice Hotel!! Booking a hotel in Venice can be pretty hit and miss but I have to say this was a BIG hit. Everything about this hotel can be recommended - the rooms are superbly decorated and looked after, bathrooms are beautifully done out. The attention to detail is amazing - everything carries the A La Commedia Hotel logo - they really have thought of every finishing touch. The staff are very helpful at all times.The new rooftop bar comes highly recommended - very stylish and a great way to end an evening overlooking the rooftops of Venice!Breakfast is typical continental with extras (at cost) if you want.All in all, well worth the money and in a great location - 2 minutes walk from the Rialto Bridge and 5-10 minutes from San Marco Square!

<Content>A Venetian Jewel! We stayed at the Hotel a la Commedia for two nights prior to a Med cruise. The time I spent researching Venice hotels paid off well in finding this wonderful oasis in a busy tourist mecca. I wish I had taken as much care in investigating how to get to the hotel. There were four of us and we should have opted for the more pricey water taxi. But we opted for the cheaper water bus and after being told incorrectly what bus to take, we found ourselves heaving our luggage over the steps of the bridges. But that was my fault. But the sight of the hotel was a welcome one! The staff was so very nice and helpful. One of the front desk fellows even walked us to a restaurant he recommended saying it was no bother...he could use some air. The hotel is beautiful and in a great location near the Rialto bridge and the Piazza San Marco. We wanted to stay in that area rather than having to ferry back to the less expensive areas since we had such a short time there. After the crushing crowds of the daytime a bit of peace comes at nightfall. We discovered an excellent restaurant on the other side of the Rialto bidge: RISTORANTE FLORIDA. Try it...a beautiful setting along the canal with superb food. Now to the hotel: LOVELY! The hotel is only a year old and it is impeccable. It is like a mini-Versailles. The bathroon is equipped with every amenity with inlaid gold accents, granite and a sumptuous tub and shower. The walls of the room are covered in silk with braided cording and the bed also has silk draping. There is state-of-the-art electonics and flat screen tv.The rooftop terrace is a relaxing and beautiful place to have a pre-dinner drink. There is a nice continental breakfast provided in the morning.Considering the quaIity of the hotel, the great location and the high cost of everything in Europe, I found this hotel to be a good value! I am in the travel business and I have shared this wonderful hotel with my agents.

<Content>A fabulous hotel! We stayed in this hotel for four nights from Friday, 17 August. The photographs on the hotel's web site are honest. This place is a real gem, do try it. The hotel isn't just clean, it sparkles! The room was beautifully appointed and the bathroom was luxurious. The bed linen and towels were changed daily. Staff were attentive and couldn't do enough to help with any request. Breakfast was good quality and there was plenty of choice. It is situated only a short distance from the Rialto Bridge so is very convenient.

<Content>Great Venice hotel I stayed at the A La Commedia on two separate days, before and after a cruise which began and ended in Venice. the Hotel is brand new, very clean and our room was luxurious. Great location, between St. Marks and the Rialto bridge. It's about 200 yards from the Rialto, so it's an easy trek from a taxi or vapporatto stand to the Hotel (although you need very precise directions to know which alley to turn into to reach the Hotel). The Hotel porter carted our bags right to the taxi stop at the canal for us. We lost ALL of our luggage when we landed at the Marco Polo airport in Venice (due to a missed connection in Frankfurt - don't book connecting flights to Europe!!). The front desk manager was a tremendous help in working with the airport to locate our luggage, and we were in awe that our lost luggage was waiting for us when we got to the cruise ship. A week later, the manager greeted us by name when we returned. A very positive overall experience.

<Content>The Best Hotel in Venice Words cannot describe the experience that we had while staying five nights in July, 2007 at this very well-run hotel. This is truly a 5 star hotel with a 4 star rating. There was nothing they would not do for us to make our stay an enjoyable one. Even when my wife became ill at 2:00 a.m. they made sure there was a doctor brought up with an interpreter within 45 minutes. The hotel is situated right in the middle of all the activities in Venice. The breakfast was very substantial and you can even order more food that was not in the buffet. Their recommendations for tours and restaurants were right on target and we did not regret any of their suggestions. This is the place to stay in Venice.

<Content>Nicest hotel on our trip This hotel was perfect. First Class room. We had a Junior Suite, it was immaculate, fresh, and the A/C worked amazingly. Many Italian hotels the A/C just works, and it was humid when we were there. Staff was most helpful, location was fabulous for walking to everything (only a few steps from Grand Canal) and the breakfast was very substantial for continental. The Breakfast room staff was always cleaning, and keeping the tables turned so you never had to wait to be seated. I highly recommend this hote for anyone, no matter how picky you are, (I am very OCD when it comes to cleanliness) A bit pricy, but for Venice, not a bad deal at all, you won't be disappointed. I'm sure this hotel would be a 5 star if it had a regular restaurant. Dennie Deetz

<Content>Fantastic Hotel in a central location I stayed at the A La Commedia for four nights as a single traveller in July. The hotel made me feel welcome and It made my stay in Venice a fantastic experience. Would I stay here again, yes definately. The staff were polite and helpful nothing was ever too much trouble. The room 106 was a double room it was immaculate, stylish and comfortable. If you want to experience Venice and you want great accommodation this is the place. I can't wait to return.

<Content>Very clean and convenient. We stayed for 7 nights as a family of four and my wife's parents. We were later joined by my brother-in-law.Between us we had four bedroomsand they were all immaculately clean.The A/C worked efficiently and we did not hear any sounds from anywhere else. I slept much better than I usually do in hotels.The maids attend twice a day and there is a nice turn-down service.The staff are all very friendly and speak good English.The roof terrace has furniture and is a lovely way to unwind , have some hot drinks , nightcaps and cocktails ,look at the sky and the Campanile of San Marco and the folks down on the street.The location is fantastic. My mother-in-law does not walk well , but the Piazza di San Marco is only 10-15 minutes walk away and the Rialto bridge is less than 5 mins.The No 1 vaporetta stop is only 2 mins away down a side alley.The breakfast is elementary , but quite adequate.It would be much better if they also provided a full hot buffet breakfast inclusive.I would stay here again.I hope that it maintains its standards , because I understand that it has only been open for less than 12 months.

<Content>Very noisy room 114, though hotel room was beautiful We stayed Tues, Wed  Thu night in early June at A La Commedia. We were shown to a beautiful room, number 114, overlooking Campo San Luca. However on returning to our room at 10:30pm we could not believe the level of noise in there. It was as though there was a live band playing in our room! Because we didn't know where it was coming from, when looking through the windows, which were tightly shut, we assumed that it was one of the locals with their stereo turned up very loud. The noise, which was impossible to block out even with ear plugs, eventually stopped at 3am. The next day we discovered that a bar called Torino @ Notte was directly underneath our room and the bar displayed a sign to show that they play live music at night until 2am. We asked at hotel reception if we could change rooms, but were told that the hotel was full and that that bar is usually a quiet bar. We endured a further 2 nights of excruciatingly loud music and on returning home discovered that Torino @ Notte is one of the few places in Venice (La Serenissima?!) that is known for loud music. Well that is the bad bit. The good part is that the hotel room was beautiful, though we had no safe due to the room being so recently refurbished. Everywhere in the hotel was lovely and clean. The breakfasts were excellent and it was no trouble for the waiter to bring us a Macchiato, when asked, to go with them. Because we arrived relatively late in the evening on our first night, we asked for a recommendation from the hotel of somwhere to eat. I had read, on the internet, about a place called Bancogiro, but the receptionist said that he did not know it and advised us to go to Trattoria alla Scala, about 10 minutes away. When we eventually found alla Scala, the food was pleasant, though the scallops were a little gritty, and the few other diners there also seemed to be from A La Commedia. The next day we walked over to the Rialto market, which was less than 5 minutes from the hotel and there in Campo San Giacometto was Bancogiro and also another highly regarded restaurant Naranzaria. We ate at Bancogiro on the 2nd night. The food was of excellent quality and very good value. Staff were very friendly. Bancogiro's location is also great, because you can eat outside overlooking the Grand Canal! For those of you who have seen the latest Bond movie, Casino Royale, these 2 eateries are where the scene where diners get up from their seats in shock at the sight of the building opposite crumbling into the water were filmed. On our last night we ate at Osteria da Alberto in Cannaregio and can't recommend it enough - great food and, once again, very friendly staff. Try the Fragolino and Venetian biscuits. Also worth a visit is Al Bottegon, a little old fashioned bar near the little bridge in San Trovaso, opposite a Gondola workshop. They serve great cicchetti and drinks or coffee. There is standing room only, but it is a real Italian experience and we were grateful of it when we ran in out of the rain on our walk around the Accademia area. We would stay at A La Commedia again, but only if we could be guaranteed a peaceful bedroom.

<Content>Nice but Noisy! Hotel a La Commedia is very easy to get to. You basically take the vaporetto (line 82 or 1) to the Rialto stop (just past the large bridge) and it's about a block or two away. It's easy to find and it's off the main street, which is nice. The hotel itself was modern and nicely appointed. There is a bar downstairs and a restaurant for breakfast only. There is also a rooftop which would be ideal for dining or drinks but there are no tables or chairs up there for unknown reasons. The desk people were EXTREMELY helpful - they booked a water taxi for me on my last day, and they gave us excellent recommendations for dinner. Here was the problem. The first night, we went to bed around Midnight. Just after 12:30am, there was blaring music coming from the back/side alley of the hotel. It sounded like the music was IN our room. It was clubbed out music, with bass pumping. We had the windows closed, but it was still horrible. We called the front desk and were told it would stop at 1am (which made no sense). At 1:10am we called again. They told us they would do what they could but that they had no idea where it was coming from or when it would stop. At 2am, I finally got out of bed, and stomped down to the front desk. They told us they could not do anything about it, so I asked for another room. We had to move all our things ourselves, but the new room was perfectly quiet. So my advice is to ask for a room in the front of the property, not the rear.

<Content>Perfection! My family of five just completed a two night stay at Hotel a La Commedia and absolutely loved it! I was nervous about it because I had only stayed at the Bauer for previous visits to Venice, but the Bauer was unavailable...the best thing that could have happened! We had a double Junior Suite and a triple Junior Suite and the rooms were just wonderful...everything was maximum comfort and the staff was attentive, english speaking and enthusiastic...As has been repeatedly mentioned, the location is great, with easy walking access to everything...no canal view, but the canal view we have had in the past (at the Bauer) is so straight down, it doesn't really lend itself to a relaxed looking out over the canal... so, we didn't miss the canal view at all...The Hotel a La Commedia will definately be our hotel of choice for future trips to this wonderful city...

<Content>Total disaster What a disaster! The entire staff we dealt with at this hotel was both rude and incompetent. The property itself was not bad, but the performance and unprofessional attitude of the staff ruined our stay in Venice. I've stayed at several hotels in this price range in the San Marco area of Venice recently, and this one is by far the worst. I had heard that people had good experiences here in the off season, but the staff clearly can't handle running the place during the peak visitor season of the summer. I will never return here.

<Content>A Beautiful Hotel My wife and I stayed here together with another couple late May.As has been explained in other postings, the hotel is a minute or two walk just off behind the Rialto Bridge near where the Vaporetto stops.On arrival the staff were very friendly and accommodation and this continued throughout our stay. The hotel itself is very new and modern and I was told it was a converted bank building now housing 40 rooms. The rooms, although not overly large were done out with very modern conveniences and in some ways seemed a little out of character for the rest of Venice but that really didn't concern us. Breakfast was the typical selection of cereals, cheeses, cold meets and an array of fresh rolls, croissants and cakes. Cooked items were available at additional charge. We mostly ordered capaccinos with our breakfast which were strong  hot.Wireless internet access is available in the room after purchasing a usage card from the desk. Usage is time based and the time is cumulative rather than what some other hotels do and make it a fixed period of time from the time you first logon. For 13 Euros I had a two hour card which more or less lasted me for the 3 nites I stayed there.Would definitely recommend this place to others and would love to stay there again.

<Content>Lovely Modern Hotel My husband and I have just returned from the Hotel A La Commedia in Venice. The hotel is situated in a great location, about 1 minute walk from the Grand Canal and the Rialto Bridge, and about a 5 minutes walk from St Marks Square. Although you do not have a veiw of the canal, and the views are not spectacular, this does not disadvantage the hotel. It is situated amongst the designer shopping centre, close to the theatre and the concert halls, and restaurants.The hotel is very modern, exceptionally clean, and because it is quite small has an intimate feel about it. Our room was quite compact, and was in red and gold and felt very opulant. The bathroom is ultra modern, and cleaned twice a day. The chambermaids are very discreet and due to the electronic key system, they know when you are out of your room, so never disturb you. The bathroom was big, with overhead shower, and hand shower, marble decor will all modern fittings. The room had LCD T.V which has about 3 or 4 channels in English. Not that you have time to watch TV when you are in Venice!My only complaint about the hotel was the bed. The kingsize bed was actually two singles joined together, and the mattress was extremely hard as were the pillows, in fact it was like sleeping on concrete. We probably should have asked to change rooms and I am sure that would not have been a problem,as the staff were excellent.My baggage had gone missing and the airline did not deliver my case until my last day. The hotel staff went out of their way to help me, and contacted the airline veryday by phone and email to chase the missing baggage, all at no extra cost. They were helpful with everything you asked for help with, and always pleasant without being over the top. As they had been so helpful we did not pursue changing our rooms, which we probably should have.The breakfast room is delightful in red and gold, again giving the feeling of opulance, and the breakfast is buffet in style, with a range of cereals, fruit, croissants, rolls, ham, cheese etc. The waiting staff were very smartly dressed in uniforms, very attentive and helpful.Overall it is a good hotel, and I would recommend this to anyone visiting Venice for a short break. Have a look at their website before booking, as the pictures of the amenities are a true reflection of what the hotel is like.

<Content>Perfect Hotel! We've just returned from four nights at the Commedia Hotel.Absolute perfection! Venice is all about location, and what a location this is! Five or ten minute walk to everything you want to see and do!The accommodations are gorgeous......be sure and opt for the junior suite. What a delight to have an additional living area, two TVs, and a spacious bath in a very old city!The entire staff is outstanding. They can help you in every way conceivable. Extra kudos to Roberto....who obviously loves his job and his city.The hotel is quite new, yet keeps to the charm and elegance that is Venice. Chic style, great views of the red tile roofs, balconies, and the Campanile. Your first step on the rooftop garden confirms that every bit of planning you put into your trip to Venice was worth it!Have a cappuccino in the wonderful bar area, and catch up on international news via the supplied papers. Ask recommendations for restaurants, Just stroll and enjoy the life that is Venice.All of the paintings that you've ever seen of this charming place will take on a new meaning after your stay at the Hotel a la Commedia! New, fresh, spectacular!!!!Should be five-star, without a doubt!!!!

<Content>Great location, excellent customer service This new hotel is well situated near to the Rialto Bridge and within easy walk of Venice's many attractions. Customer service was excellent; our room had a problem with the electrics and so the management arranged a first class suite at an alternative hotel for one night, and we returned to our room the next day to find a free bottle of wine as a thank you. They even gave us a small gift for my birthday.The hotel does not have its own restaurant, but this is not really needed given its location. The roof terrace is nice to sit out on, and the air conditioned rooms are comfortable and roomy. We enjoyed our stay and recommend the hotel wholeheartedly.

<Content>A top rate hotel by any standard Our stay was exceptionally good.The staff are excellent, polite, friendly and very helpful.The rooms were of a very high standard with all amenities.The situation is wonderful for it is both in walking distance to St Mark's Square and to the Grand Canal, with close and easy access to both Water Taxis and Water Buses.

<Content>4 stars hotel, 1 star service Stayed several night in this hotel, paying up to 600 Euro per night (suite). The hotel has little charme, but it is fresh and new, which is nice. But the service at the front desk is a misery. They will offer you a free trip to Murano, which is nothing but puting you under pressure to buy a lamp for 12000 euro or a vase for 6000. If you manage not to, you can be sure that water taxi is not waiting for you anymore. On the way back home, when we arrived at the airport ( 1 hr boat ride) we noticed that we forgot tickets in the hotel room. We called them and begged them to get this tickets and send them with the shuttle boat. The staff was not willing to walk 5 minutes to Alilaguna shuttle boat !!!Altough they knew how important it was! We had to order water taxi for 100 euro instead. This is not 4* service! It is not even 1*.

<Content>Great place to stay in Venice This was a wonderful choice for a hotel. We are picky travelers and have stayed in 4 star hotels before so we have a good frame of reference. This one is in a great location -- convenient to Rialto and St. Mark's square. They have a very helpful staff, immaculately clean rooms, a comfortable bed, a lovely rooftop terrace, a very nice breakfast included. We wouldn't change a thing and would definitely return.

<Content>Excellant Hotel Spotted this hotel via Trip Advisor.com.It is in ideal location between Rialto and San Marco. Five mins with bags from the Grand Canal, worth getting a private water taxi from the airport if you can 90Euros.Staff are friendly and bags taken to the room, the hotel is well appointed and looked new. Heard bad things about tired state of five start properties such as the Daniele and Gritti Palace, but not hear, definately 4 star hotel. Towels all clean and new and there is a turn down service as well, large screen tv on walls and cd player and alarm clock in room. Staff speak various languages as well. No restaurant but one right outside, lovely setting but not cheap, but has to be said food very good. Breakfast in hotel is good, although coffee lacking in taste for me personally. They can do cooked items should you wish but cost extra. However breakfast buffet is more than adequate. Hotel gave my Mother a small gift of venetian biscuits as it was her birthday whilst we were there and a flower for the saints day too.

<Content>Fantastic! The minute you walk into reception at this hotel you know it's going to be good. Check in was very smooth, friendly helpful staff provided us with a map of Venice and gave advice on Gondola's and getting around etc. Our bags were taken to the room for us and wow what a room! This hotel has just been refurbished and evrything is brand new and immaculate. Our room (Delux) was fantastic, I loved the bathroom! Nice details, such as when you returned to your room in the evening they had drawn the curtains, turned back the bed, left a chocolate each and the weather report for the next day. Breakfast was good, choice of fruits, cheeses, yogurts, croissants etc but if you wanted anything hot there was an extra charge. All in all a fantastic hotel and one we'll definately return too.

<Content>Fabulous hotel! We stayed here for 2 nights in March (as part of a family golden wedding anniversary celebration) and had a very enjoyable time, further enhanced by the glorious weather that weekend. The hotel itself is fabulous - appears brand new, immaculate and luxurious! The bathroom in particular was great -all shiny marble and gold!All of the staff were very professional yet friendly, and nothing was too much trouble.Excellent cold buffet breakfast was included in the price, with 'hot' items available on request (payable). Recommend the crispy bacon on toast!The location of the hotel is perfect - c 2 minutes walk from the No1 Vaporetto stop at Rialto (no bridges to cross with luggage - big advantage!), and handy for walking to all the major sites eg San Marco, Accademia etc (c10-15 mins). We bought the 72 hr waterbus passes, but to be honest, we didnt make much use of them, given the super location.All in all, we had no complaints whatsoever with this hotel, particularly given the excellent rate we had obtained on the internet. Highly recommended - would return without hesitation!

<Content>You can't find a better hotel The location is perfect; the staff gracious and helpful. You could not find a better hotel in Venice. Book La Commedia with confidence. This hotel was part of our package with Alitalia and we were delighted with our room (bathroom was fabulous); the bed was most comfortable and the breakfasts were ample. Everyone we encountered was very friendly and most helpful. It all added up to a most wonderful stay in Venice. We hope to return to Venice; and when we do, we will stay at La Commedia.

<Content>Great Deluxe Hotel We stayed at the Hotel a La Commedia for 3 nights at the beginning of a two week vacation in Italy. We were absolutely shocked when we walked up to hotel and saw that it was truly a luxury hotel. The hotel is new and immaculate - not a smudge to be found. Our room was very well-appointment (a flat screen TV and CD player, 2 pairs of slippers) with a very nice bathroom. It reminded me of the rooms at the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas........ The Vegas hotel designers clearly came to venice and took the best of........There is nightly turn down service with chocolates left on your pillow. The hotel is located about 200 feet from the Rialto Bridge and about a 5 minute walk from St. Mark's Square - the perfect spot off the square, but close to it. Hotel breakfast in the mornings was excellent - the best our entire trip. You have the option of eating the free buffet or paying a little extra to order from a menu. The front desk staff spoke good English and were very helpful. We often asked for assistance booking restaurant reservations. They can also arrange for gondola rides (at group rates) and city tours. In addition, this hotel has wireless internet access as well as a public computer with internet.We highly recommend this hotel and will return for another stay!

<Content>Beautiful Hotel I was travelling with my parents and toddler so I tried to book 1st class accommodations the whole way... sometimes we succeed! This hotel is a gem! Hi-Tech and totally clean, gorgeous beds (yes, even the sofa bed), excellent location to boot, great breakfast (for Italy) and a most wonderful bathroom. Even my 2-year old was very impressed! We stayed in a Junior Suit done up as a triple and had 2 seperate LCD TVs.

<Content>A la Commedia lived up to our expectations! We booked this hotel purely on Trip Advisor recommendations and we certainly weren't disappointed. It is a really lovely hotel - everything is brand new and it is so clean. It really deserves it's 4 stars. The hotel is in a fantastic location - 1 minute from the Rialto bridge and approx 10 minutes from St. Mark's. The room was very luxurious and cosy and the bathroom was beautiful. The staff at the hotel are all very couteous and we particularly liked the barman (sorry we didn't ask his name). He was very friendlyand helpful.We got the public water bus from the airport which took approx 1 hourand 20 minutes. On the way back we booked a private water taxi (90 euros) through the hotel and it took about 20 minutes - well worth it.If you want to see the length of the Grand Canal - take the number 1 Vaporetta (6 euros).We will definitely be returning to this hotel.

<Content>Great experience This spotless hotel was refurbished last year and is located about thirty seconds from Rialto bridge and a five minute walk to St Marks Square. I stayed two nights in a deluxe spacious room equipped with a large bathroom, mini bar. The power shower was hard to get out of because it was so enjoyableIf I was asked what made my stay so special in this particular hotel I'd have no hesitation in accreditng the staff on this front. They were so helpful from the minute we walked through their doors. We arrived at about 9pm and having been shown to our rooms we sought their advice for somewhere nice to eat. Not only were we recommended a restaurant that stood the test we were personally walked to the door by the concierge. ( Trattoria alla Scala was the restaurant and it too was a great experience, especially if you like fresh fish! ) The hotel will not disappoint you in any way!!Venice itself is a charming city. You can get lost easily on one of its many alleys, sidestreets but this is the beauty of it. Every little trip away from the hotel led to the discovery of a different street of shops etc.. The shops are exceptional to say the least, chanel, gucci etc etc..There is an abundance of restaurants or trattoria to choose from. Bars:Venice simply isn't a pace to go to if one is looking for a big night out in a bar. Alcohol isn't served after 12am. The most famous bar is Harry's Bar which doesn't serve beer or wine and its famous Bellini drink costs 鈧?5 each. Its nice, but not that nice!! Airport - City:We took a water taxi from the airport to the city which cost 鈧?10 for 6 of us. If there were less people I would have taken a water bus instead, which is cheaper but takes twice as long. The taxi took approx 25 mins.Gondolas:This is a lovely experience and is a must do as far as I'm concerned. It costs about 鈧?5 per person for a 40 -45 min trip but you can get it for 鈧?0 p/p or less if you haggle.

<Content>Lovely Hotel A La Commedia We've just got back from visiting Venice for the first time. Mr and Mrs Northpoint were celebrating our 5th wedding anniversay, so we wanted to find a hotel that was a little above the average. I can safely say we found it with the Hotel A La Commedia. The hotel is situated a stone's throw from the Grand Canal and RialtoBridge. It's tucked away in the Corte Del Teatro Goldoni, which meansthat you don't get to see the canal from your hotel window, but you do get relative piece and quiet! A walk to the Canal and Rialto Bridge is about 1 minute away. St Mark's Square can be reached on foot in five minutes. There are also some lovely shops and cafes near by.We booked a junior suite at Euro 250 per night. We found the room to be very clean, spacious, and it came complete with LCD widescreen TV, CD player, safe, minibar, and sofa. Mrs Northpoint was a little disappointed that our king sized bed was really two beds pushed together - not much sleeping area when you have avoid that nasty dividing line.The bathroom was large and boasted his and her's sinks, as well as bath, overhead shower, and the other usuals you might expect.Breakfasts were a continental affair, and rather lovely. Bacon and eggs etc could be ordered, but you need to pay extra.All hotel staff we extremely helpful and friendly, and there were a couple of occassions when they went out of their way to help. They did try to offer us a free trip to Murano, but this is best avoided, as we've heard from other travellers that this can turn into a high pressure sales event.All in all, we can thoroughly recommend this hotel. If you want somewhere with a great location in the centre of Venice, good sized and clean rooms, along with friendly staff, then this is the place for you!

<Content>fabulous fantastic hotel, the best that i have ever stayed in.the standard of cleanliness was excellent. the staff were friendly. i would recommend a boat taxi from the airport rather than the ferry if you can afford it. we took the water bus and it took ages. serves us right for being cheap skates.

<Content>Wow this was great I love this place, Great bar, very nice people. Only problem I had was that we went to a recommended restaurant and it was very pretty but we didn't really like the food much.I love the breakfast, it was the best one in europe, the staff was amazing. If you can get it, it's great.Also I stayed in a suite and I highly recommend it, because then it feels like a regular size room.

<Content>Wonderful - hotel made our trip We'd originally booked another hotel in venice but when we arrived, it was awful, so we set about finding somewhere else. My husband found this hotel, and they gave us a fantastic deal, being January and quiet, and we thought the place was excellent. Very clean, with lovely modern bathrooms, a comfy biggish bed and a flatscreen tv - all very comfortable and the staff were extremely helpful, giving us maps and directions etc. Ultra convenient location too, as it's just minutes from the Rialto Bridge, and a short walk past all the nice shops to St Marks Square. We'll definitely stay there again when we go back to Venice.

<Content>Loved every minute This is by far the nicest Hotel we have ever stayed in.The decor in the rooms was wonderful, so clean tasteful and plush.We had a junior suite with two plasma screen tv's(my husband was over the moon, though my daughter got annoyed because he had trouble changing the channel on the one he was watching without changing the one she was watching at the same time)The bathroom was beautiful so clean and well appointed lots of hot water and the tiles were exquisite.The breakfast room is a nice size not too big well laid out and the service was good as was the coffee and fresh fruit salad.The reception desk we found to be welcoming and helpful, they even laid on a free trip by water taxi(which we were escorted to)to Murano Island and organised a tour round the glass making workshop.When we first arrived at 11.30 in the morning we could not access our room until 2 pm but they took our luggage and stored it so that we could walk round the city get lunch etc and when we returned we were escorted to our room and our luggage was quickly portered to us.The roomwas cleaned each day and in the evening the beds were turned back and sweets left with a card giving the following days weather forcast.I cannot really fault this hotel we did not find the beds uncomfortable as some people have said but I think this is a personal thing I like a firm bed.Unlike many hotels we could not find a single shabby area.Simply WONDERFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
