<Content>Beautiful Renovated Hotel This is a favorite long time hotel of my family. We just stayed again for Christmas Eve and loved the new renovations. Staff was excellent as usual. This in my opinion is the best hotel on Nob Hill. Beautiful and elegant, but not over crowded with tourists the way the Fairmont and Mark Hopkins are.Now my critic; They moved the restaurant from the far corner of the hotel into the lobby area to be more centeralized and accessible to the guests. The result is a beautiful restaurant, but left us all wondering where is the lobby. There is no lobby sitting area, unless you go into the restaurant. This felt very weird. Come on put a couple of couches out near the front desk.Second the old restaurant space is now empty. It had overlooked the cable car intersection. This would make an excellent and very interesting bar area. I suspect they will just use it as meeting/function space. Too bad.Overall a great hotel and will stay again in the future.

<Content>Five Stars My husband and I stayed at the Stanford Court for one nite as we were in the city to go to the ballet. We were pleasantly surprised that it had been renovated and is so beautiful,modern, fresh and clean. Our room had amazing views of the bay and the city and was very modern. The lobby looks great and we enjoyed some appetizers and drinks at the bar. All the staff were friendly and accommodating. I highly recommend this hotel and we will be back!!

<Content>Stunning hotel I booked this hotel for work since I mostly stay at Marriott properties when traveling. Marriott's are usually consistent and nice business hotels. I stayed for Thanksgiving weekend before work at the Hilton on 333 OFarrell street. It was a little outdated and there were a lot of panhandlers outside the hotel even though it was right near Market Street with the flagship Bloomingdale's and Barney's. I was disappointed in my selection.For all that was at fault with the Hilton, just a short distance away was paradise. This hotel was at the top of Nob Hill. It was devoid of the problems I previously experienced. I stayed on the 5th floor which could have had street level noise but it was no problem. It was classic San Francisco with incredible views of the bay.The $32 million renovation was just completed. It is magnificent and a wonderful combination of vintage charm with modern comfort. The only negative is the pricing on parking. $45/night is steep but it is San Fran. I have a feeling this hotel will raise its room rates soon once the word is out. I highly recommend staying here.

<Content>Awesome! Stayed here on Dec 4. I did not stay here before the renovation. The money was well invested. The staff is 5 star. Not one complaint. Excellent service from the valet to the check-in to housekeeping. The hotel feels like a RItz. Everything is nice. I had a corner room on the 7th floor with a bay view. Unbelieveable. Awesome views of the city and the bay. The room was huge! The TV was great, too. The fitness center is top notch! Location can not be beat in Nob Hill. Cable cars are right out the door. I booked on the Marriott site and got a mid-week rate for $159. It included to cabel car passes and a free breakfast. You can't beat this deal in downtown San Fran! It is unheard of! I'm sure I won't get this deal next time I book, but it was a great deal on this last trip.I usually stay at the Hilton downtown or the Courtyard at Oyster Point. The Stanford Court is my new #1 hotel in San Fran!!

<Content>Would Not Return Again My wife and I recently stayed overnight for a conference. Had dinner, breakfast and stayed one night in what I presume is a typical single queen bed room. On the upside the service (especially at dinner) is very attentive. The food was above average - nothing to come back for though. The place has been recently remodeled and very clean overall. On the downside, the rooms don't offer much sound insulation - you can hear a lot from neighbors running water and flushing to people talking in the hallway just outside the room. The rooms are relatively small given this place is older so the beds are close to the doors. We had a room that faced the interior (and ugly) courtyard which is supposedly quieter but not by much. Keep in mind the outer facing rooms can be noisy with clanging cable cars til 1am. What made it worse is that a bunch of drunk women were rudely talking loudly in the hallway and next door at 2am waking both of us and making us lose about 1.5-2 hours of sleep that night. We called security which arrived in about 5-10 minutes to shut them up. However, the night front desk man called me 1/2 hour after the security arrived just to see if these drunkards shut up just when I was trying to fall back asleep. I mean, why call me, man? If there is a problem I will call back. How stupid! He must have been a rookie. Lastly, the wait to get my car back from valet parking was longer than reasonable - not enough personnel. I would definitely shop around for a better place since there are many fine hotels to choose from in SF.

<Content>Renovation produces a gem Stayed a delightful weekend in mid November. The ambiance is as if you had just arrived at a friend's house. Easy arrival and check-in. Concierge was well informed.Located at the corner where all the cable cars pass thus Union Square, Market  Powell and fisherman's wharf are all accessible without effort.Top of the Mark is just up the street.Newly decorated rooms and public spaces are scrumptious to the eye.As the renovations are still underway (rooms 90 percent converted), there are still some startup glitches. My room did not have the promised safe and mini bar, which was brought promptly when I asked. The TV remote did not work and was replaced promptly. The new TV channel lineups were not yet published to the in-room directory.

<Content>Loved Stanford Court My husband and I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights while we were visiting San Francisco. We had a great stay in this hotel. Only complains are the water pressure was slow from the sink faucet and the valet fees are a little high. Our room was on the 5th floor facing to Powell and we saw the cable car . It also has a nice view. We heard some street noise on the first night since it was Sat. Sun was a little quiet or may be we got used to the noise, it did not bother us much. Starbucks coffee is a nice touch in the morning especially my husband is a coffee person. We missed the champagne since we were always out during that time. The hotel room had no fridge. But we requested one. The front desk staff was very nice and also greeted us. We borrowed an umbrella from the concierge since it was raining on one of the nights. The valet parking service was very good and staff was very friendly as well. The court yard of the hotel is big (not on the street) so we did not feel rush when we dropped off the car for valet service. We walked to Union Square. Going there was easy. Coming back was hard since we had to walk up to the hill. But we enjoyed the walk. We also walked to Chinatown and Tadich Grill for dinner. Be prepared to involve a lot of climbings if you are not using car/cable car.

<Content>Nice place! This is a very nice refurbished hotel. I had a request for a king, they were out when we checked in, so they gave us a queen with a great view of the bay. It was very nice and clean. I thought the size of the room was fine. Something I noticed is that the front desk area always smelled good, kind of like a spa. I thought that was a nice touch. They have free Starbucks coffee in the morning and champagne at about 5 by the front desk. The ice machines are not in yet so just call and they will deliver it, and anything else you need right away. It is at the top of a very steep hill so just be sure to get a cable car pass so you can jump on if you are not always up for the walk. The staff was very nice and always greeted us weather we were leaving or returning. Concierge was very informative and helpful.

<Content>First Class I got an excellent rate via Expedia. Never heard of this Hotel before. I was satisfied alone with the price... but when I arrived at the Hotel, I was immediately impressed with every aspect that this establishment had to offer. We arrived at 11 am and check-in is 3 pm. However, the front desk advised me that they had a room available and at no extra charge I was in my room at 11 am. They serve complimentary starbucks coffee and morning champaigne in the lobby. The ammenities are remarkable and so many details that I can not explain here. I forgot my shaving cream and razor; the front desk had them delivered to me within 5 minutes. The staff is absolutely friendly and the whole place had a friendly and welcoming!The location is right off Powell street so the trolley is literally right outside the hotel. Very convenient to Fishermans Wharf, sNobb Hill, and The Mall. I highly recommend this hotel to everyone!!! MU

<Content>Come Here and Enjoy- The Renovations are over! I used priceline and paid $115- so inexpensive. The check in rep. offered me a view on the 3rd floor (highest priceline option) which may have cable car noise, or an interior room. I chose the view and the windows were so well insulated that the noise was no problem (and I am a very light sleeper). The view was great because the hotel is on top of a hill.The room was huge and gorgeous. The staff was professional and friendly. The location was excellent and all the public areas were we appointed. They had evening free champaign (unlimited). The parking was an insult (over $50 w/tax), but the Masonic Events Center two short blocks away had it for $30 (a fair price in this city).I would definately recommend this hotel.

<Content>Wonderful Customer Service and Location I must admit I had no baseline of this hotel before the rennovation so I arrived with an open mind. Often one can tell by employee interaction if the property is synrchronized, and as evidenced by the smiles, the tenue of employees, and the care and feeding the employees give to this grand old property, it's not just another prefabricated downtown highrise.The color scheme throughout the hotel is bright and cheery and much time was spent reusing some of the stately elements rarely found in a business hotel. From the beautiful stained glass to the marble in my bathroom, it was nice to see how much time was spent preserving the past.Since older hotels tend to have smaller rooms, I was surprised at how someone had taken the time to plan out a space to provide today's basics, large flat screen television, comfortable computer desk, and LOTS of electrical outlets for phone chargers, computers, and all the other gadgets we carry. The restaurant I understand was previously located downstairs and was more in keeping with the older, darker established restaurant theme. The restaurant has been moved to the main level, where the marble floor shines and the LITTLE PLATE menu is perfect for those of us who do not want a large slab of steak before we retire to bed. I understand in the near future their bar will offer an extensive collection of top end wines by the glass, and the executive chef personally stopped by to inquire about my dinner - you can tell he is a stickler for details and customer experience.I opt to take a taxi to my downtown hotel and then take taxis to my meetings, as parking on the hills is not one of my favorite things. As a bonus, this hotel offers is the availability of two car services during the day that will take you for what you would pay for a taxi to most destinations within the City. I used the service and was very impressed with the cleanliness of the cars and courtesy of the drivers.Overall, I would recommend staying at this hotel; it's a treat for us business travelers that are used to the cookie-cutter chain hotel accomodations, and I would also stay at this hotel while on holiday. The Stanford Court is a grand hotel, with boutique charm, and wonderful service.

<Content>I really felt like home !!! Me and my wife stayed in the Stanford Court 4 days, then I went to Wine Country and Carmel and returned for more 3 days. And both of my stays were very pleasant.The renovation was almost done, and did not bothered we at all.....and in the end of our stay we could see part of the new lobby already.The rooms were fully renovated very good with all the ammenities you'll find in a 4 star hotel.If you want a silent room ask for a courtyard view room. You will lost the partial bay area view, but won't get annoyed by the cable cars bell (they run until 12 PM)The staff is absolutely friendly from the front desk to the house keeping staff, everybody was naturally warm.Other special point was the attention we had from the master concierge, Mr. Ric Lee, who help us with the reservations in some of the best restaurants, and they also helped me with flowers for my wife's birthday.The only con I can say was the US$45/day parking, except for that everything else was great.

<Content>Overrated Stanford Court We recently stayed at the Stanford Court on Nob Hill in San Francisco. It has just undergone a major renovation. Unfortunately the rooms are extremely small and the closet is in the bathroom. We were unable to get breakfast at the hotel and our TV didn't work most of one day -all we got was excuses. This hotel does not now live up to its old reputation for excellence. There are many good hotels in San Francisco and this is not one of them. The Stanford Court has 4 star prices and 2 star service.

<Content>great location - great rooms We stayed for 2 nights here at the end of a west coast road trip. The hotel is undergoing some renovations to its lobby area, i would have like to see it in its 'full glory' once complete, but didn't bother us really - we were out most of the day. the room we had must have been one that had been updated recently. it was lovely... the best of our 2 week trip. we cant believe what good value we go it for (booked before we went through tour operator). it had a lovely big bathroom, and the bed was big and comfy. we asked to be on the road side overlooking the street. you can hear the trams going past but this didn't bother us.we didn't use any of the other services at the hotel, apart from the concierge (helpful), so cant comment on these.location wise it was great - right at the stop for the trams. before we got the hang of them though we did do a couple of trips up and down the hill which was not a good idea!!!! my calf muscles didnt recover for a few days!!all in all i really like this hotel.... and would definitely recommend it.

<Content>Stay somewhere else- I called this hotel 6 months in advance to book 2 connecting rooms. My kids are 9, 10 and 13. I was able to use my Marriot rewards to pay for the 2 rooms for 2 nights. The hotel looked beautiful on the web site and had decent reviews. Prior to our trip, I called the front desk to confirm our reservations and the connecting rooms. The front desk was not friendly and quite annoyed that I called . Marriot has a horrble policy of not guaranteeing connecting rooms, even when booking so far in advance. I was told to call back a few days before we arrived. We did call the day before check in and was told we didn't have connecting rooms and they would see what they could do. They did accomodate us. Upon arrival, the place is under construction and there is no lobby to speak of . The man at the front desk had an attitude and when I gave him our name, he said,  I worked really hard to get you those rooms. I informed him that I made the reservation 6 months ago ! Isn't that their job ???The rooms are nice, a bit on the small side. We were on the top floor in an already renovated area. The bedroom was area was fine, but the bathroom was disgusting. I found a housekeeping cart and took the disinfectant to clean the two bathrooms. The tubs were stained, grout was black in spots, mold on the shower curtains and our tiolet leaked black oily stuff from the handle. I know we were in the heart of the city, but they have done nothing to sound proof their windows or walls. It was very noisy ! I heard this complaint from other guests , as well as, how horribel the lobby area is with the construction.We would not stay here again . I'd rather pay for another hotel and use my points elsewhere.

<Content>Under construction... I booked this through my company's travel agency because I have stayed here before and also because of the price ($209). I stayed for 3 nights. The hotel is under construction, so if the renovation has been completed, this review will be less valuable. However, I was put in a room that had been updated. It had two double beds and was decent sized. It sat above California Street, and the cable cars can be heard along with some traffic sounds. While somewhat noticeable, not a show stopper. The room had a large flat screen TV that had a lot of channels. Internet (both wired and wireless) was available for $10 per day from noon to noon. A coffee pot in the room and Starbucks located in the lobby were free. The room was clean but the bathtub hadn't been given much of a makeover. They mostly updated other parts of the room. I was satisfied but the room wasn't anything special. Also, the elevators were slow and I was only on the 6th floor. The construction was a bit obtrusive in the lobby and they had makeshift check-in, lobby and other areas. Really not very appealing as long as it's under construction. Breakfast in Forneau's Oven was nice, although not much of a view. Food was ala carte only, no buffet. I only had oatmeal so I can't comment too much on the quality. Parking was $45 per day which is par for the course in SF. Service for the car was fast. The location is atop of Nob Hill near the Fairmont, Mark Hopkins and the Ritz. You can walk down the hill easily, but those with physical limitations may want to consider a cab back up the hill. Overall a decent place, but hard to rate that high with the construction going on. Be sure to ask before you book a room.

<Content>Under renovatoin I stayed one night on a business trip at the Standford court and picked this hotel for the location and Marriott points. It is under some serious renovation - if you like a formal lobby wait until they are done and I am sure it will be beautiful. Right now there is just a small area cordoned off to register and no real lobby - just an area that at one point must have been a conference room that has some couches and a make shift bar. The rooms are small but clean and well appointed. Staff is very accommodating and location is great on Nob Hill. Health club is closed but complimentary pass to neighbor facility is available. Also no concierge level until renovation is complete.

<Content>Love this place. We had the chance to stay here but one night and it was glorious. The room was impeecably appointed, spotless and exceedingly comfortable. In addition, the service was exceptional: they had my pantes hemmed for me on a Saturday morning for me just before I left for the next leg of my journey.The location is appealing as well. Since it sits on Nob Hill, everything we wanted was within walking distance or a short cab ride. Shopping, food, nightlife and sightseeing were all close by. Thus, I highly recommend this hotel. So why not the full five stars, you might be wondering? Well that's the basis of my sole complaint. We happened to stay there towards the end of construction so we did not have a real lobby to see, or a bar or restaraunt to grab a snack or a cocktail due to the construction. Also, the valet area is terrible. Both times I pulled in there, someone had left their car so that it blocked the circle to get around to the valet. A minor nuisance, admittedly, but something that should be noted. Still, all in all, I would stay there again anytime.

<Content>trolly car bells ALL THE TIME! The hotel is under renovations and the lobby is of no use. The check in is practically done in a closet. We stayed on the top floor facing the bay but right above the trolly cars with the 'at first' lovely clanging-- the longer that went on the more annoying that was, and then the car honking. Not very restful soundwise, but the bed was really lovely and soft.

<Content>High on the hill! Really enjoyed our stay at the Stanford Court. The hotel is right at the top of Nob Hill - going down is easy coming back is a killer!We purchased a 3 day ticket from the hotel for the 'muni' transport so were able to use the trams, cable cars and buses so getting around was made easier. The room was very clean but did seem small as we had just come back from large rooms in San Fransisco and Hawaii. The decor was lovely as the room had been recently renovated. There were tea/coffee making facilities, air conditioning and a huge TV. The beds were turned back every evening and a chocolate and bottle of water left in the room for our use. The radio was also turned on which made the room seem very comfortable to come back too. We did not have much to do with the front desk so I can't really comment on this. The doormen were very pleasant and happy to have a chat everytime we came in and out. There is a free internet /computer in the foyer which is for everyone's use but they do ask that you restrict the usage time to 10 minutes which seemed reasonable.It would have been nice to see more of the hotel but with all of the renovations being carried out this was impossible. Be prepared to wait a long time to for the cable cars as obviously everyone wants/needs to use them. Use the 'muni' transport to go to the Golden Bridge then take a walk across - very invigorating!If you want to visit Alcatraz you MUST book before going, we were really dissapointed to find that all the tickets had gone until at least a week after we left. We had to make do with a boat trip around the island which wasn't quite the same.

<Content>small room with a terrible view The rooms have been recently renovated. However the room I had was very small with no closet or dresser space. There was a place to hang your clothes in the bathroom! View looked onto a courtyard that was very depressing. A large flag blocked the light into the room with a strobe effect in the late afternoon. I slipped and fell in the bath tub taking a shower and was unable to get a bath mat. The staff seemed nice but I had little interaction with them. I was there for a meeting. Facilities were adequate.I do like Marriott and stay at Marriott when I can. I am afraid if this is what they are aiming their renovations at in this property they have missed the mark. I would stay elsewhere if I was to return for a conference.

<Content>Comfortable at Stanford Court I booked three rooms for three nights for our family get-together in San Fransciso. Everyone really enjoyed comfy, clean rooms and the price was very reasonable on Priceline. All three rooms were newly renovated on the upper floors! Free champagn in the Lobby on Thursday evening welcomed us to the hotel - very nice. The concierge was fabulous! We had trouble getting reservations to The Slanted Door - a restaurant that was highly recommended to us. The concierge was able to book our reservations like magic. The concierge continued to be our best friend throughout the weekend. The hotel is undergoing renovations but we were only disturbed by noise on late Friday afternoon. Everything was quiet over the weekend. This is a nice location with easy access to public transportation. The trolleys were very crowded most of the time but well worth the wait to back to the hotel...as it's a very steep walk from almost any direction! We had breakfast at the hotel one morning and it was pleasant and delicious - although the service was a bit slow. We did have difficulty keeping ice in the room with no ice machine available. Room service would bring ice - but it usually took awhile. We took the hotel limo to SFO airport for a very reasonable price. Overall a very nice weekend!

<Content>Renovations were bothersome, but beautiful We stayed here for 4 nights with our two sons. The staff is very professional and usually friendly and helpful. The layout of the hotel is a little strange and it was undergoing extensive renovations, so I'm not sure we saw it all. The lobby (not check-in) seems out of the way, so you never think of enjoying it. Not really sure what was there--the hotel didn't seem to have a lounge or bar. It did have a restaurant, but again it was out-of-the-way so you don't think about patronizing it. I never even saw it, so I can't comment on it.The concierge here is very helpful always ready with dinner recommendations, help with reservations, and even arranged for our rental car to be returned for us.Our room was on the fifth floor with city views. It was beautifully decorated and newly refurbished. The beds were extremely comfortable and triple-sheeted. There was a nice, large flat screen television. The room was very quiet, except during the day when there was the noise of construction. It wasn't horrible, but could be heard. It was also very clean. There were nice robes for after showering.On the downside: the room was quite small. One of our double beds was pushed up against the wall, so whoever slept there (me!) had to crawl over the other person. The bathroom was also quite small, especially the vanity area. The toilet and shower were separate from the vanity, which was nice. The room did not have a mini-bar or a dresser. Since the room was small, we had suitcases every where.Our boys had room service several times as my husband were going out for dinner. The service was quick (20 minutes or so) and the food was very good and excellently transported. For example, the milks and ice cream were kept on ice to keep them cold. The staff was friendly. Of course, it was very expensive. We paid about $40 dollars every night for a small pepperoni pizza, pbJ, 2 milks, and two cookies by the time we paid the already high-cost of the food, delivery fee, and gratuity. Food in San Francisco is very expensive in general, and the convenience was nice and allowed my husband and me to get ready for a night out and gave our kids a treat of room service in front of the TV.The hotel is located at the top of Nob Hill and at the intersection of two cable car lines. It is only three blocks from China Town and close to a nice shopping district. There are some beautiful views. Walking in San Francisco and especially this area is quite a workout! The hills are very steep and it is straight up hill to the Stanford Court from every direction! As I said, two cable car lines stop in front of the hotel, which is nice, but they can be extremely crowded and you may need to be aggressive if you have stood at the cable car stop for awhile only to be pushed out of the way by others running for the car as it stops.This was a nice hotel, located in a pretty and historical area. Nob Hill was the center of old San Francisco wealth in the early 20th century. It is close to some interesting sites (but not Fisherman's Wharf although the cable cars take you directly there.) I'm not sure I would chose this hotel again, though, if I were to return to San Francisco.

<Content>"Less than Stellar" I really expected more as we had stayed in the property 4 years ago and found it to be delightful. What were the problems: 1) I booked the room and made note of the fact that we were getting married while staying there. Hotel did not acknowledge this in any way. I didn't expect a lot but at least some recognition of the event. 2) In fact the room we received was on the top floor and the furthest possible from the elevators (literally as I checked the layout of the hotel). 3) Lobby and other common areas closed during our stay. Not much they could do about this but I would have liked to have known before booking room. 4) No ice machines on floors. If you want ice you have to ring the front desk (which was an experience in itself as there was nothing on the phones telling you who to call other than the valet or concierge. When you called these numbers you would more often than not get voice mail. So you leave a voice mail to get ice? Not a good set up. 5) Room was really small. I am used to that in large cities (Chicago, New York etc.) but you had to move the ottoman at night and block the door so that you could get to the bathroom. 6) Coffee in lobby not out until 6:30 or 7:00 in the mornings (coming from the central time zone this was way too late). 7) Rooms are recently refurbished in the style of a W hotel and very hip but not to my liking (ok this is a personal taste matter. But the rooms previously seemd much more elegant.) Overall the location is nice at the top of Nob Hill but I don't think I would stay here again. And ignoring our wedding date is really inexcusable.

<Content>Right in the middle of everything We stayed here last Tuesday, the last night our a weeklong trip to Northern CA. I thought the hotel looked very nice and there was a table of champagne in the lobby when we walked in. Nice touch. The rooms were clean and the bed comfortable. Two things that stood out. The a/c did not work. We like our rooms cold but the room didn't get hot so it didn't turn out to be a big deal. The biggest downer was they put us in room 161 or 261 (I forget) which is the first room right next to the stairwell and two doors from the health club door. Well, I guess there are renovations going on and some workers started clammering right below us around 5am and they kept using the stairwell to come to our floor and I swear they slammed their feet on the stairs as loudly as they could and the stairwell door kept opening and closing. After putting up with this for a half hour I called the front desk and management said they'd look into it. Nothing. I called again a half hour later a little more impatient and the manager then admitted what was going on and offered to take care of us. He apologized and gave me 5000 Marriott points and had breakfast sent to our room. We really only lost 2-3 hours of sleep so I appreciated what he did. All in all I'd recommend the hotel as renovations do happen and management stepped to the plate. Just make sure you don't get the room we had because even people going to work out in the morning you can hear opening and shutting the door. Also, it is right on two cable car lines so you can get a car quick and easy.

<Content>Nice Rooms, but lacked common ammendities Nice remodeled rooms, but very small and confined. No coffee pot to make tea/coffee; therefore, you have to order hot water from room service. I ordered hot water, after 3 phone calls and a visit to the front desk, it was finally delivered (35 min). The front desk lacks experience  creditability. I was surprised to find this upscale hotel has no hot tub or swimming pool. I travel often and was disappointed to find that the owners couldn't find the space for at least a hot tub.The superior Nob Hill address makes this a great location...close to Union Square and China Town. Rooms and common areas are very clean. Rooms are well insulated and quiet. Parking attendents are very helpful and relaxed, which; in turn, helps guests relax.

<Content>Nob Hill Star We really enjoyed our stay at the Stanford Court. Even though many public areas are currently being renovated (places like the lobby and lounge areas) they are totally shielded from the guests and work went on unobtrusively. The staff was courteous and friendly, going out of their way to add the extra touches that made it stand out. On returning from a day exploring the city, I collapsed on a bench in the make-shift lobby to wait while my husband talked to the desk clerk. A bellman happened by, noticed my exhaustion and offered a most welcome bottle of water. The concierges were knowledgeable, patient and friendly.One quibble with this and other high-end hotels: why charge for internet access?????? To be fair, there was a free computer in the lobby for printing boarding passes, but in-room hookups were part of a business package that included local phone calls and wi-fi. Sorry - but that's just rubs me the wrong way.We had one of the renovated rooms and appreciated the amenities and nice new decor. We enjoyed using the hotel dining room for breakfast - a bit pricey but a nice way to start the day. (Try the salmon hash or the lemon souffle pancakes!)Located at the junction of all the cable car lines, it was easy to get around town without a car - which would be nothing but an expensive nuisance if all your exploration was within the city limits. We got a 3-day muni pass at the airport ($18) and used that for all surface transportation. We did take cabs to dinner, but even so - with hotel parking at almost $50/day (plus tips!!) it was much more economical than having a rental car (not to mention the horror of finding/paying for parking at the local attractions).This was our first visit to San Francisco and the Stanford Court and its staff helped make some wonderful memories.

<Content>Was a good stay I stayed at the Renaissance Stanford Court for two nights. Walked up from the Powell St BART station, which I would only recommend if you are in decent shape, as it is steep!Obtained the room from Priceline, so I wasn't expecting a great room with a view, but I was pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness of the public spaces and my room. Comfortable bed, clean washroom, with all of the amenities. The free Starbucks coffee in the lobby in the mornings was nice. Accommodating staff members were helpful. They have a computer terminal in the lobby that is to be used to print out your boarding pass if you check-in to your flight online - quite helpful!One thing that bothered me was that, in contrast to every other hotel I've ever been in, they don't slip your final bill under the door - they leave it outside your door. Although this bill doesn't specify your credit card number, it does specify your FULL NAME! This is a definite privacy breach and should be fixed.I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Super location in the heart of town I just got back from a four day trip to San Francisco for business. I was pleasantly surprised by the wonderful service and great location of this hotel. From the time we got there, the service was super. I needed an extra chair for my room so my colleague and I could work on a project, it was brought to me within 10 minutes. The breakfast was served with a refreshing fruit smoothie taster and we were sent on our way for the day with a granola bar. When we arrived back at the hotel at the end of a long work day, we were greeted with a glass of cold champagne. I had some trouble with the internet and it was immediately removed from my bill. We rarely had to wait for a taxi as the valet fetched one as soon as we asked for it. The turndown service with bottled water and chocolates was also a welcome touch. The location is so central, you could walk or cable car wherever you needed to go. I would definitely stay here again!

<Content>Good Find / Great Deal The Stanford Court is perfectly located directly on the cable car route between Market Street, North Beach, Fisherman's Wharf, whatever you need. The Top of the Mark club is virtually next door, and my wife and I loved the the cheesy yet playful Tonga Room across the street. The staff was more than accommodating and they never failed to go above the call of duty. The lobby is under reconstruction as this is written, and hopefully, the rooms will be updated as well. All in all, we will definitely stay here on our next visit.

<Content>Posh piece of Nob Hill I love this hotel..It's regal, five star , posh ambience is surprisingly wonderful. It is located perfectly on top of nob hill amongst the other wonderful hotels... just minutes down the hill to china town, union square.... and if you love your walk, you could even reach fisherman's wharf in no time at all!The room was fabulous! Extremely large considering it is in a city like SF... the furniture was absolutely classy! Yup, this place is class all the way.. I absolutely love the retro elegance of the bathroom.... One complain is that it is dificult to get hold of concierge as he is always busy. Other than that, this is a wonderful classic 5 star hotel... great if you would like to indulge yourself!!

<Content>A San Francisco Classic I've stayed at the Stanford Court 3 times in the past 10 years, most recently in February 2008. The hotel perches atop Nob Hill, next door to the famed Fairmont. Rooms are comfortable and the staff is tremendously accommodating. The location is midway between Union Square, the San Francisco financial district and the waterfront area. Chinatown is a few blocks away and the Powell Street cable car line is steps from the front door.At the time of my February 2008 visit, the Stanford Court was undergoing renovation, scheduled for completion in Summer 2008. The renovation will be welcome, because furnishings have grown a bit dated and changes are needed to return the property to peak condition. As a result, my usual 5 star review has been downgraded to 4 stars, with the expectation that the renovation will give the hotel its usual 5 when complete.The Stanford Court is quiet and dignified-- great for business and leisure travelers who want a classic property that offers a comfotable stay with understated elegance and hospitality. Here is hoping that the 2008 renovation will add to the luster of the Stanford Court-- from the plans posted for guests, this seems likely to be the case.

<Author>Marriott_Devotee
<Content>Updating "a classic" -- very nicely done Booked via Marriott.com and got a price quite a bit lower than the super-luxe hotels in the Financial District and/or the high-end tourist hotels on Russian Hill or Union Square. Interestingly, the location of the Stanford Court is just as good, as it is essentially within a 5~10 minute walk of all of these points!.This is an older building, built around a courtyard, without the 40 stories that offer spectacular views of the Bay or Telegraph Hill, but it is 2nd to none regarding location, appointments, convenience and service. Biggest test in these older buildings are the bathrooms and the corner areas -- bottom line, they passed. The property has been nicely updated and all the modern amenities are in place. .In very few cases, I say this, but I would DEFINITELY seek and attempt to stay in the Stanford Court on my next trip to San Francisco. . Granted, the property is still a bit challenged by the history (this can be a plus, if one likes that sort of thing) so there isn't a super-sleek multi-story lobby, or a chi-chi destination restaurant or bar. (they happen to be just outside less than 2 blocks away!). In my too-brief 14 hour stay, I also experienced EXCELLENT service by a staff that obviously gives a hoot about the comfort of its guests. Several above  beyonds that made my too-brief 14 hour stay quite comfortable and leaves me wanting more. Great value for a perfectly located hotel that does not disappoint.

<Content>Great hotel, and good location to explore. We stayed here for 4 nights as part of our trip away to get married. So you can imagine, I wanted everything to be just right for our special trip! I spent ages researching on Trip Advisor, to decide which hotel to stay in for our special time away. The hotel didn't dissapoint at all........Public areas: Clean, tidy  spacious. Room: Clean, comfy bed, nice bathroom, big wardrobe  never heard any noise from other guests. View was OK, nothing special but we never asked for any particular view. Location: I don't think it could have been better, excellent for the Cable Cars - (Powell/Mason, Powell/Hyde Cable cars stop right outside the hotel). You could walk down to the Pier 39/Fishermans Wharf area in 10 minutes - then get the Cable car back up. A good restaurant in that area for a lovely breakfast /lunch is the Eagle Cafe. We did try to get into Mamas on Washington Square twice, but the queue was too long and we were too hungry - we went twice to the Eagle Cafe as it was so nice, with little waiting time. Also, you can walk to Union Square too, again roughly 10 minutes. However, if you do want to be in the bustle of it all, it is located that bit further out of the tourist areas. We wanted to be a little bit away from the tourist areas, so we were very happy with its location. Staff: Friendly at all times, concierge very helpful with restaurant bookings and directions. Alfreds Steakhouse was very nice for our last night - what a steak! Overall, a well kept hotel, with good staff in a great location. If I was returning to San Francisco, I would stay in this hotel again without any hesitation. One thing I would recommend for you to do, and this isn't hotel related - if your heart is set on visiting Alcatraz, book it before you leave. We were lucky that we were there for 4 nights, we went down to the Alcatraz tour area on our first day, and it was booked up for two days, luckily we managed to go on our last day on the day tour. I couldn't believe how booked up it was when we got there, even the next available Night Tour was a week away! Also, allow enough time for the Alcatraz visit we were there for hours, and thought we would be in and out within the hour.

<Content>Loved the Standford Court! We arrived from Tahoe, the valet and bell hop were courteous and swift with handling our items and moving us to check-in where the clerk was kind and friendly. We requested a quiet room and had no trouble receiving it. We were very happy with our stay, the staff and room service. We would stay here again in an instant. It is Old San Francisco, located at Nob Hill, near Grace Cathedral.

<Content>Not as good as expected from a Marriott My wife and I stayed at the hotel in late November 2007. A great location for the cable cars and easy to get around. The way the pound is against the dollar the rate was very good but the hotel is just worn out. Our bedroom was a suite with a large sitting room. BUT the TV had been removed and a hole just left. The furniture was tired. I was bitterly disappointed

<Content>A decent hotel at a fair price My girlfriend and I stayed at the Stanford Court December 27th and 28th. It is a nice hotel that is situated next to the cable trolly system on Powell street. The trolly will take you to Market Street to shop in one direction or take you thru China town to the Wharf in the other. If you plan on using public transportation frequently I would get a MUNI pass from the hotel gift shop (about $11.00 a person). When the trolly was too full we also used bus 30 on Stockton street to get us to the Wharf(Stockton street runs parallel with powell). I would recommend studying a map of downtown San Francisco before hitting the streets. Here is a quick read about the history of Nob Hill: [--]  The hotel restaraunt has a pretty good dinner and the breakfasts are nice too but a bit pricey. We did not have a car so I cannot comment on the parking however, as others have stated parking is expensive. We would have liked to have a room with a view of the city but instead we were given one with a view of the courtyard. Overall this was not a huge minus as we did not plan to spend too much time in our room.   Overall, I would say if you can get a decent rate under $200.00 I would recommend this hotel. However, if you have to pay a premium I would shop around.

<Content>Truly Crappy in every way! What a disappointment. I just can't believe they feel justified charging the prices they do! We would have been just as well off at the Best Western for a much more fair price. To start, there is virtually no parking around, so you have to buy the hotel parking at $41 per day! And it takes about half an hour for the valet to retrieve your car when requested - even though their lot is just a block away!When we checked in, the staff was about the rudest I've ever dealt with. Throughout our stay, every one of them acted as if our speaking to them was offensive. They were unhelpful, abrupt, unfriendly, and not one ever smiled at us or went to even the slightest effort to make us feel that the hotel appreciated our business. It was as if we were inconveniencing them. The room was on the verge of unacceptable. It was just barely clean. It looked as if nobody had vacuumed around the furniture or base boards in a few months, the shower had mildew build up along the grout lines, the towel warmer was broken, there were stains on the walls, carpet and doors, and everything just looked dingy, dinged up, and poorly cared for. Even the common areas, like hallways and elevators were unclean, dinged or scuffed, and poorly kept up.The furniture and decor was quite old and unattractive. It appeared to be last updated in the late 70's or early 80's. The TV is old and crappy with very poor reception. There isn't even a DVD player available! Although, the comforter and duvet did appear to be fairly new and fresh. There were some toiletries provided in the bathroom along with a coffee maker and a couple packets of coffee grounds. The first morning, I went to use some of the mouthwash, only to find that the seal was already broken! Did they refill the previous guests bottle of mouthwash?! Don't they check to see if they've been used between guests?! Gross. We tried to have some coffee too, but it was just revolting.So, now that you've paid a totally unreasonable price for a crappy room and someone to park our car a half an hour away, be prepared to shell out for internet access and breakfast. I just can't believe that a nice place like this doesn't offer some sort of complimentary continental breakfast! They have a little card in the room you can leave out on your door handle to order breakfast to be delivered in the morning. But, it's $16 for a basic continental breakfast of a pastry and coffee! We walked down the street to a local coffee shop for coffee, juice and a bagel sandwich for less than $5. And, you'd think everyone offers free WiFi these days, right? Not so at the Stanford Court. You have to pay $10 per day! And if you want to just use the business center to check your e-mail real quick - better get out your wallet for that too!We had ordered a room with two double beds, but were give one queen. So, we requested a roll away bed and some extra bedding. No luck. They were out! So, I asked for some extra bedding so one of us could sleep on the floor. Nope, none of those either. Finally after throwing a fit, the manager agreed to pull just a comforter off the bed of a vacant room. There are feather beds on the mattresses, so we pulled that off the queen and used it for a mattress on the floor. Luckily there was an extra pillow in the room. The next night I tried again to request a roll away. This time we were in luck, and it was delivered while we were out during the day.I would never stay here again. I would never recommend it, unless the only other option was some roach infested dive in the wrong part of town. San Francisco is so full of perfectly lovely hotels that are worth their expense, there is no reason to shell out a wad of cash for this truly crappy hotel. It is just such a disappointment.

<Content>a little disappointed My boyfriend and I stayed at this property the end of December and we were a bit disappointed in the Stanford Court. Unfortunately we had reservations at another hotel located near Union Square for the same arrival date but decided to try out the Stanford Court at Nob Hill. The rate we received was a fabulous rate but as a travel agent, I was somewhat disappointed at the condition of the room and the very small size of our room. In the bathroom there was quite a bit of mold/mildew in the shower, which as a Renassiance property, I would never expect to see that. Also, our food tray was still in the hallway that we left outside our door earlier that morning and ten hours later it was still sitting there when we returned to our room. The coffee pot in the room can only make one cup of coffee at a time so for two people, it takes too much time to make coffee. We were not told at checkin that complimentary coffee is available in the lobby until 11AM.Also, Parking at the property is VERY expensive. We werelucky to find a public parking garage several blocks away that was a lot cheaper but involved quite a walk to and from the property.We later stayed at another hotel at Union Square for New Years Eve and was much happier.....felt less secluded and more available shops and restaurants in the Union Square area.

<Content>Very nice accomidations ..... but older. Renaissance Stanford Court is a high end hotel in Nob Hill. Overall it is very nice, staff is friendly and accomidating and it has a fancy feel to it as whole. Room service was excellent as was the food in the restaurant. Room was very comfortable but older. Television had problems while I was there but that may have been due to a satellite problem.Overall I would recommend!

<Content>Very good hotel indeed We stayed at the Stanford Court for 9 nights over Thanksgiving. This is a very good hotel indeed. It shares Nob Hill with three other grand hotels and it holds its corner very well indeed. We were on the 3rd floor overlooking the courtyard which was excellent as its was peacefully quite. We requested a twin room which we got (with 2 queen size beds). The room was spotless and was cleaned meticulously every day. The bathroom was pristine and the beds were exceptionally confortable. Personally I cannot understand some of the less flattering reviews about this hotel, we have no complaints at all. The staff were friendly and helpful. The elevators worked well and the reception staff were both helpful and friendly. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the glorious city of San Francisco

<Content>Fantastic Stay and Fantastic City We stayed here for 5 nights at the beginning of November. It was a fantastic hotel - great location in one of the posher areas of San Francisco. It was a 10 min max walk downhill to Union Square and you can get the Cable Car back up for $5 - but we mostly walked this as it is manageable.San Fran is a great city. Must dos are going to the Cheesecake Factory to eat at the top of Macy's. Great views and gorgeous food. We took two bus tours of the city also - one for the downtown area and the other over the Golden Gate Bridge. My advice is to book Alcatraz before you come out as it gets booked up really quickly - they only let a relatively small number over everyday - but it means it's not at all crowded when you're over there. Book the Early Bird Tour. It's a fascinating, eerie place to walk around and you can stay on the island as long as you want once you're out there.If you want to go out for the evening, we had a great night out in Little Italy. Some fab italian restaurants and bars. Everyone is really friendly and we met some great people - including some Virgin Atlantic Crew who were also staying at the Stanford Court whilst in San Fran!Would definitely stay there again and recommend it to anyone. The beds were so comfy and our room was at the back so it was very quiet. The breakfast was very expensive so we always ate out - there's Lori's Diner 2 blocks away, so that was never a problem. The room was massive (2 double beds) but I agree that the bathroom was a little dated - everything in working order though.If you're wondering whether or not to go to San Fran - do it! It's a wonderful place - great shops, lovely restaurants and friendly people.

<Content>Lovely hotel with friendly staff I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights last week. I stayed in a room with2 queen beds. The room was really roomy with plenty of light. The location is great at the top of Nob Hill (California and Powell).The intersection of 3 cable car lines it takes you to Fishermans Wharfin 15 mins or union Square in 4 mins. Walkable down to Union St but would recommend getting car back up. The third cable line takes you toChina Town.The hotel is very nice indeed with a nice courtyard. The door staff/bell persons are super friendly and courteous. Free complimentary town car in the mornings to the financial district. use of the car forthe same price as a cab if availble.The reception staff and concierge are helpful and make the hotel. Eventhe gift shop staff are lovely.i would recommend this hotel for a good base to see San Francisco.

<Content>Loved this hotel The Stanford Court is a beautiful hotel at the top of Nob Hill. Our room was very nice and the beds are wonderful!! They provide turn downservice, robes and heated towel racks. One thing that they also have is air conditioning. When we return to San Francisco this will be our hotel of choice. I would only change one thing and that would be a more reasonable priced breakfast.

<Content>Enjoyed the hotel Me and my boyfriend stayed at this hotel the last weekend of October 07. The room was clean, comfortable and the service was excellent. I didn't care for the bathrooms as I felt they were dated and I expected to have it a garden tub.We stayed in room 335 which had a partial bay view and an excellent view of the city. The hotel is in a great location which is central to lots of attractions and also in a beautiful neighborhood.The parking is overpiced at $41 a day but in SF I guess that's to be expected. We ordered room service twice and our orders were promptly delivered.I got the hotel for $107 night on Priceline so I really can't complain at all although if I had paid full price I would've been dissapointed. Although the hotel was nice the decor and bathrooms seemed a little dated. I would never pay full price of $300+ a night to stay here as there are many better choices for that price range but if you can get a deal it's definitely worth it!

<Content>Negatives outweigh the positives My wife and I stayed at the Stanford Court with two other couples for three nights prior to a week's visit to the wine country in northern California. On balance, although the hotel does have some positive features, our collective opinion was that the negatives outweighed the positives.On the positive side: great location on Nob Hill just a half block from the intersection of three cable car lines. The staff is friendly, professional and helpful. The public areas and Fournou's Oven (the restaurant) are attractive and comfortable.The guest rooms were quiet during our stay,although the hotel appeared to be full. But the negatives: all three of our rooms were TINY with no views whatsoever. My wife and I were using Marriott rewards points for our stay, but the other two couples were paying regular non-discounted rates, yet all three of us commented on these being perhaps the smallest hotel rooms we have stayed in in many years.The entrance to the hotel is not on the street, but set back in an attractive courtyard. Traffic was frequently congested in the courtyard and there were sometimes long waits for taxis although there were numerous free taxis passing by on the street outside of the courtyard.TV reception was barely adequate on old TV sets in our rooms. There is no free internet connectivity, although there is an option to purchase a high speed (not really) connection through the iBahn system in the room for $9.95 per day. Like all Marriott properties, this is a totally non-smoking facility. One may view this as either a plus or a minus, but smokers are relegated to a dark corner of the courtyard where a few ashtrays and seats are provided.On balance, especially because of the tiny rooms, we would not stay here again on our future visits to the San Francisco area.

<Content>Loved the Stanford Court but one major problem Spent 4 nights just recently at the Stanford Court and loved it...it is old-fashioned, charming, kind of European Old World. The staff was very nice, breakfast excellent ( a little pricey), quiet room and best of all, a view of the bay. Definitely worth the slight extra charge for the view. Poor tv reception on an old fashioned TV. Very low tech hotel which leads to the major issue: the $9.95 charge for the internet connection in the room seems ridiculous (especially for Marriott Reward Silver level member) and there is NO wireless in the room. This means that only one person can be online at a time. If you go to the lobby to use the wireless there, there is another very steep charge, even though you are already paying the $9.95 daily charge in your room.Travellers should be aware of this if internet access is important to them.

<Content>Looking forward to the next visit! We stayed at the Stanford Court, for 5 nights in August. The first of the three centred holiday (moving on to Vegas and then Longbeach, LA). We had a fabulaous welcome at the hotel - nothing was too much trouble. Our room was situated on the 4th floor / corner room. It was spacious, comfortable (especially the beds), and clean, with pretty good views. It was rated by our travel agent as a 4*, which seems a pretty fair reflection. The breakfast buffet was the only thing to let the hotel down. But we'd highly recommend ordering from the breakfast menu, which was slightly more costly, but everything is made to order. The lemon souffle pancakes with raspberries were fantastic! We found the location of the hotel to be very convenient, especially as the cable car line runs directly outside the entrance. The most economical way to travel, is to buy a MUNI passport (which can be bought at the information desk at the airport - $24 per person, for a 1 week pass). When you add up the cost of every 'single' trip cable car ticket costing $5, the passport was exceptional value. It can be used without limit on ANY of the Muni transport around the city i.e. - cable cars/ electric trams/ trolley buses/  'bendy' buses. We found these passports invaluable, and we hardly used taxis nor the hotel limo service, (which is provided on a first come first serve basis). Despite public transport being very accessible, if you've never been to the city before, be prepared to do a lot of walking (so comfortable, flat shoes are a must). We loved the city, and plan to go back one day, and would stay in the Stanford Court once again, without hesitation.

<Content>Not 5 stars we stayed here on the second leg of our honeymoon from august 5th for one week. Our brochure stated that it is a 5* hotel - i would disagree with this, the recption was nice but the corridors were dull and in need of sprucing up. our room was ok, but the shower was too low on the wall to use properly and it cannot be moved. the bathroom was grubby too and badly lit. We were not impressed with the cleaners service either. No fridge in room. Bed and pillows gave us really bad neck and back ache.The bar prices were high and the food was extremley high priced so we never tried it. it was quite difficult to find places to eat close to the hotel. Mainly we went to fishermans wharf or union square. the westin st francis is better. location good for cable cars but not much else close by.

<Content>Great place to stay We loved this place, the staff were great, the beds were soooo comfortable and the location was perfect, Rochelle in reception was smashing, so helpful with great tips for getting the best out of your time in san francisco, forget the car as you can get anywhere by trolley bus or tramcar even golden gate bridge with just one change 30 from stockton street and change to 28 at laguna street which stops at the bridge car park with an $18 3 day pass you cannot go wrong, loved the time spent there.

We even dined at the hotel鈥檚 restaurant 鈥?go even if you鈥檙e not staying (only I forget what it was called). Lovely food, even better service 鈥?one of the chefs was talking to us over the counter lovely friendly chap and the wonderful older waiter gave suggestions for wines and food 鈥?we were being spoilt and loved it!

<Content>Great Choice, Great Hotel I have stayed at this hotel on three different occassions and it's one of my favorites in San Francisco. The most recent stay was for three nights in August, 2007.DECOR: This hotel is done in an understated traditional style with Asian influences and antiques. I really like the hotel's style. I disagree with other reviewers that this hotel is dated. I think of it as well preserved and in my opinion, in a very good and charming way. It's like going to my rich aunt's house in the 1960's. The furnishings are, at first glance, not remarkable. Upon further inspection, however, you're forced to admit that while not flashy, everything is tastefully done and of high quality. ROOM: I had deluxe bay view room one night and an executive king room the last two nights. Both rooms were wonderful. I'm not sure I'd pay the additional cost for the executive king, though. It did have a very comfortable couch, however. I love the featherbeds placed over the mattress - - great sleeping and lounging. Oh, the down pillows and duvet were very comfortable. I like the color scheme: teal carpet, cream walls, blue upholstery, crystal lamps, floral drapes, and Asian accents. My room was spacious, quiet, clean, and comfortable. I also liked the marble bathroom. It had a large vanity and closet. The airconditioning worked very well and kept my room comfortable.SERVICE: Very good. Staff here is not as friendly as some of the other hotels I stay at, but they're never rude and are always helpful.FITNESS CENTER: The hotel has a nice fitness center with great equipment. Most of the machines have individual TVs on them although I don't think headphones are provided - - so bring your own.LOCATION: Wonderful location atop Nob Hill. Your within easy walking distance to Union Square, China Town, North Beach, and Russian Hill. The location affords some rooms outstanding views of downtown, Coit Tower, and the bay.VALUE: All-in-all, I think this hotel provides one of the best values in S.F. It's affordable luxury. I love this hotel and highly recommend it.

<Content>only ok This hotel was the last leg of our honeymoon...we had been in vegas, monterey and los angeles and stayed in great hotels in each so we were confident that the stanford court would be great too. but we were wrong. i was not crazy about the location...though it is close to china town it is not close to anything else. the room they gave us first was a queen (after we had asked for a king) and was TINY and faced the dumpster on the street. because there is no AC we slept with the windows open. the crazy loud noise from the construction going on outside at 7 am woke us up. i looked out the window and there were literally people working 6 feet away from me. it seemed to me to be mindblowing that theyd give people a room directly next to a dumpster/garbage facility. thankfully, because we had asked for a king they switched our room that afternoon and our next room was somewhat larger and faced the courtyard. it was definitely outdated in decor and the bathroom was the size of a shoebox but that is par for the course, i guess, in big cities. another annoying thing about the hotel is that they charge $40 a night to park your car. i am from nyc so i know how crazy parking prices can be, but $40 is exorbitant. so stay somewhere else, somewhere closer to the water and the action.

<Content>Nightmare for group travel I organized a group to stay at the Marriott Renaissance hotel. I realized that we had specific needs and contacted the manager directly to make sure that I received 2 rooms next to each other. Since we were also on a time schedule I also asked if it could be noted that our rooms needed to be ready upon the guranteed check-in time. When I arrived with my guests the rooms were not ready for another 2 hours after the guaranteed check-in time. To make matters worse, the hotel had no record of my arrangement that the reservation manager had made. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone who is arranging a group business trip or conference. The rooms were small and the service was not helpful.

<Content>Great location  I booked this hotel through Priceline and was able to get a room at $80/night, which was a real steal. The hotel is at the top of a very steep hill, but it is in an excellent neighbourhood and is very accessible to Union Square and other major destinations.The rooms themselves are slightly outdated in decor, but certainly very clean and spacious. The beds are extremely comfortable, the windows open for fresh air, and the air conditioning also worked very well and quietly. In terms of the room quality, I would give this about a 4/5. However, the SERVICE is what prompted me to give this hotel a 5/5.The service at the front desk was effecient, polite, and very accommodating (despite my complicated requests). The maid service was invisible, and the room service never took more than 30 minutes to arrive, even on a busy Friday/Saturday night. The doormen were always on hand to open taxi doors and the front door and they did so with a smile. The only hidden charge for me was a 0.10/day Tourist Tax that I paid at the end of the stay. Despite having booked on Priceline at a much lower than regular rate, I felt that I was treated just as well as the full paying customers.I would definitely stay at this hotel again, especially if I could get the same deal from Priceline.

<Content>Great Classic SF Hotel I pricelined my reservation for a rate of $70, which was a steal. This is the second time I stayed at this hotel, and I was glad to stay there again. The location is great--right in the heart of Nob Hill. If you are interested in riding the cable cars, two lines run right outside the front of the hotel. If you are a runner like me, you will be rewarded with a nice downhill run to the Bay and challenged with a tough uphill run back to the hotel. Take Jones street for a real workout... The decor is old/classic style. The rooms are fairly spacious. But the beds are OUTSTANDING. The beds have down pillows, featherbeds, and down comforters that are way better than Westin Heavenly beds. The bathrooms have marble vanities.Insider tip: Make sure you place a wake-up call (whether you need one or not). All wake-up calls receive a pot of coffee, hot chocolate, or tea delivered to your front door. Nice touch.

<Content>Lovely neighborhood We stayed at the Stanford Court for one night using Marriott points. It is extremely convenient to events at the Masonic Auditorium - only about two blocks away. The neighborhood consists primarily of upscale hotels, residences and private clubs and is very quiet and nice compared to Chinatown and Union Square, which are several blocks away. The only problem is that there are not a lot of restaurants, except for hotel restaurants (very pricey) in the area, especially if you are at all mobility impaired and cannot climb steep hills. The Nob Hill Cafe on Taylor is a nice, reasonably priced restaurant that is nearby. The hotel itself is fine - the room was pretty large, the bed was comfortable, check-in and check-out very easy, and there were always cabs available. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Perfect Stay I loved this hotel! It's charming and the front desk could not have been more professional and helpful, suggesting neighborhood restaurants and directions. I did bid a room through Price Line, but there was not a hint of negativity concerning that.We were given a corner room (321) which was clean, spacious and nicely appointed. The beds were comfortable, and while one of the windows faced the hill and cable car route, noise simply was not an issue. US Today paper at our door every morning, complimentary Wall Street Journals stacked in the lobby. The Starbucks and tea served in the lobby every morning outdid the coffee provided in the rooms (though that's always a nice option for the slow moving!)The walk up the hill (we took Powell) isn't terrible and there's a liquor store on the way up, as well as a very popular Uncle Vito's italian pizzeria that has free delivery ($10 min) though we just picked up a couple of excellent meatball sandwiches on the way.Overall, an excellent stay and highly recommended.

<Content>Not a bad place to stay We stayed here one night using Marriott points. The beds were extremely comfortable but the room was smaller than the one we stayed in New York. The hotel is very dated but it is an older hotel in San Fran so it's to be expected. The staff was very friendly and held our luggage for us after we checked out so we could further explore the city. It is convenient to the cable car line as well. We stayed on the west side of the hotel which is not recommended because the garbage pickup is on that side. Luckily it was a Sunday so we didnt have to worry about it. We were glad we were able to use points to stay here because the 40 dollar parking fee is ridiculous and the $9.95 a day for the internet. All in all, we would not stay here again unless we were able to use points but the beds were great!

<Content>They were so good to us We stayed at the Ren Stanford Court for our anniversary on Memorial Day weekend. We were delighted with our experience. They were so good to us! But first, the basic info. Location is great, on the corner of California and Powell, on top of Nob Hill. Around the corner from the Fairmont and next to Mark Hopkins. Easy (but steep) downhill walk to Union Square or Chinatown; take the cable car or taxi back up the hill. Cheapest parking I found was 2 blocks west at Masonic hall, $30 overnight (hotel parking was $40). Classic old building arranged around center courtyard. Our 8th floor room faced in to courtyard (lack of view, but quieter). Now for the nice touches: One of the most comfortable beds ever, complementary coffee, tea, and hot chocolate delivered to your door in the morning, and nicely furnished room. And they know who you are when you call the front desk! Good fitness room as well. Now for the over-the-top touches (and I don't know if they do this for everyone): Through normal conversation during the reservation and check-in process, they discovered that it was our anniversary, and as a result we received an upgrade to a larger room, and complementary dessert, and perhaps more importantly, a seemingly genuine effort to make our stay memorable and enjoyable. They made us want to come back, and recommend them to others.

<Content>dissapointing The hotel has a great location and a 5 star style lobby but our room was very small and only had a queen size bed. In addition, hte decor of the room was very simple and did not meet a 4* standard. We got a quiet room (by their definition) on the top floor, but we could still hear the cars and cable cars in the street. Overall - not recommended. We stayed the number before at Le Meridian which was 10 times better. We booked the hotel through Priceline ($80) so that might be a reason why we got a poor room.

<Content>Great Hotel! My husband and I spent two nights at the Stanford Court while on vacation in San Francisco and had a great time. We loved the location - within walking distance of both Union Square and Chinatown, and right on the cable car line. The staff was really friendly and helpful, and our room was comfortable and beautiful. We enjoyed the complimentary coffee in the morning, and the concierge had some great suggestions for what to see and how to get around easily in the city. The only thing I would say is bypass the restaurant, Fournou's Ovens. There are plenty of better restaurants in San Francisco.

<Content>Great Location The Stanford Court is in one of the best locations in the city - at the intersection of the 3 Cable Car lines. The hotel is spotless; maid service is very attentive; the coffee delivered with the wake-up call is a nice touch. The entire staff was not only professional but also friendly. A note of caution - ask for a room on the fourth floor or above on the Powell Street side, or the back of the hotel on the outside. Many rooms face a rather drab inner-courtyard. Some of the outside rooms also overlook the wall of The Mark Hopkins. The rooms are pleasant, although a tad dated. Overall, definately worth the cost. Walking distance to Chinatown.

<Content>Fabulous Location Overall the Stanford Court was a great hotel. We stayed in San Francisco two nights over the weekend. We are Marriott regulars so we choose the Stanford Court for the location and it had the best price compared to the other Marriott's in the city. Originally we thought we wanted to stay in the Fisherman's Wharf but after seeing the Wharf we were so glad to not be in the Wharf. It was too much of a tourist trap with too many people. The Stanford Court is centrally located to major transportation and tourist hotspots. I would stay in the hotel again but would spring for a room with a view. The view of the courtyard is the view of a roof. We were not in our room long enough to let it bother us but for just a few dollars more would have preferred the view of the city or the bay. Also noted the room was a little outdated and the air conditioner did not worth work a darn. The bed was fabulous. The doorman told us they have plans to redo the hotel which would be great.

<Content>Standard Hotel- Location, Location, Location Stayed here for a conference. Thank god we got a conference rate-- the location dictates the price, not the hotel itself. The bed was absolutely fabulous. Possibly the best bed I've ever had at a hotel. Nice linens, great down comforter.However, the hotel wasn't super swanky- just in a super central fantastic location.

<Content>Horrible, rude, smelly  I was travel to SF for business for a few days and vacation for the last few days. I had a few friends meet me up there and I was excited to stay at a hotel that I thought would live up to all the standards of a 4-star hotel.Room Quality - horribleWhen we arrived in on our floor, we were disappointed to find the hallways had a musty odor. We figured it was an older property, so we looked the other way until we arrived in our room only to find the same. The room smelled very musty and the carpets looked horrible. Our view of what they call a courtyard is a view of the roof with some astroturf looking material. The bathrooms were not the cleanest and very small. And if someone can tell me why they would even leave the 1970's TV in the already small bathroom, is beyond me. The room is very outdated, with what seemed to be Hawaiian headboard, flowery-printed drapery, and asian lamps and pictures on the wall. I've seen nicer rooms at college dorms. The beds were very uncomfortable and it seems that the mattresses were extremely old (perhaps purchased at the same time as the TV in the bathroom!). I shared a bed with my sister and the bed was so saggy that we ended up rolling into the middle of the bed - making for an unpleasant evening with a lovely backache to start off the day. They did have the feather-down comforter and pillow, but that can only do so much.Poor customer service - horribleWhen I arrived at check-in, no one even greeted us to check in. I had to ask the person at the front desk for some assistance. I received a $500 Marriott Travel Card for recognition from my employer. No one on the front desk staff new how to process this card. They then tried to call the number on the back of the card to verify that I really had a $500 balance on the card. There was woman who worked at the front desk who assisted me after the initial person didn't know what to do with the travel card. I can't remember her name but she had big glasses and short spiked grey hair. She seemed impatient not only with me, but with the front desk associate who originally assisted me. I mentioned to them both that I had received and used these travel cards in the past and how they were processed. They continued to tell me that's not what they do, and then told me I would need to surrender the travel card. My two nights stay would not total $500, so I questioned why I would need to give up my card that would still have a balance remaining after my stay. Again, the front desk staff didn't know how to handle this and instead tried to credit my room with $500. After my apparent frustration, they called the manager out and he wasn't quite sure how to handle it, but said if there was a credit balance, he would just credit one of my credit cards or send me a check in the mail. I knew this was probably not supposed to work that way, but had already stood at the front desk for 15 minutes and did not want to debate with them any longer. About 15 minutes after arriving in my room, I received a phone that I needed to come down to the front desk and pick up my travel card. I went back down, picked up my card. The next morning, the message light came on, and it was the front desk telling me they needed to see me because they didn't properly obtain a credit card at check in. This was all extremely frustrating as I tried to handle all of this when I originally checked in. I had 2 guests with me, and I can honestly say that we will never stay at this property and perhaps a Renaissance property again. I also called for a wake up call, and thought I would take advantage of the complimentary hot coffee and hot chocolate service that came with the wake up call. We received the complimentary beverages 30 minutes before the 9 a.m. wake-up call (only because my friend heard them through the paper-thin walls). When the beverages arrived, coffee and tea had been delivered. We had requested hot chocolate, so I called down to the front desk to inquire about this. They said they had me down for tea. I informed them I specifically asked for hot chocolate as I do not drink tea. Their exact words were in a very abrupt and rude voice, Well it says here you requested tea. I very politely informed her that I had requested hot chocolate and wanted to see if we could have some sent up. Her response to me was, You can't have this unless you request it the night before. I then told her that I had requested this the night before, that is how I received this service in the first place. She then sighed and said she would send some hot chocolate up. The concierge staff was rude and didn't even want to try and help us. I must say however, the driver with their complimentary car service was the only highlight of our stay.I definitely would stay far, far away from this property. Thank goodness I didn't really have to spend much time in my room during the day. It really is a depressing room. Its too bad, as I stay in Marriott properties at least 15 times a year. The location is great, but too much of a sacrifice in my mind.

<Content>Spectacular experience How sad that we almost changed our reservation based on some negative reviews on this site. The Stanford Court is a wonderful hotel. The staff could not have been more pleasant or helpful! The room was both clean and attractive. Our view of San Francisco included both the city and the bay. Having read that the rooms were small I was concerned due to my husband's height. While perhaps not the largest room we've ever stayed in not once did we feel cramped. The hotel reminded me of the European hotels we have stayed in before. The building is older, not your typical Marriott property, and in a lovely, historic district. The cable cars were readily available just outside the door of the hotel and taxis at the ready. So convenient to anything we could have wanted to do. Union Square and Chinatown close enough that even our arthritic and out of shape bodies did a lot of walking. I truly believe that the negative reviews of this hotel have a lot to do with the negative personalities of the reviewers. No, it's not the Ritz Carlton hence the much less expensive room rates. Enjoy the Stanford Court for what it is - an incredibly pleasant, very attractive,quite and relaxing home away from home. Don't rely on the negative reviews to keep you from the experience of being treated as though you are the only guest in the hotel. Read the positive and skip the negative. We will certainly return in the future!!

<Content>Good enough Went to SF to celebrate a birthday weekend with some friends - we had a room with two double beds. The room was spacious and beds were comfortable - feather beds I believe. We had a corner room on the 6th floor so we had a great view. The room was adequate but could use some updating - nothing too negative, but the furniture/decor looked a bit tired. The room and bathroom were clean. The lobby was very nice and bell staff were very helpful. The location is great - short walk to Union Square - but beware of the up hill hike back to the hotel. Overall we had a pleasant stay - did not eat at the hotel as too many good restaurants to sample in the city. I would stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Beautiful lobby, but the rooms need renovating My husband and I (both early 30s) stayed at the Stanford Court over New Year's weekend -- 12/30/06-1/2/07. The lobby was beautiful. Upon check-in we were told that a queen room was all that was available. Annoying since we had expected a king and booked our trip months prior through a travel agent, but the front desk attendant said that it was New Year's weekend and all the King rooms were taken (fine, but we made reservations too). In any case, we decided not to push the issue and went up to our room.... all I can say is my back still hurts! The room could definitely use a few modern touches and is begging for updated decor or renovation (the mattress had obviously seen better days). Our room faced the loading dock, so it wasn't the best view either. I'm happy to report that we spent very little time in our deluxe room with so much to see and do in San Francisco...The hotel  restaurant staff (we only ate breakfast at the hotel)were very friendly and helpful - especially the concierge.The hotel is located at the top of Nob Hill, so bring some comfy shoes for walking back up to the hotel (it's very steep) if you plan to walk, otherwise there are 3 cable car lines within a half block of the hotel.I wouldn't stay at the Stanford Court again, but we had a fantasic time in the city.

<Content>Good but needs a makeover This is a nice hotel in a great location that is close to downtown and chinatown. The service was good at check-in and the staff was very helpful. The room was obviously nice at some point but needed a major update, one of the staff told me that the hotel is going to be remodeled in the next year. The maid service was OK but seemed inconsistent in that they only turned my bed down once the week that I was there (even though I was out and the do not disturb sign was not up). Overall, this hotel is pretty good but should be great after a remodel.

<Content>Fantastic, perched on Nob Hill! After reading mixed reviews on here, i still wanted to experience this hotel first hand.I was not dissappointed at all.The location is GREAT. Now, although it is perched atop Nob Hill, Cable Cars run straight in front of the hotel. These take you to Fishermans Wharf, Powell Street (Nr Union Square) and into Chinatown. FANTASTIC!Althought they do get busy, especially at weekends, you don't have to wait long to get a ride. $11 gets you an all day ride on these, the trolleys and the buses. We bought a 7 day for $24 which is excellent value (a 1 way ride is $5!).Anyway - back to the hotel. Concierge very attentative and helpful, and always very polite. Check-in desk, quick and informative (just avoid checking in 2-3pm(ish) as all Virgin Atlantic crew stay here and take over!We had a city view room which looked towards the bay bridge area. Very clean, comfy bed, a little dated but I state CLEAN which matters the most to me.Room service food excellent value, and very quick.I was in San Fran to enjoy myself, and thanks to the Stamford Court, I did!

<Content>Old Fashioned but Very Nice.. My wife and I stayed here for 4 nights on our honeymoon before flying off to Hawaii. We found the hotel to be in the best possible location. For this alone I would have paid a bit more!!On arrival we were met at our limousine and escorted to the check in desk. The check in process was very nice and pleasant even after a 10hr flight. The desk staff were very polite and helpful. They all provided as much information as to what was available around and about the hotel and also advised on best modes of transport around the area. Excellent. The room decor was a bit dated but as you enter the hotel you kind of expect to be met with a room that befits the rest of the decor. Not surprised by this and not at all let down. We did not use the restaurant therefore we cannot comment on this but from the aromas coming from the general area of the restaurant we certainly should have. We did however utilise room service which arrived very quickly and was well presented.What i liked most about this hotel is the staff never once stood and waited for me to pass on gratuities. They were very quick to make an exit after carrying out their duties which i liked but still we never let them leave without passing a tip which always seemed to be taken with surprise and lots of thanks. Nice to see that some folk still appreciate it and don't just expect it...

<Content>Sickening Food I recently stayed at the Renaissance Stanford Court for a conference. I got food poisoning from an appetizer in the hotel bar, one colleague got food poisoning from the hotel restaurant, and yet another colleague's wife got sick from the hotel restaurant.The hotel itself has grand architecture and a nice location, but things like the food -- as well as the fact that the stairways are very few and nearly impossible to locate (making this place a firetrap and earthquake trap) -- really overshadow the edifice and decor.

<Content>Great Location What a great Hotel in a great city. My wife and I arrived from the East Coast at 11 am and the front desk found us a room that had already been cleaned and was ready. That was great to since we had been up so early and needed a place to freshen up. The location is convenient to Chinatown and Union Square, just a couple of blocks each way. The trolley line has a stop right beside the Hotel and that makes it easy to get to all the tourist spots. A newspaper and coffee or tea in the morning is waiting at your door. The Hotel is very clean and the staff was very accommodating. The room was a little outdated, but the very plush and comfortable bed more that made up for that one flaw.

<Content>Pleasant stay at the Stanford Court We arrived in San Francisco Thursday morning and took BART to the Powell station. We decided to bag the cab and just walk up Powell to the Stanford Court hotel - with our luggage. (Yes, I know it鈥檚 at the top of Nob Hill鈥?but I knew we鈥檇 be eating a lot of delicious food and welcomed the exercise)We booked our room about 2 months before our stay on Marriott鈥檚 web-site. They had a deal 鈥?Super Savvy Weekend rate for $159.00 and we stayed 4 nights. The Stanford Court is a nice, clean hotel with a very friendly staff. We arrived around 10:30AM and to my surprise, the room was ready. I鈥檓 Platinum with Marriott so we selected our arrival gift: Bottled water鈥?quite parched after the uphill trek) and brie/crackers 鈥?plus it came with a side of grapes 鈥?yum.The size of the room is a bit bigger than most San Francisco hotels (but many SF hotels have tiny rooms). The room was clean but very traditional, almost antique looking furniture but the room had everything we needed. A king bed with down comforters and pillow top, separate vanity from the bathroom with full length mirror, open closet next to the vanity/sink with bench. Our room was on the 8th floor with a partial city view. I noticed the walls in the room needed a fresh coat of paint but I could smell fresh paint in the hall-way and noticed they鈥檇 painted other areas around the hotel, so I鈥檓 sure room will be refreshed soon.The bed seemed very comfortable at first but at night as we slept the bed sloped a bit in the middle. We鈥檇 wake up right next to each other and we鈥檇 have to scoot back to our sides. It may have been the mattress or maybe an old bed frame?We loved the chocolates on our pillows with the turn down service and hot chocolate with our wake-up call. As a Platinum member, we got the healthy start buffet on weekday mornings in the restaurant. They had oatmeal, granola, cereal, croissants, pastries, fresh berries, toast, etc. It was good.The location is perfect 鈥?walk down Powell to Union Square or walk down California to China Town and the Embarcadero or walk down Powell to the North to North Beach and Fisherman鈥檚 Wharf. Sometimes the walk back up the uphill was a little difficult after a big meal but we loved the exercise. If we鈥檇 had enough exercise for the day, it was easy to catch a cab for a few bucks. The trolley stops at the top of the hill 鈥?but it鈥檚 not worth $5 a person. A cab is much cheaper.Just down Powell, a street or two is a liquor store/market. The prices are better than other similar stores closer to Union Square. It鈥檚 a great place to stock up on water, snacks and beverages for the week. Just down from the market is a great little Mexican restaurant. I don鈥檛 remember the name but it was really good an in-expensive compared to other nearby restaurants. Other days/nights we ventured to North Beach for lunches and dinner. North Beach has better restaurants than Union Square. We always felt safe walking back to the hotel at night.The staff was pleasant and we did not have any problems. I would stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Great Service but... The service at this hotel was impecable but the rooms are getting a bit long in the tooth. It is definately time for a makeover / renovation. That being said, everything in the room was in good condition / good working order and the carpets were clean (some reviews said they wern't.) Bathtubs / showersdrain very slow (or not at all in the 1st room we were in).

<Content>Guests Beware! First off I would like to say that I am not the type that would write something unless I felt that it would help out other travelers. Ok that being said I stayed at this property for two nights starting 23sep06. At check in the agents basically ignored me until one finally gave in to helping me. I flew to San Francisco with my sister and had made multiple calls for a room with two beds. When we went up to our room there was only one bed. Also the room had stains on the carpeting, furniture, and the grout of the bathroom was disgusting. For the price that they ask for this hotel I expected it to be at least clean!!!! After speaking with the front desk they explained they were on a sold out status but could upgrade me for an additional charge of $30. Being that I had already paid $280 a night for this property and had also made multiple calls I refused and said I would be down to speak to the manager. When I spoke to the manager he reiterated what I was told but when I mentioned to him they offered me another room for an additional charge he denied they offered that for a two bed room. I finally told him that I would stay at a different property if he could find one. After 20min the manager came back and advised me that a room Miraculously became available but it needed to be cleaned. He offered my sister and I a drink in the lobby while we waited. An entire bottle of wine later the room was still not available. After 1 hour we finally went up and showed us our room. This room was an improvement but it had a smell of a wet dog. Being that the property does allow animals under 25lbs I accepeted that the prior guest must have had a pet and that the maids are unable to clean at a standard that I had expected for the price i was paying. Overall the stay was not one that I would recommend. I have stayed at numerous properties in the San Francisco area and this one is just not worth the price. Also for those of you that do not have a rental car or prefer to roam around the city by foot, BE AWARE that this property is on top of a HUGE hill and it is a very steep incline. So in closing if you want to get the most value for your dollar stay at the Omni or Fairmont, those are worth it.

<Content>pleasantly surprised reviewer from Warrenton virginia I was a bit nervous about this hotel after reading an earier review containing photos of nasty carpet and dirty toilets. I don't know where this reviewer stayed but my experience was entirely different. Upon arriving I found the entrance and lobby to be elegant and clean, not in need of refurbishing at all. The front desk staff were among the most courteous I have seen anywhere. The cordial helpfulness extended to everyone from the concierge to the doormen, housekeeping staff etc. Whenever I ordered room service or my wake up coffee there was a friendly voice on the phone who actually seemed to know me. The room was not oversize but adequate and very clean. The bathroom was fine and I had no complaints. Tho only thing that keeps me from an excellent review was a problem with the AC which necessitated open windows and subsequent cable car noise. I still would recommend this hotel, it is well worth the price.

<Content>Nice hotel, very good service This is definitely a beautiful hotel. Starting with the entrance and the lobby, the hotel is a reminder of the wealth that existed in San Francisco in the early 1900's and today. The staff was very helpful and pleasant. The turn down service and morning coffee/tea/hot chocolate are a nice touch. If you are looking for a very modern looking hotel, this is not the place for you. Instead the Stanford Court is for people that like antiques and old world flavor. The room was bigger than I thought it would be, and it was clean. I little bit of updating would probably do the hotel well, but again you have to appreciate the style of the hotel. Take a walk to the neighboring hotels. They are all lovely in their own way, and they definitely remind you of the days of the railroad mansions.

<Content>Outstanding Best place I've stayed in years. A historic hotel with lovely charming rooms and a small, but modern bath/shower facility. Staff was professional and helpful. They must also be the last hotel in the USA to do turn-down service with chocolates.Be aware that it's on a steep hill, so be in shape or plan to pay $5 for the Powell or Calif cable car, which both stop on the corner. Also note the $41 valet parking expense. Hotel is not cheap but there was a better rate on their web site than for several other hotels downtown that probably would not have been as nice.My only nits: a) for some reason there was a portable TV that took up 1/2 the space on the bathroom sink countertop. b) I'd rather have a coffeemaker in my room than having to remember to call down for AM coffee the night before c) I always used the business center for free at night to check my e-mail but others in my party mentioned having to pay for it (maybe they used it during daytime?)

<Content>Great Hotel Experience We greatly enjoyed our week at this hotel! It is attractive, clean and cozy. The people who worked there were friendly, kind and helpful. The restaurant on site (Fornou's Ovens) was a disappointment, however. The people that worked there were very nice anyway. We will definitely stay at this hotel again and will also try the restaurant too. I'm sure the situation has been rectified by now since the hotel is so nice.

<Content>Very nice but needs work Really is a beautiful, historic hotel. Each morning, complimentary coffee/hot chocolate/tea is staying hot in a caraffe and is ready for you right outside your door, on a tray, with sterling silverware, cream and sugar at the time of your wake-up call. Very nice touch. The canopy bed was beautiful and added an element of luxury. Nice marble bathrooms and good water pressure in the shower. Heated towel racks in the bathroom added extra comfort. The Pavilion restaurant (by day)/ Fournou's Ovens (by night) restaurant was delicious -- we had the brunch: spicy salmon hash, souffle pancakes and chicken/mushroom omelet. All delicious. On the flip side: They did not bring our roll-away bed right away when we checked in, as they had told us they would (reassuring us twice). So, we figured they were running a little slow -- no problem -- we went to the Top of the Mark for drinks and dancing, thinking when we got back to the room, the bed would be set up. However, upon our return at 11:15 pm, the bed still was not there. We called the front desk and nicely asked if the bed could be sent up; they said yes they would send one up right away. Another 20 minutes go by and still no bed. So we called again to ask for the bed -- the front desk guy said: Oh, yeah sorry, we'll try and have one up soon. TRY? Thank goodness, this time the bed arrived just 3-5 minutes later. Other things that need improvement: parking rate of $41/ night, or $8/hour. RIDICULOUS RATE. We understand how difficult it is to find parking on Nob Hill, so these hotels must think they can get away with such high rates, but it really is offensive. Also, the business center is militantly monitered and they charge $0.50/minute for use of the computers, and $1.00/page to print. Just not a very user-friendly way of doing things, especially in this technical day and age. Other than that, staff was capable for the most part, but lacked the polish one might hope for at a hotel of this calliber. Of note: Raul, bell captain and valet, was excellent. Overall, we would stay at the Renaissance Stanford Court Hotel again, but only if at a special, discounted, or promotional rate.

<Content>Made SF Fun I took my wife and two daughters to San Francisco for a last get together-weekend before my oldest went off to college. We had a two room suite with a view of Grace Cathedral on California Street. It was stately, clean and had great soft European bedding with fratte sheets. It was a blast. I'd heard it was a place movie stars stayed discreetly and they were right. Went to Fournou's Ovens restaurant there and had a fabulous server (that old world charm) that suggested entrees my picky eaters loved (Rack of Lamb  wild Salmon) and then Sam Donaldson came in and sat at the next table! The lemon souffle pancakes at breakfast were totally unique...people at other tables ordered it when they saw ours. It's right atop Nob Hill so I shopped for back to school with the girls while my wife attended Grace Cathedral's service. We took the cable cars to Union Square as the main stop is right on the corner. It was first class, family friendly and its proximity to everywhere we wanted to go made SF and the whole weekend fun.

<Content>Good Central Location My colleague and I stayed here on business at the end of July. We booked a twin room through Virgin Holidays and on arrival were told that we had a double room and they couldn't move us as it was a busy time and there were no twin rooms available. We accepted this as not the hotel's fault I guess. We couldn't book another room as the hotel was full so they put a extra single camp bed in the room, but it was very cramped as the rooms aren't very big! Our colleague arrived later and she had the same problem and she booked direct with the hotel! However, they said they could offer her a twin room the next day so not sure why they could for her and not for us, even though we offered to pay extra.......???The rooms were nicely decorated and the bed was very comfortable. We were also on the quiet side of the hotel which I would recommend asking for as the surrounding streets are quite busy. The hotel is in a good central location and within walking distance of the main shops and exhibition centre, which takes about 15 minutes.The breakfast has a good selection but we very rarely got what we ordered and it is quite expensive!They offer free coffee/tea in the mornings which can be ordered with or without a wake-up call the night before. We ordered tea with no wake-up call, but sadly got woken up and no tea!! The concierge is helpful for booking trips but don't listen to their restaurant recommendations as we got sent to an awful place in Chinatown! Good places to eat are Nob Hill Cafe and Venticello - both Italians within walking distance. The bar in the hotel next door (Top of the Mark) is good for a pre-dinner cocktail, as is the bar at the top of the Marriot Hotel downtown. Trips worth taking are Alcatraz (popular so book well in advance to get the day you want) and the Wine Country tour to the nearby Napa and Sonoma Valleys. If one of your group doesn't mind driving, you would have more freedom to choose the winerys you want to visit though.San Francisco is a great city but 5 days is probably long enough to do everything! Also, bring a jumper as the weather gets cold quickly when the fog comes in!

<Content>Wonderful experience My husband and I recently returned from a weeks stay in San Francisco. We booked our room over the internet using reviews from a travel company. Their reviews sounded mostly positive, with a few negatives as expected. But after learning about Trip Advisor, I logged on to read the reviews about the hotel through their travelers' eyes. I was a little worried after reading some of the opinions of these patrons, but let me tell you, according to our experience, these folks must be used to staying at the Ritz, because we could not have asked for a nicer, cleaner, and better hotel in the city. The staff was helpful and friendly with any questions or concerns we expressed. There was a doorman waiting almost everytime we entered or exited the building; the lobby contains a gorgeous flower arrangement of freshly cut long-stemmed roses, and the atmosphere is one of professionalism from all the employees without being stuffy and snooty. Our room was very clean and roomy. The bed was very comfortable, and the bathroom had oversized towels on a towel rack that could be turned on to warm your towel while you bathed. Yes, the property is older than some, but no so old that it is run down. The fact that it is older gives way to high ceilings, marbled bathrooms, and beautiful moulding throughout the hotel. I have stayed in nice hotels throughout the country, and I can honestly say the Stanford Court ranks as one of the best I've had the priviledge in which to stay. If I ever return to SF, I will book a room here.

<Content>Superb hotel for a superb stay in SF You will not be disappointed with this hotel. The Rooms are spacious, cosy, bright and airy. A nice little touch was of an evening:- dressing gown and chocolates were laid on the bed of an evening. Complimentary hot drinks arrived at the room each morning too. The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful. The location is also fab!

<Content>Set your own alarm We wanted to stay at this hotel again after visiting 2 years before. Through a mistake of our doing, we booked for 2 nights and quickly realised that we only needed to stop for the 1 night only. No refund was allowed, so an expensive stay, but, as I said our fault. The room was fine, nothing fancy for this sort of money. It being the last night in the US after 4 weeks travelling around we had a very pleasant but late night out in town.Luckily I set the alarm on my phone, and ordered an alarm call and coffee for the morning. We received neither, checking out I told reception about coffee and wake up call but they didnt seem concerned. We managed to get to the airport through morning rush hour just in time. Not the best way to start a 17 hour trip home.Yes its a fine old hotel, I just expected better.

<Content>great location I stayed her for five days and overall we had a fnatastic time. We had a premium queen room for the first ngiht, and a double queen for the remaining four nights. Our first room overlooked the main road and was a little noisy with traffic, but didnt stop us sleeping too badly. We did not eat in the hotel but if you book a WAke up call via reception then you can order complimentary coffee, which was a great way to start the day. the lobby area is very impressive, and their restaurant looks great too, we were attending a wedding in SF and didnt really have the time to eat there in our five days. The bathroom toiletries were a wonderful range LATHER, which I had not seen befor. Normally I do not bother with hotel toiletries but these were too good to miss. The hotel has a TownCar which is competitive to taxis, and is worth doing for the run back to the airport if you need it. Steep climb up from Union Square though, but there is no avoiding hills in SF!!!Internet access available from their business centre if you do not have a laptop, but it is 50c a minute. We got a great rate (拢475 for five nights) via Virgin Holidays (we booked accommodation only with them).

<Content>Great stay at Stanford Court You can't ask for a better location in San Francsico. A 20 minute walk can get you to Fiashermans Wharf. There are 2 Cable Car lines on the corner. The restaurant Fournos Ovens in the hotel is spectacular.Service from the concierge desk was impeccable.The rooms are a little old and it shows, but not in a bad way. It is a very lovely hotel. The coffee service in the mornings was a great way to start our days on our 4 day stay at the Stanford Court.I'd reccomend this hotel to friends who are looking for an affordable hotel in the Nob Hill district. Dont miss the Top of the Mark hotel bar next door. Amazing views !!!!(You Pay for the views in the drink prices)

<Content>Lovely boutique hotel with charming rooms and good service. My 17-year-old daughter and I stayed at the Stanford Court for a conference and had a wonderful experience. Having read the very mixed reviews this property received, I was pleasantly surprised. The staff was very accommodating, right from check in. I needed a room on the same floor as the director of my organization and they arranged that. They also arranged to have the down-filled bedding removed from my bed, as I am very allergic. My daughter kept her down feather bed and duvet and loved it. Even without the luxury bedding my bed linens and bed were quite comfortable. The room was a corner room with views of the city, the bay, and the Transamerica building. Very spacious, clean, and decorated in an Asian-themed English country style. Very pretty. The bathroom was clean, bright, and certainly roomy enough--and the little color TV on the counter was a nice touch. There was a heat lamp in the ceiling, heated towel bars, and a phone as well. Also a vanity bench, which made dressing and doing makeup easier.We experienced no major problems with noise except for the occasional cable cars--and we expected that--it's the sound of the city and we didn't mind. And they don't run all night, so sleeping is fine.Morning beverages were always there on time and were hot. Wake up calls were on time, too. So was USA Today. The staff was courteous and accommodating. In fact, the day we left for the airport we were waiting in the lobby for a 4:30 am shuttle. The evening manager came over to us, offered us coffee, and stayed and chatted with us until the shuttle arrived. He even had the concierge call the shuttle company to confirm arrival, even though we'd done so the day before.The concierge staff was knowledgeable and courteous--made reservations, checked menus, helped us book tours of wine country, Muir Woods and Sausalito. The hotel's town car (free during business hours) took us downtown to an off-the-beaten track shopping area the concierge recommended.In regard to the conference itself, the staff couldn't have been more accommodating, the meeting spaces were just fine, and the meals - held in the hotel restaurant - were delicious. My daughter is a vegetarian and the waitstaff made sure that she had appropriate food even though it was a set conference menu.Turndown service is available upon request and the evening housekeeping staff were very friendly--going so far as to give my daughter many extra chocolates every evening--suffice it to say she was quite pleased. We never met the day staff so I can't say anything about them other than the room was made up perfectly each day.Just a couple of minor negatives. 1. We had problems with our keys demagnetizing so that they didn't work. Since there were two of us, it was OK--seemed like one of always had a working key--but each day we needed to get the keys changed. 2. We had a connecting room - the door was closed and locked, but one evening we could clearly hear voices in the adjoining room. But that ended quickly. If there was a loud group I think it would have been pretty bad. 3. Room service is expensive (but yummy) and we had a few things that they forgot and had to bring up after the initial delivery. But it was taken care of. 4. There is nowhere for a reasonably priced breakfast in the hotel. Restaurant and room service are very pricy for any meal, but especially for breakfast.I completed the hotel's guest feedback form and mentioned my pleasure in the property, but the few problems and I received a personal e-mail thanking me for my feedback and asking for specifics so the problems could be addressed.I heard only good things from the conference attendees about the property. Everyone seemed to find the accommodations quite acceptable.The location on Nob Hill is convenient to a number of cable car lines and is within walking distance of Union Square shopping, Chinatown, and the theatre/restaurant district. A good walker could even make it down to the waterfront.Speaking of walking--we managed the hills quite well on foot, surprising ourselves. A colleague who is a native said that she has buns of steel from the hills--and I can see why. One does get a workout. Just going walking feels like a good day at the gym. We would stay at the Stanford Court again. It was a big part of what made our combo vacation/conference trip so enjoyable.

<Content>Average but great staff Stayed at this hotel for a week in mid may. The hotel is an old 5 star hotel so the decor means that it is not really 5 star any more as it needs to have its decor updated. However once you get over this it has positives. The staff are superb and extremely helpful especially Seaneen the concierge. It has a lovely bar area just off the lobby which is very relaxing for a drink. It is in a brilliant location near chinatown, union sq and on two tram lines so easy toget to fishermans wharf. As its decor is out of date this is reflected in the price. Nob Hill where it is located is where the grand hotels hang out, the Mark Hopkins Intercontinential is right next door and the Fairmont is right accross the road. these are $50-$100 more expensive per night but are more plush and up to date.The rooms are however extremely spacious with a good bathroom/makeup area also. The fitness centre is ok but could do with a few more machines.Overall I would go back mostly for the extreme friendliness of the staff. It will most likely be modernised over the next few years which will probably result in higher prices.

<Content>STAY AWAY! HORRIBLE! After staying at this property, I have lost confidence in the AAA Diamond rating system. I have no idea how this hotel can possibly be a four diamond hotel. The room that I stayed in was ugly and old and it smelled like mold. The bathroom was tiny, the carpet was grimy, and the furniture looked like it was going to fall apart. When I turn the air on in the room, it sounded like the water was running. But because the property was fully occupied, I couldn't get another room. I had to keep the air off during my entire stay, which made the stuffiness and moldy smell even worse. The walls were paper thin so every morning I heard the tv in the next room loud and clear. Worst of all was the service. Don't bother with the free morning coffee service. I asked for it to be served at 7am so it could serve as my wake up call as well. I heard them through the paper thin walls setting up and clinging glasses outside in the hall starting at 5:30a, but they did not come by my room until 9:30a! I guess it was a good thing that I got woken up at 5:30a since I obviously didn't get my scheduled wake-up call at 7a. The check-in was strange too. Matt, the night check-in person on 3/21, was like Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Hyde. He was courteous enough when I was at the front desk. But when I walked into my ugly, smelly room and saw that it was 2 full beds instead of a king, I called him to inquire. Instead of explaining that it was a full house and that was their only room left, he rudely said, I'm looking at your reservations right now and it doesn't say that you have a guarantee for a king. He obviously needs a course in customer service.I will NEVER EVER return to this property again, even if it was offered to me for free. As a matter of fact, I stayed here on this occassion because an annual conference I attend in SF was held here. If it is held at this property again next year, I would skip the whole conference.

<Content>Lovely friendly hotel My husband and I stayed for 6 nights in April. I had read several poor reviews so was nervous about what the hotel would be like. We had a city view room which although not a great view, it was nice to have a view of the city.The room was nice, it was a little old fashioned but kind of quaint. It had a king bed and plenty of room, and outside of the bathroom was a little make up area with huge lights above the mirror. The wake up beverages were great, they were always there on time and enough for two cups each, it was a nice touch.Room service was great, the lemon souffle pancakes are the best, we had to have them twice!!The concierge was very helpfull, and arranged restaurants and trips for us.The Town car took us to the airport at the end of the stay, I would reccommend it rather than taking a taxi, it costs the same as a taxi but is a nicer car and the driver was friendly.We didn't really drink in the bar, it didn't have a very good cocktail list and was lacking in atmosphere.We really felt that the staff were very friendly and helpfull, and we couldn't fault the service that we had.All in all we really enjoyed our stay at this hotel, I would recommend it.

<Content>Just OK, Older Property Was in town for business and stayed at Renaissance Parc for couple of nights. Hotel was older than I expected but very clean. Everything about this place was old and outdated, bathroom, furniture, and especially the gym (really small with old equipment). Room and bath was on the small side. There was not enough floor space to fully open up my 50 suiter. Had to walk alot to get to my room, walked around in circles in a maze. Dinner ordered through room service was unedible, my request for well done burger was charred on the outside and raw on the inside. Hotel amenities was nice, sheets, towels, etc. Found the hotel staff to be attentive and friendly. I might stay here again if the other properties I generally stay in the city are sold out again.

<Content>OK Hotel, Great Location The positives:- Great location: Just north of Union Square; Just south of Chinatown, North Beach. At the intersection of two cable car lines and plenty of cabs in the area.- Comfortable Beds- Friendly staffThe negatives:- Dated decor in the rooms, which were generally clean.- Few amenities in the hotel, though they do have a small exercise room.- Somewhat overpriced, with some better (but comparably priced) alternative hotels in the area.- No viable breakfast options in the hotel, (the in-house restaurant charges a pretty penny for breakfast), but there are several restaurant alternatives a short walk from the hotel.

<Content>Not good for business travelers The hotel was clean and the staff was very friendly. The free hot beverage service in the morning also came a a pleasant surprise. However, the hotel is a bit stingy on business-type amenities, considering what is included at comparable hotels with similar rates. They charge an extra $9.95 per day for Internet access and local calls, and 10 cents a minute for use of their business center. The lack of included local calls came as a surprise, as I got bit by a $1 charge to make a local call to a destinaton just a few blocks away. The lack of free local calls coupled with a lack of a decent cell phone signal in the room very much limited what I could get done in my hotel room.If you are in town for leisure, this hotel may be one place to consider. However, if you are in town for business and need to stay connected, I would recommend that you look elsewhere, as other hotels in the area with similar rates offer more for the business traveler.

<Content>Location, Comfort Superb We thoroughly enjoyed our two-night stay at Stanford Court last week. Our 4th-floor room was clean, appealing, and comfortable with a pleasant view of the city and the bay. Service was always available, efficient, and responsive but never intrusive. The location is ideal for walkers (we walked to Chinatown, North Beach, shopping areas and theater), but the hotel is located at the intersection of the 2 cable car lines for those who don't feel like negotiating the hills. Taxis were easy to find also.Fournou's Oven Restaurant is downstairs and our dinners were fabulous. Breakfast is good but way overpriced ($22 for the American Breakfast), but the coffee is excellent and a bowl of oatmeal or granola with fruit would be a more reasonable choice. There are numerous cafes nearby in the local neighborhoods.We highly recommend Stanford Court for its comfortable beds and perfect location for exploring San Francisco.

<Content>Dirty and outdated! This was my fourth year to visit San Francisco. Every year my husband has a conference at the Ritz and we stay there. The conference was moved to the Stanford this year. I am suspecting it was because of rates. Upon check in at the Stanford I was told that the daily rate for use of the computer in the business center would be $30 (free at the Ritz). We walked into the room and it was dirty and musty. The furniture looked like it was about to fall apart. The beds had some cheap bamboo headboard (that really was not a headboard..more like a few sticks). The bathroom was tiny. The carpet was dirty. The halls smelled. We were paying $220 a night. The very next day we checked out and went one block up to the Huntington Hotel. It was a wonderful experience. I never have checked into a hotel then checked right out. I am glad I did. The Huntington's business center was free, the view was great, the room was very nice, the bathroom was HUGE and the Spa was wonderful. I don't expect a lot, but I expect a room to be clean, not smell and the furniture not to be falling apart.

<Content>Wonderful stay at the Stanford Court We stayed the the Stanford Court on February 26 and 27 and had a very pleasant stay. Our room was neat and clean and well furnished, our bed was very comfortable, it was a bonus having the trolley car go by. Our morning wake up call was on time and we enjoyed our hot tea and fresh coffee - wonderful. We dined at Fournous Ovens and had an outstanding meal. We would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to friends and hope to return ourselves. After reading some of the reviews we wondered if we stayed at the same hotel. P.S. We were aware of the parking charge before we checked in, and all the hotel employees were very helpful.

<Content>Wonderful I have stayed at the Renaissance on more than one occassion and have never been disappointed. The staff were helpful...even asked them for a red balloon (we were playing a game) and then asked them for a wine opener which was delievered to our room in a matter of minutes.Ask for a room with two queen beds...they are spacious and lovely. The location is perfect with cable cars at the corner and cabs right at the door.You will enjoy your stay.

<Content>ok...... We stayed and the Renaissance for a weekend getaway. To be honest when we checked into the room I almost cried. It was so old, so dingy and I am sure any sort of germ analysis on that bedspread would bring shocking results. For the price and the star rating, I expected soooo much more. However, the lobby was nice, the staff very nice and courteous and the bar nice. The morning coffee delivered to your door was a very nice addition, but not enough to make up for how outdated the room was

<Content>A Tale of Two Hotels We had the best service but a dated room; a beautiful location, but a view of a satellite dish from our window. We had high-speed internet access, but no in-room safe to stow a computer. I don't know if I am a good judge of this hotel because we were here for a conference and received a discounted room rate. Most of the attendees, like us, were accomodated on the second floor. I don't know if the higher floors are nicer, but our room was very dated, although clean. (Too recent to be charmingly antique; too old to be hip.) For example, there was a strange bamboo-framed curtain apparatus over the bed that looked silly. In addition, the bathroom was straight out of the 70s, with a black-and-white swivel TV in the corner. However, the location was great and the service was efficient and friendly. You can make too much of it, I know, but the complimentary coffee and hot chocolate in the morning is a nice touch. Because of the location and service, I have to say I like this hotel, but I will try another when I return to town.

<Content>Wonderful Service, Clean Hotel The moment we arrived at the hotel, we were impressed with the service. The doormen could not help you enough with unloading luggage and opening doors. On approaching the desk we were assisted straight away very efficiently. They found our booking and said that they would find us a better room, it took less than 5 minutes to check in which is just what we needed after a long journey. Although it was a bit of a trek from the lifts, the room was spacious and clean and the view over the city and bay was magnificent. The room was well equipped and the complimentary coffee and newspaper delivered at the time you specify every morning is a great idea. The only problem we did have was the cost of the drinks in the bar - far too costly so we just drank and ate elsewhere and brought our own drinks in for a nightcap. The hotel also had no problem with us ordering a takeaway and taking it to our room. The location was not really in the tourist area and was a major walk to anywhere, however we hired a car and had it valet parked in the hotel (this was rather costly also but not bad compared to other car parks in the area). A beautiful place to stay with very unintrusive yet efficient service where nothing was too much trouble. Thank you to all the staff.

<Content>Excellent Location and Nice Amenities My friend and I stayed at the Stanford Court for the Thanksgiving holiday from November 24-29. It was our first time in San Francisco. The location is unbeatable - Nob Hill is clean, quiet and cozy, away from all the noise, tourists and panhandlers 4 blocks down the hill in Union Square. I was overall very satisfied by the hotel but I was disappointed in some areas. I have to agree with some of the other reviewers here that the front desk staff is a little cold. Not necessarily rude but just stiff and not very welcoming. They were accommodating when our room wasn't ready even though it was well past the check in time so we ended up in a large corner unit with pretty decent views. The doormen and the housekeeping staff are excellent - we were always happily greeted and they were responsive to our needs.There were some nice amenities but quite overrated. We had bathrobes which were a nice touch. The heated towel rack didn't do much to heat the towel except in the three spots where the rack hit the towel - maybe my expectation was too high. What I liked much better was the heat lamp which kept the room toasty so you didnt get the chills when you emerged from the shower. The showers are awesome - the water pressure was perfect. I don't usually make showerheads a point in my reviews but it was that memorable! Also, all the beds had the amazing new marriott featherbeds which are just heavenly. The coffee, tea or hot chocolate service in the mornings was nice too but don't expect the beverages to be of high quality.My friend and I walked almost all of San Francisco. We had dinner in the Union Square area most nights and would trek back up the 4 or 5 blocks uphill to the hotel. We don't exercise but we are from cities where we walk a lot, albeit on flat ground. I would use your own judgement for walking around but you can save a lot of money and see much more by walking. The public transportation system is confusing because there are 10 different types of public transport serving limited areas. BART seems to be more of a commuter train going out to suburbs with select stops in the city. Buses weren't the best option because it can be confusing for tourists. The cable cars don't go very far and for $5 per one-way ride, it's a total rip-off. There was also some cable train system which was cheap and got us out to Castro but it took a lot of maps and research to get around for cheap. I still recommend walking to most areas and cabbing back at day's end. I fell in love with San Francisco and I would stay at the Stanford Court again.

<Content>Not the quality I expected Stayed at the hotel the evening of November 19, 2005. I used Marriott points (30,000) and my wife and I were disappointed in a variety of different ways. The room was adequate, but we were unable to regulate the air conditioning system, thus even with the windows open, the room was uncomfortable. Upon check out, the desk clerk advised us that the range of temperature in the rooms is controlled, as to not affect the adjoining rooms. The bathroom had a sliding door, and the wash area only had one sink and limited electrical outlets. The valet parking fee was just under $50.00, steep for even SF prices. The morning coffee service was a nice feature, but certainly didn't make up for the other deficiencies. We would not consider this property for future stays.

<Content>Good and Bad The hotel is attractive with a nice entrance. Coffee and hot chocolate are served complimentary with your morning wake-up call. But I was terribly disappointed with the service at the check-in desk.I waited for about 6 hours to get a room while dozens of other travelers got served. I spoke with 4 clerks and all told me that my room was not ready. Eventually I was told that I should not expect more since I went through Priceline (although I paid over $100 per night for the room). I called the Marriott national number, and they immediately straightened out the problem, apologizing for the treatment I received. Obviously the hotel employees are instructed to treat Priceline customers this way, since every one gave the same type answers.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel We stayed at the Stanford Court Renaissance for our wedding anniversary and were perfectly pleased with everything. We were upgraded to a deluxe room, which was very roomy. City views are hard to get in San Francisco, with the buildings being so close, but we had an okay 6th floor view. The service was excellent. We so enjoyed our morning coffee and newspaper awaiting us at the door, and our room service breakfasts were another added plus. I highly recommend breakfast at the hotel. The concierges were very helpful as well. We never encountered any hotel employee who was not very friendly, even the wake-up calls. We loved the added touches of heated towel racks and turn down service with chocolates and water. It is atop a very high hill, but we walked a good bit--it just made us feel better about the large dinners we had! (The parking is expensive at $41 a night, but there is a public lot right across the street for $20.)

<Content>Perfect Stanford Court We have just returned home to England after having the most wonderful holiday in San Francisco. We stayed at the Stanford Court Renaissance and stayed in the Deluxe Double room - city view.The hotel is very luxurious and the staff very friendly and helpful. The surrounding were regal. Room was really comfortable with decor to match the style of hotel. Coffee/Chocolate on the mornings was a real treat and the turndown service with water, chocolates etc. an added bonus.We had room service one evening and the food arrived on a beautifully laid table with silver service and a rose in a vase. Food was excellent also!We celebrated our Silver Wedding Anniversary in the main restaurant and spent a fortune but it was really special and the staff were wonderful, explaining dishes and wines. The chef wrote Happy Anniversary in Chocolate on our dessert plates. Location is perfect. We walked to Union Square shops in 15minutes, To Fishermans Wharf in about 35minutes. Trams stop outside and these we used several times however taxis actually worked out cheaper and some of the times we had free travel from the hotel.This hotel has a good reputation from local people and is surrounded by The Ritz and The Carlton - Need I say more!!We had all the luxury but it was with a friendly smile and service. Before we went on holiday we were concerned about some of the reviews we had read and wondered if we had booked the best hotel for our money - but we had no cause for concern.Will certainly return. Perfect!Perfect!Perfect!

<Content>Nice hotel - awkward location Here were the good things about this hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful, the room was spacious, they had a free limo shuttle around the city between 7 and 3, the wake-up call was a real person, they delivered free coffee or tea to your room and left it outside the door with no knock (meaning no tip required) at the time you ordered it for, lovely turn down service with chocolates, TV in the dressing area and better than average excercise room.I thought the location was awful... atop very steep hills and you have to really climb or take public transportation. Granted the cable car was right out front, that is not an easy means of transporation if you have to work there. The free limo in the mornings worked well for me.While they do have high speed internet access, it cost $9.95 a day. The desks in the room were tiny and if you had to work, there really was no space.The first room they gave me had a TV in an entertainment center but when you pulled it and even turned it as far as you could, you couldn't see the TV from the bed. They switched rooms for me , and while this TV could be seen from the bed, the tv was along the left hand wall from the bed and the TV had to stick way out into the room and the entertainment center door now blocked the door into the hall. Very awkward set up.If you don't want to eat at this hotel which is very expensive ($20) for breakfast or the neighboring Top of the Mark or Fairmont (also very expensive) you must get down from the hill and then back up the hill. There is nothing else nearby.This location is awkward for business travellers and the room amentities don't cater to such. If I were on vacation, I think something closer to the Wharf or the downtown where walking isn't such a challenge would work better.

<Content>It is a dump! Not sure where the other members stayed but I was just at this hotel overnight 12 days ago and was very disappointed. First the room is old and out dated. Second, the carpet and the window curtains were dirty.Finally the room had an odor. I did request a non smoking room and was told that it was one. Possibly the room was a smoking one at sometime. Regardless the room smelled somewhat stale. Personally, I would avoid this hotel at all costs.

<Content>Soured an otherwise positive opinion with one 'rip-off' 'phone call ! Rooms were pretty typical of large City Centre Hotels, spacious but bland. No mini-bar or in-room safe though. Restaurant  snacks available in bar were excellent. We were leaving on the final morning with an overall positive opinion - only to be charged $16 for a call back to the UK of less than 60 seconds. Other similar hotels during our trip had managed to offer this service for $3 - $4 and, from the Receptioninst's 'patter' advising us that it was all clraly laid out to see in the Guest Services Book, I imagine that they face these type of complaints frequently. I guess it must be a Marriott group policy but rather shortsighted as always your final memory of an establishment is one of feeling 'ripped off' !

<Content>Nice place to stay We got a package deal through Expedia 3 nights 4 days hotel, r/t air from Lax and rental car for $777.00. The hotel and stay were great. I am not sure what all the negative stuff was all about as our experience was quite pleasant. I found the setting to be elegant as one would expect and the staff extremely professional yet not stuffy. We didn't have a view but that was ok. If you know SF at all you know it is hard to get a room with a view(buildings so close together) so if you are willing to pay a ridiculous price or plan on spending your entire stay in your room then by all means pay the price. Pillow top mattress and feather pillows made for a very restful sleep.Parking is steep but that is how it is in SF so add another 40 bucks or so a day for parking your car here. The cable car is right outside the hotel and cabs are abundant. The lounge is classy,cozy and intimate with a piano man playing in the background. I didn't eat at their restaurant,I have many favorites around town that I go to whenever I am here. Try Frascati on Hyde street (Russian hill area) Chef Teri McLeod will blow you away with her Cal Med rendition of the areas freshest foods. Yummmmm! Anyway if you are looking for comfort and value for your buck I recommend the Stanford court. Close to everything, classy and comfortable,what more could one ask for.

<Content>Terrible hotel, great location Stayed at the Stanford Court earlier this year through a priceline purchase. Paid $110/night, which was great for that area. First the good - location is amazing. Great fun to walk down to Union Square, then take the cable car back. Close to everything, and great views (from some of the rooms). Now the bad - the hotel obviously has not been renovated in more than 15 years - totally unacceptable for a supposed 4 star property. The walls in between guest rooms were paper thin - had to spend two nights listening to our neighbor's conversation. I refused to walk barefoot on the carpet, it was so disgusting. The entire room (and most public areas) felt like I was staying at my grandmother's musty, old, dated house. If I had paid anything near normal price, I would have taken one look and left. There are much, much nicer hotels in the area - spend your money somewhere else!

<Content>Very lovely After reading some of the reviews for this hotel, I was very skeptical and expecting a rundown facility. It was very clean, furnished very nicely, and was comparable to some very nice boutique hotels in Europe. I was pleased with the courteous, attentive staff, loved the bath and body products, the chocolates and turn-down in the evening, the complimentary beverages in the morning and the feeling of being very pampered. I thought the walk to Union Square was going to be too much but it was invigorating, but not for someone that may not be physically fit. I would definately give this place a thumbs up and for those that complain about the parking prices, hey, remember, you are in San Francisco.

<Content>Good for the price We got a great deal through Priceline. The hotel is in a great area. It was only 1/2 block to catch the cable car and a few blocks from Union Square. The service in the hotel was impeccable. The bellmen were the best.......very professional and could not be more helpful. The rooms were average...nothing spectacular. At times it was a bit noisy....you could hear the bellmen's whistle early in the morning and the maid vacuuming. The room service menu was a bit pricey. I would definately stay there again because of the price and great service.

<Content>Stretch out at the Stanford Court A wonderful place for a romantic get-away. Don't bring your car. Take BART from SFO or OAK to the Embarcadero Station. Walk 1/2 block to the California Street cable car line. Take it to the top of the world's greatest view and, alas, the hotel is on your left. Great, attentive service. 12,000 restaurants, amazing walks and Giants baseball just a taxi or cable car ride away. I suggest the Cosmopolitan Cafe and Morton's for dinner.

<Content>What I expected! Typical 4 star hotel. I expected the hotel to be a bit closer to Union square. It is actuially on top of nob hill neat to the fairmont. Didn't think it was at all worn as some of the reviews say. I did notice a bit of noise. I could hear the doorman blow his whistle for a cab. 10 minute uphill walk from Powell BART station. Overall good stay

<Content>Luxurious Hotel at an incredible price. After reading some of the reviews on here I was a little worried about this hotel, but I got a great deal on Priceline. That said the hotel would have been worth the full price of $169 a night! The rooms were medium to large size with a good size all-marble bathroom.The Stanford Court has excellent service professionals throught the hotel. From the Bellhops to the Concierge to the front desk staff everyone was extremely courtious and attentive. The Sunday brunch at Fournou's Ovens was excellent. They have great cuisine and complimentary Mimosas. If you are there on a Sunday morning be sure and make reservations for the brunch.One warning is the parking in this area of town is VERY expensive. It is $45 a night at the hotel which is the going rate at the hotels in the area. I found a deck about a block away for $27. Don't rent a car if you are staying in this area.If you are looking for a great deal in San Francisco bid for Union Square West and four stars on Priceline.

<Content>Average Hotel, Expensive The lobby of the Stanford Court is beautiful - a nice place to hang out  get a feel of what San Fran used to feel like years in the past. After viewing the lobby I expected more grand things in our room and was disappointed. The room was fine - it was clean  nice but it smelled like an antique store; old. The hotel is definitely an older hotel in need of some upgrades. The bathroom looked like it'd last been renovated in the 1960's, but was otherwise clean. What has room for improvement is the price of all the incidentals at this hotel. The drink prices in the lobby bar, the room service prices and the parking was highway robbery. Beware: They only offer valet parking (there's no self-parking available and according to the front desk, none nearby.) The only alternative is street parking, which is metered. I suppose if we'd have wanted to walk several blocks we could have found self-parking, but since we were in the City to go to the opera and a nice dinner we weren't exactly in walking attire. The total bill for one night of valet parking was $46.74 including tax. If we'd been told it was that much up front we could have found cheaper parking  taken BART or a quick taxi ride back to the hotel and saved money. I know San Fran isn't known for its inexpensive parking, but we felt almost $47/night was just a little much. Overall, if The Stanford Court were to remodel its hotel it'd seem more reasonable to pay the high prices, but with its current condition we feel they鈥檙e a bit overpriced. It's worth noting that we paid a discounted rate for our room, otherwise if we'd have paid $200+ night we would have only given the hotel 1-star.

<Content>Wonderful... After reading some of the reviews I was ready for the worst but was surprised by the wonderful place this Hotel really was. The staff was professional, very friendly and helpful. The view from the room was breathless. The area was very safe and a close walk to Union Square, Pier 39 and other great areas. This a very relaxing, quiet, classy Hotel and If you are a family with small children (under 12) this may not be the place for you. The Pier 39 area is more 'Family' friendly. But if you want a romantic time, either alone or with loved ones, I highly reccomend this Hotel. Be sure to ask for the Bay View if available. I was a Priceline customer and I vote 5 Stars for sure. This was a Priceline Jackpot and I will be returning to this Hotel on my next SF trip.

<Content>great service, good location, big rooms My wife and I stayed at the Stanford Court from June 10th to 12th and were very pleased. We didnt go the Priceline route like the last feller, but still found the AAA rate to be reasonable. We were given a 2nd floor room facing an alley, but after a night of noise we asked to switch. They were very accomodating and polite about it, and moved us to a nice quiet upper floor courtyard room while we were out touristicising. It is a full service hotel; doormen, bellhops, turndown service, EXCELLENT concierges... everything was handled with utmost professionalism. The hotel is not a modern marvel, but I wouldnt call it 'antiquated' like some other reviews on this site. Our rooms were large and well appointed, large bathrooms and down pillows. The location is very good right in Nob Hill uphill from Union Square, and there are 2 cable car lines that run right to the corner of the hotel. A nice close-by lunch is at the Italian Cafe in Union Square (great people watching) and it really did feel like being in Rome.I would definitely recommend the Stanford, you get treated like royalty without shelling out the royal jewels.

<Content>Great Priceline Deal (Demanding Respect in SF) I am writing this review from the perspective from someone who paid $80 a night on Priceline not $180+. I stayed for three nights June 4-7. To save as much money as possible I took the BART station from the airport to the Powell Street station and walked through Union square up to the top of Nob Hill (walking time approx 15 minutes). Ticket price on BART from the airport were $4.95pp. (Instead of $30+ for cab) The walk gets difficult the last three blocks but worth the savings. For someone who is not as adventurous you can take the cable car (stops at the corner of Powell and California) to the top of the hill for $3pp. Upon arriving at the hotel I sensed a little attitude from Rochelle about being a Priceline customer and got a 1st floor room facing Powell Street. We had a really good view of the financial district because the hotel is on the hill anyway and the first floor is basicall the third floor. We could hear the cable cars below and some traffic but it never disturbed me or interupted sleep. The rooms facing the street were large compared the others I saw overlooking the courtyard. The room is confortable but a little antiquated. The old TV in the bathroom was a joke at first but was really handy as I was getting ready in the morning. Is located in a great location for tourists. We walked to North Beach (recommend Pasta Pomodoro for a reasonably priced meal), Fishermans Wharf, Union Square, Coit Tower etc. etc. I wouldn't reccommend it for someone with a bad ticker but it can be done by someone young and fit with no problem. The coffee service and paper in the morning were a very nice touch. I don't feel the place is worth retail price but it was a great find on priceline!

<Content>Past Its Prime The Good: Very courteous staff; new, comfortable mattresses; complimentary Town Car available; free coffee/beverages delivered at your door in the AM; great tourist location.The Bad: Old 1970's furniture; noisy rooms on lower floors facing the street (cable cars and other street traffic all night); small TV's; dark small rooms facing the inside courtyard where it's quiet; slow elevators.The Deal Breaker: I reserved a junior suite and requested a high floor. I was given a room on the 2nd floor facing the street. I asked politely and reasonably to be moved to a quieter location, was given a much smaller room facing the inside courtyard. This was not what I wanted or what I was willing (and prepared) to pay for. I would gladly have paid a premium price to have had a junior suite on a high floor which is what I reserved. The front desk clerk told me that they were sold out and there were no junior suites on higher floors available. [My reservation had been made 4 weeks prior to my arrival and I am Marriott Platinum Elite]I left after one night, cutting short my stay, and chose to stay at the Omni instead. Too bad, because the restaurant at The Stanford Court is very good, especially breakfast.

<Content>A little tired I stayed here on business for one night. The location is great, right in front of the cable car line which takes you to the Embarcadero, Union Square, Fisherman's Wharf, North Beach or Chinatown in just a few minutes. It's a good spot for tourists, but not so great for business. It was pretty quiet during the week and I had the definite impression that the hotel has seen better days. The furniture was dated and worn, the fixtures were old and the lobby and public areas look dated. That being said, the customer service was fine and they have FANTASTIC feather beds with Frette linens. The bed was the best thing about the place. If it were shined up a bit and had a little more bustle it would have been great. Given a choice I would stay at the St. Francis or the Fairmont over this place, but it was certainly ok if you can get a priceline deal or similar.

<Content>Bad situation turns into KUDOS for Stanford Court I read some horror stories about this hotel, after I had booked it on line... and... I did experience a problem with my room. When I sat on the bed it fell through the frame onto the floor. I called for assistance from maintenance. Joe arrived in very good time and determined that the wood in the box spring was broken and that we should not use the bed. He called the front desk and asked for a porter to assist us in moving to a new room. I did find that interesting, considering at check-in, we were told we received the last room with TWO beds. We were escorted to our new room, that was about twice the size of our original with far nicer ammeities - including TWO King beds with european down comfortors (Very Nice). This was a wonderful upgrade. I was pleased that the hotel staff was accommodating. One review I read had mentioned some staff members by name. I believe the desk clerk who checked us in was one of those mention, in another persons very negative review. I think there may be some staff and management that may not handle complaints well, UNLESS the complaints are presented in a calm and undemanding manner. Presentation of a problem is very important. Yet, I do get the impression that management pays very close attention to where you purchase your room and how much you pay. And this does determines the quality of room you receive. But that is true of all hotels.There is a disparity between regular and discounted rooms, at Stanford Court. It would serve this hotel to consider that imbalance, when time comes for a remodel.I was impressed with the way they handled my NEAR disasterous stay. turning it into a POSITIVE experience. Thank you! I look forward to staying at Stanford Court again, in the near future.

<Content>Great location, dirty, old room We atayed at the Stanford Court on the last leg of a CA trip that included LA, Yosemite and then four days in San Francisco. We were very displeased and disappointed with the condition and size of the room and bathroom. We booked a family room which had two queen beds. Because I was traveling with my spouse and two teen children, I was expecting a larger room with adequate storage for clothes. I have been a Marriott member for many years, and this is quite honestly, the worst Marriott property I have ever stayed at. Upon arrival, the bellman took us to our room and immediately suggested that I contact the front desk and ask for another room, because he felt that there might a better accommodation for us. Unfortunately, the hotel was booked out and there was not another room to be had. Even though I complained, they never offered to make amends of any sort. The front desk told me that they have a limited number of these so-called family rooms and because of that they are always booked up and never have a chance to refurb them.There was no storage for clothes and limited floor space for suitcases. We had to live out of our suitcases - and pushed the two chairs together to make room to get one suitcase off the floor. Everything was old - carpet, furniture, and the bathroom is another story. Outside the bathroom, was a separate counter with a sink and an old TV sitting on it. If they consider this an amenity, they better think again. It looked like it was from the 1970's and worse yet, no one had ever taken a dust rag or cleaned it in all that time. When I tell you it was laden with filth and grime, it is no exaggeration. Who would want to touch it to even turn it on. It would have been better to remove it altogether, and make more room on the counter. The bathroom had an old rubber bathmat hung over the shower door that was covered with dirt or mold - couldn't tell which. It surely would have been a breeding ground for athletes foot. I did complain to housekeeping and they wiped off the TV and brought a new rubber bathmat. Considering the state of the room, nothing housekeeping could have done, would have made it much better. I work out daily, and the workout room was small and dark, the worst I have ever encountered. The upside to this stay is that we were on the go all day long, and we did not spend much time in the room. If you like staying at nice properties and expect cleanliness and amenities, I would not stay here. By the way, there is no concierge level at this property. The location is very nice - the cable cars are on the corner outside the hotel. Even if you are a Marriott member using points, I wouldn't waste them on this property. If you get a super-low rate through a third party vendor and you don't mind taking luck of the draw, go for it.

<Content>Nice Weekend Place to Stay Just stayed in the Stanford Court over the weekend with my wife and some friends from Australia. We all found the hotel to be quite nice and the staff to be very, very helpful - even with a two year old Aussie in tow. Admittedly it is an older building, not the glass high-rise that some SF hotels are, but the rooms we had were spacious, clean, and had great access to everything. Parking was an ease and the cable cars go right in front.

<Content>Had a Great Stay We had a wonderful stay at the Stanford Court this weekend. We found the staff to be unfailingly courteous and extremely helpful. Our room was spacious. We thoroughly enjoyed our complimentary hot coffee and cocoa. We booked the hotel with Priceline and NEVER had a negative response from the hotel staff (as some prior reviews noted). Summary: very pleasant stay, would definitely book there again, great location, fantastic staff

<Content>Great Hotel! I stayed at the Stanford Court in March 05 and had a great time. The location is great within walking distance to Union Square and Chinatown and we even walked to Fishermans's Wharf ( 18 blocks). The cable car stops right in front of the hotel. The hotel itself was very nice, rooms are fine although some might be a little small. Try to get a room facing the courtyard less noisy. The complimentary coffee, tea or hot chocolate with your wake-up call is a very nice touch. The staff is very friendly and helpful. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again next time I visit San Francisco.

<Content>Great Location! Great Price! Superb Staff! I just got back from a six-night stay at the Stanford Court. I was totally pleased with the hotel. The rate was great...$170/night. I also stayed on the eighth floor and did not detect any odors whatsoever. The room (also interior facing) was more than adequate...with nice touches such as gym equipment brought to your room if you did not want to go to the fitness center. But what impressed me most was the staff. They were consistently and uniformly wonderful. It seemed that no favor was too big to ask of the staff and that they really wanted to make sure that you enjoyed your stay. Was the room the biggest room I ever stayed in? No. Is the hotel the most deluxe hotel in San Francisco? No. But it was extremely comfortable and I would not hesitate to stay there again and would strongly recommend it to others. The ONLY problem I encountered was with the shower. It reminded me of the shower in my college dorm...anytime somebody flushed the commode in another room, the pressure would noticeably drop. Other than that, I truly enjoyed my stay there.

<Content>The pits We had just stayed 4 fabulous days in las vegas, coming to san francisco for a further 3 days. We arrived and the Stanford and thought 'this looks nice' went into the lobby which was also nice. They were nice on the check in desk gave us our key etc and told us we were in a superior room with a view of the courtyard we thought 'oh how nice' We got in the lift got out on the 8th floor (this is the top floor) the smell hits you when you get out of the lift it smells musty and damp, the corridors were small and the carpets in the hall way were dirty. We opened the door to our superior room and in there was a bed (double) and not very much floor space and old wardrobe and a very small bathroom. We didnt even unpack we rang downstairs to confirm that this was indeed a superior room they said it was we said it was no where near good enough. Our option was to upgrade for a furthe $50 per night to a deluxe room. So not really having a choice we did this. We got the key went to the delexe room only to find the stence was still there and the room was actually no different no bigger and certainly no better than the last room. It was awful. We then rang to double check that this was indeed the upgrade room and it was. On that note we spoke to the manager and said we were leaving they said fine, so we rang round looking for a new hotel and we booked in at the holiday inn at fishermans wharf. THey then had the audacity to charge us $12 for the telephone. I would have rather flown home than stay here it was awful.

<Content>A nice hotel in a great location Usually stay in Union Square area so it was a great change to be in lovely,quiet Nob Hill. The room was clean and comfy, though the decor could be updated. Staff was professional, friendly and accomodating. At a bargain Priceline rate, this was a great value. If you don't mind the hills, you can walk to all the main attractions and get a good work out, too.

<Content>Good Location for Nob Hill, So-So Rooms We just returned from a 4-night stay at the Stanford Court. I booked our stay as a combination hotel/car package through the Marriott website, which saves money ($550 for 4 nights with economy car, and includes all taxes) but also creates a couple of problems: (1) you cannot specify the type of room or bed; and (2) you have to find somewhere to park your car; the hotel valet costs about $43 per night. When we checked in, the desk clerk tried to get us to upgrade our room to a queen non-smoking ($30 more per night) or a king ($50 more per night). We decided to stay with the room she offered (a queen in an optional smoking room), and the room turned out to be smoke-free, with a nice view. It was a bit dated, but perfectly adequate--I would rank it as a 3.5 star. Our room overlooked the cable car intersection, but the noise wasn't that bad. As for the parking, it turns out there is a small parking lot right across the street from the hotel, which charges $20 a day (no in-and-out privileges, however). You can also park at the lot for $15 for up to 12 hours. This is a bargain as the commercial garages in the Nob Hill area charge about $3 for every 20 minutes, with maximums of $27-$31 a day.The greatest advantage of this hotel is the proximity to the other hotels on Nob Hill. The Fairmont is right across the street, the Mark Hopkins at the end of the block (uphill), the Huntington another block up, and the Ritz-Carlton 2 blocks down. The biggest problems, of course, are the steep climbs up from the Union Square area. However, if you take your time up the hill, it will be ok. I wouldn't wait for the cable cars, as they are usually packed to the gills.All in all, the hotel was fine, but I would stay elsewhere on my next visit to the Bay Area...the hills and the parking were a bit much.

<Content>Not Walker-Friendly The beautiful lobby and great service is somewhat offset by the small, older rooms. The location is at the top of Nob Hill, which means it's just two (VERY steep) blocks from Chinatown, and two of the main trolly lines pass just outside.There's not much within walking distance because of the steep hills, and the on-site restaurant prices are very high ($30 pp for breakfast).I would have been very pleased to get this on a Priceline stay, but at regular prices I'll be happier next time somewhere more walker-friendly.

<Content>The price was right! After getting this hotel on Priceline, I read some of the reviews from other travelers and was a bit scared about what I was in for.....I was prepared for a horrible room, snotty desk people, hard beds, etc.. I was plesantly relieved! We payed $80.00 for a nice room. I called the hotel in advance and requested a king bed which they gave me with no problem. We did not have a view of the street, but their courtyard. The desk staff and concierge were wonderful. The hotel was extremely quiet and was located right next to two of SF's most expensive hotels on Nob Hill. We walked down the STEEP hill to Union Square for breakfast at Sears Pancake House. We had wonderful Swedish pancakes and made the walk back to the hotel....WHEW!!! A real workout. The only downfall is the parking fee of 43.00. But that is SF, parking is expensive. I would recommend this hotel again.

<Content>There are better places to stay I go to San Francisco on business several times a year and have usually stayed at the Stanford Court. My last couple visits were less than satisfactory. I recommended the hotel to other co-workers who stayed there and they did not receive complimentary coffee. When I wrote to the management, it was checked out and determined that one WAS delivered (tho the time stated was after the guest checked out!!) and the other one just slipped through the cracks or some such thing. I was told that on my next visit, I would be given an upgraded room with a view. When I stayed there again (Feb 2005), I brought the letter that said I'd be given an upgraded room and was told that the manager who wrote the letter no longer worked there. The room I got was an interior room with NO view! The following day, I stopped at the vending machine on the 2nd floor to get bottled water and the machine dispensed soda instead. I brought it to the front desk for either a refund or replacement and the clerk asked a bellboy to get me some bottled water to replace it and he said that there was none in the fridge. The clerk then told me that WARM water was better for me than cold anyway. I just said that I had paid for cold water. I went back to my room and a while later, housekeeping brought me some warm bottled water. As others have said in reviews, the location is great, but the hotel itself worn and tired, some of the staff ok, others indifferent at best. Personally, I won't stay there again. Grosvenor Suites is right around the corner and a better deal.

<Content>Terrible bed and snotty staff. The offer of free coffee certainly does not balance out the horrid mattress, or the snotty front desk staff. We booked a room with a king-sized bed but discovered that we had been put in a room with a queen-sized bed. When we inquired, we were told that the hotel considers a request for bed size but that they can't guarantee such a request unless the hotel guarantees bed size at the time the reservation is made. In other words, you have to even know to ask for such a guarantee. Talk about double talk. There was no attempt at an apology from the counter person or the manager. It was like talking to a wall. Their attitude was bad enough -- but the bed was absolutely horrid. And I'm not talking size -- I'm talking the absence of even minimal comfort. My husband and I rolled toward a depression in the middle of the bed, and it felt as if the bed had no padding whatsoever. It was so hard that my hip bones ached the next morning. The only difference between the bed and the floor would have been that, if we had slept on the floor, we wouldn't have rolled together. We didn't ask for or expect much of a view, but the windows opened to a dark alley and a view of the moldy wall of the building across the alleyway. The towel heater would have been a nice touch -- if it worked. But the absence of a fan in the bathroom was not offset by the nonfunctional towel heater, or the tiny robes offered for guest's use. No, the room wasn't outrageously expensive (although parking was). The room and the bed were just not acceptable. I've had better rest at a Holiday Inn.

<Content>Great hotel and service We stayed at the Renaissance Stanford Court for three nights in September 2004. The service was excellent and the staff members were all helpful and friendly. We loved the location, close to public transportation and also close enough to walk to several attractions. Our room was very comfortable, quiet and peaceful and we loved the little luxuries of turndown service and morning tea delivered to our door.On our next visit to San Francisco, we will definitely stay here again!

<Content>A real treat! I stayed 3 nights in a fantastic room overlooking California street. The service was great! The staff was very pleasant. Considering that the posted room rate was $250 a night, I am shocked to read some of the comments other writers has left especially considering they paid around $80. Parking in the city is expensive at ALL hotels. I cannot believe some complained about it when their room was so highly discounted. I really enjoyed that the valet would have my rental car ready at a moments call. But with two criss-crossing cable car lines just outside the hotel door it was seldom used. It was nice to come back after sight seeing to find the beds turned down and a robe layed out. Such nice little touches that I didn't recieve when staying at other more expensive hotel. I suggest you give them a try.

<Content>Good room, pleasant service I was worried about the type of room and service we would receive as we booked the hotel through Priceline for 48 GBP per night and previous reviewers expressed that staff at the hotel weren't very nice if you went through priceline; but I was pleasantly surprised. We stayed from Jan 5th to Jan 7th. The staff at the desk were very nice and not snobbish at all, and we had a good room, perhaps not what everyone would expect form a four star hotel but it had all the amenities we needed, it was clean, and a good size. I would recommend staying there, it's also in a great location.

<Content>great christmas stay 12/22 - 12/30 First the good, we arrived without a stroller for my younger child. When we asked where to purchase one the front dest person told us they have them to loan in the hotel. We used it for entire stay. The coffee service was wonderful, even the day i forgot to order I called down and within minutes we had our beverages. My son loves getting hot coco (something that dosent happen to often at home). Next the bad, though my room was clean twice a day, with two little ones you need it. After a few days our robes and shampoo's were not replaced so we had to call down for more. This did happen more than once.The hotel has a great Sleigh in the lobby during the holiday season. Though i feel overcharged for parking ($41 per night) our car was always out front and ready to go when we called. Just in case you were wondering there is nowhere else to park in the area, this area is all hotels. For the area NOB Hill we got a great deal on priceline of about $80 per night. Just wish we could have bid on the parking. Overall, Thanks for the great stay.

<Content>Loved it! Just returned from a 6 night stay and our verdict is that this is an excellent hotel. The wakeup call with complimentary tea/coffee was brilliant and always ontime. Our room on the 6th floor, overlooking the inner courtyard roof, was clean and well furnished. The bed was very comfortable and the room quiet. As others have said the location is perfect, at the crossroads of the cablecar lines and a short (steep) walk downhill to union square. There is also a complimentary town car service ( excellent ) for short journeys. All the staff were friendly and helpful, the lounge was fine and the food very good. We would have no hesitation in staying at this hotel again.

<Content>What's all the hype? With all the hype that this hotel is given, I was disappointed with the quality of the hotel room. The lobby, location and staff were top-notch, however the rooms themselves were depressing and that's what really matters. Their heated towel racks didnt' do much but I will say that their morning complimentary beverage delivery was great.

<Content>Horrible Horrible save your money! Booked through priceline. $76 a night. Got the most horrible room, with a mattress you could feel the springs through. Room was a relic of the seventies, I doubt they even washed the bedspread since then. It was very tacky and looked like a motel 6 room.We were told we could upgrade to a deluxe room for $50!! Insane!Not only that but the front desk was very rude about us booking through Priceline, very snotty and said - you booked through Priceline- that's what you get.Horrible Horrible. Never again!One of the WORST hotels I have ever stayed in, that includes all other 4 star hotels I booked through Priceline in the past in NY, Paris, LA and SF.

<Content>Great place to Stay Stayed at the Hotel from 12/10/04-12/16/04. Reserved through Priceline at $80 a night for standard room. The Renissance is known for a theme like atmosphere and this hotel lived up to it. I felt like I was in a Hotel that was that was a little older like an old hollywood hotel (intentionaly done). The view wasnt the best since we overlooked part of the Mark Hopkins Hotel but they have to have rooms all the way around. Turn Down service was great and the staff was helpful and friendly. But after all of that I have to say location location location. On top of Nob hill at Powell and California we would walk down to union square or China Town and catch a trolly car back and no panhndling like I would have dealt with anywhere else. I would definetly go back.

<Content>Favorite SF hotel This is a perfect balance of quality, service and price. I have stayed at several SF hotels, but when I found this one I became a regular. Service is wonderful, and I don't say that casually. One of the better restaurants in the city! Across the street is a great health club (free for Stanford guests). Love this hotel. Highly recommended!!

<Content>Fantastic Service My financee and I stayed at the Renaissance Stanford Court (12/01 to 12/05). What a great hotel for a great price. We did priceline and paid $75/night. As soon as we arrived, the person behind the desk voluntarily upgraded us to a deluxe room. The bed was so comfortable and the bedding set was so great we want to buy the same set for home. The whole staff was simply the best. From the turn down service with chilled water at your bedside, to the complimentary town car service, you will be glad you stayed there.

<Content>charming and old fashioned Got this hotel for $70/night through priceline, and we were quite pleased. Room with 2 queens was very spacious, comfortable, and quiet, and service top notch. The Stanford Court will not be everyone's cup of tea--it's kind of old fashioned and the rooms and furnishings are deliberately retro, down to the pocket doors leading into the bathroom and the ancient mini tv/radio in the bath area. everything has been updated recently, but in kind of a glamourous hotel of yesteryear way. it does NOT look like a westin, at all, but i liked it quite a lot. several nice luxury touches, like the bathrobes, turndown with chocolates, free shoeshine. another plus is that on weekdays they have complimentary town car service within the city. beds were excellent and the service/lobby area were grand. it's a bit removed from the bustle of union sq, but not too far out of the way. i liked the fact that the surrounding area was quiet and not teeming with panhandlers, like some areas of union sq can be. we parked on the street nearby without any problems.

<Content>Always a pleasure I visit San Francisco twice each year and always stay at Stanford Court. The rooms vary - some are really wonderful but the others are fine - they are all in good order and well appointed. It is delightful to get your morning tea/coffee with your wakeup call and the staff is uniformly helpful and professional. My friends and I particularly like to have a first cocktail in the lovely lobby bar and the doormen and valets are always quite benevolent to my friends in terms of parking briefly in the lot right in front of the door. The location can't be beat. I wouldn't consider staying anywhere else!

<Content>Pretty Good We stayed at the Stanford Court on 18th Sept for 4 nights, I have to say the location is very good, we did not bother with breakfast in the hotel as we knew it would be very expensive so we found a few restaurants near by which were very good value. The view from the room was exceptional but the room was looking tired and I was a little disappointed for the price we paid and the description being luxurious. The bathroom and dressing area really needed to be knocked down and re-designed, it was nice however to get tea and coffee in the mornings. I think really what you pay for this hotel is the location.

<Content>Disappointing! The pluses, the Stanford Court has a great location, we had a wonderful city view from our room, and the mattress and linens were top notch. Unfortunately it went down from there. The rooms are tired looking, even though they have recently been re-painted and wallpapered, along with new rugs and drapes. The furnishings are old and tired, a cane and rattan headboard just doesn't cut it in a luxury hotel. Some basics like an in-room safe and mini-bar are nowhere to be found. Coke and Ice Machines are located on the 2nd floor, not very convenient. A circa 1980's TV took up half the bathroom counterspace. Bathroom and dressing areas are tired and worn. Breakfast at the restaurant is top dollar, in the $30 (with tax and tip) per person range. I guess the room rates are reasonable for San Francisco, but the hotel is need of renovation. Even the lobby and lobby bar are tired and seem like they haven't been renovated in years.

<Content>Loved the Hotel Our stay at the Renaissance Stanford Court was great. The pot of coffee that comes to your room with your paper was a nice touch, as well as the heated towel rack in the bathroom. Room Service was good and they provide you with extra towels if needed. The entire staff is very helpful, and the bellmen called to check on our shuttlle to the airport. The Concierge was helpful in giving directions and restaurant ideas. The lobby lounge has a nice menu, as we had dinner there our last night.

<Content>OK but rooms look tired... My partner and I stayed at the Renaissance Stanford Court Hotel on the Labor Day weekend 3-6 September 2004. We arrived at 9:30pm after a long flight from Australia.On check-in, we were greeted by a very helpful clerk who said that the hotel was extremely full due to the Labor Day weekend. That meant that our preference of King Bed and Non-Smoking room could not be met, which was frustrating seeing we had requested this when booking six weeks earlier. We eventually settled on the smoking room with the King Bed, which the clerk assured us was one of the bigger rooms.I can say that we were disappointed on entering the room. Whilst the smoke smell was not too bad (2 non smokers), the general quality of the room looked tired and old. The canopy over the top of the bed was broken, and our hairdryer didn't work and needed replacement. We tried to use the in-room internet via the television, and after 2 minutes use found that it did not support Google's gmail. We had to ring and request the charge be removed from our account, and also found out that general internet would then be $2.50 for five minutes in the business centre, which we found to be very expensive.We drank in the bar after returning from dinner on the Saturday night, and after one drink we were told the bar was closing (12:45am) despite advertising that it was opened until 2am. We were really trying to support the services of the hotel but felt let down.The location atop Nob Hill is excellent, however the cable cars were so full that we walked a few times up and down the hills. Good exercise!Overall, a stately hotel in its time, however the Renaissance Stanford Court really needs to lift its game if seriously aiming for the business travel and high end leisure market. If the rooms were refurbished and the facilities more accessible, we would probably stay again due to the location.

<Content>Stanford Cout Thinks a Little to Highly of Themselves The Stanford Court is nice but not that nice. This place would like to think of themselves as the Ritz-Carlton and they are not. The rates are overpriced and room service is ridiculous. For what they portray of themselves I would expect comfortable beds with nice fluffy pillows and soft blankets. Not so. Comforter looks like something out of a Red Carpet Inn and pillows were tiny and flat. This place isn't bad it definietely isn't anything special. A couple good things, the cable car stop is right outside on the corner which is convenient (although walking is more efficient than the cable cars. Ride it you'll understand). Also the staff is knowledgeable and curtious. The food is delicious if you eat there at all. Overall though it isn't worth it. If you want to spend your money and get quality stay at the Ritz-Carlton across the street.

<Content>OK rooms, Superior service! Just returned from a wonderful three day weekend at the Stanford Court in San Francisco. I would rate the rooms a three star experience, while the service gets a four or five star. The Stanford Court was converted from an apartment building to a hotel in the 1970's and some of the interior design ideas of that era are still evident in the rooms, especially the dressing area and bath room with its white marble wall tiles and wood paneled partitions next to the 70's era vanity and sink, with chrome framed mirror. The overall design of the standard rooms is what I would call 'old English country style' with floral print bed bedspreads and drapes with blue carpeting. I believe a typical conservative grandmother would feel very comfortable here. The quality of the furnishings is good, but not anything special. The standard rooms are moderate in size with lots of light from windows that actually open for fresh air, which is great as long as you are not on the busy Powell or California street side of the building. The service on the other hand was exceptional. Every single staff member we encountered was very polite and helpful. Even though we arrived two hours prior to normal check-in time, there was no problem checking in early. The concierge desk was extremely helpful, especially when it came to securing a lunch reservation for us on short notice at one of the city's hip and hot new restaurants 'The Slanted Door' at the newly renovated Ferry Building. Although I would stay here again, I prefer being closer to the Union Square area, theatres, and the Muni Line on Market St., and not having to climb up Nob Hill to get back to the hotel since riding the cable car during the day is not convenient due to the long lines of people that are always waiting to get on.

<Content>Decent for the Right Price I was only slightly disappointed with the Quality Room I got at the Renaissance Stanford Court. The room was a little tired, in need of updating, and had no view (unless you consider an alley a nice view). It was clean and offered a few nice ammenities including a heated towel bar and robes. The bed was nothing special --standard sheets and a basic blanket (the deluxe rooms have upgraded bed linens and ammenities). The turn-down service and courtesy a.m. beverage service and paper delivered to the room were a nice touch. That being said, I say I was only slightly disappointed because I got a Priceline rate of $75 per night and I consider that particular room, with the added ammenities and services, a bargain at that rate. However, had I paid the standard weekday rate of $169 for the same room, I would have been a little more upset. You can go right down the street and stay at the fabulous Orchard Hotel for a lot less.

<Content>Perfect location, great hotel! Stayed here 3 nights midweek for a 2 day conference. For the conference rate of $149.00 I thought the hotel was excellent. Service, room, attention to detail, food, were all above average. Perfect location on Nob Hill with cable car stop virtually outside the door. Would stay here again when I'm in San Francisco.The entire staff - from front desk to concierge to doormen were first rate!

<Content>So far, my favorite perch in San Francisco So far, my favorite perch in SF. We had a small but lovely room (extraordinarily comfortable bed) with bay windows overlooking the city.Yes, you pay for some extra$ (martinis and valet parking), but the concierge couldn't have been more helpful. No attitude toward our (well-behaved) kids which is unusual in SF. We parked up the street to help meet our budget. Take your kids to the hilltop park a few steps up Nob Hill and across from Grace Cathedral.

<Content>Good deal during mid-week My wife, 12 year old son, and I just returned from a one night, mid-week stay. We got a nice room that had a southerly view towards Union Square. It was elegantly appointed, clean, and had a very comfortable bed. The windows open, thus allowing the nice cool, fresh air inside. Although we were on the fourth floor, the outside noise was not bad, especially after the cable cars stopped running for the night. The location makes a walk to Union Square easy (walking back..and uphill is a different matter.) We booked our room through Priceline ($100.00). With tax, that comes to about $120.00. Parking is another $39.00, so I instead parked at the Sutter-Stockton garage (three blocks away) and paid $18.00 for 4:00 pm to 9:30 am the next day. The only negative was the snooty attitude of the front desk staff when we asked for a room with a view. She said that the hotel doesn't assign view rooms to people who book through a discount online service; however, she nevertheless gave us a room with a good view.By the way, Priceline was $79.00 better than anything we found on orbitz, expedia, etc.

<Content>Loved the Stanford Court Hi,We spent 3 nights at the Standford Court and loved it. It's right at the top of Nob Hill so bear in mind, it's easy going down to Union Square but walking back up, can be tough but saying that we did it twice and then the rest of the times we got the cable car which is just outside the hotel. Very central to everything. Loved the complimentary coffee/tea and newspaper every morning with wake up call. Staff very friendly. Room was lovely, top floor. Noticed another post mentioning the tv, but it's on a shelf which you can pull out and we just turned the tv around to face the bed and it was grand. Would defo go back to this hotel again if staying in San Fran.

<Content>pleasant experience Just came back from a 2 night stay last week. The room and bath were small but well furnished. Very comfy beds. My one complaint is that the TV set was perpendicular to the beds and the seating area, making watching TV from your bed virtually impossible, and you have to do an extreme body twist to see the set from the chairs.The staff was very nice (same with the waiters in the restaurant).Be careful if you plan on lots of sightseeing, the only sane way is to call a taxi or take the cable cars, since the hotel is situated on very steep hill, making it a workout even if you only walk one block.

<Content>True Excellence! My partner and I spent one night at the Stanford Court after extending our vacation by one night. The hotel is excellent in every sense of the word. The staff was very friendly and attentive. The lobby is classy. The room was small, but we don't spend much time in the hotel room on vacation. The bathroom was spotlessly clean, and the towel warmer was a nice touch. The extra amenities including cotton balls and q-tips were nice as well. We were especially impressed with the complimentary beverage that was outside our door when we received the wake-up call. We were given a choice of coffee, tea, or hot chocolate. I highly recommend this hotel on top of Knob Hill. It is within walking distance of local attractions, and a cable car stop is at the corner within feet of the hotel.

<Content>Good Experience, Mostly This is a nicely appointed hotel. Very comfortable, though not ultra-modern. The location is great: right on the cable car routes, near downtown, Chinatown, North Beach, etc. Well-known (and expensive) restaurant on premises. We enjoyed our stay.Down side: If have a car, the hotel charges $38/day plus 14% tax. There's a garage at 1045 California Street, a block and a half away, that charges $27, but without in and out priviledges.The first words out of the receiptionist's mouth upon checking in were, Oh, you booked with Expedia. We can't guarantee room-type with third-party bookings, with a tone of condescension. Nice way to make one feel like a second-class citizen. If they don't like Expedia customers, they should not accept Expedia bookings!

<Content>Made our Holiday We stayed at the Stanford Court from 27th May for 4 nights. We upgraded to a junior suite which was gorgeous and had fabulous views of the city. The staff were keen to help and were very attentive, very quick to open doors for you and generally very polite. We had room service on a few occasions; the food was always hot and tasted delicious and it was always prompt and beautifully displayed. We didn't find it too overpriced but you don't expect it to be cheap when you stay in Nob Hill. We would definitely stay there again, the sooner the better.

The guestroom was lovely with a nice view of the city from atop Nob Hill. The doormen were very quick to arrange taxis and the concierge can get a dinner reservation on a moment's notice. I will definitely stay here again.

<Content>Decent We stayed at the Stanford Court May 30th.The Stanford Court has a great location. However, rooms are small, and the AC doesn't work well on warm days (warmer than 70 degrees). The concierge was unavailable, and bordered on being rude when asked questions.

<Content>Expensive but quaint This is a nicely appointed property atop Nob Hill. The Cable Cars stop just outside the front gate. Otherwise, the hill means very steap walks from the hotel and in and out of the cul de sac entry. Not a good option for wheelchairs or mobility impaired folks.The lobby bar was almost always empty. The $19 cocktails are probably to blame. The waiter we encountered was detached and seemed bothered to assist us.The front desk staff was poorly informed and reluctant to help. I witnessed a few guests struggling to be assisted at the front desk.Rooms are nice, but small, and feature awkward pocket doors and strange european light switches. The towel warmers are sweet, but the shower doors made getting in and out of the tub a challenge.

<Content>Stay on Nob Hill We stayed at the Stanford Court from April 19 until April 24, 2004. I called ahead and asked for 2 adjoining rooms for our group. The staff was very courteous, the lobby beautiful, and the rooms we requested were waiting for us. Hot tea and a newspaper in the A.M., clean and lovely rooms, and turndown service at night! What a nice hotel! We were at the intersection of the two cable car lines, 2 blocks from China Town, and 3 blocks from Union Square. Sightseeing was so convenient. I will stay there next time I go to San Francisco.

<Content>Easter in San Francisco We had a short but excellent visit to the Stanford Court Hotel for Easter. Being a bit jet-lagged on the first night, we ate in the Fournos Oven restaurant on site - and what a great experience.....fine dining and attentive service. The hotel is right on the junction of California and Powell, so all the main sites are an easy cable car (sorry - I want to keep calling them trams) ride away. The room was comfortable and quiet, and the complimentary morning coffee always there on time to wake us up. If you're thinking about it....go go go

<Content>Great Hotel - Rooms need a facelift The Stanford Court is a beautiful hotel. The staff is friendly, the location is perfect (beautiful views), the lobby is breathtaking, and the service is first class. The only problem is the rooms. They are clean and have all the amenities you'll need, but many 4 star hotels in San Francisco have nicer rooms.

<Content>overrated My family and I stayed in the stanford court for four nights from 29th december. I had booked a deluxe family room almost six months previously and was very disappointed to be told on arrival that this type of room was not being held for me. the room we were allocated was very small for five people. despite this we did have a very pleasant stay and all the staff were extremely friendly and polite particularly the bar staff and the concierge. I think the hotel is slightly overrated but would stay there again

<Content>Stanford Court was a wonderful experience We stayed at the Stanford Court during an all-too-brief visit to San Francisco over the Thanksgiving holiday. From our first encounter with the front desk until our check-out, the employees could not have been friendlier or more helpful. We had a beautiful view of the city and bay, and the linens and bedding were unbelievably comfortable. The Stanford Court, though much smaller than its Nob Hill neighbors, is every bit as enjoyable. We would definitely stay here again!

<Content>Great Location and Beautiful Hotel We were close to everything and the staff at the hotel was very nice and attentive. A cool thing that they do there is complentary hot chocolate or coffee at you door in the morning when you wake up. The parking is expensive so try to use public transportation. It has a nice workout facility but you won't need it after walking all of those hills.

<Content>Ugh! We arrived to a magnificnet lobby but the room was dreary and had no heat. We changed rooms to one with dirty carpet and again no heat. A bellhop brought us a heater, but at those prices that was not acceptable. The bellhop said that the hotel is due for renovation. We left and went elsewhere.

<Content>attentive staff We had a lovely stay at this hotel. The staff was particularly helpful. The front desk agent came around himself to take our items rather than calling someone else or having us take them back to the bell desk. When we arrived back in the evening we were soaked through from getting caught in the rain in Sausalito they automatically sent us additional towels. There were other kindnesses. It felt as though they were making a special effort to take care of us.

<Content>I wonder why this place is so highly rated . . . After a recent weekend stay at the Stanford Court, my partner and I are both wondering why it is so highly rated among San Francisco hotels. True, there was nothing really wrong with the place. But, there is nothing really special about it either. Service was good, although distant and less than welcoming. The room was clean and comfortable, though without any sense of style. Nice location, but a real hike to Union Square and back. In short, functional but charmless. At these prices and in this city, I feel sure you can do better.

<Content>Excellent Hotel This is a wonderful hotel. the rooms are beautiful and well kept. Ask for the 8th floor it is beautiful and looks out over the bay. The staff is great and knowledgeable, the location is perfect for getting around, whether you choose to drive, take the cable cars or get a cab. Also ask Jonathon about seafood restaurants, and he will direct you well. You will have a great time here.
