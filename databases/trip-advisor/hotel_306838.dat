<Content>gorgeous I stayed at the Aston for 1 week. We booked the Onyx all inclusive package for my honeymoon before traveling around the island. Overall the hotel was great for the money spent. We had a deluxe ocean view room and it was stunning. The room was huge with a nice bathroom, a/c, and flat screen TV. For the most part very clean. We loved the pool and the grounds were well manicured and clean. The beach was mediocre and the ocean just okay (rocks, coral and seaweed, it wasn't the crystal clear blue sea I was expecting). Hawkers not so bad, you just have to ignore them and not give them any attention. A lot of water sports so you need to be careful when swimming in the ocean. If there was anything I would suggest improvement on it would be the food. The nightly buffets were pretty much the same thing with slight variations. Thankfully they had one restaurant that was a la carte. The staff were fantastic. I would stay there again.

<Content>we want to go back Arrived after a two night stay in HK. Aston was great. everything you could want from a holiday with family. The rooms were spacious and cleaned everyday. The hotel staff were very friendly any problems were dealt with quickly. We all had massages and spent most of the time eating drinking and sunning ourselve. All inclusive, we got our monies worth within a couple of days. For what we payed, it was real value for money.

<Content>Fantastic Resort! This resort is amazing!! We arived at the Aston after a 16 hour flight and were imediatly impressed with the hotel as well as the staffs service and hospitality. This hotel is absolutely beautiful, the pool area was amazing and the grounds are very well kept. The beach area was much nicer than the other hotel we have stayed in in Bali, which was in the Tuban area. And you did'nt have to put up with being constantly harrased by hawkers which made for a relaxing stay. We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and now wish we had stayed their for the whole 8. The Restrants were very nice and so was the Biwana spa. Would definantly stay here again. Would reccomend to ANYONE. LOVED IT!

<Content>Bogan central! My husband and i stayed at the Aston for 2 nights in November of 2008. We had come from two places we could very highly reccomend, The Sofitel in Seminyak (stunning!) and Jati Homestay in Sanur (gorgeous and cheap).For the price we paid, The Aston just wasn't worth the money. It's not REALLY bad, just not good. Any service such as help with bags or general questions needs to be asked for and is offered with a somewhat reluctant attitude. We stayed in a suite which had a nice view but no aircon and and a few cockroaches. We were boiling without aircon or a fan and you can't really sleep with the balcony door open or mossies come in.The pool area is ok and looks out over the beach. But this place seems to appeal to a certain demographic of middle aged bogans (Australians and lots of Russians) who roll around in the pool with drinks in their hands getting drunker and louder as the hours pass. A peaceful swim through the 'waterfall' will no doubt bring you face to face with one of the many graceless couples shamelessly gropping each other for all to see. As i lay on the sunbed sipping a very badly made and expensive cocktail and the sent of sewerage wafted over from the bar area with the breeze i thought, i may as well have gone to Surfers Paradise.On a more positive note, the shopping at Bali Galleria is great for suveniers and clothes and even cheaper is Hardies where many locals shop. A shuttle bus takes you to Bali Galleria for free. A taxi to Hardies is around 30,000Hope this has helped you, Selamat Tingal!

<Content>graet value just got back from the aston what a great holiday!!the hotel is well kept with large rooms and well kept gardens.the food was nice sometimes only just warm but the majority of the time nice.we travelled with singapore airlines from manchester via singapore,this is the best airline i have flown with nothing was too much trouble. we went on several trips elephant park 2 hr drive but well worth it you get to see bali on the way there also a 2hr trip white water rafting what a laugh!! well worth it.we booked a taxi driver for the day 500,000 ind rupiah(拢37) he took us all over the island we were gone 11 hrs and saw loads barong dancing, wood carvers rice terraces temple on the lake temple in the sea all beautiful. we are definitely coming back to bali but we will stop in the grand bali mirage about half a mile down the road a lot bigger and better hotel. the aston is in my opinion a 4 star hotel but great value the grand bali mirage is about 拢200 deared but we walked round it and it is impressive. a slight moan about the aston is you have to sign for every meal and every drink and there is a differrent menu for all inclusive all in all a good hotel and well worth the money. the best beach we saw was dreamland but you get pestered with the sellers ALL day. we fell in love with bali the people are soooo friendly we will be going back in a few years

<Content>great hotel - would reccomend all inclusive package great hotel - in a quieter part of island on Benoa near Nusa Dua - you dont get hassled by beach traders and hotel is beautifuly maintained. We went for the all inclusive turqoise package which was great, unlike some all inclusives this was good - there were some rwstrictions on branded alcohol but the local stuff was good. food is excellently presented witha choice of italian. buffet and a la carte restaurant, even the buffet was varied each evening - i reccomend the mongolian stir fry night. The italian restaurant has a great position over looking the main road and the food is beautifully presented. it is good but will not win awards for the authenticity, but saying that you shouldnt go to Bali to eat italian. the rooms were large and well presented and althoiugh there was some problem with the air con this was soon fixed once reported. The hotel it self is great and the pool is large with lots of different areas, staff were excellent.i would definatly stay there again.

<Content>Quality Resort and Extremely Good Value The Aston represents exceptional value. It enjoys a beachfront postion alongside a strip of other resorts in Nusa Dua. Our room was gigantic, with a private balcony overlooking a serene pond. It is not as elaborate as some of the five star resorts in the area, but is still a luxury stay. A bargian. I would definitely say here again.

<Content>Lovely place but service could be better My family and I have just returned from a 4 days 3 night stay at the Aston. The view is lovely, the setting great, the beach nice, the weather cool and the setting really charming. The rooms are average as the furniture is really old. The air-conditioning in one of our rooms conked in the middle of the night resulting in technicians clambering into the ceiling at 1am. When we got there only 2 of our 3 rooms were ready and that too after half an hour of waiting. All in all an average bet.

<Content>Nice hotel for the price but not 5 stars Overall the hotel is very nice with a great pool and friendly staff. It is not a 5 star quality hotel though. The rooms are not well cleaned and the furniture smells musty. For the price, the quality is quite good. The beach isn't so great and the area is very boring if you are looking for things to do. Good place for people looking for some peace and quiet at a fair price. As long as you don't expect it to be perfect, you will enjoy the hotel.

<Content>Great Hotel We booked the hotel via internet for 4 people, 2 deluxe rooms. Upon check-in the reception staff provided us a deluxe room + a deluxe suite, a huge room without any additional charge! The 2 rooms had a common door, so actually we were together with our friends allways, in a huge, nice room! (With 3 toilettes...)The hotel staff is very friendly, the lady at the swimming pool know some words in Hungarian. :-)The sea isn't that good as the hotel, go to Dreamland instead, the taxi driver will know, where is it. It takes about 45 minutes to get there, but that's a real paradise!

<Content>No for swimmer! The hotel is oke, the swimming pool is oke. But...but if you want to swim in the sea, do not go there! The beach is terrible: full with jatskis (here is the station) and with motorboats. Noisy, noisy, noisy. (In whole March was the water very dirty by plantes.) And too many sellers, who are standing and standing before you and do not late you in peace... You can not relax if you lie on the beach. (I was on more other beaches in Bali, here and in Kuta was the worst).

<Content>Loved it!!!! My family and I (me, hubby, 5 kids) arrived in Bali on March 17th from Perth. First impressions of hotel was stunning. The porter/bellboy was jovial and entertained us with his brilliant humour. The kids rooms (2 x ocean view rooms) were ready and they settled in however they tried to put hubby and I in similiar room when I had paid for a suite facing the ocean. We waited over an hour for things to be sorted with no apology. It was not a good start. In the end we made our own way to the room.have to say the suite was perfect, I cannot fault it in anyway except to say I wish the balcony was bigger but that was no real problem.After the initial disappointment at check in, we settled in nicely to the room and loved every minute of our stay. The staff at reception we all found to be not very friendly but everyone else was great. We made friends with the pool bar staff and staff at the spa and also the melasti restaurant.My son had his 14th birthday there and they really made it special. All the staff at the restaurant sang to him. The pool bar is great. Pool fabulous. Great food especially the buffet brekkie. Spa treatments were to die for and I had a massage or treatment everyday!!! The kids loved the beach and did many water sports and it was completely safe for them. There are a few shops in the area opposite the hotel but just a 5 min drive is the main Nusa Dua markets and we found it the best place to shop as it was quiet unlike Kuta. The kids got better bargains there than in Kuta so we stuck with these markets and saved the trauma of busy Kuta!!!I personally like the hotel. Some say it is dated but I never really found that. the rooms were very clean.We all enjoyed it so much that we are going back again for Christmas!!

<Content>Good Resosrt This is our 3rd time at the Aston Bali, perfect location with shopping and restaurants within easy walking distance.After our 3rd time rooms need a little more updating. But for value for money big rooms and location this would have to be the best.The staff are fantastic and very friendly and also very easy to understand. If you make the effort to learn the language you will be even more comfortable. We love Bali and the people are very easy going. We also noticed that it is a lot cleaner than 3 years ago. Kuta is not as friendly and more pushy but cheaper for shopping bargains. DVDs are a must and most work well.Best restaurant down the road from the Aston was The Nelayan Restaurant (ask for Diva) service was exceptional and food was divine. I do not like spicey food so I stuck to the usual sweet and sour and chicken snitzel, my husband tried everything, nothing is a problem they will do anything if you ask.We flew singapore airlines from Melbourne to Singapore with a 4 night stopover in Singapore then Singapore to Bali 8 nights at the Aston, the price was not much more than going direct to Bali.But be aware after arriving back in Melbourne we were hit with excess luggage payment with Tiger Airlines to get back to Hobart.

<Content>Old and overrated A month ago we stayed at the Aston for 2 weeks. Although the accomodation was cheap, it was for a reason. We were given a smoking room when I had requested a non-smoking room, and it took the staff over an hour to alocate us a room on a non-smoking floor. My partner and I also had to push 2 single beds together for the whole week as there was no Queen/Double bed for us. Both rooms were ordinary, old and the bathroom/toilet constantly stunk. We have been told that the resort was only ten years old, but the furnishings resembled something from the 70s. Breakfast here is fantastic. The beach was very ordinary, and you still get hassled by market vendors. The highlight of the stay is the Breakfast which is incredibly fresh and tasy, the restaurants at the hotel are also lovely and have a good pricetag for Hotels. I would not recommend staying at this hotel as there is nothing else around it within walking distance and it is Benoa, as opposed to the posh gated precinct of Nusa Dua.

<Content>Good value hotel - beautiful pool area I found it really hard to find a family room ( i.e. for 2 adults and 2 kids) in Bali that did not cost an absolute fortune. I tried for months to find the best place to stay for a good price. It was hard to make a decision.I came across the ASTON, and contacted direct, and got a good rate of us$119 for a seaview suite - 2 beds provided free for the kids . Great i thought. Cheaper than the hotel booking web sites. When we arrived, the hotel exterior appears impressive, and the lobby and bar areas are nice - lots of carved stonework. Good start. The room however, was a different story. It was very old and was overdue a renovation. I specifically asked for a renovated suite and was most miffed to end up with this huge but very outdated room. The reception staff said that the hotel was full and that there was no difference between the rooms. I beg to differ on that one ! Anyway, i put up with the room - after all, what do you expect for $119. In the end, it wasn't too much of a problem - the hospital type camp beds could be overlooked, the bathroom was large if run-down. But we had 2 tv's , and lots of space. I found out that there are renovated rooms - be very specific and ask for one. Also confirm what kind of sea view you have. The top floor appeared to have the best. Our so called seaview suite only had a sea view glimpse due to all the palm trees outside. Areas of the hotel are being renovated and it should be lovely when its all done. but the breakfast room isn't as yet. ITs very dark and dingy unless you sit outside in the morning heat. the breakfast buffet is just OK. Take your own tea bags from the room so you can have a half decent cup of tea. The best bit is the sea front part of the hotel. Lovely bech cafe with trendy furniture, and a nice evening cafe too . The service is with a smile, and the prices are OK. The pool is old, but GREAT. Basketball hoop in the pool with lots of balls for the kids. Volleyball net (deep pool area) , little grotto area. Plenty of corners for hiding. ITs also a zero entry type of pool, so its starts shallow, but parts are very deep. There are 2 bikes available for guest use too. The beach is clean and there are lots of loungers on it with comfy cushions. the sea is OK, nice and warm, but a bit sea-weedy, and the sea-weed tends to remain on the beach. But apart from this, the sand is lovely and clean and you can swim in the sea. The restaurant food was ok - nothing to shout about. However, the restaurant over the road - Coco's - is great. We had a seafood platter for 2 at us$22. IT was just great tasting food, superb friendly service and entertainment in the evenings too. WE had side trips by taxi (get one with a meter and make sure it works) to Kuta and jimbaran (for seafood). Kuta is busy, large and full of life - we like it although i wouldn't want to stay in the heart of it. Its great for shopping. Jimbaran was where we went to for the famous seafood . HUGELY EXPENSIVE - especially the lobster. I have no idea how much it should cost, but our meal for 2 (lobster, prawns and 1 fish filleted) was US$170. !!!!!. Give it a miss - you're not missing anything here. After the initial schock about the state of the room wore off, we agreed we had chosen a good place to stay. We visited a few other hotels and pool hopped . The Westin isn't worth the money in our opinion - at least not for a Family room. The hard rock in Kuta was ok, but very concretey, if you know what i mean. We were pleased we had chosen the ASTON and we definitlely would return.

<Content>Not bad, Not good... My husband and I stayed at the Aston in mid September and opted out of the all-inclusive option. We werent sure what to expect being it was our first trip to Indonesia but when we arrived at our hotel, it didnt fit with our expectations.The hotel itself is ok but a bit run down and is in need of some renos. The rooms are spacious and relatively clean but we were disappointed when we found ourselves in a smoking room even though we requested a non smoking. The bedsheets smelled a bit musty and the bathrooms were ok but sometimes smelled of sewage. There are 3 restaurants in the hotel and though we only checked out one of them and ordered from the waiters at the pool, we found the food expensive for what you got and didnt think the food was that great so we often opted to go to another resort or take a taxi to kuta or semynak for dinner where we found better deals and better food. The upside is that the staff are really friendly and the beach and pool are beautiful. If you are looking to get a couple of lounge chairs with an umbrella be sure to get up early. We found that by 9am there werent any available so we'd have to lay our towels on the grass by the pool to get some sun. Overall the resort was ok. Not the best but not the worst Ive been to. If my husband and I make it to Bali again we would probably choose another resort.

<Content>Middle of the road We stayed at the Aston for 4 nights and although the staff and hotel grounds are very nice overall we weren鈥檛 overly pleased. The rooms are cheap, modern and very clean however the grounds / pool are small and can get crowded. My partner made a number of reservations with the Spa and every time they stuffed it up, it was also very expensive. The cost of the room was cheap but the hotel more than makes it up in the cost of drinks and food (service charge not included) e.g. spirits cost about $12. The food was not anything to write home about and also pricy. The beach was very nice and plenty of water sports to keep you busy. My suggestion is if you stay here go for a short walk up and down the main road as there are some nice restaurants and you will save a lot of money over hotel prices.

<Content>great resort Upon arrival at the Aston bali my friend was already quite sick, during the stay she grew progressivley worse and the help that the staff provided was wonderful. They have an onsite docter who provided medication and when we were told that we could not fly home on the intended day because of the sickness, they very quickly organised for an extended stay and also on the last day one of the managers gave free late check out as my friend was still too sick to leave the hotel at normal checkout time. Also as my friend couldnt leave they let us choose any of the restaurant food and brought it too our room, instead of only having the room service food options.The hotel is located right on the beach which is great. Also a few minutes walk away there are lots of water activites to do. The hotel also has a lovely spa and a large pool with pool bar.That is the second time I have stayed at the Aston, and I would definatley recommend it.

<Content>Loved the Aston, Would definately recommend! My partner and I stayed at the Aston for 7 nights on our very first trip to Bali in June 2006. We have nothing but positives to say about our stay, and I read some of the negative comments from fellow travellers with surprise! The staff were very welcoming and helpful, and the location was great.Favourite Parts: The fruit drink and cold towel on arrival, the spacious rooms with wood floors, huge bathrooms, flower filled bathtub every morning, great pool area, free shuttles to Kuta, range of fantastic restaurants right oppositeNot so Favourite: Lack of variety at breakfast! Also, the lack of variety on the TV but really, if you are in Bali to watch TV, you might as well go home..Tips: There is a great little laundry opposite the hotel if you don't fancy paying US dollars to get your undies washed, I got a whole suitcase full of washing beautifully laundered for about 75 rp. Also, there is a convenience store about a 2min walk down the road where you can buy your Bintang, water and snacks extremely cheaply if you want

<Content>We loved the Aston..... We recently spent three weeks at the Aston  had a wonderful time. The Aston in my opinion,is a good 3 1/2 star hotel.The pool area is very nice, maintained well and when we were there ,pretty quiet,which was great!The staff at the Aston are very friendly and helpful.We had an ocean view room and it had a great ocean view,no craning of the neck like someone else posted.(room 422 by the way!.)The rooms were a little dated but very clean. They are undergoing renos at the Aston  we saw one of the renovated rooms, it was extremely nice and we were told that all rooms will be renovated within the next year.The restaraunts at the Aston we OK,nothing amazing.Having said that we ate out most nights..and would recommend* Casa Bella* and *Bagus* as two of our favourites.The only let down for us during our stay was that the ocean was not particularly clean..we saw quite few a plastic bags, cartons floating around. We would have liked to be able to swim in the ocean, but stuck to the pool for swimming instead. The beach outside the Aston is groomed daily and was therefore clean. There are plenty of sunloungers both on the beach and around the pool.Try the reflexology/massage out by the pool under the thatched canopy.it is wonderful...a drink at happy hour and then an hr massage..Bliss!To conclude: A great hotel at a very competative price.

<Content>Great Value, Very little to criticise, would recommend for a quiet trip to Bali We have just returned from an excellent 8 nights at the Aston and would recommend this resort to those who want total relaxation and are not interested in doing much shopping or exploring. The staff are terrefic and extremely prompt and efficient, nothing was to much trouble.Our ocean view room was good, however room description could possibly have been described as ocean glimpse. The pool area was wonderful and could not fault the cleanliness. Beach access was very easy and the resort also has sun lounges on the sand for those who prefer to lay at the beach.Our only suggestion would be that there are more shuttles into Kuta or even Legian. Having been to Bali on many occasions we did not realise how many times we would want to go into the main tourist area, shopping or alternate restaurants. Restaurants near the hotel are superb. The best being Makum Sate. What a delightful surprise, this is owned by the same chef who has Bumbi and you just could not fault either, The LaScala, Coco's and Casa Bella also served great food and typical Balinese service, could not fault. The cost for meals is higher than in the main tourist precincts however why quibble over a couple of dollars each.If you are after a total break and do not have a partner whose first sentence (no maybe second) each morning is what should we do today, then this is the resort for you.

<Content>Only if you really really have to..... We arrived at The Aston from Ubud to be waved through the security barriers without being stopped or checked. We were then at liberty to drag our suitcases up a steep slope to an indiferent staff at reception. Once checked in, we were invited to enjoy a sweet sticky fruit cocktail and refresh ourselves with a cooling flannel, very worn, thin and some shade of grey! Our suite was an odd collection of furniture haphazardly arranged in a dirty room. It looked as if this room had been out of use for some time. Breakfast was served in an overcrowded dining room which smelt less than inviting, and the quality of food did not seem to be particularly good. The beach was also dirty and access to the sea was difficult. Our second day was spent sight-seeing on a fantastic trip to visit the temples. On returning to the hotel in the evening, a large cockroach type of insect was happily making it's way around the bathroom. This was reported to the reception staff who apparently informed house-keeping to deal with it. We went out for dinner and decided that due to the difficulties encountered and the lack of care from the staff we would check out and stay elsewhere. The reception staff seemed at bit surprised at our decision. We had paid for a three night stay and no refund was offered, but we were charged for a twenty minute internet usage. Horrid, horrid, horrid!!

<Content>an amazing and great value hotel we stayed at this hotel twice in two weeks (small break in middle) and it was superb! we had a deluxe double and then luckily got an upgrade to a suite as they were so full! suite or no suite though the place is great! staff are amazing, so friendly and helpful - the grounds are beautiful and it has a lovely pool with swim up bar, waterfall and volleyball/basketball ring for kids or big kids! the bathrooms are amazing, huge sunken bath and the shower was masisve! beds are comfy and views from all rooms apart from garden view are great! dont book garden view ul be disapointedi really cant find fault with the place, the breakfast was lovely (especially the indonesian food and omelette!) as was the spa (although you can find much cheaper at a little place on the beach next to the hotel! the only thing i would say is dinner portions were quite small by western standards (minute by american standards!) other than that a beautiful hotel that is a bargain!! honeymoon material id say! make sure u catch a sunrise in the morning too!

<Content>A Wonderful Place to Stay We just returned from a holiday in Southeast Asia and we spent a week in Bali at the Aston. It is a fabulous place and we will definitely go back. On our last day, we even asked to see some of the suites as we plan to bring family members with us on our next visit. The location of the Aston is great. There are lots of restaurants nearby. We ate at Bumbu Bali, Coco Bistro and Warung Sate. They were all excellent and very good value. The food and service at the Aston were excellent. The room and bathroom were absolutely beautiful. We had a huge soaker tub and a huge walk-in shower. We also enjoyed a late afternoon drink on the balcony. The pool is huge and not crowded. The whole resort is very clean and well-maintained. There is always someone cleaning or sweeping up, etc. We didn't use the spa but were told by fellow travelers that it was wonderful. My husband and I have traveled worldwide and this place was one of the best places we've ever stayed. The staff is eager to please. If you book your trip here, you won't regret it!

<Content>Came back for more! I had previously gone to Aston a few years back, and when I came back at the end of last year, it was as good as I remembered. And even CHEAPER!Food is not the best, but since it is a 3 star hotel, I did not expect too much of it. After the 2nd day, breakfast is boring.Service is great, all smiles. Pool is great, not too many people. Beach is not crowded, though there is some parasailing and jet-skiing (at next hotel), it is not bothersome at the Aston beach front.Room is big and comfortable. I asked to be on higher floor cos there were lots of mosquitoes at the lower floor near the garden. The hotel is not the newest, but it is certainly well-maintained for its age. Plus, the price offered was unresistable!

<Content>Fab Location! Its a while since we went to Bali but we were very lucky to have been booked into the Aston Bali by our local friendly travel agent.It was a great base and the staff were soooooo friendly.The people of Bali are incredible.You must be careful however as if you eat out you can get ill.We did however find the BEST restaurant ever BUMBU BALI-it was so good....owned by a Balinese lady and her German husband it beats any restaurant the world over.The guys on the very small beach outside the hotel were so lovely. And although the fishing wasn't great the guys made it a great day out.We hired a Taxi diver for a few days and made a lovely friend.This is the way to see the real Bali don't miss the elephants!!!!And dont get friecked out as we did as we had never traveled before so the smells in Denpensar were a shock!!!!It is a poor but a very wonderful country.There is so much to see and do ...Enjoy!

<Content>The Awesome Aston I just returned from Bali and have survived the 16 hour flight from LA. This was a great hotel with all the amenities and the price was right. I was there for 4 nights and 5 days. The food, service and convienance was all wonderful and watersports are right on the beach. There is a great restaurant just across the street that is to die for and a friendly guide named Katoot who is affiliated with the Aston who will take you anywhere you want to go such as into Kuta for shopping or an all day tour to the volcano, rice terraces or temples. (just ask at the front desk for him). I much enjoyed it more so than the big and pricey tours and he was fair and honest. He continued as our guide when able when we moved next door for another week. The ASTON was a hit with us. You will love it I promise!!!!
