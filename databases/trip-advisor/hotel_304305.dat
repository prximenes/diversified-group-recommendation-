<Content>Large Hotel, Consistent This was my second visit to Tokyo within 12 months and with my previous other Tokyo experience was at the Hilton Tokyo, so the Keio had to some tough competition to fulfil my expectations. And meet them, it did. I was genuinely impressed with the overall experience. Even though the Australian dollar had halved since my last trip making Japan one of the most expensive countries in which to stay I found it good value.We stayed in a Plaza Premier Room #3908, nice room, good size, excellent view across Tokyo, contemporary refurbishment with a host of electronic gadgets to keep you happy. I really appreciated the remote controlled window screens and heated seat on the toilet. Stress free check-in and check-out.One small complaint would be to say that the cost of restaurants within the complex were VERY expensive. The breakfast was average and in NO way compares to the Hilton.Overall, a good choice and we got what we expected which is more than I can say for some hotels around the world.

<Content>Great rooms, service and location We stayed at the Keio Plaza hotel with my family.The rooms were very good sized, the service great (particularly the conceirge) and the location fantastic (lots of nice small and authentic Japanese restaurants across the street. There is an amazing electronics and camera shop in the area).In particulary, it was great for families who want to visit Disneyland. The hotel is a Disney Good Neighbour Hotel and has a free shuttle to and from the resort. That made it easy for us to have fun at Disneyland with the kids while being close to great Japanese food and shopping in the heart of Shinjuku. Lastly, its within walking distance to the Shinjuku station for subway, JR lines, Shinkansen bullet train, Narita express train.

<Content>great place to stay We booked online before we left the US, the rate was great so we booked a plaza premiere room and were not disappointed.It was modern, super clean, free internet, great toiletries, night-shirts, yukatas, automatic window shades, quiet and a great view.The pool was closed for renovations, but that was ok.It was the perfect room to stay in after a long flight with jet lag.We decided to stay there again on our last night in Japan before flying home - this time however, we didn't book as far in advance, an the plaza premiere rooms were too expensive at short notice, or maybe it suddenly became the busy season. The rate was MUCH higher, and our room was just a regular room.It was still a nice room, just not quite as fancy and modern.

<Content>No Air Circulation in hotel room during X'mas We stayed at this hotel, from Dec 19 to Dec 21, then we come back again on Dec 23, and stayed in this hotel for one more night on the 33rd floor . We found out that, there is no air-conditioning in this hotel. We could not have slept and We complained at 00:30. It was very hot inside the room. we complained, and they only provide us fan for the night. we hardly slept during our stay. we complained to the manager and the manager said that's what it is. However, we stayed here 2 nights before and it was not the case. We found out that, they are not honest and when there is complain, only will said that, sorry, we asked what they can do, they still said that's what it is. I never stayed in a hotel that need to use fan to sleep and with no air circulation. We got up at 7:00 in the mornig, and we complained again, still the same answer, they did not change the room to us for a better sleep. I would not recommend anyone to stay in this hotel. They should not sell a room with below standards to clients, I guess that, they do not know what does service mean. Just cannot believe that, it will happen in Japan with such land mark hotel in Tokyo.We did not enjoy our stay in this hotel and got a bad experience of this hotel for the holiday.

<Content>Great Hotel in the Middle of Everything I was at the older building for a business trip about eight years ago. The room was older but the service was good. Now we are on a family vacation and got settled into the newer building (main tower, 31st floor). I must say that the rooms are very nice and we have an excellent view of Shinjuku. The room has all the amenities (flat screen tv, free internet, etc). It is also roomy for a japanese hotel. Service has been great too. The free buffet breakfast is a nice touch and the food has been very good. All in all, we would probably stay in this hotel again if we came back to Japan.

<Content>Not worth the money! We just came back from a memorable trip to Japan and the whole experience could have been perfect if this hotel turned out to be as expected. However, we were really disappointed the moment we stepped into the room assigned to us. Considering that we have paid A$339/night I wasn't expecting an old room with an outdated decor especially after they have confirmed that we will be staying in the new wing of the hotel upon check-in. Don't be fooled by the modern and spacious lobby as rooms is entirely a different story. It has a small TV, old desk and chair, console system with a radio and clock like the one from the 50's movie. Fraser Apartment in Okubo just one station away from Shinjuku where we stayed for the first week before moving into this hotel is so much better, in fact 100 times better for $100/night less. Another thing, if you will be using the subway system to reach this hotel and you need to haul your luggage/s, it will be a nuisance as you need to literally carry all your belongings climbing up and down to at least 4 sets of stairs (no escalators or elevator) before reaching the actual exit heading to the hotel direction then it will be another 10mins walk from the station.

<Content>Great stay! We booked this hotel (king, main deluxe) through Expedia because it was lower than the hotel website. No breakfast included. It was a nice find. We were in the Main building. Room d茅cor could have been a little cleaner like bed sham and rug. However, location was perfect for getting around. We arrived in Shinjuku station via the Odakyu Romance train from Hakone. It was an easy walk to the hotel and there were moving escalators. Bring a Lan cable for your laptop in the room. We did not eat at the hotel after seeing the prices. You can walk to a bunch of cheap restaurants and even get pancakes across the street at Royal Host (by Sizzler) for yen 500. We bought the yen 1000 subway pass each day to get around. Subway maps are in English and very easy to get around. Tips: Take a ferry ride. Make an advance reservation for the Imperial Palace tour via the web. We took the Narita Express to the airport, which was a breeze. There are 2 stops so make sure you know which one to get off at when arriving at the airport.

<Content>Keio Plaza Hotel did not disappoint The first two nights of our premier visit to Japan were spent at the Keio Plaza. Everything about the Hotel was excellent. The rooms were immaculate  fairly spacious. The bed was comfortable  the walls were solid and thick, so we heard no sounds from any of the adjoining guest rooms. The bathroom was fine, as was the high-tech toilet seat device. I would stay there again given the chance.

<Author>EuropeLovers123
<Content>Awesome Hotel Keio Plaza was incredible. My husband and I stayed there for 3 nites 2 weeks ago and we have nothing but good things to say. We booked this hotel through an agent and because it was a packaged deal with our flights, she booked us a standard room which was a superior room with a queen size bed. Because it was a packaged deal, we couldn't upgrade to a nicer room and we couldn't get the points towards our Asia miles. Although, it was just a superior room in the main building, the room was amazing. We got the basic toiletries (from Shiseido, that's pretty good for a standard room), different types of green tea, free internet... The room was a bit outdated but extremely clean. Our room faced the Parliament building, which was fine, not like we planned to stay in our room all day. The best thing to do is, once you have arrived at the Narita airport, go to the Airport Limousine counter and purchase the tickets to Keio Plaza, it's around $30 US per ticket but it will take you directly to the hotel with no hassel. It's around 1 hour to 1.5 hour ride from the airport, depending on traffic. Once you have arrived at the hotel, the hotel reps will rush out to get your luggages. They will put your luggages on the side and guard them while you check-in. Once you have checked in, the rep will walk you to your room with your luggages. Our rep told us which direction we were facing and which way was to the subway. The service was amazing. Breakfasts were included in our package. The breakfasts were soooooo good. They have a few different restaurants to choose from. Breakfast usually starts at 6:30am or 7am. On our first day, we tried the western style breakfast. It's like a buffet. There were not just Western style breakfast, but also Japanese food. The 2nd day we tried the Japanese traditional breakfast, it was really good as well. The hotel is in the center of the financial district and just across the street from restaurants and shopping. It's about a 5mins walk to the subway but it's a nice stroll because there are lots of things to see. We tried the restaurants around the hotel and they are all very good. You can also book the Airport Limousine at the hotel as well. There's a machine that you can purchase the bus tickets from. We checked out at 11am and our flight wasn't till 6pm, the hotel locked our luggages at a secure room until we were ready to leave. In conclusion, Keio plaza is a wonderful hotel. The staff are very courteous and helpful. The hotel is extremely sensitive to the customers' needs. I highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay there again.

<Content>Fantastic hotel We stayed for 6 nights in the Keio Plaza and thought it was a fantastic hotel. It was very easy to find for a pair of first timers in Tokyo, you find the West Exit from Shinjuku station and there's a pedestrian underpass which emerges right in front of the hotel door.The hotel is only a few hundred metres from the station as well, so it's a very quick walk, which we found to be a good thing as we were walking to the station on most days to visit another suburb. We also stayed in the Park Hyatt, which is quite a lot further away and can be a bit of a pain to get to on foot. We took the advice of another reviewer on Trip Advisor and booked a Premier Plaza room. This was a beautiful room, very stylish and well sized. It had a big bed, and a nice space around the bed with a table and couch. It also had a window the length of the room with electronic curtains and views over Shinjuku station and the bright lights. The bathroom had the obligatory (and very cool) robotic toilet as well as nice L'Occitane products.The hotel was probably the biggest we have ever stayed in, but we certainly appreciated all the services they provided. For example there's a bakery, a convenience store, a pharmacist, and several restaurants and bars in the building, and all the staff were very good at speaking English, which we found helpful when we were tired and hungry from walking around all day. It's also worth noting that the Sushi restaurant is actually a branch of a high-end restaurant in Ginza, so you can get very good sushi within the restaurant. We also tried the tempura restaurant which we thought was excellent.The service was top notch, right from the outset. Even the guy who showed us to our room gave us a pair of origami cranes to welcome us to the hotel, which we thought was very nice. We also had the hotel services desk book a night at the Kabuki theatre, which they did with no problems, even though the guy had to call the theatre over and over again because they were so busy. In fact we preferred the service at the Keio to the Park Hyatt, they were always available to help us with whatever we needed, but they stopped short of being so helpful it was annoying, which the Park Hyatt excelled at!All in all we couldn't recommend this hotel highly enough, we would definitely stay here again, and would recommend it to anyone who wants a really first rate hotel in Tokyo.

<Content>Great Tourist  We were on a business trip to Japan and we need to use the Shinjuku train station to take a train to another city. This hotel is within walking distance to the hotel even with your luggage. Like most Tokyo hotels, the rooms are small, but we upgraded to a bigger room, which also included breakfast. The room was quite modern, clean and we had a great view of the city. There are various restaurants and shops on the bottom floor of the hotel which makes it convenient ,if you do not have time to explore beyond the hotel. If you do explore beyond the hotel there is a good night life with clubs and restaurants. Everything is within walking distance. The staff at the hotel is excellent. We travel often to Japan for business and we will definitely stay at the Keio Plaza again.

<Content>Excellent experience The Keio Plaza is one of Tokyo's massive hotels. Located near the world's busiest train / subway station of Shinjuku, it is an excellent base for a business or tourism trip to Tokyo. While the street level is bustling and busy, the rooms are quiet and well kept, and are fairly large by Japanese standards. There is excellent transportation to the airport and to anywhere else in the city. Shinjuku is famous to tourists as the setting for Lost in Translation - filmed at the Park Hyatt, a few blocks away from the Keio Plaza. The Hilton Tokyo is also close by. Within walking distance of the Keio Plaza are some of the best electronic and camera stores in the city, as well as the dubiously famous Shinjuku entertainment district. The restaurants in the lobby are uniformly good and you'll find everything you need from food to toiletries to last minute souvenirs either in the hotel stores or nearby. The hotel staff are attentive and service uniformly excellent. The laundry service is reasonably priced and very prompt, with the customary Japanese quality. The room price was in line with what you expect in any large modern city.

<Content>Luxurious We decided to treat ourselves the last day in Japan by staying at a premier room this high end hotel, plus we wanted the Lost in Translation hotel experience (touristy, I know). This met our expectations. The room was gorgeous with an amazing view over Tokyo. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Several great restaurants in the building.

<Content>Exceed the expectation We had a Tokyo vacation from 4-13 October 2008. Myself, my husband, three daughters age 5-10 and my mum. And we chose the Keio based on excellent review from Trip advisor and its location. As our primary target is Disneyland and Disneysea, Keio is the perfect hotel for its free limo bus to/from Disney resort.The airport limo bus also dropped us just in front of the hotel. So convenient.I never regret my decision...Keio is superb! I can email them and get so much info about Disneyland.We booked via hotel website. I've compared the rates to other online travel agents and my travel agent where I booked my airtickets. And the hotel rate is much more efficient. I chose the Amex package for two superior rooms with triple beds. The beds are comfy as they are ALL three real beds, not adding one extra bed or sofa bed..We've got 31th floor and the view is fantastic!The rooms are clean.The bathroom amenities are also plentiful and good-quality.Breakfast at the Lounge is nice. The location is perfect that we can walk just around 10 minutes to Shinjuku station.There are plenty Japanese cheap restos when you walk 1-2 blocks around Shinjuku post station.Great depatos (department stores) nearby. Takashimaya is the best. Also Isetan. Browse the foodhall! You will be amaze d with various heavenly food displayed!Shinjuku is a nice area to stroll around, especially in the week ends. The roads are closed for vehicles. You don't have to go to Ginza to see hundreds of Tokyoites passing by. There are also street performers, such as acrobats. So entertaining! If your primary destination is Disneyland/Disneysea just choose the hotel which offers free limo bus transfer. You'll be glad that you do't have to run and lost in the huge train station!

<Content>Loved it We stayed at Keio Plaza Tokyo 4+2 nights (on two occations) during our trip to Japan. The hotel is excellent. Service is very good everywhere in the hotel. We had a nice room in 29th floor with brilliant views. The room wasn't the biggest, but still of very good size with safe, minibar, internet connections, air conditioning, Japanese hi-tech toilet etc. You can choose between Japanese or western breakfast. We loved this place. Location of the hotel is very good; central location in Shinjuku area. There are very good connections from Shinjuku station (straight train from Narita to Shinjuku + local connections) and the area both sides of the station is full of great restaurants and night life.

<Content>Very nice and clean hotel, convenient location I stayed at Keio Plaza on two different trips to Tokyo and was very satisfied both times. My first trip there, we stayed in a large room with two beds and plenty of extra room to move around. The bathroom was stocked with every L'Occitane product you could need. Our second stay was about a month later and our room was a standard room, which was a little smaller but still sufficeint. Very conveniently located near the train station, and many good restaurants. Breakfast buffet in the basement was great compared to other Japanese hotels we had stayed at. Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>lost in translation? We had gotten to the hotel about 3pm and the front desk was great to us. A bellman took our bags and showed us to our room. The rooms were standard to any other japan business hotels. We would leave bright and early and come back late and tired. Every night we had notice a smell coming from our bathroom. We had asked for someone to check and every evening it would smell worst. We had called customer relations and they had sent someone to check. A man came in and walk into our bathroom and closed the door behind him. It took about half and hour for the man to come out to tell us what the problem was. It was the toilet pipe. All he did was apologized and left. We had complain to the front desk and did nothing.Overall the hotel was good but the bathroom was gross!!!

<Content>Great hotel overall Stayed here for 6 nights with my wife and 10-month old in a non-smoking Plaza Premier room. Room type affects your experience in a hotel like this so keep that in mind when evaluating.PROS:* Big room* Great room appointments -- flat screen TV, stylish furniture* Nice bathroom -- Shower with water temperature setting, toilet with washlet/bidet seat* Super clean, high standard of cleanliness by their maid staff* Great bathroom amenities (L'Occitane brand)* Choice of Japanese or American breakfast (both served buffet style) if it's included in your rate* Located in Shinjuku, which generally is a great place to be* Provided a baby crib at no charge* Hotel is a stop on the limousine bus, which makes it easy for first-timers to get here from the airport.* Great service greeting us at the door when we got off the airport limousine bus, taking our bags to our room* Great view from our 38th floor room facing the station.CONS:- Smoke. Our room was non-smoking but you still smell it in the hallways and in the elevator sometimes. Hotels in Japan (not just this one) have that Vegas casino feel to them when you walk in. I've lived in an area that has not allowed smoking in buildings for many years, so I'm not used to this. - The 10 minute walk to Shinjuku station gets old after you do it over and over again. There are hotels closer to the station that are also highly rated (See Century Southern Tower).- Station is on the west side of Shinjuku which is the less lively side (this could be a pro depending on our point of view). It seemed that all the restaurants we wanted to visit were on the other side of the station. It's a huge station, and quite crowded, so the side of the station is not an insignificant issue.- Hotel doesn't point out that there's a covered passage way from the hotel to Shinjuku station. We walked in the rain back from the station twice before figuring this out. Some signage would be nice.- No diaper trash was provided, which made left us in the awkward position of putting diapers in plastic bags and tying them up for the cleaning staff. The trash cans are tiny so there really isn't enough bin space to throw away diapers or even a take-out dinner box.- Lounge is in the South Tower, but the Plaza Premier rooms are in the Main Tower. It's pretty inconvenient to go down 38 floors walk across the building and then up 35 floors just to get some free beverages and packaged snacks.Overall I would definitely stay here again, but I would also consider another highly rated hotel that is closer to Shinjuku station.Others have complained about the fact that this hotel serves large tour groups. I didn't find that to be a problem. We didn't spend much time hanging out in the lobby, nor did we use the concierge much.

<Content>Geared to large tour groups Arrived by train to Tokyo Station and rode Metro to Shinjuku. Hotel is composed of two towers, some rooms have been renovated and some are very outdated. We were two family groups. One was given rooms in the South Tower which has not been renovated and the other was given a room in the Main Tower which had been upgraded.Room was comfortable, air conditioning was average or below in the renovated room. Cleanliness was not a problem as the room was spotless.Staff were not as sharply dressed or precise in their actions as other areas of Japan. They did not seems as dedicated to their customers as other hotels. Maybe as a result of the mass numbers of guests that they handle. If you want personal service, this is not thehotel for you.Internet use was roughly $1. for 3 minutes. Breakfast buffet was $22. and obviously prepared for large groups to pass through the line. Food was of mass prepared quality.Bakery on basement level had very good sweets.If I return to Shunjuku, I would choose another hotel that provided more personal service.

<Content>Excellent Hotel Stayed here the last week of August 2008. This was a great 4 star hotel. The facilities and customer service are excellent. We were very impressed with the personal service the hotel staff provided. The hotel is in a great location. We took the bus limo service to Narita and it was problem free. The hotel is also located very close to the subway station so we used subway to do many little side trips to other cities like Yokohama, Kamakura, etc. The subway station announces the Keio hotel in its exists so you wont have any problem finding the hotel as you walk out of Shinjuku station - the hotel is very well known in the city, which also was impressive. We were upgraded at check in and got to stay in one of the exclusive floors...believe its floors 34-39. The room was great and had an excellent view of the city. We also took advantage of the free shuttle service to Disneyland. We had a great time. We traveled with my wife and two little daughters. We will definitely stay there again when we go back to Tokyo.

<Content>prime location, very good service Perfectly located right next to the Tokyo government offices and within walking distance of Shinjuku station and the commercial shopping area of Shinjuku. The hotel is a large high rise. Check-in was speedy and efficient. The room was very large by Japanese standards with fabulous views of Tokyo, spotlessly clean. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom well appointed with lots of toiletries, robes, slippers. Early morning check out was handled quickly, competently and politely. Not the cheapest but a very good base from which to get around Tokyo.

<Content>Great stay at Keio Plaza We stayed just one night at Keio Plaza in Shinjuku and we were super-satisfied with our choice.The location is superb: right in the middle of Shinjuku area, just few minutes away from main streets.It is served by Limousine Bus, so it has a direct connection to Narita Airport.We had a superior room with breakfast and it was excellent: spacious room, with beautiful view on the area, super king bed very comfortable, newspaper outside the door in the morning.Good buffet breakfast with great variety of food (you have three different restaurants to choose from).Staff is OK.Great hotel in great location.

<Content>Pleasant Stay My japanese friend booked us this hotel on a japanese website. We were extremely pleased. This was the first time for us in Japan, so I cannot compare the room size to other hotels there, but we had plenty of space. We each had our own single bed. Satellite TV. Hot shower. Comfortable air conditioned room. Daily English newspaper at the door. A small fridge in the room held mainly hotel beverages (for which there is a charge) but we were able to squeeze in a couple bottles of water in the door. The bathroom was much smaller than what we were used to, but is likely the norm for Japan. We took the limousine bus from Narita airport  it dropped us at the front door of Keio. We used it to return to the airport  the hotel simply added the cost of the bus to the hotel bill. The staff were overall friendly. The hotel is an easy walk to the Tocho-mae metro. I did not bring my laptop, so I cannot comment on the wireless internet. I did find a FedEx-Kinkos across the street which seemed to have cheaper internet than the hotel business center. We did not eat at any of the 5 restaurants on-site. There is a convenience store located inside where we did purchase water  juice.

<Content>Great customer service Travelled with 3 kids and 9 pieces of luggage. We worried about the hotel room size in Japan and how we should handle so many pieces of luggages. We arrived by Airport Limosine, it stopped right at the hotel door. The Bell Boy already standed by and took care of it all the way to the room. We booked 2 rooms, and the room size is large and clean. The Hotel has a convinence store at the basement selling things from drinks and milk to instant noodle. Locationwise, it takes 5 to 7 mins walk with indoor corridor to Shinjuku station. We checked out for Hakone for 1 night ( see my other review for Hakone hotel) and stored all the luggage at the hotel. When we came back, the Bell Caption already reconized us and got our luggages ready. When we checked in again, one room was not ready, we heard the apology from manager to bell boy more than 10 times, since It is a good traditional Japanese service to show how they care about customer service.

<Content>Good location, great hotel This hotel is massive. There are 2 towers, and based on the reviews, South Tower is the newer one. We ended up at the Main Tower, sadly. We went for the Plaza Premier rooms which gave you VIP check in, modern, soundproofed, large rooms and added security. However, these rooms dont let you access the club floor/lounge - which was strange considering Plaza Comfort (which we thought were cheaper) guests get the lounge as part of their stay. We booked 2 rooms - one with a king bed and another with 2 twin beds. We saw how spacious the king rooms were, and quickly switched to 2 king bedrooms instead. Definitely a big plus was the fact that the airport bus leaves for Narita straight from the lobby so no matter how early or late the flight is, its always that little bit more convenient. Its located near enough to the main Shinjuku station to walk, but its far enough so the traffic and noise doesnt affect you. There's so much to do mere steps from the hotel. We would recommend it.

<Content>where's the pool??? We stayed at the Keio Plaza the first week of August. We had chosen this hotel because of the location and the pool looked great too. Upon arrival our room wasn't ready but we were upgraded from a deluxe room to a Premier room-great customer service. When we asked about the pool we were informed that it was closed which was a great disappointment-the website doesn't state this so that's 'a bit naughty'.The check in staff are friendly and the concierge is keen to help. Housekeeping are very efficient. The only let down was the Polestar bar-AVOID!!!! On the last night we went there for a drink. We were completely ignored by the staff. It took 15 minutes for someone to bring a menu, another 15 minutes for someone to take an order. We then waited for another 15 minutes or so before our drinks arrived; I was ready to walk out at this stage...We weren't offered seats at the bar-seats with great views-yet there were seats available. We were completely ignored yet a guy sleeping at the bar was getting quite a bit of attention. We both really felt that we weren't wanted in the Polestar bar; the staff looked after the Japanese guests but we, 2 western women were not treated very nicely...Oh and then we had to wait for another 10 or 15 minutes or so to get the bill. I did complain to the duty manager and he assured me he would speak to the restaurant manager; not sure if he ever did. It truly is a shame this happened because we did enjoy our stay at the hotel-in spite of there not being a pool-but this really spoilt our last night. The location is very good and the rooms are nice-almost all of the staff are friendly and helpful BUT the website needs updating regarding the pool and a change of attitude at the Polestar Bar is required!

<Content>Convenient and Efficient Hotel Stayed 2 nites there in mid July. This is a huge hotel with 2 towers. It is well located, just a 5-7min walk from Shinjuku station where you can travel to most parts of tokyo conveniently.We booked the premier room which had a separate check-in counter. The room is spacious and nice, with very large windows and nice view of tokyo. (we stayed on 38th floor). Premier room is similar to club rooms in other hotels where you have lounge access, but strangely, the lounge is located in another tower, why would anyone want to go to a lounge so far away from their rooms.... doesn't make sense. The hotel was fully booked when we were there, but the staff there are pretty efficient, so it wasn't overly crowded or have to wait too long to get concierge attention. Hated the breakfast though. We booked the room  breakfast package and were told to go to a lounge on the first floor. (doesn't seem like a usual breakfast place), not sure whether the lounge serves just guests on premier floor or what... but the selection is very pathetic. only about 2-3 types of hot food, some bread, fruits etc. I stayed at many hotels in Asia for both business  leisure and this has one of the worst buffet breakfast selection, if not the worst! If I had known this, would have gotten the room without breakfast.Other than the breakfast, the stay was a pleasant one.

<Content>Great hotel, great location We stayed there for five nights in early July. When we arrived, they upgraded us to a beautiful room on the 39th floor for $50/night extra. We had a great view of the city, and the room was quite spaceous for Tokyo standard. Staff were very polite and friendly. The location of the hotel couldn't be better. My travel back to the airport from the hotel was also very smooth and convenient. The hotel staff loaded my luggage to the bus that left from the hotel, and I was in Narita within an hour. It really was a pleasant stay. I would definitely go back there again.

<Content>Super Location, Great Staff Stayed at the hotel with my wife and two year old son and had a great timeThe Keio Plaza is in a super location in every sense. It is located very close to Shinjuku Station which I think is amongst their best landmarks. The hotel is also very close to the Metropolitan Building from which some great views of Tokyo can be hadTheir staff are great and I think this is also reflective of the Japanese who are such amazingly helpful people. The reception staff in particular could not have been of a greater help with inputs on places to see and how to get there at all points of timeReally loved Tokyo and i'm sure would stay there again..

<Content>5-star service Just got back from Tokyo and our 6-day stay at Keio Plaza hotel. Although we were given one of the older rooms, the views were still stunning and the service definitely 5-star. My travel companion and I were both ill (for different reasons) and we asked for the hotel doctor. The people at Guest Services were so attentive. They came to the room, asked about our situation so they could translate it to the doctor. Then one of their agents actually took us to the Doctor and stayed with us so that she could serve as a translator. PLUS she even took us to the pharmacy. The location is perfect, it is a short walk to the busiest train station in Tokyo -- Shinjuku. And on the way to the train station, you will find lots of adorable hole-in-the-wall restaurants where the food will take you to a different level! We loved our stay at Keio. We loved Tokyo. We are definitely coming back!

<Content>Second time around This was actually our second stay at the Keio Plaza hotel. I wrote a review previously, based on our stay last year, but I thought I should write another.Rooms:This time we stayed for 2 nights at the begining of our trip to Japan and 7 nights at the end of our trip. For the first 2 nights, we stayed in a Plaza Comfort room. It was a nice room, especially for the price and definetly was a step up from last year when we stayed in the Superior room. After our 2 night stay, we were off to Kyoto and Osaka for 5 days and the hotel was kind enough to hold our luggage since we wanted to travel light. Upon our return, our luggage was waiting for us in our Plaza Comfort room however this is where I felt the first bit of dissapointment. The room (wasn't the same as our first 2 nights) was in fairly bad shape. One of the lights was burnt out in the washroom, there were marks on the walls and part of the carpet was coming up. We quickly called guest relations to ask if we could switch rooms, however they said they were fully booked for the night, but we could do so for the remainder of our stay. Now, aside from the room looking beat up, I still felt a bit let down, which was probably caused by the fact that we had just spent the last 3 nights in the Ritz Carlton in Osaka. So we decided to bite the bullet and pay for a Plaza Premier room and am I ever glad we did. For the extra $40 Canadian a night it was well worth it. Far more spacious and modern than our Comfort room and we got a kick out of the bedside light/curtain controller. Next time we go again (3 years from now) we are going to book a Plaza Premier room again.HotelGreat as last always. Friendly staff and a great location. We did try the Korean restaurant this time for a bit of yakaniku. The meat was terrific but the price was a little steep (luckily we had a $50 meal voucher from the hotel)ConclusionWhile i'm sure there are even nicer hotels in Tokyo, I would still stay here since in my opinion, it provides the most bang for your buck. However I do recommend spending the extra bit and go for a Plaza Premier room.

<Content>Shinjuku's Best! We stayed at the Keio Plaza Hotel for 9 nights a month ago. It came highly recommended by a friend and I am so glad we listened. Keio is located in the business area of Shinjuku, therefore it isn't as chaotic as the other areas near the Shinjuku train station. It was relatively peaceful, especially during the weekends. The great part is all the action is just a 5-10 minute walk away! There were restaurants nearby but we especially loved this tempura place which served the best tempura ever at a great price. Around Y580 yen for a tendon (tempura rice bowl topping) and Y650 for a tempura set meal. Its located in the underground walkway leading to JR Shinjuku station, around 3-5 min walk from the hotel (next to Yoshinoya). We were also very happy with the rooms we got - clean, spacious plus it came with a great view. We requested for our rooms to be next to each other and thats what we got. We were a group of 9 - 5 of them kids - so it was essential that we all stick together. Keio Hotel also has the best-trained staff. All of them were corteous and friendly, and of course they all spoke english really well which was a big plus when we needed any help. The hotel itself is huge - I think more than 1,000 rooms. Luckily we were booked in the South Tower which is more modern (and was just renovated) so I suggest you request for the same when making plans to stay in this hotel.Our trip to Japan was wonderful and our stay in Keio made it even more fulfilling! I would gladly recommend you stay in this hotel :-)

<Content>great location Very clean hotel. Rooms are very quiet. We stayed in a 3 bedded room. It is large and spacious. Two super single beds + one sofa bed. Hotel breakfast buffet - 3 different restaurants to choose from. Big spread of Japanese food and American breakfast. Hotel also has shops and small grocery, but don't buy here - see below.Hotel has FREE bus to/from Disneyland for those who are staying in the hotel. Book early (immediately after you check in) so that you can get the timings you want. Hotel is one of the few stops for express buses (called airport limousine) to/from Haneda airport and also Narita airport. Book the rides from the Bell Captain, and buy the tickets from the 'vending machine' in the hotel.Hotel is at a GREAT location:- Tokyo government metropolitan building is 1 block away from hotel's front entrance. The building's two towers have FREE observation floors (45th floors).- across the road from the hotel's back entrance is SHINJUKU, with all the shops, eateries, supermarkets, departmental stores (Keio and Odakyu), etc. We stepped one street away from the main thoroughfare and managed to eat noodles for dinner at Y400 each. - 10 minute walk away is Shinjuku station. From this station, you can take subway to the rest of Tokyo. From this station also you board the train to Hakone to see Mt Fuji. The station also has bus stops for Disneyland (not free) and to Haneda and Narita airports.-

<Content>Luxury and Convenience My husband and I decided to splurge and stayed in a Premier room. We booked through the internet and got the room for just under $300 when it normally goes for over $550. Great internet deals through the hotel website. The room was very luxurious and modern with fancy amenities like L'Occitane toiletries and a flat screen TV, along with a very comfy bed. Aside from the wonderful quality of the hotel, the location was excellent. While it was in Shinjuku, the hotel was not in the chaotic bustling section. However, the station was less than a 10 minute walk away making it a great base to tour Tokyo from. Also, if you are using a JR Pass, the Narita Express stops at the Shinjuku station, meaning you don't have to travel far to/from the hotel. However, you would have to travel light as you would be rolling your luggage through the station! Would definitely recommend the place for a romantic retreat!

<Content>Great Location We recently returned from a 4 night stay at Keio Plaza beginning on May 16th. This was our second visit to Keio Plaza, having stayed there in May 2007. As previous posters have noted, there are many positives to staying at Keio Plaza. The Hotel is well situated in Shinjuku, close to Shinjuku station and to the Tochomae station (which is handy for traveling to Tsukiji and Roppongi on the Oedo Line). The airport bus from Narita stops at the Hotel and also departs from the Hotel for returns to the airport. There are also many restaurants (sushi, udon  ramen noodles, tempura and coffee shops) in the area right outside of the Hotel. The convenience store in the Hotel is also very handy for purchasing bottled water and small snacks. It is also only a 5 minute walk to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building, which is a must visit since the two towers have observatories (no admission charge) on the 45th floors, with shops for picking up souvenirs and small gifts, and a tourist bureau on the ground floor for picking up maps and brochures, or signing up for guided tours. Although there are many restaurants in the Hotel, they are very expensive. Fortunately, there are many cheaper options in the area right outside of the Hotel. We stayed in a comfort plaza room, which provided great views of the TMG building and also joined their Executive International Club (EIC), which provides breakfast in the Tea Lounge and access to the EIC Lounge, the costs of which are built into the EIC room rates. The buffet breakfast was adequate at best, with juices, fruits, coffee  tea, breads  pastries, and a daily egg and meat item. The eggs and breakfast meat, however, were often not kept warm enough. The EIC Lounge was okay for a beer, coffee, or soft drinks, although the snacks offered are quite limited. For some reason, the temperature in the Lounge is kept very warm, almost uncomfortable. The comfort plaza room had a great bed, but the carpets were definitely showing wear and in need of replacement. What was odd was that although our room was near the elevators but across the hall from it, we could still hear a loud humming sound when the elevators were being used, especially evident at night when we were in bed and expected it to be quiet. I suggest if staying in the South Tower that you request a room that is not too near the elevators. All in all, the Keio Plaza Hotel has an excellent location that is a great base from which to see the rest of Tokyo.

<Content>Service was beyond excellent... Every where in Japan that we went the people were phenominal, and especially at the Keio. The service was almost too gracious for me. Hotel rooms were recently renovated, and very nice. We stayed in a Comfort Queen in the South Tower. Rooms very quite at night with great views of Tokyo. Bed and Duvet comfortable as well. Great ameninites in the bathroom - L'Otaines. Great restaurants around the hotel, with Japanese food. Also a Starbucks around the corner (best coffee you can find in Japan--- not saying much) Hotel was so close to the Shinjuku station (5 minute walk)... but beware. I travel the world, and live near Manhattan and have never been more frustrated and confused in my life. The train station is INSANE. we could not find our exit out and literally walked around for an hour during rush hour, and no one spoke English to help. Anyway- great hotel, great location, great staff, great rooms. Oh yeah - big plus - register online with the hotel for an EIC card (its free) and you get access to the 34th floor lounge- lounge has small amount of snacks available, along with beer, wine and sodas for free. And the BEST massage chair I have ever used- up there with a real massage.

<Content>A Great base for first-timers in Tokyo We stayed here , in a standard room, for a total of 4 nights at the start and finish of our first (but certainly not last!) visit to Japan in 2006. Our welcome was very warm and the room was fantastic, all the amenities you could wish for and floor to ceiling windows. Not so good if you suffer from vertigo! Amazing views, especially at night. Don't miss a drink in the sky lounge, have a Bellini, it's delicious if a bit pricey. The hotel and its staff helped us to 'settle in' to Japan as we were a bit apprehensive as it was our first trip eastwards! Tokyo was in full swing for Christmas , the shops and lights were amazing.The hotel staff were very helpful with directions to city attractions, the concierge in the main lobby has loads of info. sheets which are easy to follow. There are several excellent restaurants in the hotel,we liked the shabu-shabu one and the 'early' breakfast one where you can eat from 05.30. Useful as some of the tours start pretty early! Service was very good and friendly throughout the hotel. We would certainly stay here again.Can't wait!

<Content>Great hotel, Great Location! Keio plaza was indeed a great hotel...stayed in a deluxe room in the main tower...which was clean and spacious, and included all the necessary amenities one would need. Staff at the hotel were extremely friendly and helpful (expected being in Japan I guess).Airport bus (from Narita) drops you off at the hotel which is very convenient (for about $30).It also provided a great central location...very close to the Shinjiku subway station (about a 10 minute walk to the west side of the station). On rainy days, the tunnel to the station was wonderful.Numerous restaurants were located around the hotel (in the neighbouring high-rise buildings as well as the shopping areas very close by). There are ofcourse numerous restaurants in the hotel itself, but slightly over-priced. (guest relations were very helpful in providing a variety of maps of the area which included variety of restaurants, as well as making reservations if needed).Overall a fabulous stay...would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Keio Plaza Shinjuku - Delightful stay in great location. Couple and young teenage son chose Keio Plaza from reviews and capacity to accommodate triple booking. (We experienced difficulty trying to make a reservation for a triple room in Tokyo). From other reviews in Tokyo regarding size of rooms, we expected a very cramped room 鈥?how wrong!We stayed on the 24th floor of the south tower. Room was more than adequate with 2 double beds and a made-up double sofa bed across one wall! Still enough room for our suitcases, etc. After arriving late in the evening after a long flight, my son appreciated the fact that the sofa bed was ready to fall into after a shower.The entire experience was delightful 鈥?staff very pleasant, friendly and ever so helpful. Amenities were the best we鈥檇 experienced over a month away in Canada, USA  Japan. Toothbrushes  paste, hair ties, cotton buds/balls, razors, slippers, dressing gown, etc.Great location within relatively easy walking distance to Shinjuku station, Isetan  Keio Plaza Dept stores and numerous other stores, restaurants, cafes  bars. Since we were tired on our arrival we also appreciated the great little convenience store on the 2nd level that was well stocked with snacks and drinks.Narita Shuttle picks up and drops off from the front door and Keio Plaza were more than happy to hold our luggage from checkout until late afternoon when we were due to return to the airport via the Shuttle.For convenience, on our first morning we opted for a good breakfast at the hotel prior to walking the city, and were not disappointed. The continental breakfast I chose was more than adequate (couldn鈥檛 finish it all) and the boys were very happy with the buffet.We would鈥檝e loved to have stayed longer 鈥?instead we鈥檒l make a point of returning.

<Content>For the price, a solid choice With the dollar at an all time low against the yen, I think all hotel reviews in Japan need to be taken in the context of price. I paid $160 per room per night on Expedia which I thought was a fair price. I had 2 rooms, as I was traveling with teenagers. We were in the older Main tower which is circa 1970. I had very low expectations and was pleasant;ly surprised. While the drapes are gold velvet (?)and the furnishings are from the set of the Brady Bunch, everything is very clean and the rooms spacious. The beds are reasonably comfortable and the linens were acceptable. One of the rooms smelled of cigarette smoke but the other was fresh. The bathrooms were large and upgraded. My only real knock on the place is the A/C was antiquated. It was cool every day we were in Tokyo but I could always count on our room being warm and stuffy when we returned. Also, don't bother applying for their membership card unless you plan on paying rack rates. If you book through Expedia or any other service, the membership is useless. The morning buffet is wonderful with a high price tag to go along with it ($30+). We spluged one morning, the other mornings we ate at the pancake place across the street (under the Sizzler). And BTW, the Sizzler has an awesome salad bar if you are sick of sushi. Don't laugh, I counted 7 kinds of tomatoes. It's amazing. My summary, for the price I paid on Expedia, Keio Plaza was a fair value. I don't think the Main Tower is worth much more than what I paid.

<Content>Enjoyed My Stay at the Keio I stayed at the Keio Tokyo for four days in March. Felt that I made a great choice. There was a nice mix of people-couples, families, business people and young professionals. Everything was clean and tasteful. The location was so convenient-there was a walkway leading up to hotel from Shinjuku station. In response to a previous review of the hotel about treating other Asians inferiorly, I disagree. I'm a young, Cambodian-Chinese American and felt that they treated me just as well as any other customer and would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Tokyo.

<Content>Pretty Nice The staff speaks excellent English, so check-in is easy, though they can get very busy. You can't take your own bags up, and I felt awkward on my second trip, when a little, 80lb girl lugged my bags up to the south tower 30th floor. If you're a first timer, ask for a map and guide book; they have some very decent ones for free). Convenient location, about 4-5 blocks from Shinjuku station.Pay the extra $20-40 to get a Comfort room. All the rooms are nice, but the standard beds, like most beds in Japan, are a little stiff for western backs. Another minor annoyance in the standard room is the hard to read clock by the bed is impossible to in the dark. No big deal. The bathroom is much bigger than the Japanese average, and like all latrines in Tokyo, the toilet is super high-tech (sans heated seat). The shower water pressure is extreme (which is good), but angled strangely, so be careful or you'll have a mess on your hands.It is expensive, though not as much as many comparable hotels in Tokyo. If you're there on business, sign up for the EIC and save a few dollars, get free access to the lounge, and breakfast (not the greatest meal, but better than seaweed and miso soup).

<Content>Perfect Hotel We chanced upon this hotel while we were searching for our accomodation in Tokyo and went to the hotel desk to enquire on the rates for 2 nights. The service was impressive and the rooms were luxurious and comfortable. There were also many nice restaurants located near the hotel, such as Sumitomo building, famous sushi joint located a few streets away. For tourists who are interested to catch the first train to Tsukiji Market, this is a ideal place to stay as the train station to Tsukiji is a few minutes walk away. However, the JR train station is a short walk from the hotel, which may be inconvenient to shoppers as it is a distance away from the shopping centres.

<Content>Good Value, Good Service Great location, with a very short walk to Shinjuku JR station, which is a major transport hub. Room was large enough and contained all the mod-cons. Good size bathroom for Japan too. Nothing was too much effort for the staff - every time we asked a question, they went out of their way to help us. They can organise postage, buses to the airport, have a deposit box system almost like a swiss bank! The restaurants were a little on the expensive side - but hey, no worse than any other 4 star hotel, and just 1 block from the hotel are plenty of little japanese places which serve great food at local prices. It was worth every cent for the convenience of the location to transport and shops. Big thumbs up!

<Content>Okay room, Bad Beds, Rude Check in Staff, Noisy drunken people everywhere. We stayed in the Original Building, the rooms were smaller than the Southern building that the rest of my family had stayed before.Location:- Great! walking distance to good restaurants, bars, shopping, and train stations. Lobby Staff: - Obviously treating customers of other Asian races differently than Westerners. Condescending and with contempt to the former; bowing and smiling and back-side kissing to the latter. - There was a 2 hour delay in check-in for one of our rooms, 2.5 hours for the other. It was especially bothersome to us since we arrived at 8am after a red-eye flight, walked around town until 1pm, the supposed check-in time, and was asked to wait in the lobby until 3pm... Rooms:- Small- Beds were uncomfortable- Blankets kept slipping off the bed (material of blankets and flat sheets were not well matched.)- Really, really good complimentary girly stuff--shampoo, body wash, conditioner, and face wash. Far superior than most hotel kits. - Have connecting rooms -- we traveled as a family of 4, 2 connecting room was rather wonderful. Beware of the TV remote though, once father turned both of our TV on and spooked our 10 year old off her bed. Restaurants:- Expansive and food was edible, but not nearly as good as anything nearby. Well, most hotels are like that.Entertainment: Drunken People Show!- One can relax in the big well-dressed crowd for conference, during the day, and watch them stagger around and listen to them make noises during the night. It was really quite entertaining even at the expanse of sleep. The best was that we saw a man standing in the middle of the side lobby drunk out of his mind, not violently though, just trying his best to stay on his feet and staggering with the effort. The staff did nothing to it, just take turn looking and obviously amusing themselves without being intrusive to the drunken man. We saw policemen/security guard walking towards the man, we thought they must be ready to escort him out, but they joined the staff in watching and discussing the man. What a strange culture.

<Content>great hotel - ideal location I stayed here with my friends for one Saturday night to experience Tokyo nightlife.The hotel is ideally located in Shinjuku - full of restaurants, bars and clubs - and the neon Tokyo you see in pictures! Only 5 mins walk from Shinjuku train station also - so very handyThe hotel is enormous, but well organised. Check in was quick, and the room had been updated so the decor was contemporary. Beds were very comfy and the bathroom was large with walk in shower and bath seperate. 32nd floor views over Tokyo.For the price you couldnt get a better located hotel in the heart of the action of Tokyo

<Content>Mammoth hotel experience, luxurious space This hotel is HUGE and as a result, appears a bit soulless. However, all service was friendly, efficient and polite. Checkin and checkout were easy and quick. We have previously stayed on the eastern side of Shinjuku JR station, and found this government area very different. However, only a few blocks away is a great enclave of restaurants, karaoke bars, noodle and sushi houses, shops for cameras/electronics, fashion and ski gear. We stayed on the 21st floor and the room was clean. Altho non-smoking it had a slight stale smoke smell. Our friends on the same floor didn't have this problem. Room and bathroom are fantastically spacious by Japanese standards with plenty of room for luggage, furniture and us. A nice touch was the complimentary paper in the morning, not that we had time to read it! We've heard the breakfast is fantastic, but didn't opt for this inclusion. There are cafes (Excelsior, Doutor, Pronto and Lawson) nearby for quick  cheap breakfast options. We had a drink in the Aurora Lounge, which was expensive, but with an incredible view over the lights of Shinjuku.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel We had a three night stay in two Plaza Comfort rooms and found every aspect of the hotel to be excellent. It was in a great position a short walk to the subway station, shops, restaurants and the Government Building which has a free observatory which offers spectacular views on a clear day.Most of the staff spoke excellent English and were very helpful with any requests we made.The rooms were very spacious by Tokyo standards and were well maintained with everything required. We could not fault the hotel and would definitely stay there again next time we visit Tokyo.

<Content>Good for price but very old deco The hotel has been marked as five star in our hotel booking site, so I was pretty dissapointed when I open the door to our room and find the deco to be 1970's Japan. I did get a good deal for the room though--and the room is clean and big. We were upgraded to the delux room since the superior room we booked were full. We were put in the South Wing and this is the newer wing that was suppose to be renovated. I cant even imagine what the interior is like in the Old wing. Anyway--the hotel is relatively close to the subway station so no compaints there. There is nothing between the 200 USD and 1000 USD range hotel wise in Tokyo, which is pretty interesting. I would have paid a little more for a more modern hotel but I would have to book hotels like Ritz Carlton or Park Hyatt which are in the 1000 USD range. Anyway--we get free breakfast with our room which is a nice touch. This would be a clean business hotel for anyone on a business trip but not for a romantic get away.

<Content>Perfect stopover We stayed at the Keio Plaza for 4 nights on our way to a Niseko for a skiing holiday. We are a family of 5 and had 1 twin room and a triple. The rooms were in the main building. The rooms are renovated, very neat and functional. The triple room is adequate in size rather than generous as it has to accommodate 3 oversized single beds. The twin room was more spacious. Bathrooms were small but functional. We were 34 floors up and the views were quite nice. There are quite a number of restaurants within the hotel complex but most are very expensive for dinner, however, you get what you paid for. We had the best Korean meal there one evening. Interestingly, even the most exclusive restaurant offers set lunches at a fraction of the evening prices.Staffs there are very polite and helpful but language is still a barrier. You can survive on English alone but if things get complicated then expect some slow, simple speaking and gesturing.The hotel's location is excellent. Shinjuku station is only 5 mins away on foot (or 10 mins if you actually follow the signs from the station!). All the major electronics/camera and departments stores are represented within a few blocks of the hotel.One word of warning. Neither of our rooms are marked smoke free (nor our friends so I assume it is not a house rule) but each room has a very elaborate air purifier in the room and a call to the front desk will have housekeeping running with a can of air freshener.

<Content>What a wonderful hotel... Keio Plaza is a great hotel. Great location. We walked to the hotel from the Shinjuku station. The staffs are wonderful, very friendly and very helpful. Two staffs took us to our room. One was taking care of our suitcases and the other one showed us how to get to our room and all the amenities in the room. What a wonderful service. We booked the superior renovated room in the South Tower. The room is large for Japanese standard. Very clean. The bathroom is very clean and modern. Great amenities. Very accomodating for kids. Our daughter got her own yukata, cute tiny slippers and kids' size toothbrush. We had such a wonderful stay there. Will definitely stay here again on our next trip.

<Content>Excellent Choice My family of 4 adults just returned from 5 days in Tokyo after Christmas, using the Keio Plaza as our home base. We all loved the hotel and its convenient location. We requested 2 non-smoking rooms but when we got to one of them, it was clearly a smoking room. The front desk was quick to switch us to an even nicer one that met our needs.The concierge staff especially was extremely helpful in planning our days, giving us maps and directions to nearby restaurants and sites. They also arranged for us trips to a tea ceremony and Tokyo Disney (which is very different from Disney world!!) and even called ahead to insure that places we were considering would be open. The only negative was the very expensive Japanese restaurants in the hotel which would like to have tried; unfortunately $80-$100 per person was beyond our budget for a single meal. However, the Italian restaurant on floor 2 was outstanding and reasonable. We did find sushi places a few blocks away that worked fine.The hotel offers all the services a traveler would need and in a most accommodating manner. Definitely would recommend this hotel in a heartbeat.

<Content>Good Location, but a Bit Old The hotel is considered an old school hotel - very grand entrance, but the facilities in the hotel (beddding, deco) are quite old. If you are looking for a hotel with direct access to/from the airport (there is a hotel bus that takes you right to the front door) and convenient location in Shinjuku, this would be an excellent choice. But if you are looking for a place close to all the major shopping areas and cheaper, I would recommend Kadoya Hotel (a more local business hotel), which is just 20 feet from the hotel and other smaller ones closer to the West Shinjuku subway station. I stayed at the old wing of the hotel, which is quite old. Not surprisingly, the room is very small, but it was very nice the fact that there was hot water in the room, as the weather was getting cold. The staff was very attentive and the overall logistics were very well arranged - from letting you know where you should put you luggage when you check in to how to book a bus ticket to the airport. All these amenities are there. I would recommend this hotel if you have never been to Japan and need more hand-holding as not many Japanese (including staff members at the hotel) speak English. Most staff (including bell boys) are proficient in English, which is impressive.

<Content>excellent room We booked a plaza premier room and our room was fantastic. The hotel itself is too big to be an special place but the room was new, big, clean... Everyday we had 3 restaurants for breakfast, very good breakfast and one of the restaurants opened from 5,00 a.m. very coneveninet if you are jet laggedLocation is convenient, 5 minutes walking from Shinjuku Station and 3 minutes from Tochomae Station and 10-15 minutes from department stores and bars and restaurants. However, if I went to Tokyo I think I would stay in Shinmuya instead of Shinjuku but in Shinjuku, this would be my hotel, for sureStaff very, very helpful. Air France lost our baggage and the `people from the reception were very helful ringing Air France ( always engaged ) asking for our luggage until the Air line found our suitcases, 3 days later....Anyway, plaza premier room is an excellent choice

<Content>Very nice hotel but very expensive I was in Tokyo with some friends for three nights. We had a family room for the four of us which was very comfortable and clean. We had an amazing view of Shinjuku and the whole of Tokyo as we were on the 27th floor. The room was cleaned every morning, the staff spoke english and were friendly and helpful. The Plasma TV had BBC World, CNN etc. The hotel bars and restaurants were very expensive, nearly 拢5 for an orange juice!! The Sky bar is worth a visit as the views are amazing at night. Overall a very nice hotel and i would use this hotel again if i was staying in Tokyo.

<Content>Fantastic Honeymoon Adventure My husband and I just returned from 10 nights at the Keio Plaza Hotel. We spent our honeymoon in Tokyo and intended on using the Keio as a home base and maybe making some side trips, but fell in love with the hotel and Tokyo so decided to stay here the entire time.The service was spectacular. Our bellman actually left us the cutest note in broken English congratulating us on our recent marriage. The room we stayed in (2915) was very spacious and had a great view of East Shinjuku. We even had a massage chair in our room. This is certainly not the fanciest hotel that I've stayed in, but was SO clean and layed out phenomenally well. We had Kimonos in our room and the bed was ridiculously comfortable.The room was a little out of style - more fabulous 80's then fabulous 00's, but not old, just a different sense of style.THe room had great water pressure in the shower and a HUGE soaking tub (not seperate from the shower, but HUGE)THe only real disadvantage is the restaurants are REALLY expensive, but all hotel restaurants are in Tokyo. We did order room service one night, and it still didn't break our budget.Shinjuku is a great location in many aspects. It is directly accessible to Shinjuku station, as well as other Metro stops that are even closer. East shinjuku - probably a 15 minute walk from the hotel - is a great spot for nightlife. We probably preferred the nightlife in SHibuya more, but this is fine too! Just know that the fun is on the other side of the neighborhood.THe Tokyo Metropolitan Government building is directly across the street - Spectacular views from their observation deck, the Park Hyatt (the Lost in Translation hotel) is just down the street, and the fabulous department stores around Shinjuku station are only a five minute walk away.Remember to use the Restaurant levels in the department stores for some fabulous food - I had heard this before we left, but basically forgot until the end of our honemoon. We missed out on some really yummy looking places!Loved this hotel - and if you read other reviews I've done, there are a LOT of hotels that I do NOT love :)

<Content>Love the free internet connection and closeness to the Shinjuku Station. I emailed Keio Plaza directly and is pleasantly surprised to find that the hotel offers a rate slightly cheaper than what my tour agent quoted. It is about SGD350 per night for 7 nights ( 1 double, 1 single bed ). A bit pricely but it is situated in a very decent neighbourhood, west of Shinjuku station. Neighbourhood gets quiet after office hours.It is opposite Tokyo Met, so we went over twice for free city views at the Met's top floor. Awesome!Our room is huge and chamber service impeccable. The free internet connection in the room kept me connected to home.Keio Plaza has easy access to Shinjuku station via underground tunnel ( with travelator in the direction to the hotel during office hours ). There is also free shuttle services to Disneyland Tokyo ( to and fro ). We booked the hotel-Narita airport shuttle at the concierge to avoid dragging the luggages to Shinjuku Station.

<Content>What's the hype about? The hotel has an airport bus dropoff which is very convenient. Upon arrival, the lobby was very full. No one spoke English very well. We were given a room in the old part of the hotel. It was disgusting- wreaked of cigarettes, holes in the bedspread, looked like a motel. We changed room after begging. The second room was in the other tower. It was slightly nicer, on a non-smoking floor. The bed was rock hard. Also, the diner downstairs is extremely expensive for breakfast. Eat outside the hotel at a cafe for a much better deal. The location is convenient to the trains but I think Ginza is a better area to stay in. Overall, I don't understand why this hotel got such great reviews. I've stayed in MUCH nicer hotels in Asia for the same price.

<Content>Convenient + bonus view to Mt Fuji if orientation and weather permit I stayed there for 5 nights in late Nov 2006 for about $160 per night. The location is convenient; and the hotel is a good 10 minutes stroll to/from the Shinjuku station. The assigned room was pleasant and happened to face the gap between the twin government office towers. On a clear and sunny day (just 1 out of the 6 days unfortunately), one can see Mt Fuji. The airport bus service definitely simplified transportation to/from Narita.

<Content>recommended Stayed here early August after reading through the reviews. As a family in two rooms we found the hotel well placed with easy covered walkway access from the hotel to the Shinjuku station via the basement exit . Along this walkway there are a few shops and a convienence store wjhich was very useful for water, crisps, etc., Use the airport shuttle as is easy door to door at 3000 yen and for 100 yen more you can get one day metro passes which I recommend as it has easily understood ticket machines and convienent way around the city. The mainline JR line ticket machines are not easily understood and we required local help. Dont drive as most signs are not helpful and traffic is awful. Hotel rooms were clean and with a good view of the government building (free viewing platforms at the top floor), Breakfast was buffet with good choice and I recommend sign up for their EIC membership online for discount rooms and priority check in and use of the business room in the south tower (as a good place to plan your visit with free coffee and soft drinks). This hotel is closer to the station where there are stacks of shops than the Hilton. Check out the food halls in the shops - absolutely amazing. Only downside of the hotel is that being on this side of town adds 20 mins to the shuttle time to the airport at 90mins. Hotel swimmimg pool is shaded by the building at certain times of day so plan your visits.

<Content>OK but not worth the price. Booked at late notice while already in Japan on holiday for two nights. Booked it because we thought it was right on top of Shinjuku station meaning an easy departure when we needed to move on - it wasn't.Stayed in two rooms normal room one night, renovated next night for around 拢40.00 more. This 'new' room was smaller and less impressive. Overall I thought the hotel was over priced. Breakfast in The Brasserie was the most expensive and least impressive we had all the time we were in Japan.Don't get me wrong, everything was nice and clean. Just the price for what you got was a bit hard to swallow. We stayed in the New Otani for around 40% less and it was far nicer all around.

<Content>Careless luggage handling I trusted hotel staff to deliver my luggage to my room upon check in, as I was with Japanese business colleagues who wanted to go directly to dinner. When I arrived to my room that evening, I found the door to my room was not shut/secure -- it had not closed properly. Call to front desk prompted a promise of follow-up that didn't happen. When I asked at check-out, I was met by front desk manager who apologized, asked for my business card and promised a reply... that never came. I will not stay here again.

<Content>Great location We stayed in the Keio Plaza as part of our Honeymoon for 5 nights during August 2007.When we arrived we were amazed by the massive glittering hotel lobby/reception area. We were soon disappointed however with the incredibly slow check in having travelled overnight from Ko Samui. We arrived at 10am but were told we could not get a room until 1pm. I found this hard to beleive given the massive size of the hotel.When we got into our non smoking room we could immediatley smell the cigarette smoke on the curtains. The view from our 30th floor room was amazing though. the room was a bit dindgy but I beleive they are in the process of doing them up.The staff who could speak English were very helpful and welcoming.The hotel was in a great location for shopping and seeing amazing Tokyo.

<Content>ok room, excellent concierge My family of 2 adults and 2 children stayed at the keio plaza last week and for the price, the facilities i would rate as ok to good. We paid around $500 us dollars total for 2 rooms for one night and $400 a night for two nights. The rooms carpets and walls were a tiny bit worn but the beds and bathroom were great. The mattress and covered duvet were extremely comfortable and made for a easy rest. The bathroom was very functional in that the plumbing fixtures had strong water flow and the tub was deep. The keio provided plenty of top notch french provence toiletries plus a hair band and brush. There's also a bidet on the toilet. I found the extendable clothes line to be helpful with keeping up with the kids laundry. Of course no civilized japanese hotel room would be without slippers--there were 2 sets for each person. One for the bathroom and the other for the bedroom. The reason i would stay again at the keio is the exceptional concierge staff. It was usually older gentlemen who exceeded the usual range of service. One concierge gentleman noticed that my daughter had what appeared to be a bug bite and got out his first aid kit. The concierge staff throughly briefed us on the fine details of taking a train at shinjuku. He gave us a schedule of the time table and wrote down the price and platform number. He left out no detail, practically hand spoon fed us. Most concierge in big cities are usually hurried and give the basic facts of maps and directions. They just want to get you going and away from their desks. Not so here at the keio, they were exceptional and excellent. If you're new to tokyo, this would be a great place to stay just because of the concierge.

<Content>Go for the renovated rooms Stayed for a week at the Keio, my second time there, and I have to say that it is a great base to explore tokyo.Try and get one of the newer rooms there, the old ones in the other building aren't very nice and we asked to change.Shinjuku is also a great area, with plenty of cheap (but good!) restaurants and gadget stores (similar to Akihabara without seedy shops selling dodgy comic books...). Also a hub for camera buyers, check out map camera for second hand treasures.Restaurant map provided by guest relations was pretty useful, the tepanyaki place recommended (Seryna/Mon cher ton ton) served amazing Kobe beef and is set on top of a sky scraper.All in all, a very good place to stay and much cheaper than rivals like the Park Hyatt (though the New York bar there is awesome and a must see).

<Content>Great location/good value My son and I stayed here for nine nights total. We were quite happy with the service upon check-in, front desk and bellpersons spoke excellent English and were very gracious. The common areas in the hotel are elegant and clean.The first three nights were in the main tower, where the room was dated, but quite large. The bathroom had been redone and we had a nice view of the city. Provided in the bathroom were a razor, toothbrushes, hair scrunchy and elastic band, cotton swabs, shower cap, shiseido bar soap, foaming face and hand soap, liquid bath soap, shampoo and conditioner, making me wish I had left most of my personal care stuff back home and left more room in my suitcase. Surprisingly, there was no lotion provided. The bell desk happily stored our larger pieces of luggage while we left for three days to Kyoto. Upon our return, we stayed in the south tower. The room was smaller but the furniture more current than in the first room - bathroom once again had been updated and was immaculate. There were instant hot water dispensers and green tea and teacups available in the rooms. Both rooms also had a sitting area where we could have meals and look out at the view. Several times during our stay, we bought food in the nearby department store basement food halls or the nearby Shinjuku station restaurants and bakeries and ate in our room after long days schlepping around Tokyo. I would recommend joining the hotel's Executive International Club for the free breakfasts as the restaurants are quite pricey. The Glass Court breakfast buffet ran around $25 pp for a choice of Japanese or Western style foods. There was quite a variety there. The Korean restaurant was excellent, and my son enjoyed cooking his tender short ribs at the table. As noted before, the convenience store in the lower lobby is very reasonably priced and offers a variety of bentos, noodles, rice balls, baked goods, liquor, etc. The hotel location is very convenient to Shinjuku station as well as to several great department stores. It rained a lot of the time that we were there so we took the covered walkway to the station most of the time. We took the Yamanote line and transferred from it for most of our expeditions.We took the Airport Limousine Bus to and from the Keio Plaza from Narita Airport and can vouch for its convenience. I agree with previous posts regarding the lack of weight equipment in the workout room. I also agree that the free LAN is a nice feature.The only negative experience at the hotel was with our one attempt to get information from the guest relations desk. The woman we spoke with was quite snippy with us, so from then on I just got on the internet in our room for any further Japan information. I observed other guest relations employees being quite pleasant and helpful with other guests so it was just the luck of the draw for us.We booked our room through JTB and got a reasonable rate. This room was a lot lower-priced than I expected in Japan. We have paid much more for comparable rooms in the U.S.

<Content>Good Quality/Price ratio I don鈥檛 waste my time upgrading rooms. If the Ac is working and if the bed is good then it is ok for me. Surprisingly, I found Tokyo hotels (4-5 star) lesser in price when compared to Mumbai where I stayed at the Hilton. Stayed 5 days at the Keio Plaza and 5 days at the Westin Miyako at Kyoto. While I found the Westin Miyako Kyoto to be much spacious and a separate shower room that I very much appreciated, I found the Keio to be the best quality/price ratio. The broadband Internet was free and the pool and the gym albeit small. The location of Keio was fantastic. Westin Miyako (Kyoto) although the Dsl was not free, the location was not bad. Nanzenji temple and Heian shrine (both figure in Lost in Translation) are situated in walking distance.Returning to Tokyo we were unable to get any room in Keio as the property was sold out. Settled in Ana. I don鈥檛 think I鈥檇 have to say about this politburo type hotel. Special mention I would like to make of the vegetarian restaurant Savera in Kyoto: one of the best vegetarian I have had.

<Content>Great spot Stayed at the Keio Plaza in Tokyo based on reviews from tripadvisor. Having always heard that hotel rooms in Tokyo are miniscule, was delighted to find the accomodations at the Keio Plaza up to N. American standard, and beyond.There were some amusing touches - the sleeping garments that are in the drawers for guest use or the robes that only a 10 year old could fit into. All of the amenities were excellent : one of the best was the toilet which has a heated seat, and warm water sprays for both front and rear. Foriegners are eligible for their free Executive International Club (EIC) which allows for substantial room rate discounts and free breakfast.Don't bother trying to eat in the hotel - despite there being many restaurants, they're all ridiculously expensive. There is, however, a convenience store located in the lower lower which is well stocked and reasonably priced.

<Content>Another Great Stay At The Keio My wife and I just left the Keio after a five night stay. This was our second stay at the Keio this year.As in our previous visit, everything was flawless. The Airport Limousine direct to the hotel is extremely convenient. You don't have to touch your luggage. Our ride from NRT was about 90 minutes. Our room in the main tower was large and elegant. Room service was lightning fast. The outdoor pool on the 7th floor was nice. Breakfast each morning had a nice variety. Service was attentive. The staff at the bell captain's desk was quite helpful in arranging to send my luggge to my hotel in Osaka. They even called the hotel to confirm my reservation. The concierge was very helpful.Locationwise, it can't be beat. It's a short walk to the Shinjuku subway station. From there, you can get anywhere in Tokyo.Overall, a great stay. We'd definitley stay at the Keio again on a future visit.

<Content>Great value, great hotel For the price, this is one of the best hotel deals in Tokyo.1. Very high speed internet is free. Most places I've stayed at in Tokyo charge an extra $10 to $15 a day for internet connection. The connection is only via LAN and I wouldn't have preferred wireless....but free is a good price. 2. Join the hotel Executive Club. You can join from the hotel web site (for fee) and this gives you free access to their a club room on the 34th floor of the south tower. The club has tons of free newspapers, free beer, free soda, rice crackers and a killer view. 3. The health club was small....but at least they had one. 2 treadmills, 2 stair climbers, and 1 bike. 4. The hotel is RIGHT next door to the Tokyo Government building that has a free observatory on the 45th floor. Great views and the price is right. 5. The hotel is a 10 minute walk from Shinjuku station but it is right on top of the Toccomae station on the Oedo line. Easy access to the train system is the single most important factor when I choose a Tokyo hotel and the access is great here. 6. There is a convenience store in the basement of the hotel. You'll save a bundle on food and drinks if you take advantage of this budget eating option. 7. There is a large district of budget restaurants and pachinko parlors 1 block away. You won't suffer a lack of low cost eating options if you stay in this hotel. THE CONS1. Shinjuku is on the far eastern end of Tokyo so it takes a long, long time to get from Narita to the hotel. 2. When possible, I like to stay at a hotel that is right on top of a JR line. While the Tocomae line is right beneath the hotel, I did get tired of the 10 minute walk to Shinjuku station not to mention the finding your way in that maze of humanity. 3. The health club had aerobic equipment but very little weight lifting equipment. I paid about $240 night for a triple room (breakfast NOT included) and felt it was a bargain. If you have 2 or less in your traveling party, I think you can do better than the Keio Plaza. If your traveling party is 3-4 people, the Keio Plaza is the best bargain you will find in Tokyo.

<Content>Nice hotel, but no perfect When we arrived at this hotel, we stayed for 5 nights. The first night was a bit of a disaster, since they put us inside a smoking room, and could not accommodate a change. Apparently, they were fully booked, since did the same with many of my classmates on the trip. We were able to change rooms the following day, but this experience starkly contrasts my wonderful experience with the Granvia Hotel in Kyoto.The staff was friendly, to a degree, but I did not feel the hospitality I did when I was in Kyoto. I guess the city folks in Tokyo have become more and more like New York.The rooms were decent. The location was good, since it was right by the Shinjuku station, where there were tons of shops and restaurants.The view, however, was phenomenal, spanning the whole city.The restaurants were decently good, but they were quite pricey.I have to admit, I really loved their French/Japanese restaurant. The view, food, and service were all top notched.Overall, it was a convenient location, sufficiently friendly staff, and a beautiful hotel.

<Content>Great hotel I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in March/April 2007. I spent two nights in the south tower in a Plaza Premier room and then one night in the main tower in a Plaza Comfort room. I joined their executive club before booking directly with the hotel which lead to substantialsavings and inclusions such as breakfast and newspaper. The hotel is located in the business district about 10min walk from Shinjuku station and is directly opposite the Tokyo Metropolitan Govt offices whose viewing tower is worth a look. The rooms were great, beds comfyand the staff very helpful.

<Content>Great hotel, excellent service  My husband, son, and I stayed 6 nights at this lovely hotel--first 4 at the South Tower and the last 2 nights at the Main Tower. Rooms were large and comfortable (with a walk-in closet in the Main Tower room) and offered good views of the city. Service is excellent despite that most of the staff spoke little English. Hotel is located in front of the impressive Metro Gov't Building and is right beside the Tochomae subway station and the Shinjuku subway/rail line is also very close to it. There are many good restaurants within the hotel and around it and lots of shopping in the area. We would highly recommend this hotel to our friends and relatives anytime.

<Content>Great Choice for the Shinjuku area This is a n excellent choice if you are looking for accommodations in the Shinjulku area of Tokyo. We stayed in a room on the upper floors of the Main Tower. The room was large by Japanese standards and very well appointed. The room was quiet and extremely clean. Like all the nice hotels we selected in Japan, the rooms were well appointed with all needed toiletries including razors, toothbrushes, brushes, as well as slippers robes, and sleeping kimono. Shinjuku is a busy business area, but there are large department stores and good restaurants close by. The hotel is a two block walk on a pedestrian walkway to the large Shinjuku station including the line that takes you to the Hakone/Mount Fuji area. We booked the room through the hotel website which included a deal with a nice breakfast, Western style, served in a stylish lounge on the first floor.

<Content>Great value, great location, great room We were a little hesitant to stay at the Keio since the website looked kind of drab, but we went on the recommendation of our travel agent and are really glad we did. It was a GREAT value for Tokyo, especially Shinjuku (I think we paid around $200 USD or less per night). DEFINITELY though make sure you book one of their newly renovated premier rooms.... price difference was not drastic, but the rooms were a big step up (we saw an unrenovated floor at one point and it was very old and smelled like smoke)... the new rooms are very modern and clean... they had computerized toilets! The furniture is all modern and sleek looking and nice toiletries are provided (Aveda products, toothbrushes, razors, robes, slippers, PJs. We had a great view. it's a short walk (10 min) to Shinjuku station, a major station in Tokyo... The Keio's location is actually much batter than the Park Hyatt's actually, where we also stayed.The reception desk was fine - they spoke English. There are a few restaurants in the hotel though of course they are expensive. We ate breakfast at a little American-style cafe only a block away that was delicious and cheap. An on-site convenience store did have reasonably priced drinks and snacks. Overall, this was a fantastic value for Tokyo, seeing as you can easily spend $300-$400 there for mediocre places. I would definitely stay here again!

<Content>Excellent location and great service Stayed at the Keio last June and liked it so much, went back this year with my husband and kids (ages 2, 7 and 9). We had two rooms, each very spacious compared to other Japanese hotel rooms. The hotel staff was helpful and friendly, but best of all is the location to all the restaurants and shopping. Will stay there again.

<Content>Great Place to Stay Stayed here at the beginning of April for 3 nights. We caught the airport bus from Narita. The staff were very friendly and looked after us very well - our bags were whisked off the bus, straight to our room. The room was a good size and very clean.  As we had early starts each morning I went to the little shop situated on the lower ground level and bought juices, yoghourts and doughnuts for a makeshift breakfast - all very reasonably priced. Didn't eat in any of the hotel restaurants, although they looked very nice, but I suspect they may have been quite pricey.The location of the hotel is excellent for the Shinjuku area - lots of restaurants, shopping and nightlife. There are also several food courts dotted about in buildings adjacent to the hotel - even a McDonalds, if you're craving a western fix!!Do go across the road to the Government building viewing level at night - the views are great.

<Content>Flying Visit Just stayed one night here and couldn't fault it. We caught the airport bus straight to the front door where our bags were taken by the porters while we checked in.Room (in main tower) was a good size - plenty of room for two suitcases. Bathroom was good size too.Breakfast in the morning was a good selection of Western and Japanese food and we were pleased we managed to get this included in the price.Caught the airport bus back the next day reserving it at reception - all very efficently handled.Location is great. 10 mins from the main areas in Shinjuku and very easy to walk around.

<Content>plush! We stayed at the Keio Plaza twice on our recent trip to Japan.First visit we were on 26th floor of south tower - enormous room, seperate vanity area from bathroom (I could do my hair whilst the boyfriend showered, wihtout getting in each other's way!). Complimentary toiletries - Shiseido, no less! Newspaper daily, was very impressed.Hotel facilities boggle the mind with dozens of restaurants. We liked the Jurin buffet breakfast option as it had a smoking area.Ate in the tempura restaurant one evening and had delicious experience with many courses, highly recommended.Polestar bar on the 47th floor is a smaller, more intimate bar although the views are not as good as those in the main Sky Bar as it's tucked around to the left.Very helpful staff, money exchange up till midnight on front desk!Stayed in the main tower on our return to Tokyo which wasn't as high a standard of room but still very large by Japanese standards and we enjoyed the ame services.

<Content>Loved it Spent 3 nights at the Keio Plaza starting 6th of April 07. Check in was very quick and smooth, the staff seem to go out of there way to make sure all your needs are taken care of. I had a large room on the 22nd floor of the south tower and it was spotless. It had a very nice Panasonic LCD tv in the corner.The bathroom was a little small but it did not bother me.The location is superb just a few minutes walk to shops.Take the airport Limo bus it's so easy !

<Content>Excellent location, good service, airport limousine is a must! Location: Excellent, situated in Shinjuku, one of the largest entertainment district, its only a few blocks away from the JR and Metro station. Within a block you'll find plenty of convenience stores, restaurants, stores, and arcades. Perfect when you don't feellike venturing far from your hotel. Beyond that are large department stores like Tokyu Hands, Mylords, and Takashimaya. Everything is nearby so it provides plenty of options on your activities, you can relax in Shinjuku or venture off with ease.Service: Everyone in the hotel was helpful and tried their best despite language barriers. Foreign currency exchange was easy, they do both traveler checks and cash. Some hotels only accept one option over the other, but Keio was very easy and minimal paperwork as well.Room: Small, but that's standard in Tokyo. The view of the Metropolitan Tower was nice and the city lights looked great at night. The room was clean and comfortable, bathroom was very clean as well. Only flaw was the decor was a bit old, but I think they are still in the process or renovating their rooms. I'm not too sure about it, but we definitely did not get the ones featured on their website. Still, its perfectly fine. All I needed was a clean, comfortable, and quiet room so I can sleep after a long day in Tokyo.Transportation: Just walk a few blocks and you'll find JR  Metro stations easily. There are plenty of entrances for both these stations so its not difficult to find. Locals will be more than willing to help you. Airport Limousine drops off right here, make sure to buy those tickets because: 1. it makes transportation from and to the airport easier and 2. they offered a great special where when we purchase on AL ticket, we get a one-day unlimited use metro ticket for only 100 yen more. Its a great deal, considering those tickets normally cost 700 yen! I did not use the bus while I was in Tokyo, found the metro and some exercise sufficient enough.

<Content>Keio was fab We loved the Keio Plaza. We stayed in a Premier Plaza room on the 37th floor. These are the newest rooms in the hotel, which were modern and comfortable. The room was large, with a good view - the bathroom was a little on the small side but perfectly adequate. (Low ceiling for tall people as previously mentioned!) Great toilet - heated seats and nice deep bath. The reception check in staff were extremely helpful and so courteous. The porters had relieved us of our luggage the minute we stepped into the lobby. The service was first class, as it always is in Japan. The buffet breakfast was served in a very pleasant and relaxing room downstairs with a good selection every morning. One of the best things about the Keio is the location, Shinjuku is a very central point to stay in Tokyo and easy to get around from. We took quite an early morning limousine bus to the airport when there was little traffic and it only took just over an hour to get there - a great door to door service. We would stay at the Keio again without a doubt.

<Content>Great location, large room The Keio Plaza hotel is in the Shinjuku area, within walking distance to the JR station . This makes it easy to take the Narita Express from the airport and walk to the hotel, even with the roll along bags. It takes about a 10 minute walk and there is a travellator on the underground plaza (which makes it even more convenient than the street level). By taking train, you can be sure to avoid traffic jams. If you are travelling to Hakone, the direct express train starts from Shinjuku. The Tochomae station is about 2 minutes walk from the hotel and served by the Odeo metro line - which gives direct access to the Tsukijii fish market with the fresh yet cheap sushi and sashimi.I love the shopping malls at Shinjuku area as you can browse at the ever exciting food basement halls and do shopping. Good and reasonable restaurants are everywhere.I stayed at the Premier rooms and they are newly renovated. The size of the room is huge by Tokyo standard. My room faces the Tokyo Metropolitan Govt. Building and has a partial view of Mt Fuji on a clear day.I stayed at the Park Hotel Shidome Towers on my return to Tokyo as the Keio Plaza hotel is full. I am disappointed with the location - you need to take the metro or take a long stroll to more eating places. I need to take a taxi to the Tokyo Station to catch a return Narita Express to the airport. The room is very much smaller and the view is much better at the Keio Plaza despite being on the 2nd highest floor. It only cost slightly less and I will definitely return to the Keio Plaza on my next trip. I am disappointed that the Park Hotel was actually rated 2nd in the Trip advisor site for Tokyo.

<Content>Ok business hotel The Keio has a great location in Shinjuku near the station and close to the Tokyo City Metropolitan Offices.A fairly typical western style business hotel for the area, the Keio represents a safe option without being great and there are certainly better business hotels very nearby such as the Park Hyatt.The hotel is clean and has good amenities (pool, gym and many restaurants and bars) with very helpful staff many of whom speak good English.However, even the newer rooms in the South Tower are dated although well equiped with a full bath, fridge. The free internet (they provide a cable as there is no wireless) is also excellent.The rooms are also an adequate size (maybe about the same as the standard rooms at the Century Hyatt).Overall the Keio rates as a 4 star and not the official 5 star rating it is listed as in some guides

<Content>Nice hotel in Shinjuku This is one of the nicer hotels near Shinjuku station. Only about a 3000yen cab ride from the station. Rooms are relatively large with a queen bed and desk and dresser. The windows span an entire wall, so you get a great view if you are on an upper floor. The bathroom is pretty nice.The hotel makes it easy to not venture out. There are roughly ten restaurants in the hotel with a good variety of choices. If you do venture out, the restaurant district is just two blocks away. Breakfast is pretty good, too.Service is good with many of the employees able to speak a little English. You won't have an issue at the reservation desk, but don't count on talking with others.Also, there is a Citibank about 3 blocks away as well so you can access an ATM that works with US banks.My opinion is that the only hotel that is nicer in Shinjuku would be the Century Southern.

<Content>Nice size room and great location During my stay the hotel was very clean and service was great! I loved the location, it's very convenient. However, I don't recommend taking the limo-bus from Narita, it took me 2 1/2 hours. I've heard that the train is much faster and the Hotel is only a short walk from Shinjuku station (mostly through a covered underground tunnel).

<Content>Great location We stayed for 3 nights at Keio Plaza last month. For a family of six, 4 kids and 2 adults. They gave us a reasonable size room. The hotel is well situated and you have a covered walkway right to Shinjuku Station. Its walking distance to major department stores and food outlets. Overall I would say this is a good choice if you plan to travel around Tokyo by train as it is well located. Family-friendly too and the staff speaks good English and are well verse with tourist queries.

<Content>Large rooms for Tokyo Booked direct thru hotel's own easy to follow website. Got special rate of CAD 200 per night though with taxes etc gone up to US$200 per night with breakfasts though only in the tea lounge as mentioned in the prev review. Ideal for family with children because of room size. Arrived early at 10 am but still managed to be given a room to rest before taking Hato/Sunrise tour picked up right at the hotel. Convenient cos of Shinjuku Station and a closer Toei Subway station for self-directed tour..Beds are too soft for my back, however.Guest Relationships staffers are superficially polite but not too knowledgeable or helpfuleg. We bought a limousine bus airport/Tokyo metro card combination package, showed the lady at the GR but was told to use the most direct JR line? instead of using the Tokyo Metro for free with a change at Ginza.

<Content>Convenient Location, Large Room Shinjuku is convenient for shopping, nightlife, restaurants and access to all subway and rail lines, and the Keio Plaza is located on the other west side of Shinjuku approx. 4 blocks from the subway/rail station. Not a problem because it's connected to the station with an underground passage that has a moving walkway and there are a lot of reasonable restaurants and diverse nightlife one block from the hotel. The hotel itself is huge, with over 1400 rooms, so don't expect personal service. The lobby is always crowded with tours and business groups but the rooms are larger sized with large windows and views of Tokyo from higher floors. The hotel has three types of rooms: newly-renovated in modern style in the main tower, deluxe in main tower, and superior/standard in main and south towers. The deluxe rooms in the main tower are a little larger than the superior/standard rooms but with dated furnishings. I preferred the superior rooms in the south tower that had better and more recent furnishings. Bathrooms are modern with Toto washlets. Windows in rooms don't open. Our reasonable rates included breakfast that is served in the tea lounge. Better than adequate western food buffet with cold and hot items, though it's not the regular breakfast buffet in hotel's buffet restaurant. One complaint about the hotel's decor is that it could be in any western city; there is nothing Japanese about it. Still, a good value in a very convenient location in Tokyo.

<Content>Tokyo stole my heart...... This was the second time that we have stayed in this fabulous hotel and I have just booked another fortnight here in april 2007.The hotel is located in a fabulous part of Shinjuku close to shinjuku train station and close to the large shinjuku shopping area. The views from the large windows are breathtaking. And even though you are very close to the neon lit bustle of shinjuku the rooms are very quiet, the beds are extremely comfortable and you will get a great nights sleep.Rooms were fully equipped with everything you need including a fully stocked reasonably priced mini bar, Hairdryer, satellite TV, lovely toiletries, japanese tea / english tea and coffee...etc etc..Room service is excellent and prompt and there is an extensive Japanese / Continental / British menu that is available 24 hours a day.The rooms are very large and comfortable and very clean.They come complete with a japanese 'yukata' robe and free slippers.The hotel is a mini city in itself and has many restaurants, shops, and bars inside the huge skyscraper building. The view from the sky bar is fabulous!! Sip a cocktail whilst looking at the most fantastic view of Tokyo.The Keio Plaza also has a swimming pool and excellent gymnasium.My only criticism..... and it isn't really a criticism ( I am just desperate to find something that wasn't 100% !!)... the rooms are a little dated but the hotel have fully renovated one of it's towers with the new slick modern 'plaza premier' rooms and they plan to renovate the complete hotel within a couple of years.The first time we visited they supplied modems at reception if you wanted to use the internet in your room, however now all rooms are equipped with extremely fast free 100 mb internet.I took my laptop and was able to send photos and emails from my room every day which was really handy.I cannot praise the service highly enough...... but in my experience this is the same across the whole of Japan.The rooms were perfectly clean, the staff were extremely respectful, courteous and helpful and spoke many languages fluently.I plan on visiting this hotel every year from now on...... I fell in love with Tokyo and this hotel made both of my trips so far extra special.

<Content>Keio Plaza - Location, location, location We chose the Keio Plaza for its location and once there felt we had made an excellent choice. We wanted to be completely independent and by being right near Shinjuku Station we had ready access to anywhere we wanted to go. Hotel itself was also excellent - definitely 4 star plus, even though we only had a standard room. The room was spacious, the bathroom one of the best we''ve ever had, and our view was directly looking at the Metropolitan Govt. Office building - a landmark in its own right and quite spectacular, especially at night. Also in that particular building they offer free tours, and have a free observation platform on the 45th floor that overlooks the whole of Tokyo - open night and day. The nearby streets of Shinjuku seemed to be wall to wall restaurants and we had a great meal every night - the dearest being only $50 Australian, including beer. There were also department stores nearby which had food halls to die for - we were literally gobsmacked at the quantity, quality and presentation and packaging. ATM's were scarce on the ground but fortunately there was a post office a block away with oodles of ATM's and which was open 24 hours a day.The train system was most probably the thing we were most impressed by, and our one ride in a bullet train could only be described as wow. Shinjuku is the busiest station in Tokyo and caters for 4 million travellers a week, yet even in peak times we found it worked like clockwork - and the Japanese then, as we found them everywhere else, handled everything in such a polite and courteous manner. We had no trouble buying train tickets from vending machines - and followed the good advice we had been given, that if unsure what price ticket to buy, buy the cheapest ticket and then fix it up at the other end in one of the ticket adjustment machines. How civilised can you get! The behaviour on the transport system was always impeccable - signs requesting people not to use their mobile phones, not to eat or drink on the trains, etc., and then thanking them for the consideration, worked like a charm. Once again, how civilised!We did 3 day trips from Shinjuku - to Mt. Takao (just sublime), Kamakura and Mt. Fuji region. Also caught a train to Tokyo Station a few times and walked around Ginza (a bit akin to 5th Avenue, NY), to the Hama-rikyu Gardens on Tokyo Bay, to the Fish Markets and nearby local markets, and to a performance at the Kabuki-Za Theatre, where you can buy tickets to individual acts. Quite an experience and it exceeded our expectations.Also visited the 5 Museums area at Euno - caught a taxi there from Tokyo Station and found it quite reasonable. Noticed taxis all seemed to have white lace covers over the backs of their seats,and white damask covers on the seats themselves. They were just immaculate.After pounding the pavements day after day, or doing day trips, it was always great to get back to the Keio Plaza. It may have had over 1400 rooms and sound impersonal, but we found the rooms, service, and atmosphere excellent. Possibly our only ciriticism would be that we thought all their restaurants were pricey but with endless restaurants nearby that was the least of our worries. The fact that it's less than a 9 hour flight from Australia, only 1 hour time difference, you can drink the water anywhere, so many signs are in both English and Japanese, the people are helpful and courteous, plus the countryside is so interesting, has made us hope we can go back again for a more extensive trip.

<Content>Comfortable 'western' style hotel in the heart of Shinjuku My wife and I stayed at the Keio for several nights while visiting our son in Tokyo. All in all, it was a very pleasant stay. Hotel staff was exceptionally polite, as most Japanese are, and spoke passable English. The rooms were a bit small, but comfortable with all of the western style amenities one would expect. Since we traveled by rail every day, it was handy to have the Shinjuku station close by. It could easily be reached by waking through the underground tunnel just outside the hotel's side entrance. Our rate was booked through the hotel web site and included breakfast. Although some of the food choices were a bit odd (french fries as breakfast potatoes!) they did a good job of providing a passable selection of food: toast, cereal, bacon/sausage, yogurt, etc.Since our son is a local, he lined up our dining experiences so we did not try any other food in the hotel. It was very handy however, to have a convenience store right in the hotel! There is also a pretty cool western style restaurant in the bottom of the office building across the street called Guts Grille that served a passable Hawaiian pizza.One caution, allow plenty of travel time (at minimum of 90 minutes) in order to get back to Narita. Although the airport bus will pick you up directly at the hotel, Shinjuku is on the far side of Tokyo from the airport and it took easily over an hour just to reach the hotel.

<Content>A little dated but great location The Keio Plaza is one of those older hotels that was once a grand 5 star hotel. These days it's a little more run of the mill. The hotel lobby and surrounds are a little dated but pleasant and functional. We were placed in the older part of the hotel and the rooms showed it. There was quite a bad musty cigarette type smell in the room which initally prompted me to call down and asked for a different room - but the hotel operator didn't understand english and so we kind of got nowhere. As I was only staying for 3 days I decided to just live with it as I knew I wasn't going to spend alot of time there. The decor seemed dated and worn, however the rooms are quite spacious and the bathrooms were really big. The best part of the htoel is the location. Shinjuku is a pretty hip part of town and is Tokyo's only real skyscraper district. The hotel is also right near Shinjuku station which is one of Tokyo's biggest and busiest stations and as such is surrounded by hundreds of restaurants, shops and department stores. Just north of the station is also the red light district - which is unlike any red light district I have ever seen and is quintissentially japanese and certainly an attraction rather than a detraction. In the opposite direction to the station from the hotel is Shinjuku Central gardens which is a nice little park to get a break from the hustle and bustle of Tokyo. Oh and if you cross the park to the northern side you will find Denny's if your craving a little more western style food though even at Denny's it has a distinctive japanese flavour, which after all is why you'd come to Japan!

<Content>great service, very comfortable and convenient We were in Tokyo for a few days in March 2006 and were extremely pleased with our stay at Keio. The room is unexpectedly huge for Japan's standard especially the toilet. Besides it's comfortable and we look forward to return to our room after a tiring day.In addition, the hotel had great service. The staff was very helpful and courteous. We were in a hurry to check out and overlooked to check the drawers if we had any clothings. When we began to unpack we realised we had left a few items in the hotel. So we decided to call the hotel and the housekeeping department was very helpful. They had not only kept our items aside but was so kind to send it all across the ocean to our home within 2 days. There is a door-to-door limousine bus service to bring us to the international airport which was very convenient for us with a toddler. The variety of food was unimaginable. We were given more than 3 selections of breakfast - Japanese, western, international - more than what we expected.It's close to the shopping area, within walking distant.We will definitely return to Keio if we were to visit Tokyo again and strongly recommend it to all who wish a convenient location and comfortable and luxurious acommodation.

<Content>Unspectacular, but comfortable Whilst the hotel is well located in the heart of the Shinjuku district, the hotel itself is entirely unremarkable.Clean, comfortable - well maintained. You'd think there was nothing to complain about. The fact is however that the hotel felt extremely impersonal. It's so HUGE for starters (with something approaching 14 restaurants), with the resulting reduction in service one can expect from a staff who are responsible for so many people.Don't get me wrong - it wasn't a terrible visit by any means. My room was lovely and overlooked the Tokyo Metropolitan buildings and Mount Fuji. It's just that, on a personal level, large hotels like this do little for me.

<Content>Very convenient location, spacious room, adequate service ... Overall impression of the KEIO Plaza - pretty much perfect location for us, non-spectacular but very spacious room, adequately friendly and helpful staff.Location: It's slightly less than a 10 minute walk to the Shinjuku station (more or less depending on which line you want to take at the station), which is a super convenient station to get to almost anywhere. Better still, it's only about 2 minutes to get to the Tochomae Station (pretty much next door to the hotel) on the Toie Oedo line. Tochomae is probably not as central as Shinjuku Stn, but we found the Oedo line very useful too. But more than just subway/train stations, the hotel is located within walking distance of pretty much a whole lot of department stores, specialty shops, convenience stores ... well, everything. And perhaps the best part of it is that it's located on the west side of Shinjuku where you can actually enjoy some peace and quiet after being bombarded by the sights and sounds of East Shinjuku.Rooms: Although we were placed in a room located in the old wing of the hotel, we found the room comfortable and clean. Also, it was definitely spacious enough, and not at all like the tiny can't-place-your-luggage-anywhere hotel rooms we've heard about elsewhere. It wasn't as modern or stylish looking as the rooms in the new wing (as seen on their website), but we weren't looking for luxury, so the room was more than adequate. The beds were a tiny bit on the lumpy side though, but nothing major. The smoking room we had to accept turned out to not smell very much of smoke, so that was a plus for us.Service: Slight complaint - even though we had requested a very long time ago (and apparently received confirmation) that we wanted a non-smoking, double room, they had neither available at check-in, and so we had to settle with a twin/twin smoking room for the whole week. Because the room turned out to be not that bad, it was no huge deal. The staff were pretty much all friendly and helpful, and most of them spoke and understood English just fine. There were many choices of restaurants within the hotel, although we did not actually try any.To sum it up. If you are looking for low budget accommodation - this is not it. If you want quaint, traditional accommodation with that personal touch - this is not it. If you are seeking luxurious, modern and spectacular accommodation - this is probably not for you. But if you want a moderately-priced (by Tokyo standards) hotel with spacious, clean and comfortable rooms, and a convenient location (depending on where you want to go), then the KEIO Plaza should be there on your list.

<Content>Great location, but not spectacular The Keio plaza is located in the heart of Shinjuku, a magnificent skyscraper district. The hotel seems to used more by Japanese/East Asian tourists as opposed to westerners. The rooms were nice, clean, and large with well appointed bathrooms. The only problem I had is that it seemed almost too businesslike and the area of Shinjuku is not a true tourist area. There's not great shops/small markets or eateries. When I wanted to go out, I had to take the subway to other areas such as Roponggi, Asakusa, and Ginza. But, the massive Shinjuku station is only a 5min walk so getting to those areas was not difficult and when I left tokyo for Matsumoto, it was good that I only needed to lug bags for 10min to the train station. Overall, the hotel is solid, but not the place I would stay again.

<Content>great location - great hotel - will stay again! I have stayed at Keio Plaza many times and every time the service is always wonderful. Staff is courteous and helpful. It's only a 10-minute walk to Shinjuku JR station. It's a great hotel for both business and pleasure. It's one of my favorite hotels in Tokyo.

<Content>better than expected We received an upgrade to our room so can't comment on the standard rooms. Our room was large for japanese standards. Same as US size room.The location was great within walking distance to Shinjuku station. Small restaurants near by. Hadn't tried any of the hotels restaurants but their was always a long line at the Japanese Buffet in the bottom floor. I would definetely stay there again. Also stayed at the Hilton Tokyo which is about a 10 minute walk from Keio which was also nice but you felt as if you were still in the States.

<Content>The best hotel in the world? We stayed at the Keio Plaza in Shinjuku for 2 weeks while visiting the Tokyo gameshow using it as a base for exploring Shinjuku and Tokyo in general.The twin room was large and comfortable, very clean and the view from our 24th story window of the Metropolitan Government Office Buildings across the street was amazing.The staff were polite and courteous even going to the extremes of holding open automatic doors for us. The bars on the top floors offer stunning views of Shinjuku but are very expensive.

<Content>What I expected This hotel is perfectly adequate - rooms are clean if a little dated (the new premier plaza rooms are supposed to be much larger and totally renovated but are much more expensive). The hotel is huge and has 2 towers which makes it slightly confusing as to where restaurants are etc. The bars on the top floors have great views over the city, particularly at night, and have massive potential but are complete throw-backs to 1970's and don't look like they have been refurbished since! Hotel is handily located for public transport and access to city. Basically an excellent base if you plan to spend a lot of time sighseeing and not in the hotel and are looking for a moderatly priced (hotels are expensive in Tokyo) hotel in convenient area to rest your head. Concierge/reception speak excellent English and are very helpful. Go to the jazz bar at Grand Hyatt Hotel on a Sunday evening - fantastic jazz, wine, cigars and atmosphere in laid ack leather chairs (not the usual crap lobby bar set-up at all)!

<Content>So-so, not too great We usually choose this location as it's close to shops and department stores. Overall nice hotel, fast check-in, etc., but the central air conditioning seems to be too warm in winter and not cold enough in the summer. Ask for South Tower as the rooms are bigger and cleaner than the Main Tower. Rooms in the Main Tower could use some updating.
