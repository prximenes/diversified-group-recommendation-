<Content>Convenient and Good 2 star hotel The hotel is located near the Hospital Clinic metro. Although there is a garage opposite, there are two more shops i.e. Cabpro and Discor nearby. Use bus 59 (very frequent) as the stops is a 3 minute walk away and gets you down to Plaza Catalunya in 10 mins.Ask for a room that does not face the road and you would be fine. I know a lot of others complain about this and that about the hotel, (room size, noise, blah..blah..) but in reality, the rooms are very acceptable and comfortable. Hairdrier, toileteries and good shower (some expect things to be the same as the US would complain about the shower) for the price paid.Another tip, Maitea, a famous Basque rest ,nearby the hotel, is great for tapas and reasonably priced compared to Las Ramblas area.

<Content>Disappointed My husband and I were pretty disappointed with this hotel. First of all, they are very misleading with where they are located (advertised/online on travelvelocity). They claimed to be located on Las Ramblas/Barri Gottic when in reality they are two train rides (about 15 to 20 minutes) away. The room was extremely small for two people and the bathroom was incredibly small, the t.v. was extremely small, their was constantly noise that could be heard throughout the night and no air conditioning. The crazy thing is that your room key has to go into a slot on the wall in order for the electricity to work in the rooms. It is there way of saving energy but then the fridge is off throughout the day and your drinks are warm. However, the hotel was clean and the staff was pleasant. The cleanliness of the hotel was the best part of our stay there. I do not plan on going back nor recommend this hotel to others.

<Content>If you like a noisy aircondition I stayed in the Junior Hotel in December.Although the room was quite small, it was O.K. so far. Not much to complain.In the night, they have turned on the air condition every now and again to heat the hotel. It was terrible. It was so loud, I hardly slept.After the second night I moved to another hotel.Maybe it is better during summer.

<Content>Good Value Stayed here last week for the Rangers champions league game. Check in was fine and the guy on reception was pleasant.Rooms were excellent more than I would expect from 2 star. Only problem I had here was the room was freezing at nightime. No heating and the cover was a bit flimsy apart from that the stay was fine.Contary to other reports I found the night man most helpful especially when me and my boyfriend were being a bit daft and had a problem with the room key.

<Content>Good for brief stay Hotel felt newly renovated, clean, simple and small. Buffet breakfast was very good. BUT, air conditioning was shut off during the night, supposedly because of neighbourhood complaints to the police. Pool was closed during most of our stay (bacteria levels). Very noisy neighourhood. Staff were incompetent and night staff would have romantic moments with their love interest in the lobby.

<Content>Disaster, incompetence! My husband and I stayed at thishotel from August 28 to September 3, 2007 and during our 6 night stay, we had to change our room a total of 3 times! When we arrived on the first day, there was a mini fridge in our room that was operating but the a/c in our room was not working. It was about 33 degrees at the time. We went to reception to inform them that there was no a/c in our room and it seemed that they were well aware there was no a/c and offered us the use of a small table fan for now as there were no other rooms available at the moment. As we had no other alternative, we accepted the use of the small fan and opened our window and suffered through the heat and noise of the street for that night. The next day, we were moved to another room - with operational a/c and a mini fridge. When we arrived at this room, the a/c was working - but the mini fridge was not so we could not keep any water or anything cold - and boy was it warm. Again, we went back to the reception to report the fridge not working and a male receptionist told us very firmly that we were expecting too much from a hotel which is only rated as a 2-star hotel. Now we were really ticked off and I demanded to speak to the hotel manager once again. Upon speaking to the hotel manager, I told him that if he could not provide us with the service that we have paid for, then please send us to an alternate hotel - where we will receive the services that we have paid for and we are expecting. He said he would see what he could do by tomorrow morning. The next day, yet again we were given our third room - on the top floor of the hotel, the 5th floor - where everything was working o.k. until our last night's stay. When we arrived back at the hotel in the evening from sightseeing during the day, we were told by a female receptionist that we have had some problems with the elevator today and I am sorry but you will have to walk upstairs to your room and I am not sure if the elevator will even be working by tomorrow. She continued on by saying that we even had to call the fire department. Now we were wondering what really took place here while we were away from the hotel all day and walking up a total of approximately 102 steps was not our idea of fun after walking for many hours already. Once we went up to our room and turned on the faucet in the bathroom, we noticed that the water must have been shut off for a time as the water coming out of the faucet was flowing irregularly as if it had been shut off for a time. We went for dinner and came back to our room and now noticed that the mini fridge in our room was no longer working and through the night, the a/c also stopped working as well. The next morning, we walked down the several flights of stairs to the basement to have breakfast and we noticed that there were only a few people in the breakfast room. Of course, not many people would enjoy walking up and down over 100 steps. However, as it was our last day, we thought we would have breakfast and get our things ready and check out. There was now an OUT OF ORDER sign on the elevators and we asked the receptionist if there was someone that could help us with our luggage from the 5th floor. We were told that there was only 1 guy available as everyone else is in the basement cleaning up the mess as a water pipe had burst. Now we knew why our water was running intermittent the previous day. The photos on the internet do not do this hotel justice and I would not recommend staying at this hotel for anymore that a day. You just never know what will happen next and living like this - on your vacation - is extremely unpleasant. It was no use taking your things out of the suitcase as every other day we changed rooms. Choose another hotel!

<Content>Good hotel away from tourist area, excellent value Ideally located, modern clean hotel. Air conditioned rooms with complementary bathroom products. The night receptionist was especially helpful. The hotel is easily reached by metro (Hospital Clinic station). We asked for room away from the road as other reviewers had mentioned the road noise, this request was granted. The room was an odd shape but perfectly adequate. We had not booked the hotel breakfast (鈧?0pp) and had planned to use the Pans  Co across the road, instead we had an excellent breakfast in La Fornet (less than 鈧?pp) only two doors down from the hotel. Across the road is a garage for snacks and water supplies and an excellent pizza restaurant (similar to Pizza Express), very handy as we arrived on a late-ish flight. We bought a 3 day transport pass, available at all metro stations, that gave us unlimited use of the metro, buses and also the train back to the airport. We found this was easier than a T-10 as we did not have to worry about when the ticket would run out. I would recommend this hotel to COUPLES who want to be able to get out of the tourist centre yet still be central to reach all the sights. EXCELLENT VALUE.

<Content>Good experience The hotel Junior was a good hotel. Positives include: good location (just outside of the tourist areas), great breakfast, and accomodating staff. Negatives include: small room and street noise. Overall though, good hotel for the money spent.

<Content>Great Budget Hotel Stayed there 3 nights in Mar 2007, and very pleased with the experience. Conveniently located - 5 mins from a metro station, and slightly away from the most touristy part of town (Barri Gotic and Ramblas) where I think the rooms would be more cramped. The room was small, but adequate. Bathroom was nice and well appointed. Walls are thin, like all hotels of this nature. Staff were friendly. Would definitely stay there again and highly recommend this as a good budget hotel.

<Content>Noisy rooms, unhelpful staff... Hotel Junior is a decent budget hotel in many ways. Decent, clean rooms (except water didn't go down well in shower), and a cute terrace with indoor pool that's open until around 7 or 8pm.What I didn't like about Junior is that I felt like I was sleeping on a highway because of the big street right outside my front-facing window. No noise insulation AT ALL. The many motorcycles and various sirens made it all the worse. When we requested a room change, different people gave us conflicting reasons why no other rooms were available. My main issue was that we requested a wake-up call on our last night to make it to the airport the next morning. The call never happened. When we called frantic in the morning, the woman told us that there is no way to prove that we really requested the call, and therefore, she could do nothing but call us a cab. When we requested the hotel pay for our taxi, she said no because again, there was no way to prove we really asked for the call. No hospitality. But the hotel's cheap, so if you want to come here, bring earplugs, a noise machine, and a loud alarm clock (no clocks in room).

<Content>Good hotel We arrived at the hotel by taxi from the airport, which cost approx 鈧?5. The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful, and speak good English. Our room, number 46, was fairly small and an odd shape but perfectly adequate for the amount of time we spent there. The room was spotlessly clean and overlooked a small courtyard so we weren't disturbed by traffic noise from the main road. The rooms have a TV and mini bar but the prices were obviously quite inflated. The petrol station / garage across the road sells drinks and snacks a lot cheaper. Breakfast is in the Aston Hotel round the corner and there was a good selection of fruit, pastries, cereal, etc which is replenished regularly.The only downside is that the rooms have hard floors, rather than carpets, and we were woken up a few times by inconsiderate guests next door and above us stomping about with high heeled shoes on. The hotel itself is approx a 5 minute walk from the Hospital Clinic metro station. We bought a T-10 ticket which gives you 10 journeys for 鈧?.90 and shared the ticket between the two of us. There are plenty of cafes and bars in the area and a few restaurants. We had a lovely meal at the Restaurante Peppo a few doors down from the hotel, towards Carrer de Londres. We had two courses with drinks and coffee for 鈧?7, which was great value for money.I'd stay at this hotel again.

<Content>outrageous upon arriving at the hotel at just before midnight on the 8th dec 06there was a party of twelve colleagues from work.we had booked 6 twin rooms weeks in advance as there was only two couples in the party. i was hoping to just crawl into bed and sleep, however when my partner and i got to the room it was filthy, the bed sheets had not been changed the dirty towels lay on the floor, there was cigratte ash everywhere and the toilet hadn't even been flushed.not only that they had given us six double rooms and though this was fine for the couples it was not fine for everybody else.a mother and daughter in the party had to share a single bed!!as for the rest of the party after nearly an hour complaining to the staff, matresses were put on the floor in the double rooms. we were told we woyuld recieve a discount the next day, which we never recieved. to add to this that the restaurant and the bar we were told were in our hotell were actually in a different hotel and were closed. andthe hotel was not as close to the tourist atrractions as the website states. to be quite honest the service we recieved was appaling and i would nver go back to this hotel.the staff even threatened to call the police when we complainedmy advice is choose a different hotel!!!!

<Content>Very friendly, helpful staff in clean, welcoming hotel I stayed in this hotel in early December 2005. The hotel was very clean with extremely welcoming, helpful staff, checking addresses on the internet, showing places of interest on maps etc. All spoke English. Room was big with smart bathroom and, as I requested, I had a bathroom with a tub rather than just a shower.I travelled to the hotel from the airport via train and metro which took over two hours but returned via the airport bus (from Placa d'Espagna) and taxi which was only 25 minutes in all and a few Euros more expensive (lots of stairs and few escalators in metro, so the bus is easier if you have lots of luggage and/or mobility problems).As a woman travelling alone, I felt the area where the hotel is situated was very safe and only about 20 minutes door to door to La Rambla area via metro.The Barcelona Card is a great way to get around the city and have discounts/free entry/travel to various attractions (check out the municipal swimming baths/leisure centre, Passeig Maritime, near the Olympic towers, 8 pools, sauna etc, entry was only 6 Euros open until midnight in the week). I bought my Barcelona Card at the airport but they are on sale at tourist offices etc.The only problem that I had with the hotel was the traffic noise but I invested 拢1 in some earplugs which cut all sound. Hot and cold buffet breakfast was fine, there is a bakery on the corner plus all night garage nearby which sells groceries and alcohol.PLEASE be careful about pickpockets in Barcelona. I met many people who had been stung, one by a very slick gang who pretended a bird had made a mess on a womans head, they came to her rescue with bottled water and tissues whilst stealing her husbands wallet. Also whilst on a tour of the cathedral, a member of my tour had her purse stolen.Just be very careful as you would in any big city and do not let the pickpockets put you off visiting this amazing, beautiful place.I would really recommend this hotel and would certainly stay there again either travelling alone or with my family.

<Content>Excellent allround except for traffic noise The Junior Hotel is situated in Avinguda de Sarria 5 minutes walk from Hospital Clinic metro station. The bus stop for both the red and blur routes on the Bus Turistic is 7 minutes walk away. The centre can be reach by public transport within 15 minutes. The accommodation itself is a high standard in our opinion above its 2* classification. The rooms are clean, simply but tastefully furnished with air conditioning. The bathrooms are excellent and the buffet breakfast we can recommend. The staff go out of their way to be helpful and reception is manned 24 hours a day. The main drawback is the hotel is situated on a main road and most rooms suffer from some traffic noise during the night which is disturbing when you want a good night sleep so you can sight see the next day. Apart from this aspect we cannot fault this hotel.
