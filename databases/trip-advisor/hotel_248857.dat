<Content>Young and chic Didn't know what to expect from either Berlin in December or the Mandala but both came good for us. The hotel as mentioned is in the very modern Potsdamer platz area. The entrance and lobby are fairly small and unassuming but the staff were all friendly and helpful during our stay. The room was on the 10th floor with a small balcony looking out across the Sony Centre and its spectacular roof. One of the highlights was breakfast in the Facil restaurant, a square room mostly made of glass with a couple of water features. That doesn't perhaps do it justice but it's stylish and the food was excellent. The only small gripe we had with the hotel was a 15 minute wait on our last morning for a table - it is not a terribly big dining room for the hotel and I would guess this is not that unusual at busier times.The city is great to visit and the hotel is ideally place for walking, cycling or any other mode of transport might use for sight-seeing.

<Content>Nice Hotel Central location We stayed at the Mandala hotel for seven nights and found it to be a pleasant hotel.Don't be put off by the lobby it is small, but rooms are spacious, clean and well serviced. Staff are quite friendly and helpful. The breakfast was outstanding and has everything you could ask for. As we were on a long trip the washing machine and dryer came in handy for washing clothes.The mandala is in a very good location if you want to see Berlin, close to most sights, decent restaurants, shops and train stations. Overall this is a fairly decent hotel for the price.

<Content>The Mandala Hotel in Berlin is an awsome hotel! The room and bathroom were both very nice. The service as well as breakfast was great!! If we're going to Berlin again we will certainly stay there.

<Content>Everything perfect, until I tried to sleep on the bed I have travelled fairly often for business and I was so impressed by the service and the decor and layout of both the hotel itself and the hotel room. I thought it was perfect. There was a lot of space and some fairly nice touches, like the bath that would fit two people, the desk that had plenty of room around it and chairs on both sides, the granite kitchen area, most of all the frequency modulator that blocked stray radio frequencies and I could actually feel the difference upon walking into the room, it felt so very peaceful.So in all it was perfect.That was until I went to bed. I had a queen bed with the softest mattress I have ever slept on, so in the morning my back was wrecked, same for my neck after trying to sleep on pillows so soft and fluffy but that disintegrated inside once you lay upon them, and a single duvet ontop of the queen bed, something I found neither stylish or comfortable.I called for more pillows and another duvet, and they obliged, but it was pointelss sleeping on a queen bed with only the room to move under the thin width of a single duvet.So it looked great, but for me the most important thing in a hotel room is the bed, and because of this very reason, I'll never stay there again.

<Content>Oasis of tranquility in the heart of the city When I entered the lobby of this design hotel it gave me the impression to be narrow. The rooms are however pretty big, very comfortable and timeless in style. What I found most amazing is that there were -besides a huge flat TV screen- CDs in the room with relaxing music, interesting books (novels) and magazines. I had a room with a kitchenette (which I didin't use) and a huge balcony towards a quiet backyard. The bathroom is huge and modern. They have a nice breakfast room, very stylish with palm trees and great food selection. Staff was very friendly.Another advantage of this hotel is also the proximity to the underground (2 minutes walk). The Brandenburger Tor and Unter den Linden can be easily reached by foot.

<Content>Promised so much but failed to deliver The Mandala aspires to excellence but disappoints in service.With well-appointed rooms, beautiful interiors, a newly renovated spa and a smiling staff you'd think this hotel had it all.Unfortunatley that wasn't the case during our stay.To begin with they couldn't find our reservation.Three people at the front desk spent 15 minutes not finding it.I was then directed to their customer computer to find the reservation myself. Too bad their computer was out of order.I suggested that they call the site we used to book the roomThis came as an unexpected idea. At first they were reluctant...the lines might be busy (?!) but eventually the manager decided to give it a go.We were then sent to the bar for a complimentary coffee while they sorted things out.At this point approx. 45 minutes had passed since our arrival.15 minutes later someone arrived to tell us that they had located out reservation: it had been lost in the system but the manager with his special computer had been able to retrieve it.Sigh.She tells us that the room is made up for one but that they'll immediately send someone up to prep it for two.Four hours later no one has arrived.We call reception and they send someone up.However, for the rest of our stay there is still only one bathrobe and one set of slippers.In the beautiful newly renovated spa I'm hoping to get a massage so I go up to look at the different treatments available.A week after their new opening they have no brochures or any other printed material about which treatments they offer.They seem puzzled by me (all 7 of them staring at me when I ask for some information) and the spa manager promises to send something to my room.3 hours later (and too late for me to book a treatment) a thick manilla folder arrives full of information.Lastly, the bar. Which I love! Wonderful drinks and a nice ambience!We order the After Work special which they've advertised and receive champagne cocktails. After another drink and dinner (excellent kitchent) we receive our bill. The price for the After Work special is 11 euros whereas it was advertised at 5 euros. When I ask the waitress she looks confused and goes to speak with the bartender.She returns and informs us that there is no After Work special, only a Special drink of the day (full price).So while the hotel is lovely and the staff is very polite and helpful, the actual service level falls far short of what the hotel aspires to and promises.Not a tragedy, but it certainly detracts from the overall experience.

<Content>Awesome Hotel Excellent hotel, the rooms are massive, especially if you get a suite. We were there for the marathon so booked well in advance, but had such a fantastic room. Very spacious and ideal for a toddler to crawl around, make noise and not cause mischief.One of the best hotels/apartments I've stayed at.

<Content>Huge room, great location What a surprise upon arrival.......when I entered the small lobby, I thought this was going to be one of those boutique hotels that only looked nice on websites...but it wasn't like that when we got into our huge room. There's a living area separate from the big comfortable bed, and also a separate office area....the bathroom was huge ase well. The room was extremely comfortable and the decorations are very classy. The location is right by the Sony Center but a bit far from the main shopping area. I would stay at this hotel again when I visit Berlin...the size of the rooms can't be beat in Europe.

<Content>Good value and location Nice modern hotel with good location on Potsdamer Platz, which has both U and S bahn stations. It is only a 5 minute walk to the Brandenberg Gate and Reichstag Parliament building. Behind the hotel is the Arkaden shopping mall where on the ground floor you can find cafes and supermarkets.  I stayed in an Executive Suite which was one large room with open plan kitchette, lounge and bedroom area with a balcony overlooking the inside courtyard. The bedroom is not actually a seperate room but is divided off from the living area. The kitchette is very convenient for making your own drinks, breakfast or snacks but you would want to cook a full meal here as there is no microwave or oven just 2 small cooking hobs. If you want any utensils or pans these can be requested. You can also request a DVD player but they do charge for this. On each floor there is also a laundry room with washers, dryers and an iron, washing powder is provided. Overall, I would definately recommend this hotel for its convenient location, nice modern decor, friendly staff and reasonable prices.

<Content>Great Suites My husband and I stayed at the Mandala for 6 days in April/May 08.It was my first trip to Berlin and I found the hotel very centrally located to explore the whole city with easy access to public transportation. Potsdammer Place is not especially charming but there are good restaurants nearby and many sights are within walking distance. The hotel itself has excellent suites and the morning breakfast spread is delicious. The staff was generally helpful, although the reception area is tiny so there is not much room to linger if you need to discuss travel or restaurant plans.The workout area and spa upstairs are light filled and a welcome refuge from the busy-ness outside the hotel. I would stay here again.

<Content>A classy, nice hotel in an excellent locaiton I stayed in the Mandala, to be found right at the Potsdamer Platz, over a weekend. My room was called an executive suite, located on the 6th floor. It was very spacious, especially the bathroom and the walk-in clothes closet, and arranged in a very pleasing way. Additionally, my room featured a balcony which looked out the back of the hotel onto a brick building and a very quiet street. Small touches made it especially comfortable for me - the swivel tv (so it wasn't a flatscreen, but still), the CDs, the books in the shelves. Everything was clean and crisp, and the AC was making sure that I wasn't dying of heat (37掳 C). I was a little miffed at the price for the WLAN, considering you can get it free right across the street in the sony center (an amazing new complex!!!), or at a number of coffee or food chains, but I guess you can't have it all. The staff at the front desk were well schooled and very helpful. Unfortunately, the spa on the 11th floor is being renovated so I did not get a chance to experience anything of that sort. The spa in the sister hotel is available for use, however. I also enjoyed a couple of drinks and dishes in the first floor lounge, and thought both the lounge and the food were excellent (and again, most attentive staff). The area itself is one of my favorites in berlin - everything is new and modern, and shopping/dining is plentiful around here. To summarize - if you get a good deal for the weekend, it is definitely a hotel you should stay at. I know I will if I come to berlin again.

<Content>Secret urban retreat We were in love with this hotel before even arriving! We had booked an Executive Suite and were allocated to the 11th floor, so our suite had fabulous views over Berlin and a nice terrace. The suite itself was excellent; well equipt and in a modern, yet not too minimalistic and cold design. Loved that they provided cd's in the room! Unfortunately their restaurant, Facile, was closed when we where there, but the bar served fantastic food and the service was excellent!When it comes to location, The Mandala is a bit secretive and is not in the most happening of neighborhoods, but we didn't mind at all. The U-bahn and S-bahn are just around the corner and taxis are quite cheap. And, of course, you can always walk :)Staff was very friendly and service minded.We would definately recommend this hotel and look forward staying there again!

<Content>Just wonderful We stayed in Mandala to celebrate my birthday and to go to the Blue Man show, and it proved to be the right choice. It was my second time in Berlin and the experience could not have been better. The room was huge and the staff was very friendly and pacient. They prove to be quite familiar with other languages and always had a smile on their faces. The food was great and the atmosphere very nice. Breakfast fantastic and the breakfast room wonderful especially with snowflakes falling.The hotel spa is great and it is located on the top of the building with a wonderful blick uber Berlin. The hotel is located in the new East Berlin area near theatres, shopping malls, bars, restaurants, and the famous Fuji replica. There are also museums in the area and a large transport center.

<Content>Perfect Location. Wonderful stay. We could not have been more happy with our stay at the Mandala Hotel. First, the location: Perfect in every way and within walking distance of many of the historical sites in Berlin. We were lucky enough to have great weather during our stay in April, so we could walk to Museum Island, Brandenburg Gate, Reichstag, embassy row, etc. Foodwise, we were able to eat both at Qiu and Facil. If you have the means and the inclination for fine dining, we highly recommend a dinner at Facil. Wonderfully prepared food in an elegant setting with beautiful service. They also were excellent in working with my husband's nut allergy, changing the preparations of 3 of the 4 dishes on the tasting menu. The wines were also wonderful--if you don't want a bottle, the sommelier recommendations by the glass are outstanding. Qiu also serves lovely food, but is not necessarily going to be your destination dinner place--you won't be disappointed if you go there, though, if you are tired after a busy day. We stayed in a Management Suite, which featured tons of closet space (more than enough for 2 people) and a super-large bathroom. The largest hotel room we have stayed in while in Europe. There was even a small terrace (no seating here--though we didn't ask for chairs, so I don't know if they are available). We were really delighted by the quality of the accomodations and the modern decor. This is not the place for someone who wants an old world setting, however.Service was efficient and polite. Enjoy your stay at the Mandala!

<Content>A really great experience We had a wonderful stay here. The hotel is very stylish, quiet, and perfectly located in Berlin, right opposite the Sony Centre (lots of shops and restaurants), a short walk to the Reichstag and 100m from the U- and S-Bahn, right in the heart of the new Berlin. The suite was spacious, comfortable with an excellent bathroom. Breakfast in the restaurant was equally good - the combination of buffet style with fresh-cooked eggs works well, and the bar was just what we needed after a long day's sightseeing. There is a spa at the top of the hotel, but we didn't use it. The staff were friendly, helpful and welcoming - we couldn't have asked for more. As a retired airline pilot, I have stayed in very many hotels over the years, but I have rarely had a stay I have enjoyed as much. If you want a large, bustling hotel with several restaurants and lots of shops then this is not the place for you, but if you're after a quiet, stylish oasis to return to after a hard day out, you will be very happy here.From our experience, this is a very, very good hotel indeed.

<Content>Great location We stayed here over the 2007/2008 New Year and booked it primarily due to the proximity to the Brandenburg Gate (a 10-minute walk) which is the focus of the New Year (Silvester) celebrations. It was wonderful to know that we were such a short walk away at the end of the night. We also got our own personal fireworks display at our hotel window courtesy of folks on the street below.The hotel is bang opposite the Sony Centre at Potsdamer Platz and you can easily hop on the U-bahn (underground/subway) to get to other locations like the Ku'damm for shopping/the zoo or Alexanderplatz in the east.We booked an Executive Suite at the Mandala. The room was huge, with a small kitchenette, large bedroom with desk and sofa, and a large bathroom with a big bath, perfect for wallowing in after a cold day of sightseeing. The room was stylish and modern in decor, as is the whole hotel.Breakfast was included in our room, and we had it every day, in the Facil restaurant, although if we had to pay to 23 Euro charge (per person!), we would have opted to make something in our room instead. The buffet was immaculately presented, with staff constantly topping up food supplies and making sure everything was perfectly aligned (no, I'm not kidding) and all labels pointing in the right direction. You could order hot food from the staff, who all seemed to speak six languages.On our first night, we'd had an early start and just wanted to relax with a DVD in our room and some pizza. The staff helped us to find a DVD in English from their library (bring your own...most are German) and ordered pizza from a local restaurant for us. They were very helpful.The only criticisms we could find were a) the pillows, which were typical German/European and far too thin to be effective and b) the housekeeping staff, who seemed to ignore the electronic Do Not Disturb signs when it suited them.Otherwise, it was on the pricey side but we spent a lot of time in the room and the location was great, so I'd say it was worth it.

<Content>Outstanding Business Hotel I was in Berlin for five days on business. I stayed at the Mandala. I found the hotel facilities and the staff excellent. All of the staff spoke good English and were very helpful - from rebooking flights to providing me with sellotape and recommending an interesting walking route. I stayed in one of the business suites. It was a well thought out design that allowed for separate sleep and working areas. The room included a kitchenette, lounge area, desk, bedroom and bathroom area. The most impressive aspects of the hotel were the details: the desk was spacious and had network cables, plenty of electricity points (at desk level!), and was complete with the office necessities (highlighters, post it notes, stapler etc); the hallways and lobbies feature interesting photos and art; and most importantly there was no noise from neighbouring rooms. I can highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>An oasis of calm... Have just returned from a great weekend in Berlin, made all the better for staying at the sublime Mandala hotel. We booked a 'management suite' on a booking website for a fair bit cheaper than the rates advertised on the Mandala's own - and it was really good value for money. Despite being right on Potsdamer Platz, our room was very quiet and perfectly relaxing - a real pleasure to go home to at the end of the day! It's tastefully furnished to a high standard, and the bathrooms are enormous (as was the bed). We didn't have a chance to try the Spa on the 11th floor, but the prices looked reasonable.The food and drink we had there was all very good and we found the staff to be really polite and helpful. Breakfast (at 23 Euros a head) is a little steep, but you can't fault the food and it'll keep you going 'til the evening! We'll definitely go back to Berlin and the Mandala and I wholeheartedly recommend it as a base for exploring the city - Reighstag, Brandenburg Gate and Unter den Linden are all within easy walking distance.

<Content>Classy Hotel in a Great Location! The Mandala Hotel is a small boutique style classy hotel in a premium location across from the Sony Center right on Potsdamer Platz. We stayed five nights while sightseeing in and around Berlin. Almost everything we wanted to see was within walking distance from this hotel, and those sights that were further away were easily accessible via the subway station just around the corner. We did not utilize the nice spa or recreation area with the exception of one morning in the fitness room, but we could see that it was very nice. This was a pretty expensive place to stay, and unfortunately breakfast was not included in the price. Some of the front desk clerks were friendly and some were not, but our overall experience with the staff was great. We highly recommend this hotel for the beautiful rooms (and especially the large beautiful bathrooms!) and the location alone.

<Content>Nice staff but very poor management We just returned from Berlin after we booked two 5 day packages for this hotel through LuxuryLink. Since each package included a dinner at their restaurant (Facil) I had emailed the hotel to make certain that the reservations had been made and for which nights, as I had requested in March when I booked the stay. Two days before we left, I received an email stating that the restaurant was closed. After a game of email tag, they wrote that they agreed to book us in another restaurant. Fine. When we arrived, the staff was very nice and helpful, held our luggage for us, gave us some tips, brought us towels to freshen up, etc. Couldn't have been nicer. Then it all fell apart. They also did not mention that the hotel was being renovated. Drilling and hammering started at 8:30 a.m. and paint fumes filled the halls to the point of giving us a headache. Also, try getting a newspaper delivered to your room. They finally got it right by the time we left. The final straw was trying to book the second dinner. The first one they arranged was great - Vox which I highly recommend. I kept asking whether we could book the second dinner for the night before we left. After much hand wringing from the staff let me know that the manager would need to approve it. I kept repeating taht the package included two dinners. They kept telling me that the manager would call. That never happened. Finally one morning there was a note on the desk which I found after coming out of the shower. It indicated that they would allow us a second dinner at Le Forbourg restaurant at 8pm. Now the manager's tone of 鈥渁llowing us鈥?was annoying since we paid for his as part of the package. Long story to short, the restaurant had no reservation or idea of any arrangement. It was very embarrassing. Sitting down to what was one of the worst meals in Berlin (we never had the chance to order wine, needed a flare to get a waiter, basically inedible food, you get the idea), we were out of there in a half an hour. The front desk at the hotel apologized said they鈥檇 take care of it.  After waiting for three hours for a response from the manager, I finally camped out in the lobby to wait for him (Herr Schaeffer). He first said that he tried to speak with me and there was no answer at our room, which was a lie since we sat there for three hours. Then he basically told me that there's nothing he could do, they'd pay for that meal at that restaurant, not arrange another and blamed the entire episode on Luxury Link. Then proceeded to tell me that the restaurant did indeed have a reservation for us and that there was a miscommunication. THEN he proceeded to tell me that they had placed phone calls me to letting me know that the restaurant was closed and that they were renovating.This was not the case and his accusitory tone was at best rude, at worst innappropriate. His lack of customer care was a nightmare. I Seems like he had someone to blame for everything - including us! If you鈥檙e going to offer a package, don鈥檛 make the clients feel like welfare cases by using the amenities, Avoid this hotel.

<Content>Spacious, well designed rooms I stayed on a quick, overnight business trip to Berlin - so not much time to experience all aspects of the hotel. A good position in the 'new centre' of the city. Not much of an entrance to the hotel, with a small lobby. Check in was quick and efficient.The bedrooms are great. Spacious, well designed and stylish decor. There is even a small kitchen area in the room - which I would presume is great for a long stay. The entertainment choices are quite domestic (not many English channels on offer). Oversized bathrooms are also a another plus.The bar is quite small, but nicely designed and perfect for a quick drink, before heading out to enjoy the city. I only experienced the restaurant for breakfast - which was very good. The restaurant is a 'glass block' in the central courtyard - a chic start to the day.Definately a good recommendation for travellers who like to shy away from the 'chain hotel' experience.

<Content>Perfect in every way! The Potsdamer Platz area itself is amazing, must be seen to believe the incredible modern architecture that has arisen in such a short time after the Wall came down. Well this hotel with its unassuming facade is perfect in every way, Superior location, convenient to trains, S and U Bahn, fabulous new shopping arcade and wonderful abundance of restaurants, not to mention the Sony Center, Lego Land, German Movie Museum all directly across the street. Hotel itself is ultra modern, enormous rooms, some of which have balconies, which over look a quiet inner green area. Our room for three had a separate desk/bed area for our son with his own balcony, so we lucked out with two balconies. Rooms are more than twice the size of your typical standard European hotel. Gigantic bathroom also, with bathrobes and slippers of course, good water pressure too. Didn't get a chance to eat in the restaurant, breakfast was not included , but many places nearby. Great night club around the corner, Adagio and Italian restaurant Essenza on corner. Would certainly return, prime location, excellent staff and hotel.

<Content>THE MANDALA, BERLIN Great stay at the Mandala in Berlin, in the hearth of Potsdamerplatz, just in front of the Sony Center and few steps away from many cultural points and sites of interest.Brand new hotel with all facilities.Just take note that some rooms do not have air-con, during hot season better ask for it.Excellent breakfast in the Facil Restaurant with excellent food and service.

<Content>Can you imagine that some guests want to live on the 10th floor? After having stayed at Dorint Sofitel and Lux 11, I decided to try another design hotel. I have different feelings about it. Actually I was expecting room upgrade, because American express website ( I have fa platinum card) offered a promotion in coop with this hotel, and the upgrade was offered when mntioning Amex code/ So the stuff at the reception told me that have heard nothing about such a promotion. Ok. Then I was shown the room. It was exactly the opposite from what I have expected. It was Executive Suite. But it had no Potsdarm Views which I have requested. And the colour scheme of the room was too frog-like. So the guy from the reception has brought some of our luggage, and I have inquired about the possibility to change the room, because it was different from my expectations.The guy was very good-looking as for Berlin. But sometimes I have the feeling that those super good-looking people should earn their money in some other services. He said,  Yes, some people also want to live on the 10th floor, what shall we do then?Actually, I see myself no surprise that some people want to live on the 10th floor, because it's demand-supply world, and they have every right (if they pay) to live on the 10th floor if they have requested it and noone said it's not possible beforehand.I did not want to live on the 10th floor, I wanted to have the room with a view on Potzdarmer Platz.So after talking to the reservation department, I was offered to change rooms next day. And the next room we had was a dream. It was a corner suite with all the views possible, nice business colour scheme, and I was feeling great there.So when reserving something at Mandala, do not expect they will take your wishes into account, because some people also want to live on the 10th floor. Isn't that horrible?

<Content>Lovely Hotel This hotel is great for sightseeing - it's not just for business travellers! It's right near Potsdamer Platz train station so you can take full advantage of Berlin's public transport. The staff at reception were so helpful during our stay (especially when they found out a well known airline left our suitcases in Heathrow!). Just literally round the corner there is a shopping arcade with shops, restaurants and cafes!Lovely! Recommend it!

<Content>5 star service, excellent hotel Two friends and I are just back from a wonderful stay in the Mandala Hotel. If you want to get away to relax this it place to go, so much so that my friends and I started referring to it as our oasis of calm. Although this Hotel does not have a big lobby it is very tastefully decorated and the suite we had was more like an apartment with bedroom, two bathrooms, a kitchenette, study/seating area and Balcony. Everything was spotlessly clean and our rooms were made up to perfection everyday. Its also in a great location, the Sony Centre is across the road and its right next to the Potsdamer Platz S Bahn and U Bahn Stations. There is also a shopping centre at the back of the Hotel.I've read some of the previous reviews about the staff being unfriendly, i cant believe it, they were more than lovely to us. They organised a birthday cake for my friend's birthday, gave us a free bottle of champaign, advised us about where best to go out in Berlin, gave us umbrellas for the rain, gave us dvd's to watch in our room. They greeted us and waved us goodbye everytime we went in and out of the Hotel. The service was second to none. By the third day they new all our names and on our last night we got complementary glasses of champaign at the bar.We ate in the restaurant twice, once for breakfast, which was amazing and once at the Michelin star restaurant Facil which was out of this world. I've eaten in a lot of restaurants and never experienced service or food like it.I cannot recommend this Hotel highly enough, we were very sad to leave and will definitely be returning to our Oasis of Calm!

<Content>A disaster waiting to happen... After check-in we were shown to our room which turned out to be a garden studio when we had booked ( paid for in advance) a management suite. Nobody told us at any point that we were not being allocated our correct room  it was only when we were shown to our room  queried the type of room given that we were told that the hotel was being refurbished  that this was the only room available. After much discussion and disappointment we were finally assured that we would be upgraded the following night  given a complimentary bottle of champagne. There were no other rooms available on our day of arrival. Totally dissatisfied with the deception  lack of customer focus on arrival we felt we had no option but to accept this offer. First morning in our new suite we were woken at 7.00 a.m. to the sound of drills and constant hammering. Following our call to reception we were told that the hotel was undergoing 'emergency essential maintenance'  there was nothing they could do. Basically, we had to put up with the noise and disturbance. However, the same occurred on day 2 and day 3 - at precisely the same time! In the meantime, on day 2 we discovered a bag of dirty working clothes behind the curtains in our room - obviously overlooked by housekeeping  not a very good indication of their levels of cleanliness! The bathroom only had one bathrobe, one pair of slippers, insufficient shampoo  shower gel  was generally shabby. Overall, we were extrememly disappointed with our stay in The Mandala. We paid for and expected 5-star service  accommodation but actually experienced far less. The staff were cold  uncaring and really did little to ease the problems we encountered.Stay there at your peril!! For us - never again.......

<Content>Amazing, beautiful, handsome hotel Mr. O took me to Berlin for a surprise weekend. We booked into The Mandala Hotel on the Potsdamer Strasse. There is also another Mandala Hotel but I reckon the location of the one we choose was best suited to the purpose of our break which was to sample the atmosphere of the German Xmas markets and do some shopping. As soon as our taxi pulled up in front of the Hotel the Concierge greeted us and took our bag for us to Reception. Then once we had checked in, he again took receipt of our bag and escorted us to our room; one of the Management Suites on the sixth floor. This included a kitchen, a walk in wardrobe, a living room with Study area, a patio terrace with views overlooking the Christmas Market below and two further built in wardrobes. I could move in there tomorrow!! The concept of the hotel is to create a home away from home and it certainly achieves that goal and then some. The bed was very comfortable and the great thing is in the morning there is not a sound to be heard from House Keeping going about their chores; no knocking your door or vacuuming the room next door, etc. Also a television placed mid centre of the room swivelled to allow one to watch television either from the couch or from the bed; not that we had much chance to watch television as there was so much else to do. Accompanying this was a powerful Grundig stereo system with a handful of music CD's to get one in the right mood.The restaurant on the fifth floor was full on the first morning so we had breakfast in the bar on the first floor which offered a wide selection of different beverages; fruit juices, lattes, cappuccinos, green tea etc. There was a wide selection of breads, cheeses, cold meats, different types of spreads and also one could order hot food from the kitchen; eggs, waffles (not to mention the small little fruit tarts and mini chocolate cakes!!). We managed to have a table in the restaurant the following day and the surrounding was absolutely fabulous; the sun came in through the glass roof top and also there were some very ornate interesting water displays. They had thought of everything including small stools for ladies to put their handbags on; which all restaurants should have as who wants to put their Bottega Veneta on the floor!!As guests of the hotel, we had access to the Wellness Spa and Fitness Lounge; located on the top floor of the hotel. In the Sauna Room there was a big window offering great panoramic views across Berlin. Also the walls were adorned with very sexy prints of men throughout which would make one sweat even if the work-out didn't; it couldn't have been more exciting!! Also there were Laundry Rooms on all the floors which housed a washing machine and dryer and an iron and ironing board, so one could do one's last minute ironing if needs be before one headed out into Berlin. There was even a television in the Laundry Room which one could watch while the Laundry was being done.The hotel's location is great; it's very close to a lot of the main cultural  political places of interest; the Holocaust Memorial, the Brandenburg Gate, the Reichstag, Checkpoint Charlie, the Tiergarten, the Sony Centre, etc. And not forgetting of course the Potsdamer Strasse itself. Also everything was within easy reach either by foot or by metro; the U-Bahn. Furthermore the market just outside the hotel was one of the best Markets we saw on our trip and to have it literally at one's doorstep was such a treat. There were ski slides and various other forms of entertainment at the market and Mr. O and I had great fun going down the ski slope on big inflatable rubber tyres.This is one of the best hotels that I have ever stayed in and we will definitely book into the Mandala Hotel again if we are back in Berlin which seems a certainty after this wonderful trip.G Lee

<Content>Cool  Very chic hotel with large just out the box rooms (our exec suite was excellent for a family of 3 with huge seperate sitting area)  superb location in the new potsdamer platz. Resturant is also very smart - hidden on the 5th floor in a courtyard. If you like your hotels to have a big fancy lobby  bar , then this is not for you. The check in is a tiny lobby  then you go up 5 floors to the room.However for style  value for money this is hard to beat.

<Content>Absolutely Fabulous Hotel!! I can not say enough about what a wonderful stay we had at the Mandala Hotel. First off, the hotel is very stylish and hip with a gorgeous lobby and lounge. The staff was friendly and attentive but no overly so. We were delighted that upon check in that we were upgraded to a HUGE suite. I have never seen a hotel room that was so large. It had a kitchenette, living room with dining area, bedroom with office and a huge marble bath. It also had a giant walk-in closet to store our things, which was just great. And when we thought there couldn't be more, we open the curtains to reveal a 30 ft balcony! With the relatively low rate we were paying we thought there must be some mistake and that someone was going to show up and tell us we were in the wrong room! We also appreciated that the room was immaculately clean, the pillows and bed were heavenly, and the decor of the room was very modern and fashionable. Also fashion and architecture magazines were provided for us which was a nice touch.The location was okay. Potsdamer Platz is a newly developed area with lots of great architecture however as another person mentioned, it is not near any of the cool nightlife or shopping. However taxis were always available outside the hotel and a giant U-Bahn station was right there. Also there is a big mall in the Potsdamer Plaz complex which was handy when we needed to find a drugstore, grocery store or quick bite to eat..Overall this hotel was an amazing value for the money and would not stay anywhere else in Berlin.

<Content>Loved it! The hotel is in a up and coming area of Berlin, where people are on the go 24/7 - its great for nightlife. The staff were friendly and provided an excellent service. The room was clean, a good size, and there were all amenities needed and more - including a kitchen area. I was surprised by the quality of this hotel for it price, and would reccomend it to anyone!
