<Content>quality and value stay modern hotel with good amenities. Whilst some way from Amsterdam, ideal for families with a car. A good rate of sub 100 Euro and family rooms make this is a good option for visiting amsterdam

<Content>Nice hotel We spent 55 euro for 2 people for 1 night (on internet). The room was very spacious and cleanly. The position is near the city of Edam and Volendam. The breakfast wasn't included.

<Content>Generally comfortable stay at the Golfhotel We were visiting relatives in Purmerend for a week, and their house was being renovated, so we decided to check in to the Golfhotel nearby (despite not playing golf!) We chose the hotel because of its location. It was also offering a decent rate for a week's stay.The hotel is best reached by car, though there is a direct bus from Amsterdam Centraal to Purmerend that stops about a 10 minute walk from the hotel. We took this bus to Amsterdam a few times.The hotel itself has a lobby (with restaurants and bars) and a long, curved two-floor wing containing all the bedrooms. Our room was right at the lobby end of the wing, meaning it was an easy walk. It would be a healthy walk for anyone stuck in the middle of the wing!Things we liked about the hotel:+ location, very convenient for what we were doing+ room was large, bed was comfortable. There was a writing desk, lots of storage, and a second door to block out noise from the hallway.+ room had a fridge.+ free wireless access+ good breakfast in the morning+ attractive locationThings we didn't like about the hotel:- the room got very hot at night. We didn't want to leave the patio doors open, because we were on the ground floor and anyone could have walked in. - they played music all night in the lobby. While we couldn't hear it in our room with the inner door shut, if you left the inner door it was quite obvious.- some of the staff working in the breakfast room were quite rude and unpleasant. One person told us repeatedly that we could not eat outside (despite it being boiling in the room). However, lots of other people kept going outside to eat. We eventually went outside anyway, where it was much cooler, and were harangued by the staff member. I eventually asked her for her name and said I would inform her manager of her behaviour. This seemed to shut her up.- you are staying at a golf hotel. Some guests are not as interested in a quiet night's sleep as others might be.Overall, our stay was fine. We'd go back, particularly because of the location.

<Content>great value for the area I'm not a golfer, but decided on this hotel because of its apparent value  I wasn't disappointed. Service is efficient and friendly, and rooms are luxuriantly big and well equipped at the price-level. Only slight complaint was the seemingly never-ending corridor to the room from reception, but at least it's exercise. On the whole, a great value place from which to see Amsterdam and the area, but since it is quite isolated, having a car available is a must.

<Content>Can't fault it Went with a few friends to amsterdam booked this hotel as got a very good deal for 4 in one room. Staff are very friendly and helpful, rooms were clean.

<Content>Quiet and close to Amsterdam and many other nice places The hotel is located in a quiet place. Rooms are large with a terrace and a fridge.The bus stop is not far, and you can rich Amsterdam central station very easily.If the teapot is mentionned in the room description, don't miss to ask for it at the welcome desk !Breakfast is very correct, even access is sometimes difficult during peak hours !

<Content>very very long walk to most rooms, mosquitos in summer Location: long way from city center, in a quite countryside location.Room: spacious with a writing desk and a comfortable sofa, reasonably clean, comfortable enough. Hotel facilities: restaurant/bar/gift shop. While the reception/lobby area is reasonably large, the receptionist area is exceptionally small -- the size of an average desk, and there is only one person working there most of the time. Problems: 1.) very, very long walk to the rooms if you are not staying in rooms #1 - #10, (on both floors) the rooms are all on one side of the hallway, lined up one next to the other, i.e., #1, #2, ..... up to the high 40's. There is no porter available when I was there (twice), and only one porter's trolley for the whole hotel. Good luck if you have more than one piece of hand luggage. 2.) some rooms have lots of mosquitos in the summerI stayed at this hotel twice for business. I would not recommend this hotel for a city-based vacation stay, it takes too long to get to/from the city center if you don't have a car. It's fine if you plan to play golf there and have time to enjoy the nice countryside scenery during the daytime.

<Content>Lovely location Booked this hotel at a very good price. When asked for any special requests we asked if we could have a double bed as opposed to two single. The Hotel was lovely and in a really nice position, however on finding we had single beds my partner spoke to the receptionist and showed her the confirmation. Unfortunately at this point she became extremely unfriendly and unhelpful and said that they did not correspond with the website we had booked with other than to take a booking for the number of people requested. We appreciate that a lot of hotels in europe accommodate with single beds but felt her reaction was quite unacceptable and could have been dealt with in a better manner.Having said all that we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and the hotel was on a bus route so we didnt have to take our car into Amsterdam. The rooms were nice and bright and the food was very good.

<Content>Peaceful retreat in lovely surroundings Just back from 5 nights at the Hampshire Golfhotel (now called the BurgGolf Purmerend) and would definitely recommend it to those looking for a tranquil hotel in peaceful surroundings. We intended to stay in Amsterdam and use that as a base to explore the surrounding area but were glad we chose this hotel instead as it's so peaceful. Only 25-30 minutes on the bus to Central Station, and about 10-15 minutes on bus 113 from the quaint old town of Edam, which provides bus links to many other town such as Volendam (for windmills, clog makers and cheese farms).To reach the hotel from Central Station keep walking along to the left, across several tram lines and cycle paths, till you come to the Arriva bus stops. The bus to Purmerend is no. 107 and there are 4 per hour during weekdays, fewer at weekends. They're always on time, very clean and comfortable, and the majority of drivers speak very good English. It costs 6 euros per person for a one-day bus pass (available from the tourist information office opposite Central Station and also on the buses themselves) which can be used all day in the Waterland area and to reach Central Station, but not to travel around Amsterdam itself. Don't bother buying one-way tickets as they're much more expensive. For families the 10 euro weekend ticket is a very good deal. The hotel itself lacks some of the amenities that are often associated with 4 star hotels (no pool, gym or sauna, no air conditioning) and is very much geared up for golfers, with the reception being accessed through the golf shop. There's a restaurant, breakfast room, downstairs bar (wasn't open while we were there) and internet access in the lobby.There are ice machines on both floors and an unstocked mini bar in the room which can be stocked on request. We just used it as a fridge! The rooms are really spacious and comfortable (three beds in ours with ample room for another) with the ground floor rooms having patio doors leading out to a small paved area with two wicker chairs overlooking the putting green. Lovely to sit out in the evening and watch the hares jumping around, but not so good at night as I didn't feel comfortable leaving the patio doors open as I was on my own with two children. It got unbearably hot indoors as the temperature reached 30 degrees even at night.The rooms are very well designed, as there's a door separating the bedroom from the bathroom/dressing area where the kettle  hairdryer are located, which means that the kids aren't disturbed while you have your shower/make a cup of coffee/dry your hair! Bathroom is pretty basic with sink, loo and bath with (very efficient) shower attachment. Loads of towels with extra ones in the cupboard in case you run out. There's also a safety deposit box in each room - we didn't use it but I suspect there's an extra charge.The breakfast buffet had various cereals, a selection of teas, coffee, juice, cheeses, sliced salami  ham, salad (unfortunately buzzing with flies which was off-putting), tomato, cucumber, boiled eggs, scrambled eggs, bacon, little herb sausages, croissants, rolls, various breads, yoghurts, fresh fruit salad.All in all, a nice hotel with friendly and helpful staff, not particularly fancy but a good base to explore the lovely towns and villages in the Waterland region. Easy access to Amsterdam AND a peaceful night! Can't ask for more than that.

<Content>Relaxing, country atmosphere After busy, bustling Amsterdam, a break in the country was very relaxing. It's a 20+ minute walk to Purmerends, but buses are available every 15 minutes. Helpful to have a car here if you plan on an excursion. Golf courses look lovely. Ducks, heron, waterfowl and the biggest hare I've ever seen reside on the property. Dog-walking path near, and sheep/cows/horses/goats nearby. Great bar and dining rooms, a terrific buffet breakfast with friendly, helpful service. Nice pro shop, knowlegable staff. Only 20 minutes by bus to Amsterdam, 30 minutes to de Zaanse Schans (village with windmills), and Edam for cheese!

<Content>Great Place to Relax! After two days in Amsterdam, this hotel was a brilliant place to relax after plenty of sightseeing - only half an hour from the city, but lovely to visit surrounding areas, eg. Edam, Volendam, etc. They no longer have a pool here, but as my husband and two sons play golf this was a lovely place to end our short half term trip. Although not particularly attractive from the exterior, the hotel was excellent - with very large and comfortablerooms that are spotlessly clean. We also managed to get a great deal so ended up paying much less than we did for our very small rooms in Amsterdam itself. It is brilliant for golfers, although there is not much to do if you do not play, unless you want to drive off somewhere, or just chill in the room or the public areas. One thing that particularly stood out was the food, which was absolutely fantastic. The buffet breakfast offered a wide variety of hot and cold food, but the bar food for lunch/evening meal was something else - gorgeous food and beautifully presented and served - a real treat, and a much higher standard than I would have expected.Highly recommended!A great

<Content>great place to rest up after 15 nights in busy amsterdam this hotel was just what the doctor ordered, excellent food and service!!!!!we did'nt need to leave the hotel at all! the town of purmerend is a quiet and relaxed they have a first rate coffeeshop splief 2, and a taxi to schipol is 68.50 euro. they have a wonderful pool and sauna and the longest hallway you have ever seen in your life! almost a quarter mile from room 250 to front desk ( with an interesting mix of big band and disco music playing on the speakers) the hotel is surrounded by a moat and farms, and a golf course (a big one) that gets used even in snow and rain! very friendly staff spoke the kings engilish, as well as german, flemmish, french, and spanish!!!!
