<Content>Unfriendly and incompetent personnel; broken heating The good ratings of this hotel on tripadvisor.com were one of the reasons for me to choose this hotel for a getaway of 5 days at the end of December 2008 with my girl-friend.This may well be my worst hotel experience so far, and this is also the reason for me to write this review.During the first night, we noticed that the heating was broken, i.e. that the air-conditioning was producing only cold, but no warm air. For that night , we pulled on some pullovers to be able to get at least some sleep. In the morning I informed the rather unfriendly guy at the reception (refusing by the way to speak English or any language other than Spanish) who told me that they would take care of the matter. During the second night, the heating did still not work, and it was cold again. I then went down to the reception, asking for another room, or someone fixing the problem - the receptionist for the night-shift informed me that no other room was available but that he could give me two or three additional blankets for the night - and that someone would take care of the problem the other day.Again, this did not happen. So I went a third time to the reception, asking for someone to check - the again very unfriendly guy at the reception gave me the same answer Si, si... I insisted that someone would check the heating right now, in my presence, to which the guy replied that it had been checked and that it worked perfectly - after 10 minutes of discussion he called someone to check with me in my room. The heating was (indeed) broken. They promised to fix it, and in the afternoon, the heating worked - unfortunately it did not work anymore during the night, which gave us a third night in the cold.The other day, I asked for another room, threatening to leave the hotel. So finally, we could sleep at least two of the 5 nights in a warm room.Besides the fact that we were not the only people complaining about the heating and that the hotel seems to have a serious problem with it, what angered me more is the way this was handled by the hotel. The personnel at the reception, and especially one Spanish guy for the morning shift was not only unfriendly, but at times even impertinent. The rooms were OK, and clean.Breakfast did not give a huge amount of choice, but was OK. Less OK was the fact that on the last day we had to wait 15 minutes before having a clean plate (no it's self-service, but no clean plates in the breakfast room). The hotel has 2 PC's with Internet access on the first floor - when we were there, one of the two PC's was broken (so was also one of the chairs lacking one wheel...)Overall conclusion: I hope and firmly believe that there are better hotels in Barcelona. Please avoid this hotel for your own sake.

<Content>Pretty nice place, but noisy room Spent 4 nights at Ciutat in Barcelona in November, mostly on the basis of TripAdvisor Reviews. Overall I'd say it was a very good choice with 2 caveats, 1 major and 1 minor.The hotel has an outstanding location - literally a few feet from the PIcasso Museum in the Old City, a 5 minute walk from the Cathedral and a ten minute walk from Plaza Catalunya. There are tons of restaurants, bars, etc within a short walk.The lobby is small but pleasant, and secured after-hours. It is fairly modern and sleek. The hotel has 2 elevators, 2 computers with free internet access, and free bottled water for guests. There is a breakfast room but we didn't eat breakfast at the hotel. The staff speaks very good English and are helpful and professional. They requested a taxi for me on departure and gave me some good restaurant suggestions as well.The room was ready upon our arrival at 9 am, which was very nice. We had requested a crib in advance and they had the crib in the room, also very nice.Our room was a corner room on the main street (C/ de Princessa) with 2 large beautiful windows and a small, pleasant balcony overlooking the street. The room was floored in Pergo and did feel a bit like it was Ikea-furnished. The double bed is two single beds pushed together, but that was not a problem. The TV gets about 20 channels, about 2 in English. There is a safe in the room, no refrigerator. The room was a decent size for Europe, average to small by American standards.The bathroom was fine, the standard weird Spanish half-shower door thing which I've never understood, good water pressure and good lighting. The counter around the sink is too small and doesn't hold enough toiletries for 2-3 people.As for the caveats:Caveat #1 (minor): the beds are extremely firm. I mean almost rock hard, and I like firm beds. As I am a side-sleeper, this was a little tough to get used to and over 4 nights I had a sore neck several times.Caveat #2 (major): Our room was quite noisy. It faces onto C/ de Princessa, which is a single-lane, one-way street but a significant artery for the east side of the Old City. It's not that the street was actually so noisy; however, because the buildings are so close together, the street seemed to act as a reverbatory cavity, amplifying the sounds of voices, cars, scooters, recycling being dumped in the bins, and trash trucks/street cleaners coming through, especially at night. If you are a heavy sleeper or have a very good set of earplugs, this is not a problem. However, for our infant, it was a major problem, and therefore, it became a major problem for us! She woke up every night at 2 am (as people started coming home from bars and restaurants) and couldn't get back to sleep. We didn't ask for a quieter room, thinking we'd get used to it over the few days, but we never did. I'm not sure if there are rooms NOT on the main street but I would be sure to request one if you are at all a light sleeper. Overall we enjoyed this hotel and in particular the location simply cannot be beat. However, make sure you bring earplugs or look into the possibility of a substantially quieter room. We would come back if we could be sure of a quieter night.

<Content>Above Average hotel What makes this hotel different from the rest is the customer service, value for money and location. We looked at other hotels during our stay and were pleased with this choice.Barcelona is a very busy city and if you like the busy city (outrageous prices) experience then this place is for you.Taxis TransferWe took a taxi from the airport and he drove like Nigel Mansell My mum was actually sick when we arrived at the hotel . Our return taxi was no better and both charged excessive rates.

<Content>Great location overcomes poor amenities The hotel Ciutat de Barcelona is centrally located near the beach, Las Ramblas, and plenty of great dining. The amenities are nice and you can tell the hotel was recently refurbished to a high standard. Unfortunately all the work is superficial and this hotel has some problems.The double bed was really 2 singles pushed together, each one with its own linens. This made it hard to set a romantic mood, as well as presented a danger when the 2 beds started drifting apart in the middle of the night. The mattresses themselves were horribly uncomfortable; we might as well have been sleeping on clay. And the walls were paper thin -- we could hear our neighbors coughing! Despite these deficiencies I am giving this hotel 3 / 5 due to its newly renovated decor and great location. Within 10-15 minutes you can be at the sagrada familia, the beach, or las ramblas. Plus the staff was mostly friendly (though they couldn't bring us extra pillows both nights we asked). And it's a 25 minute metro ride, a direct shot from Barcelona airport. I should also add that the hotel offers free internet w/ printing, a very nice touch.If you dont mind loud and uncomfortable sleeping conditions with a rock hard mattress, check this place out. It might make a nice alternative to some of the bigger, more expensive, name brand chains.

<Content>4 nights stay 27/09/08 Stayed in this hotel for four nights. Had really good time over there. Get taxi from airport to the hotel paid éˆ§?7.00 euro for two people. The staff in the hotel was very nice and helpful. The room wasn't too big but was modern and was with balcony overlooking the city. Thought it's gonna to be noisy during night but it wasn't and it was great.The hotel located just 10 min walking distance to La Ramblas and 20 min to the beach, 7 min to the Zoo. Hotel has free internet facilities so we could check our emails and print the tickets they day we went home. The terrace on the roof is great and very romantic. There was nobody there around 1am so we went there drinking champagne and enjoying the great weather and company of each other. The water in the pool was cold so didn't really enjoy it. Even day time it's not warm. It's great they provide bottles of water free of charge just the fridge was at the back of the corridor so we didn't see the first night. Probably it's our mistake. Make sure you iron all your clothes as one night we went for dinner and I wanted to iron my dress so I ring to reception around 8.30pm but I was told that they do not provide iron to the room. I offer to pay for it but receptionist refuse to give it to me saying that i have to give my dress and housekeepers will iron it to me. I didn't mind... just it took them 24 hours to do it :) so I never wear the dress that night. And they charge about 10 euro. After all I was happy with the hotel and would recommend it to someone who wants to be minutes to La Ramblas and who like modern style. I booked the hotel through centrlr.com and it cost me éˆ§?60.00 per night for two people with room only rate.

<Content>Comfortable! This Hotel is clean  comfortable. The rooms are certainly not big but we are talking about the centre of Barcelona. For the price éˆ§?20 per night, I would definitely recommend this hotel. The free bottles of water were fully appreciated. The Staff let us leave our luggage in the hotel for some time after checkout as we wanted to spend some more time in Barcelona. The rooms are air-conditioned although I switched it off due to the noise. The only real negative was the Breakfast. A group of Germans had arrived and as they do, really took over, the staff were simply unable to cope. We had to comeback a further two times before there was any space and food, even then we had to ask several times for cereals and juice. Overall, I would definitely check out the rates  availability of this hotel on my next visit to Barcelona.

<Content>Pretty Good Hotel Small hotel in a nice part of Barcelona. Rooms are basic, seemed to entirely furnished by IKEA judging by my room but OK for what you pay. Clean rooms, helpful staff. Free bottles of water in the corridor is a nice touch. Will stay there again soon.

<Content>Pre-Cruise Stay We stayed at the Ciutat Hotel for one night preceding our Mediterranean Cruise leaving out of Barcelona. The hotel provided a perfect location to explore the city on foot. In addition, it provided a locked luggage room, so we were able to store luggage before and after check in/check out times. The staff was very friendly and helpful with directions, transportation, and restaurant recommendations.

<Content>Perfect Location, perfect hotel Stayed at the Ciutat de Barcelona for a birthday break, so I was very pleased that this hotel was everything i had expected. Room was very clean, with a balcony which was a nice relief being in a city.Last hotel we stayed at was lovely but very claustraphobic due to lack of view and balcony, which a lot of places are like in barcelona. Had been to Barcelona once before and really wanted to stay in the Gothic quarter this time due to the accessability to the rest of the city from there, and also the great atmosphere. Hotel is 10min walk through gothic qtr. to the Rambla, and 5min walk to the Ciutadella Parc which is gorgeous. Very good to have free bottles of water on hand, especially good after a night out when the shops are shut. Jaume 1 metro about 100m away, so had easy access to entire city. Recommend this hotel for access to Gothic Quarter, beaches, Picasso museum, Cathedral and Port. However with a metro stop so close, it is easy to get anywhere in the city from here. Pool on roof nice touch, although small. Didn't get a chance to use it though as there are only 5 or 6 beds and we are not early risers! Didn't have breakfast at hotel, but the rooftop breakfast terrace looked lovely. All in all, a nice modern clean hotel in the heart of barcelona.

<Content>Faultless. We spent six nights at this hotel in mid August and couldn't find fault with it at all. The hotel is wonderfully located in a lovely area and very close to the metro (which is brilliant and cheap). The air con was very good, the shower superb, the room clean, airy and extremely well insulated for sound and light. We had breakfast up on the roof every day and it was a lovely way to start the day. We also made use of the little pool and rooftop sun terrace every day, a real bonus in a city centre hotel. The staff were helpful and pleasant. Excellent all round, we wouldn't think of going anywhere else next time we go to Barcelona.Worth mentioning that we had a wonderful Indian meal at the Kama restaurant in the Born area, and a wonderful Italian meal at Caputxes, also in Born ( we got a bit of tapas fatigue!)All of Barcelona was great but we particularly loved Casa Mila, the cable car up Montjuic, the magic fountain and just sitting at the edge of the walkway at Port Vell and watching the huge fish in that twinkling blue sea. Bliss!

<Content>Great Place My Wife and I stayed here as a belated wedding anniversary break.When we got to the hotel the welcome was friendly and the reception staff all spoke English.When we got to our room we were really pleased by it, whilst not big it was sufficient and VERY clean.The toilet/shower room was also spotless and very well appointed.Breakfast was a buffet with Hot and Cold items available, plenty of juice, but tea and coffee was only available from a (free) vending machine and proved to be somewhat poor in quality. However there was a good selection of food available and every thing that we had was very good.The hotel provided complementary bottles of chilled water to guests so that you could take a couple of small bottles or maybe a larger bottle in a backpack, or both I suppose in really hot weather.The hotel is located in a very quiet lane only a few minutes from the top of the Ramblas, the lane was dimly lit at nights but we did not find it too intimidating.I would find it hard to find fault with this hotel although I must concede that it had only been opened for around one year when we visited so everything looked very fresh.

<Content>Great Hotel We have just returned from a lovely weekend at the Hotel Ciutat, staff were very helpful, rooms and hotel spotless, excellent location in the heart of El Born. Very close to the Picasso museum, chocolate museum and the Cathedral. I also lost a very precious ring and when I returned to collect my bags en route to the airport, housekeeping had found it and returned which I was really pleased about. Didn't have breakfast at the hotel but went to a little cafe close by at the industrial museum which was excellent also. Will defo be returning to this hotel on my next visit to Barcelona.

<Content>Great location but 'apartment' disappointing My husband and I we were keen to stay in the Bari Gothic district and booked an apartment which we mistakenly thought was part of the actual hotel. However, when checking in we learnt that the apartment was in a separate building in one of the back streets about 300 metres away from the main hotel.This would not have worried us greatly except that our apartment block had no lift (this was not mentioned in the description on the website) and the staircase was very impractical - very steep and extremely narrow - not what you would expect in a 3 star hotel.In addition, our 'two-bedroom' apartment was no more than a small one-bedroom with another room that served as a bedroom, kitchen and dining room all squashed into one! Luckily, there were only the 2 of us so this was not a major issue but given that we had paid for a 'two-bedroom apartment'we expected a lot more for our money. We hate to imagine how more people would have stayed without living on top of each other!On the plus side, the location was fabulous giving us an opportunity to expereince life in the old quarter of Barcelona.Luckily we only had to rely on the hotel breakast for one morning as it was unimpressive with little variety and lack of service.Overall, an average hotel experience.

<Content>great location, great room My husband and I are in our late 20's and recently travelled around Spain. We thought this was an excellent hotel. The rooms were very clean and we thought they were quite spacious compared to other hotel rooms in other cities we had recently visited. It was hard to find inexpensive rooms in Barcelona, but we thought this was a fair price for the room. Our room was bright and open and had a nice balcony overlooking the street. There were computers with free internet, which was really nice. The pool and sundeck were also great additions. In the halls, they had refrigerators full of bottled water for guests, which I had never seen in Europe. The neighborhood in which this hotel is located, is excellent and we spent most evenings walking around and eating at nearby tapas bars. If you are looking for something quaint and charming, you might not be impressed with this hotel, but if you need a nice clean room in a great area, this is a great choice. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Perfect Location great position in the gothic quarter. 2 mins from the picasso museum. Bars and restaurants within strolling distance. 5 mins from the train station. Clean hotel and very friendly staff. Restaurant was closed on evening in hotel as they were refurbishing.,however they were still doing breakfast which was good. Top tip if you are a brit take your travel kettle! as tea was horrid. But thats a minor gripe. Definately worth staying at

<Content>Great Location! We stayed in this hotel for 5nights for the first week in June. The location is very good, in the gothic quarter of Barcelona. Lovely restuarants near by, train station/zoo/La Ramblas all within a 5minute walking distance.The rooms were nice, very clean, small pool on the roof was nice, no bar which was a pity, breakfast was very good, hotel staff could have been more friendly - its extremely well located at a reasonable price - we just loved Barcelona!!

<Content>Great location but IKEA like rooms My husband and I stayed at this hotel for two nights last week. Overall it wasn't a bad expereience at all but I'd look for somewhere else next time round.On the plus side, the location is the best, so close to Barri Gotico, Rambla and metro, yet on a relatively quiet street. Also very clean and free water and Internet access.On the negative, the rooms are small even for European standards and very IKEA like, as in very cheap modern-style furniture and plastic accessories. The bath was a let-down, being only a half size one. The noise insulation is not great and the cleaners doing up the rooms at 4 pm wasn't great either!The hotel was quiet expensive for the standard it offered. I've since seen a couple of 3 star hotels in similar great location at 40 EUROS less per night.

<Content>wish I was still at the ciutata de barcelona! We stayed for 3 nights on a short break to Brcelona. The hotel was in a great location. An easy walk to the bustling La Rambla and main shopping area, lined with bars, restaurants, coffee shops and boutiques. It was the easiest journey from airport to hotel I have ever made. Barely 5 mins from Estacio de Franca train station which is the end of the line so you can't go wrong. Plus for some reason, tourist tickets were free, so our journey to and from the airport cost us absolutely nothing. The hotel decor was lovely and modern. Very clean with a good bathroom. Staff were helpful and the breakfast was varied with several options. I am only sorry I am not still there but I have already reccommended it to friends and family.

<Content>Good 3 Star Hotel with nice extras I stayed here with my husband for 3 nights at the end of January on our first ever trip to Barcelona. We realised later what a fantastic location we had picked - that is the major plus point for this hotel. It's surrounded by lots of lovely bars, restaurants and shops and only 5 mins walk from Estacio de Franca which has direct trains to/from the airport. The hotel itself was an excellent 3-star hotel - rooms are good with all the facilities and the bed was a really good king size. We were originally offered a room at the front of the hotel overlooking the street but it only had a (big) shower and as I wanted a bath they moved us to another room which faced onto a courtyard. This actually worked out best for us as it was completely quiet and I would imagine the rooms at the front would have noise quite late into the night. The terrace and pool area are beautiful and I imagine they are great in the summer - although the weather was lovely in January it wasn't quite swimming weather! We had dinner in the restaurant one night and the food was good and reasonably priced - my husband's main meal was a bit on the nouvelle cuisine side but tasted nice. We didn't try breakfast at the hotel - we found loads of nice cafes nearby for coffee and a sandwich. The only downside to the hotel is that you can't get a drink or anything from the restaurant outside of restaurant opening hours - we asked reception if we could have a glass of wine to take up to our room at about 7pm but they said we couldn't get one until the restaurant opened at 8pm. They seem to have strict rules as the night we ate at the restaurant we ordered a cocktail at 11.15pm but were told we couldn't have cocktails until 11.30pm - by which time we couldn't get the attention of a waiter to order one! Anyway, apart from those little niggles, it is a superb hotel for the price - and the location is fantastic. Barcelona itself was fabulous - easily my favourite city destination beating New York and Paris - highlights were definitely Parc Guell and Sagrada Famillia. Downside was we had our camera stolen on the first day but our fault for not being more vigilant.

<Content>Great hotel for the whole family We found this hotel by chance and how lucky we were! Just down the street from the Picasso Museum in the up and coming Born district, the location is perfectly located for walking and buses, easy to get to if your are coming in from Girona or walking in the Gothic quarter or close to the port. The hotel is modern, clean and essential with everything needed: hairdryer, flat screen TV with satellite in three languages, internet in-room and two computer stations and printer on the first floor. The staff is service oriented and friendly. Breakfast at the restaurant Colors next door was add-on but included croissants, bacon and eggs, cheese, cereals, fresh fruit and juices,etc. We stayed five nights (family of four) and ate there every day. We dined one night at Colors: excellent and well priced food and great local wine list. In sum this is home away from home...a great hotel and we travel a lot!!! Problems: small towels and the bed was a bit hard for our taste. Stay at this hotel you won't regret it.

<Content>very good hotel, perfect location I spent three nights at the hotel with my wife. We were given a double room facing on the pedestrian road Carrer Princessa which is lively but not noisy as other streets in this wonderful city. The quarter El Born-Ribera is one of the most authentic, far from the mass touristic Ramblas, full of bar, taparias, restaurants and typical shops (there area couple of pastry-makers close to the hotel). The room was clean and large, with a large bathroom. The reception was friendly and helpful. We were surprised by the breakfast in the lounge bar: rich and good, even if they charge you it is worth of the money you spend. The nearby Estacion de Francia leads you to the main railway station of Barcelona Sants and to the airport. I strongly recommend this hotel for a short or long break. You are ten minutes' pleasant walk far from the Ramblas and near to all major attractions. If not, take the underground at Jaume I, just one minute walk

<Content>Fab Hotel We stayed at the hotel in November 2006, sorry i am late adding my review.We found the hotel to be of a high quality very good choice for breakfast we also had lunch and dinner at the hotel and found the foodto be very good and not over priced.The only one negative comment i have is, i went in the lift one morning and to my horror it ground to a halt between floors, as i was in the lift on my own i pressed the emergency button thinking it wouldput me through to reception but it contacts the lift service centre and the first person who i spoke to could not speak english they then put a man on who could speak english and he to my surprise asked me where i was, i thought they would have known, i then started shouting and banging on the side to get help, the manager was able to open the door a few inches and he reassured me help was on the way he stayed out side and passed me some bottled water and kept talking to me throughout the wait he sent a message to my husband in our room to inform him what had happened, once the enginer arrived they manged to open the door wide enough to put a step ladder up to the lift and helped me through.The experiance left me a little nervous when using the lift again.The manager gave us free breakfast. Apart from this incident we had a lovely holiday and would return to the hotel.

<Content>Classy city hotel Clean, bright, modern hotel in a traditional building in a narrow street. The hotel is within easy walking distance of the city centre (old and new) and the port area. Our room faced the front street and had a tiny balcony. Room decor was bright and modern, and the modern bathroom was huge! Excellent choice at breakfast, and the restaurant 'Colors' offers good value. Others have spoken about the bottled water and internet access provided - both plus points for the hotel.

<Content>Fabulous place to stay My boyfriend and I just returned from spending 4 nights at the Ciutat and had an excellent experience there. We stayed in a large corner room facing the street. It was a little noisy at night, but not too bad. The room was sparsely furnished, yet very comfortable and the bathroom was large (especially for a bathroom in Europe!).The location of this hotel is excellent. It's very close to the Picasso museum (a must see) and it's one block from a metro stop, which is very convenient to take you to many of the sites. Las Ramblas is a 5-10 min walk from the hotel. There are several tasty restaurants within walking distance to the hotel. We were especially impressed with an Italian place called Murivecchi, just a block east of the hotel. Had excellent, authentic thin crust pizza there. If you love Italian food like we do, this place will rock your world.We were very pleased with the free bottled water in the refrigerators on every floor. And there are 2 computers with free internet access available to guests. The staff was very accomodating and helped us send faxes when business unfortunately intruded on our vacation...All in all, I would highly recommend this place. We would stay there again in the future.

<Content>Great hotel, great location The reviews that precede this are all on point. This is a very nice hotel. The rooms are spacious and neat. Bathroom is modern. Location is superb - I came in from the Franca train station and had an easy walk to the hotel. It's within walking distance of many attractions including the Picasso museum (2 blocks), Las Ramblas, Sagrada Familia, the Born district, the marina and the warrens of the Gothic Quarter.I paid E125 per night.My only complaint is there is no in room internet access and the 2 common use computers were often occupied. Oh well...

<Content>Highly recommedable My wife and I stayed here in November last year, together with our then eight-month old son, for whom the hotel arranged a baby bed thatwas in place already upon arrival. The hotel is superb, with excellent location and modern and simple, but clean and classy rooms.If I were to return to Barcelona, I would stay here again.

<Content>Very nice place to stay in Barcelona Hotel Ciutat is a nice place, well worth the price.We stayed there with my wife for three nights, the room was well-designed in a modern way, was clean and neat. Location is central, in Barri Gotic, less than 10 min. to Rambla, and to a near Bus touristic stop, to main train station. The breakfast was cool.People were firendly. It has a cosy terrace with a small pool. Very preferable.

<Content>We loved the Ciutat Very helpful and sincere staff, well and modern equipped rooms and a beautiful terrace with a small pool on the top of the hotel.Our group of 22 swiss people stayed for three nights in this perfect priced three star hotel. The location and the service is very good for the money we've spent!A big thank to Marta and the rest of the staff at the Ciutat de Barcelona for helping us for this unforgettable weekend in Barcelona.

<Content>Stay here in Barcelona! We have just spent five days here with three teenage children, and whilst I had done my research on trip advisor before I left I was still totally impressed. I even took it upon myself to speak to the manager of the Hotel and pass on my compliments cos whatever he is doing - it's working!The children had a room with three single beds on the back of the hotel and we had a double room over the charming spanish front street. Both well furnished and tastefully decorated. I can't stress enough how great it was to have the bottled water in the fridges on each floor. Also the free use of computers and internet fab for teenagers.The central location of the hotel was fantastic and although you had to wind your way back through the side streets on the ten minute walk from either the port, the beach or Las Ramblas - it was totally safe and no problems.The pool is small - but an absolute godsend after a day touring, sightseeing or on the beach. A rarity in a city centre hotel. We didn't pre book breakfast, thinking that we would prefer to eat out in the mornings. But after our first morning we stayed for breakfast every morning. It may appear that 9 euros is quite a lot but actually it was a feast! Three teenagers with healthy appetites all filled their boots.The only negative I can think of - and i've really thought long and hard about it - is the lack of coffee available after breakfast. If you can live with this - or use the fab little deli at La Jaume metro entrance - then I'd thoroughly recommend it! Feel free to ask me questions.

<Content>Would definitely go back. Booked this hotel BEFORE it was reviewed in the New York Times. Felt good about my decision to book it AFTER reading the NYT. The hotel is in the Gothic District - a great place to explore. Within walking distance to the Picasso Museum. The rooms were basic, but comfortable. Large bathroom. Kinda noisy with the windows open so we took advantage of the AC. Comes with a safe - very handy especially in Barcelona. The staff was okay. The women who worked at the front desk were extremely helpful. The male was not very helpful each time I asked him a question. We had a great stay before our cruise. We didn't try the food in the restaurant.

<Content>Great Location  I recently stayed at this hotel with four members of my family and was very impressed.Although the hotel is a small (boutique style) it had a spacious feel. I am in the hotel business and as a result can be very picky but I was very happy with the hotel both from a location and service point of view.The hotel was extremely clean, rooms were a good size (furniture and decor is simple and modern).Complimentary internet and wireless access was brilliant. All the staff were extremely helpful and friendly which is very important. This is not a plush hotel but they do not sell themselves that way; it is however a very high grade 3 star. Roof top terrace was a welcome retreat at night. Breakfast is good value and tasty leaving you ready for the sights and sounds of Barcelona.Location- 10 mins walk to La Rambla  15-20 to the Beach. Overall, ths is gem in Barcelona and I am afraid it will get to popular... Well done to the management and staff.

<Content>Great Location and Pool Excellent location - 10 mins from beach, 10 mins from las ramblasOur room was good sized and comfortable. Lacked drawers and a view but this did not detract from the overall 4* quality.The roof top terrace was the reason we chose the hotel and it did not dissapoint. Obviously it was small and therefore sometimes hard to get a lounger by the pool. There were plenty of places to sit and lie away from the pool though and was ideal after a long day sight seeing.Staff and maids were friendly and efficient. We got a good deal on the hotel and would definitely stay here again if it was affordable (we paid approx æ‹¢75/night)

<Content>Excellent! We stayed at the Ciutat for 5 days and we were not disappointed. The hotel is spotless. The rooms are very bright and modern with controllable aircon and safe in the room. Free water was provided on each floor, which was really handy. The roof top terrace was a great addition, although only small it was a great place to relax at the end of a day of sightseeing. The food was very good. We decided to have breakfast there the first day and then try other places but it was so nice we had it every day. We dined there one evening whilst the jazz musicians were on and it was delicious, the size of the liquers after dinner were huge! The location was excellent. We arrived at night and were a bit perturbed as most of the buildings surrounding the hotel had shutters down and covered in graffita. We need't have worried in the morning all the shutters came up to show a vaiety of shops form ice cream to handbags. There is also a small supermarket located on the street. It is ten minutes walk to Las Ramblas one way and ten minutes to the waterfront and beach the other way. It is surrounded by very narrow alleys which hold secrets down each. We were four women on our own and never felt in any danger around here. The only fault we could find was that there were no drawers and only one shelf for clothes which could not be hung. We would definately go back to this hotel if in Barcelona again.

<Content>Enjoyed our stay at the Ciutat We spent a week at the Ciutat, really enjoyed our stay. The hotel is quite new, very simple and well located. It is a easy ten minute walk to the Ramblas, Waterfront and Old city. Around the corner from the Picasso museum. We found the rooms to be comfortable and clean. The corner rooms are much bigger and the rooms at the back of the hotel were very quiet . The hotel offers free internet, cable TV with 2 English news channels. The breakfast was very good with plenty of fresh fruits, yoghurt, cereals, eggs, cheese, assorted smoked meats and pastries. They gave free bottled water ( fridge on each floor) .The many small alleys around the hotel are filled with restaurants and small shops. There is a little pool on the rooftop . The staff were very obliging. Barcelona is a great city and you will not spend much time in the hotel . Highly recommend this middle range hotel for those planning a short stay in Barcelona. Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Basic but clean We have just returned from the Hotel Ciutat de Barcelona. The hotel rooms are very basic and storage is extremely limited - no draws and just a few coat hangers in the wardrobe. However, the cleanliness was second to none. The reception staff speak very good English and are helpful - finding me a bag of ice at 02.00 hrs for a badly sprained ankle injury! The location is good; within walking distance of La Rambles and La Gotica, but if you're thinking of taking public transport from the airport, just be mindful of a reasonable walk from the bus terminal at Placa de Catalunya or having to change lines on the metro. We had a room at the back of the hotel and were woken every morning at about 06.30 by the pigeons who also slept there and the smells from the kitchen each night. All in all a basic, clean hotel that serves it's purpose of a comfortable bed with no frills.
