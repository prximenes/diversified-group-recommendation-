<Content>good base when we arrived at the airport, which is the weiredest airport i've been too, went to connection travel and booked transfers 21 euro's for return, which dropped us off right out side the door.The hotel was clean bathrooms tiny but functional can't say was nice experience getting dressed and undressed in their, but went with a friend and not that familiar with each other so it was a shock to have to share a bed, beds really soft and comfy and the pillows were to die for, (tempted to bring it home). The hotel is situated about 3 tram stops from the van g mus, so quite near but not too near, overall had a fab time would go back again but only for 3 nights cause i've never walked so much in my life.Beware of those wishing to give directions when you look lost as they end with 'just one question for you' they are homeless and they want money

<Content>Not a good experience Our room was small and the ensuite very mouldy. Breakfast was not very fresh. For example, new orange juice was just topped up in a dispenser - concentrate mixed with water. Not sure how old the juice at the bottom of the container was.

<Content>Lovely park nearby We only had one night in amsterdam and did not plan to spend much time in any room . the apple inn was booked last minute and we were pleased to have found accomadation at such short notice. Lucky for us we were travelling light with just small backpacks as we would never have been able to get up the extremely steep and narrow stairs.My husband and I are both in our fifties and quite able bodied but those stairs were unbelievable. Receptionist was polite but not overly friendly. Our room was basic 2 single beds , small bathroom with shower . Everything worked but was very old and tired looking. Breakfast was very good , we were there around 8 am . lots to eat with a good variety of fruits , cereals ,meats and cheeses. I was pleasantly surprised. It was fine to stay one night with easy access to museums and city centre. Just don't bring a suitcase and keep your expectations to a minimum after all it is only a 2 star rating .

<Content>Not recommended! I booked this hotel through Alpharooms.com after reading reviews on this site which all sounded quite good but after staying at this place I would not recommend this hotel to anyone with any kind of disabliity such as lymphoma, arthritus or heart trouble. The stairs were extremely steep and narrow and with no lift I was unable to get my case onto the second floor, fortunately I had help from another guest as no help was forthcoming from the staff. The room was very small and old fashioned with no safe or tea making facilities I couldn't wait to escape it! The shower was good but with no where to hang the shower head it was impossible to shower under. the door got stuck as soon as it was shut and it was hard to get out! The breakfast was a waste of time as we spent ages waiting for cups, knives etc no hot bacon and eggs or fresh croissants. I do not think that this hotel was very good value and will not be going back there .

<Content>Not great... Stayed here for 3 nights in a quadruple room. 3 of the beds were perfectly decent but the fourth may aswell have been a plank of wood put on the floor but with bumps in it, it was so uncomfortable. Not a lot of room for cases once four beds were stuffed into the room.Bathroom was tiny and the shower makes the entire floor wet. There is no lift and the stairs are incredibly steep and narrow so dragging suitcases up and down is not easy at all.The receptionist was very nice but at the end of our stay we were charged for phone calls that we didnt make. Also remember that city tax needs to be paid on top of the total cost of the rooms.Location is in a quiet area but there is a tram stop just up the road from the hotel which will take you to central station and goes past dam square- or this is about a 25 minute walk away approx.

<Content>not great experience While reading reviews of some hotel that i'm planning to book on our stay in bangkok, i remembered my unpleasant experience in apple inn hotel last year. stayed there for 3 nights. the rooms are not dirty but i wouldn't say it's clean either. bad smell in the toilet .no lift and the stairs are very steep. not recommended for elderly and if you have heavy luggage.unfriendly staff too and unreliable. almost missed our plane because of the stupidity of the lady in the reception at that time.

<Content>Not worth the price Stayed for 2 nights, paid 鈧?25 plus taxes and the iniquitous 2% credit card surcharge per night for a double room. Although Amsterdam is notoriously expensive at this time of year, I don't think that the two-star Apple Inn warrants such a hefty bill. Come to think of it, that 2% really grates. It's just as much a gouge here as it is when Easyjet et al do it. Contrast all this with our next admittedly weekend night at the SAS Radisson in Brussels' Wolvengracht. 鈧?35, no fuss, no bother and NO SURCHARGE.On the postive side it is in a wonderfully quiet location (if you want that sort of thing) and very easy to reach from Central Station on the no2 tram (more like 20 minutes than the 10 mentioned below). BTW this tram goes past the Dam and the Leidseplein both of which are worth a stop. In fact the whole route is littered with things to see and do.The problem is that the quality of your stay is going to be heavily influenced by the room that you get, and the nature of the building gives rise to some of problems. Steep stairs are par for the course, for example, and the adaptation of the original buildings are bound to give rise to an unusual environment in places.OK, firstly, avoid 43 and 42 if you can. I'm not sure about 42 inside, but 43 is a triple at the back on the ground floor with an en suite shower/toilet room which is tiny to a fault. You literally can not turn round between the door and the sink. OTOH it all works fine, but they did need some new towels too! Even two-star towels shouldn't be unravelling at the edges. The real problem with 43 (and 42) is that they are under the first floor communal (breakfast) area and you get a seemingly constant scraping of chairs at all hours.Breakfast is the usual cereals/coffee/juice/cheese/ham/bread kind. The choice is good and when we were there it wasn't too busy at all (the 2 hour window 7-9am seemed fine). They did seem to run out of stuff and we found ourselves asking for coffee and bowls for example on subsequent days, and it should have been better.The acid test is, would I stay again? Sadly, no.

<Content>Could be better, could be worse Spectacularly unhelpful staff -- but the room we had was cosy, relatively clean (don't look too close), and the hotel is in a really nice area near Vondelpark. There is no way you'd walk to the centre from here, but it's easy to catch the tram (#2) and it's worth the 10 min tram ride to be out of the city centre proper. Breakfast was perfectly decent (admittedly we were there very early, 7:30 am on a Sunday), nice dining room, lots of food, enough variety, no service -- but this also means nobody bothers you and you can have a pleasant meal before the start of the day. Overall probably overpriced for what it is, but I could find nothing else on short notice without a 2-3 night minimum stay (that wasn't a youth hostel), and was basically satisfied.

<Content>A bit "crummy" I stayed at the Apple Inn with two girlfriends for four nights. We should not all have shared one small room - it got extremely crowded. This was down to our own budget, though, so the hotel can't really be blamed. I learned from this that I should always put aside some money to be able to stay in my own room when traveling with girlfriends.My overall impression of the hotel was a bit crummy. There were marks on the wall above one of the beds, and the bathroom was extremely tiny. You could not sit entirely face-forward on the toilet seat because the wall is so close.The woman at the reception seemed quite reserved and aloof at first, but turned out to be a nice and humorous girl. We didn't really feel like we were given a heartwarm welcome when we arrived, though.The stairs are very steep! And there are a LOT of them. We had to climb a flight of narrow stairs, then cross through the breakfast room before climbing even more narrow stairs to get to our little chamber, which caused some confusion, but as I've learned, a lot of the buildings in Amsterdam have these steep staircases and narrow halls.The breakfast buffet was OK.

<Content>great stay in the apple inn Just returned from amsterdam our stay in the apple inn was great the rooms were clean, spacious and the hotel was in a nice area. Alot of the areas are seedy in amsterdam so it was nice to be staying in a more residential area. Although the hotel isn't near the main areas its easy to get the number 2 tram from central station to a stop just up from the hotel the stops called valeriusplein and there are other stops inbetween for dam square(red light district), leideisplein etc. All rooms come with breakfast and some rooms have balconys which you can sit out and smoke , and the hotel staff were always around cleaning rooms and fresh towels were given everyday. The rooms were good value and we were impressed by the hotel, our best stay in amsterdam yet!

<Content>Decent hotel for the price but could be much better Me, my boyfriend and 3 other friends have booked this hotel for the weekend.On the internet, they say that it is a short walk to the center, well its not ! Unless you are an olympic champion of marathon, it will take you a hour to walk to centraal station, so unless you got plenty time, you got to take the tram, which I got to admit is pretty easy to get (number 2 is round the corner from the hotel).The double room was allright, but there was way not enough plugs, we had to unplugg the tv to charge our phone or use the straigtener.They provide a hairdryer in each double room but I do recommend to bring your own unless you have very short hair !!They shouldnt call a bathroom but more a washing room, after a shower, the room get flooded and you need to wear wellies to use the sink or toilet.But I do have a few positive things to say, the bed is one of the most comfy i have never had and we had a lovely terrace where we could sit and have a ciggie.We were on the ground floor and feared that it would be too noisy but overall it was quiet.I got to admit that the location is quiet and its near Vondelpark so perfect for a nice walk, but I wont choose this hotel again when I will go back to the Dam.

<Content>Terrible,terrible, terrible We arrived on the mon afternoon to the rudest receptionist in the world but that was nothing to the welcome we got when we opened the door to our hotel room. Use this word loosely as the place is actually an extremely run down BB. The description on the website does not fit at all. There was live electric wires hanging out of the wall and when we took the light switch that was supposed to be there down to reception she said someone would fix it while we were out. They didn't and we arrived back to find the wires still sticking out. We didn't manage to make breakfast as the place was so noisy during the night and the bed and pillows so uncomfortable that we were too tired. We had to check out on the Tues and no refund was offered. We tried to explain why we were leaving but she actually didn't care. This place may be OK for single young guys on a stag do but be warned it's actually about 20 mins tram ride from the centre of Amsterdam and 40 min walk. Cabs expensive to return. Dirty, uncomfotable and unfriendly. Not recommended.

<Content>rundown, unfriendly, overpriced A hotel I cannot recommend. overpriced and the rooms were rundown and dusty. But the worst was the breakfast: by far too few tables and dishes / flatware for the guests on a weekend morning (when most people would like to have breakfast around 9-9.30am), so one had to wait in line for quite some time for a table. there was only one service personnell at hand and she was clearly overwhelmed. since there were too few dishes, she quickly rinsed dirty ones by hand in washbowl and wiped them off with a damp towel. we felt like in a youth hostel for a hefty price tag.

<Content>The worst ever Poor location ( missleading on web site), dirty, lacking of the most essential confort, overpriced and charging a 2 % extra on credit card payment. Elder and phisically unfit people should also avoid it because of vertical stairs. Worst possible choice in Amsterdam.

<Content>Great for the price Stayed here from the 15th to the 18th of June 2007. I quite liked the location so easy to get to the leidseplein and central station via the number 2 tram stop being almost outside. Also an easy walk through the Vondal Park to leidseplein though a bit of a trek if you want to walk to central or dam square but do-able. The rooms were fine a bit small and not much storage but clean and perfectly comfortable. Some of the reception staff were a bit miserable but nothing too bad.Managed to get up for breakfast twice which was ok but a bit basic.Overall a great base to explore Amsterdam in a nice area.

<Content>Unfriendly and unhelpful staff - this place should be avoided This hotel, although well located, was one of the worse that I have stayed in. This is purely because the staff were unfriendly and unhelpful to me, my friends and to other guests. They created an unwelcoming atmosphere and made you feel as if you were bothering them by asking simple questions like 'how do I get to...'.

<Content>Will stay here again! VERY central - just catch the tram to the left and down 50m from the front door. Most of the front staff were friendly. Breakfast good for what you get in this price braket and in a nice room. Just make sure you request a room with a shower and toilet if you dont want to share. The only let down was the room decor which was a bit old and lack of sufficent reading lightening at night. We reccommend the place if you just need a clean bed and bathroom.

<Content>Bargain hotel if a little far out! I booked this hotel through a website and managed to get a bargain price of a room for myself and 5 others!Upon arriving in Amsterdam we got the number 2 tram from Central station (the number 2 tram can be picked up from nearly everywhere in Amsterdam centre, just look for the number on the tram stops to find out if it stops at the stop), we paid a one off fee of 1.60 euros which is valid for as many journeys as you can make within the hour.The tram ride from central station was about a 12/15 min journey and about 7/10 mins from the Leidesplien area which was what we wanted to be near.To walk to central station it would probably take you well over 1hour and to walk to Leidesplien it would probably take you about 20/25 mins.Upon arriving at the hotel (the tram stop is either at the end of the street or the middle of the street - the street name is announced on the tram so you know where to get off) we checked in with a helpful member of staff, as we were 2 hours early for check in only one room was available, but the staff member was most helpful and allowed us to store our luggage in this one room till our other rooms were available after 1400hrs. All the rooms were twin beds, which is a little annoying if you want to snuggle up to your partner, but then good if you have had a row!!!The rooms we had were all similar but different in size. Room 1 was a very good size with a big bathroom and the worlds biggest mirror, room 2 was a reasonable size with an odd layout and reasonable bathroom and room 3 was the smallest of the rooms with a small bathroom, although adequate. The rooms were basically decorated and a little dated, but all was clean so it wasnt an issue. The mattress was very soft which isnt too good for the back but I slept ok so it wasnt too much of an issue. The bathroom in room 3 smelt a little but soon went away.Sadly noone got to sample the breakfast as noone got out of bed so sadly I cant comment on if it was any good or not.Some of the friends I went with purchased some food and drinks from the fridge at reception, the prices were very expensive, but I think this is standard in Amsterdam as everywhere food and drink is rather expensive which isnt good!Overall the stay at the Apple Inn was good, its situated quite out of the way in a quiet street so ideal for those who want a good nights sleep but not if you want to be in staggering distance from the pubs and clubs in Leidesplien area! If you want to be in staggering distance I wouldnt recommend staying here but somewhere closer.I would stay at the Applie Inn again as it was fantastic value for money, only 59 euros per room which is very cheap and I would recommend to others too if they want a nice quiet stay.We did have a walk when we got there and its within about 15mins walk to the RIKJS (maybe spelt wrong) and the Van Gough museums so ideal location for these places.Amsterdam was very rainy whilst we were there but we still had a fun time. All I would say is make sure you take plenty of money as the food and drink is fairly expensive, you are talking just less than 10 euros for a decent breakky (try the Irish Bar in Liedesplien) and 5 euros for a pint of strongbow!

<Content>Great Value. Well Recommended. Great value for money. We booked direct with hotel over the phone - friendly helpful service (english speaking) and then paid when we arrived in cash. 2 adults in luxury ensuite room - 3 nights bed  breakfast cost us a total of 217 euros inc the city tax. (18-21 feb 07)helpful receptionist - note: f you are arriving late to check in, contact the hotel by phone or email - they reply immediately. and they will arrange for someone to wait up for you. Reception normally closes 10pm. Fridge in reception is stocked with cold drinks inc. Beer !Room adequate size, very comfy bed, reasonable bathroom.clean, warm and welcoming. we had room 4 looking onto front street and heard no noise at all with double glazing window shut. when open just rumble of trams.Breakfast 7.30-9.30am dutch buffet style, much as you can eat.breads, cheeses, meats, cereal, yoghurts, boiled eggs, fruit juice, coffee, tea. All fresh and tasty !3 mins walk from Vondelpark, in a quiet neighbourhood, a perfect retreat after an insane day+nite in the centre.15/20 mins walk to van gogh + rijksmuseum. 30mins to the heart of the dam - basically nowhere was very far to walk.There is a tram stop right outside hotel, Line No. 2 to the centre and train station every 10 mins until very late. When arriving by tram get off at Valeriusplein stop. 15/20 min journey from station. 1all tram rides are 1.60 euro for any distance within an hour on as many trams as you like ! much more fun walking about though.avoid most coffeshops in the centre and red light district, they are seedy and a rip off. you can usually tell without going in !recommend rookies coffeshop near the liedseplein which also sells beers, very friendly helpful staff, great music and good vibes. or for a total ambient horizontal time try global chillage !if you are on a budget for eating out best value is MAOZ felafel bars which are all over city. 3.50 euro for large pitta with felafels and a free salad bar, couscous etc when you can top up from as much as you like ! filling + healthy (veggie)best pub is Gollem off the singel canal on a narrow side street. trad. dutch bar with 200 belgian beers ! ENJOY !!!

<Content>Nice hotel for short break! Nice simple hotel in Amsterdam and perfect for a short break. Not ideal for anyone wanting to be in the thick of the Amsterdam action but ideal for those looking for a hotel in a quiet area and not too far from the center. ideally situated on the No2 tram line. There are 2 tram stops near the hotel (can't tell you which one is nearest). Not that far from the Van Gogh musem and the hotel is on a very nice street. The hotel room we had was quite small but quite adequete for a couple for a few nights. Daily breakfast that finished at 9.30am when we stayed. Included tea, coffee, orange juice (watered!) , apple juice, bread, jams, cheese and sliced meats. Stair case a little steep to some of the rooms which could be difficult for someone with walking difficulties. Overall a very pleasant stay. Nothing luxurious but perfect for a quiet nights sleep after a hectic day touring Amsterdam (Although tram noise can be heard from front bedrooms if you are a light sleeper). Recommended.

<Content>Location  Booked this hotel via the internet prior to departure. Found it a little difficult to get to, as neither the hotel, nor the website we booked it thru gave us much of a clue, but I suspect if you're good at reading maps you'll not find it a problem. Basically, once you get out of the train station, its in a North East direction. We paid about 14 euro's in a taxi from the Dam Square and once we got to the hotel, we realised that it was right outside the number 2 tram stop. So if you get to the Dam Square or indeed outside the central station, you need the number 2 tram and it will drop you off practically outside the hotel. The trams are 1.60 euro's per journey, but are valid for an hour. So you can jump on as many trams as you want within an hour for the same price.The hotel itself is really clean and tidy, the rooms are to a nice standard and we found the reception staff really helpful, especially when our bags were not put on the flight and they spoke to the handling agents in dutch.All in all, well worth the money, and if we went again, I'd gp back without hesitation

<Content>red light district - wow Well, before we went I read the reviews and they were either good or bad! I was dreading going to be fair as the bad reviews were bad! We got there and the reception was quite modern, and unlike some reviews I read, the receptionist was polite, and ended up very helpful. Cut a long story short - i snapped the key in my suitcase lock and she directed us to a shoe maker who mamanged to cut off the lock off - nitemare!! Our room was basic, but clean, No ripped bed linen as I had read, and the towels werent smelly either - another thing I read. Our toilet seat was broke which we reported on the Saturday and a new one was fitted on the Monday. It was the weekend they couldnt get a workman out - fair enough. Clean towels daily. Ensuite small, but clean and did the job! Breakfast was fine, toast, cereal, meats and cheese. No full english - but helped with the figure! Haha! All in all the Apple Inn hotel was fine and not as scary as I had read!

<Content>Very Good Accommodation! Nice, clean and well placed hotel. The staff were friendly, the room was pleasant and reasonably sized, with sheets changed daily. The breakfast was a normal continental sort, certainly nice and filling to start the day off. The hotel is situated almost next to Vondel Park which is lovely to walk through in the morning - although all the joggers do make you feel unfit! I wouldn't venture there at night however.The hotel is also a short walk away from the Rijks and Van Gogh Museums - if you fancy being cultural.We walked into Amsterdam centre twice a day for 3 days so it's really handy (about 1 mile), but if you;re feeling lazy the trams run regularly right outside the hotel door.There is also a shuttle bus that can take you to and from Schipol Airport for 12euros per person. It's called Connexions and you can buy tickets at the Airport Connexions Booth and the Hotel Reception - very handy!So, if you're a couple or family I would recommend this. The stairs are steep for anyone infirm so this might not be such a good idea, but other than that it would make for a good, reasonably priced place to stay for anyone really. Enjoy!

<Content>Clean, comfortable, close to tram A cheap no frills hotel, handy for the museums but a few tram stops to the Dam Square. Clean and comfortable - our bed was huge, clean towels daily, breakfast ok, staff ok, tram stop pretty much on the doorstep... All in all an ok but nothing special hotel, however for value for money I would seriously consider booking at this hotel again.

<Content>Impersonal Service Upon arrival staff made no effort to greet us or to offer us information on travelling into the city. We were offered no help with our luggage (stairs are extremely narrow and awkward). We were also charged 'city tax' despite the fact that our reservation confirmed that all taxes were included. The hotel staff seem to be impersonal and indifferent.Our first room was damp and musty and we had to insist on being moved to another room. Beware of the adverts which state the Apple Inn is 'child friendly'. I think this means the hotel aren't concerned about groups of students etc making noise and slamming doors until the early hours and disturbing other guests ! If you like to stay in a hotel with a distinctly impersonal service then this is it.

<Content>Comfortable stay My wife and I enjoyed a very comfortable stay at the Apple Inn. We had a lovely light, airy, big room at the back of the house with a double bed and private terrace overlooking the inner garden. The room was very clean, towels were changed daily.The location is excellent - only five minutes walk to the famous Vondel park. The hotel is on a busy road but we didn鈥檛 find the noise interrupted our sleep! Breakfast was tasty and nice, though it was just a self-service buffet. We had a wonderful stay - the hosts were very friendly and helpful! Great value for money.

<Content>Highly recommend, best value for money! This hotel has 2 stars but is really a nice 3 star hotel. We had a concert in Vondel park and this hotel is located very close to it. It was a special celebratory weekend for us and therefore making the right choice was extra important. We certainly weren't disappointed.The hotel was to a very good standard, and the location was perfect and much nicer than I had imagined. We were pleasantly surprised by the very, very friendly and helpful staff. Our rooms were all on the ground floor and very adequate for the price paid, and the standard of cleanliness was top rate. The buffet breakfast was excellent, with sufficient choice to suit every taste, and (a first in my experience of hotel catering) perfect boiled eggs and really fresh orange juice. All in all, Amsterdam has made a great first impression (with lots still to see) and the Apple Inn Hotel made a great base from which to explore it. I really can recommend this hotel!

<Content>Great value, I would heartily recommend this hotel My wife and I stayed at the Apple Inn Hotel recently (mid Aug 06) and would recommend it highly. Staff were very friendly and helpful, room was fairly spacious, clean and comfortable with all the amenities one would want, only safe deposit box was available on request. The hotel is well situated, close to tram line #2 and within walking distance of many main attractions. The owners of the hotel are delightful and are extremely friendly and helpful. Our room was pretty large and simple with very large windows that let in a beautiful breeze. The breakfast room is very pretty and the breakfast was very good. We hated to leave this hotel after 5 great nights. Family Pedersen, Denmark

<Content>Better than expected After reading all the other reviews on this hotel it is fair to say that my friends and I were not looking forward to our break at all. We were in a family room for 4 which after looking at the photos on the hotel website, it looked like we were all going to be in one HUGE bed. Happily, we all had our own single beds, with enough space between them for a bedside cabinet.The hotel is clean, contrary to the other reviews, the bedding was also very clean and maids visited the room every day to clean the bathroom, replenish the stock of loo roll and make the beds.The street can be a bit noisy - there is a tram line outside after all. There isn't a kettle in the room but we took our own anyway so this wasn't a major problem, the breakfasts were basic - breads, jams, muesli and fresh eggs, coffee, tea and fruit juice, but enough to fill you up in a morning.The staircase to the second floor is a bit steep but this seems to be the standard for the whole of Holland, not just this hotel!All in all, I would definitely return to this hotel and would not believe a word of the previous reviews, these people were obviously nit picking as I have never stayed in 2 star accomodation before but was pleasantly surprised by how nice this hotel is.
