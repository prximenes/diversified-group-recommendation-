<Content>Nice friendly hotel We stayed at the Bristol for 3 nights over Christmas and New Year. We arrived on an early flight and were delighted to arrive at the hotel around 11.00 am and find that our rooms were ready.Both the single and double room were quite spacious. The double room in particular was large and even had a sofa in it. The bathrooms were fairly small but were clean with plenty of towels and complementary shower gel and shampoo.There are only two English channels on the television, CNN news and BBC World News.While we were there the hotel was undergoing annual maintenance for two of the days. As a result of this the hotel bar and breakfast room were closed. Instead we had to use the facilities in its sister hotel which is about a 1-2 minute walk up the street so I can鈥檛 comment on the hotel bar in The Bristol as I never got to see it.The sister hotel was called The Pure. This hotel was decorated completely in white, from the walls to the chairs to the decorations on the wall. It was a bit strange in that there was no reception area you walked directly into the bar which also doubles as the breakfast room in the mornings.We managed to have breakfast in The Bristol on our last morning. The breakfast in both hotels is good. There were a variety of juices, cheese, meats, salad, fruit, yoghurt, bread, rolls etc鈥?There are also hot dishes such as bacon, sausages, scrambled eggs, carrots  green beans (who wants this for breakfast I don鈥檛 know), buns, muffins and pastries. The Bristol also had boiled eggs and chicken drumsticks (again who wants this for breakfast). Weirdly there were also bottles of Vodka and Champagne.There are two free internet access points in the hotel reception.The staff in both hotels were extremely polite and helpful. When we requested a street map from The Bristol reception, the receptionist marked the hotel on the map and the best route into the city centre for us.Depending on how fast you walk it takes around 10-15 minutes to the Alter Oper and another 10 minutes or so to the Romer from the Hotel.The back of main train station is around a 2 minute walk from the hotel. The river can be reached in around 10-15 minutes from the hotel. From here you can stroll along the riverbank into the Romer.There is a very nice Italian/Greek restaurant directly across from the hotel. Be warned the portions are large. This also serves breakfast and snacks and it is possible just to have a drink here. The staff are very friendly and the food is beautiful.

<Content>Convenient, clean, sumptuous breakfast The Bristol suited my needs perfectly for a 4 day stay in the region that involved some day trips by rail, as it is a very short walk from the Hauptbahnhof. In winter, with the windows closed, even my room facing the street was very quiet.  The staff were friendly and efficient, and my room was spotless. To say that the budget singles are small is an understatement; tiny or lilliputian are more apt descriptors. But it had everything I needed, including a safe; even had a flat screen TV. I wouldn't choose that type of room, tho, if I planned to spend much time in it. The breakfast buffet is, in a word, wunderbar. Plenty of options so one could have an entirely different breakfast each day if one chose. From previous reviews I was a bit concerned about the so-called dodgy area it's in. I think that's been overstated. I found the area safe, even when I walked back late at night. I didn't notice any unsavory characters, red-light aspects, etc in the area around the hotel. This might be a seasonal thing--very few people at all out in the cold night air. There is a fairly raucous adult-entertainment district about 6 blocks away which I accidentally found on my last night by taking a different route to downtown. Easily avoidable.

<Content>Stylish  Hotel Bristol鈥檚 interior was contemporary and stylish and thought had obviously been put into the communal areas resulting in good use of outdoor space and a stylish bar /restaurant area. However, my room was tiny with only just enough room to walk down the side of the bed. Additionally my room didn鈥檛 have any air conditioning so I had the choice of using a small portable fan which just circulated hot air or opening the window onto a noisy street below. As a single female I didn鈥檛 particularly enjoy the walk to and from the hotel as it鈥檚 on the edge of a dodgy area and the street outside was often full of people milling around which I found quite intimidating.

<Content>pleasant clean and friendly hotel Excellant hotel good location despite being near the railway staion and not a very nice area never felt unsafe at anytime. Breakfast was ok cold buffet excellant hot buffet left a little to be desired dont realy want dim sims or battered prawns for breakfast.Room was excellant apart from very poor pillows that seriously needs to be looked at.We asked reception for an early morning call which never happened so if you have an early flight have an alternative alarm callHowever on the whole we had a very nice couple of days in Frankfurt and the Hotel had everything we needed

<Content>Good enough for an overnight but no more I stayed at this hotel for one night whilst attending a conference in Frankfurt.I have to say that it was booked for me by the organizers and on the basis of the reviews would not have chosen it.It is located close to the railway station, which is very convenient, but usually means a somewhat sketchy neighborhood in most large cities..This proved to be the case here and I would certainly not have felt comfortable walking around the area particularly at night.My room was very clean and a reasonable size for one person.The bathroom also spotless with a good shower.The bed was extremely uncomfortable with inadequate pillows and a really unsupportive mattress.The staff were friendly and helpful and moved me from a room with a door that could not be locked to another with speed and efficiency.Breakfast was varied and fresh.As an overnight stay and if your priority is to be close to the central train station I would say that the Bristol is just about O.K. but no more than that.

<Content>Very High Standard at Reasonable Cost Hotel is exactly what you need for an overnight stay in Frankfurt. About 5 mins walk from the station in a safe feeling area. Everything you need and nothing you don't. Free WiFi was a real boon. Breakfast was excellent, great choice and quality. Even a bottle of iced Russian vodka for the brave!

<Content>Enjoyed the Bristol Hotel Stayed here on my last night prior to my flight home.It's got a convenient location next to the main train station and it's literally less than a 5 minute walk from the north exit to the hotel front desk.The front desk was very kind and helpful in allowing me to check in early. I booked a double based on reading previous reviews and it was more than spacious enough for me. The room was extremely clean and very comfortable.I must agree with all other reviewers in that the breakfast buffet was excellent in both quantity and quality! It was a great way to start off the day.It's easy to get to the sites of Frankfurt by foot and the area isn't dangerous at all. Sure, at times (especially at night) it might seem a bit sketchy but I felt extremely safe. Very good hotel to stay for a short time in Frankfurt since it's so easy to get in and out.As always, free wireless is a BIG plus for me and the hotel provides this service free of charge.

<Content>Great Breakfast, terrible room! My wife and I stayed at the Bristol Hotel for 2 nights in late Sep.08 at the end of our European vacation. Our room was extremely small with one chair for 2 people,sparsley decorated and we had a terrible view. It was a smoking room for my wife's convenience and this was the reason that we did not ask for another room. Most disappoiting after reading all the good reviews on trip advisor.Front desk staff were ok and the bartender Kevan was very friendly.The big saving feature was the breakfast-absolutely incredible, including champagne. The breakfast staff were very nice and efficient.We would have given the Bristol a higher rating but for the lousy room.We much preferred the Concorde Hotel, where we stayed for 2 nights at the beginning of our trip.There was a very good pizza place less than one block away, on the way to the train station.The surrounding neighborhood was very dodgy.

<Content>Nice hotel This hotel was nice. The front desk was very friendly and helpful. The neighborhood is a little shabby (I felt safe, but it wasn't a gorgeous neighborhood), but a 10 minute walk brings you to a very nice area. The outdoor summer patio seems like a great place for having a drink. The room was nice- with a charming view of apartments. The breakfast was over the top fantastic. The selection was amazing and I think I had 3 servings of delicious foods. They had computer terminals in the lobby for anyone that wanted to check emails, no charge. Great for me as I was traveling without a laptop. The bar seemed like a very hip hangout.

<Content>Good value The hotel is within quick walking distance of the train station and is within walking distance of a nice outdoor shopping area. It's a nice modern hotel with computer access conveniently located in the lobby. The front desk staff were helpful, the rooms are comfortable, but it can be noisy on the streets outside the hotel. The breakfast buffet is incredible!

<Content>Loved the Bristol Hotel Frankfurt I would like to recommend the Bristol Hotel in Frankfurt. First of all, it is only a 5 minute walk from the Haupt Banhoff (Central Train Station) which is quite convenient. In spite of this, the area where the hotel is hardly resembles your typical central station area. The hotel is surrounded by nice streets, with an incredible number of restaurants, cafes, some outdoor lounges, etc...The Zeil (shopping areas) are around 20 minutes away walking, through main streets which are very safe. Inside, the hotel is very modern and well decorated. The check-in was very fast and efficient. The rooms are small but comfortable, and so is the bathroom. They offer free wi-fi, which worked just fine. Can access from both the bedroom and the lobby area. In case you do not have a laptop, they also have 2 internet computers to be used at the lobby. Breakfast, well, what can I say...I though it was excellent. Big selection of cold cuts, smoked salmon, breads, eggs, sausages, fruits, etc...I was really impressed by it. At around US$100 a night, I think you cannot find a better place in Frankfurt!! I will definitely stay here again if I am back in Frankfurt.

<Content>Amazing Experience I've been in this hotel during a work trip and I have to say that I really had a beautiful experience. The room was beautiful, not noisy at all. The whole hotel is build with a fantastic modern design (black wood and minimal). Breakfast was fabolous, the buffet was so rich and good. The staff is very friendly too and I spent some night at the bar and I had so much fun, they play live music too, cocktails were great. I had a beautiful experience and if I had the chance to come back to Frankfurt I'll definetely come back here.

<Content>Boutique is right, it was cramped Some boutique hotels have a certain charm to them and make it worthwhile to stay there due to innovative design and cutting edge comfort. Sadly this was not up to scratch at all.The bed was very uncomfortable with square pillows with barely any filling. The bathroom was decrepit, with an odd fan heated radiator which groaned when you turned it on.There was no air conditioning to speak off and the television and remote was a dingy portable that had seen better days.The staff had obviously not serviced the room well,since the safe was locked when I arrived and the shower and shampoo bottles looked like they had been used.If you like to use the public areas like the bar, then I guess I can see the attraction but if you like comfort and design you would be better staying at Goldman25 - that is really how a boutique hotel should operate.

<Content>Little gem Great little hotel in Frankfurt. Located next to the main train station. Hotel is modern and cosy. There is a little bar/lounge in the foyer area which offers a place to chill. The hotel is used by quite a few business people. The breakfast is excellent with a wide selection of items to choose from including Vodka. Not sure why. The staff are very helpful and are proficient in English. Very good value and a good base to explore.

<Content>Smallest room in the world This must have been the smallest single room ever created! You would barely fit 2 singles beds side by side in the room (fortunately there was only one so i was able to get into the room!). There was no storage room for luggage in the room. The bathroom was an ok size but did not have a bath.It was clever use of space but not ideal if you want to stretch your legs or are claustrophobic.Internet service was provided via WiFi and worked well.Breakfast included an selection of hot and cold food and was good.Check-in / check-out service was good.Overall, a nice hotel but if you're travelling alone, spend a couple of extra quid and book a double! You'll appreciate it. :)

<Content>Exactly what I needed I needed a place for an overnight layover at FRA. The Bristol was easy to get to (3 S-Bahn stops from FRA). The room was clean and roomy enough for one person. The breakfast buffet was excellent. I needed a taxi and the service they used offered a great car and driver (very clean Mercedes with friendly driver).

<Content>Bristol is well worth $125 or less. We stayed one night on our way to Oktoberfest and booked the hotel on both price ($95 US) and proximity to the train station which is about a 5-7 minute walk. The room was modern and nice although the carpet needed to be vacuumed. The bathroom was a typical European bathroom with a tiny shower that spilled water into the rest of the small bath room. The hotel is about a 15-20 minute walk to old town Frankfurt. The bar just off the lobby is nice and gets busy around midnight. The bartender was very helpful and gave us ideas where to go out to eat and drink but told us the party would be back here as the bar was opened 24 hours. The breakfast the next morning was very satisfying which included the typical pastries, eggs, sausage, deli meats, cereal and yogurt among other things. Overall we had a great stay and would definately stay here again.

<Content>Relaxing with great quality We stayed in this hotel in early August. Food quality 10/10, Comfort 9/10. I give it 9/10 as it was exceptional heat at 37' and all you have is a fan. During our trip we stayed in 5 hotels and this was the most relaxing.

<Content>could be ok if they can find a way to get the windows to open properly I would really not recommend this hotel. The room I was put in was horrible and the smallest I have been in in a supposedly nice hotel. It was airless and had no airconditioning - the only way to sleep was to keep the fan on all night on the desk which 'luckily' was almost hanging over the single bed. I woke up every morning with a headache - the double rooms may have been better, but they were unable to move me, so I'm not in a position to comment. I don't want to be unfair, but I really wanted to get out of the hotel at every opportunity because it just felt so stuffy and claustrophobic. It also seems to be in the worst area in Frankfurt - a few blocks down from the red light district, and my travelling companion told me he saw someone shooting up outside the lobby. That said - I felt quite safe walking around Frankfurt in general and never felt threatened, but whether this was the rose-tinted spectacles of a naive tourist is difficult to say. The hotel however was clean, the breakfast was pretty good and the lobby decor was modern - although don't expect this to be a hipster haunt. If you really must stay here just make sure you have a double room.

<Content>Great Deal Location: The hotel was walking distance from the central station, so that was convenient, but the area surrounding the hotel is not very charming, however the metro is quite close.Rooms: The room was a bit small, but it was nicely decorated and it had all the amenities needed for a short trip.Hotel: The lobby is nicely decorated and the breakfast brunch (included) was great. The front desk people were very polite.Overall: I think this is a great hotel for a short, weekend stay. The price is great and the location is convenient.

<Content>Good hotel for an overnight stay We have just returned from our stay at the Bristol Hotel. We stayed here for one night for our return flight from Franfkurt. The hotel is just one block away from the train station which made it easy to catch the S-bahn train to the airport. Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. Rooms bathrooms were small (typical for europe) but for one night not a big deal. The hotel has no AC but had a large fan in the room which helped. We paid 95 euros for our double room booked thru [--] This a funky modern looking hotel which was not is my taste but I was just there for a night. The hotel has a bar but would not let us in because we were wearing shorts. I'm on vacation, so since our money was no good to them we in typical american fashion walked across the street and had a beer there. Overall I would stay at this hotel again if it was just for one night.

<Content>Funky Cool Hotel Recently stayed at the Bristol for 4 nights on a business trip. Was very happy with the style and comfort and cleanliness. Yes European hotel bathrooms are small. How small? I smacked my elbow on the back wall while brushing my teeth - that small. Front desk staff was very friendly. The breakfast was indeed the best meals I had in Frankfurt. The dinner less so. The bar was very good and the bartender remembered each of our drinks from the night before. Nice touch. The location is not great, unless you want to be near the main train station, which is a very short walk away. Frankfurt is not a great destination city but this hotel was modern, hip and gave the trip a nice cool flair. I'd stay there again and recommend it to anyone who prefers style over old world charm.

<Content>This is not the W San Francisco Having a one day flight layover in Frankfurt is tough enough (nothing is printed in English), this hotel was meant to be our safe haven to hold us over for the night. The room is neat, but tiny and we order the double medium room. Boutique is not the best way to describe this hotel although it definitely tries. The room is not relaxing and feels more like a galley instead of a room. I understand European standards are different, but if you don't need dark wood-tones and geometric shaped furniture, don't waste your time. As far as convenience, I'm quite sure the train station is great, but the nearest museum is 1 mile away, so unless you know your way around and have a good map, you might find a better value elsewhere.

<Content>The worst hotel experience we've ever had. We were on a driving tour of Germany and made a two day stop in Frankfurt. We arrived around 11 p.m. on a Tuesday night, still recovering from jetlag. I walked into the lobby and stood at the front desk for a good few minutes before the desk clerk deigned to speak to me. I asked him if there was valet parking for the hotel. He gave me a dismissive wave of the hand and told me to find on-street parking. I again asked him if there was any parking for hotel guests and pulled out my reservation confirmation. After finally finding the parking garage (not exactly near the hotel) and dragging our luggage to the hotel, there was no computer record of my reservation. Another bored, not overly friendly desk clerk finally found our paperwork and checked us in. I am not even going to go into the details of the room, since other reviews here have already covered the major aspects (size, etc.).The following night, after a full day of sightseeing, we return to the hotel only to hear a loud thumping coming from the floor of our first floor room. Apparently our room was directly above the bar. Around 1 a.m. we called the front desk to ask how much longer the bar music was going to play. The clerk said that the bar was open all night, but that she would see if they could turn the music down. By two a.m., the music appeared to get LOUDER. We called the front desk again to see if there was any way we could exchange rooms. A different clerk answered the phone- he said there was nothing that could be done since the hotel was booked. He was rather rude and didn't even offer us earplugs (which would have only solved the noise problem...the bed was actually vibrating from the bass). We spoke to a manager prior to checking out in an effort to warn her about room 103 and about our experiences with the desk clerks. Although she superficially appeared to listen to our concerns, two sentences that she uttered suggested that she did not find our comments productive: what do you expect me to do now? and why are you telling me this- what do you want? I am not certain she was implying that we were complaining in an effort to get some part of our stay comped (incidentally, no concessions were even offered), but...on the positive side, there was free internet and the breakfast buffet was probably one of the best we had in Germany (and we stayed at a Ritz Carlton, and a Kempinski Four Seasons with their impressive breakfasts). Is the internet and breakfast worth the bad attitude, miniscule room, and subtly accusitory management? Definitely not for me. Our next stay in Frankfurt will not be at the Bristol Hotel.

<Content>Handy for the Hauptbahnhof The hotel is a short walk from Frankfurt HbF, so there was no need to catch a taxi. The value for a single night's stay on a weekend was outstanding. I did not check the weekday prices but, given that Frankfurt is a major commercial centre, I guess that prices might rise somewhat. The rooms are a little on the small side, but fine for a reasonably short stay. The purpose of our visit was to go to the opera. Frankfurt has a fine new opera house - it's a pity the production didn't live up to ther environment! So far as sights were concerned, the city had more to offer than we had expected (my only visits there before were to change planes or to change from planes to trains - not a really good way of finding out about a place). Not too good a city for dining after the opera - we didn't find a restaurant open at 23h00, so thank goodness that we had had a proper lunch and didn't starve. The hotel breakfast (included in our room rate) was truly exceptional.

<Content>Dissappointed I had high hopes and the Bristol did not live up to them. I booked the standard room and it was quite small. Likewise, the bathroom was very small and if you are a large person you would struggle.This is not a hotel well suited for international guests. There are no hotel instructions/information guides in the room, the room does not come with an iron or ironing board (available on request), and what instructions are written in English are full of spelling mistakes (It took me a little while to work out that to get my jeans laundered, I had to select stacks - Bristol for slacks).What I found most strange was that you can't order room service from your room, you have to go to the bar downstairs! How is this room service?!Overall, looks great on web but this is about as good as it gets.

<Content>Great hotel This hotel is very nice, from the friendliness of the staff to the rooms. Having read the reviews on the site I knew I wouldn't be disappointed. There is a lovely bar in the hotel and we were not disturbed by any noise (room was on the 5th floor).The hotel is located very close to the train station and about a 10 min walk to the shopping areas. I would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again.

<Content>Love the Bristol just like the W in SF The Bristol was great, centrally located near the train station. Art Deco rooms, confortable beds, and beautiful ladies everywhere from check-in to the restaurant. The included buffet breakfast was comparable to brunches I have paid between $25-40 for. Overall a great scene for young hipsters and anyone else who doesn't mind a little techno or house during your stay.

<Content>Just great! I had a fantastic time in this hotel and I was lucky enough to go to Frankfurt during the Football World Cup as the ambiance everywhere was just incredible.The hotel bar is amazing as they open 24 hours!!! They have a delightful brunch on Sunday in the patio ouside. They also have a sister Hotel: The Pure at 50 meters which is also very nice and pure!Nice area within walking distance from every place.I just loved this hotel and I hope to be back soon.

<Content>Ok, not as fantastic as everyone else says... Maybe I am spoiled as I try to stay at 'Boutique Hotels' throughout Europe whenever possible, but I just didn't see what all the fuss was about this hotel. It was ok, but I found the room too small.... especially for 2 people who had any amount of luggage. The bathroom was a closet, and the shower was designed to soak the floor of the whole bathroom. The other strange thing I found in the shower - there was no shelf or place for the soap (very nice - hand made small square) or the shampoo. This would not normally be that big of a deal, but the shampoo bottle was made of GLASS. Hmmm, glass bottle in a small slippery shower with nothing to hang on to? Sounds like a safety disaster waiting to happen to me.The people were very helpful, when I asked if they could make a print out for me they first asked 'how many pages is it'? And when I said I didn't know (as it was an email attachment I had not opened yet) they shrugged and said, oh that's ok it doesn' matter. So I was pleased by their helping me - then I found it amuzing that they charged me on my bill for the 15 black and white prints they made me.The parking structure was interesting - convenient - just across the way, but locked up like Fort Knox with various doors to go through to get to your car.It was an ok experience, but after the review I was expecing some real luxury or novelty, which I didn't find.

<Content>Great hotel, good location Stayed here for 2 nights in March 2006. The hotel has a very modern style and looks nice. The room was small, but very clean, and I was able to check in at 11am: nice. Staff was very friendly and helpful with information about the area. Loved the breakfast buffet. The bar was good as well, as were there internet terminals. It's centrally located, but behind the train station. Reasonably priced, and highly recommended overall.

<Content>The welcoming of Frankfurt served in the Bristol Hotel Our stay was from 11/11 - 13/11 for two nights. We travelled with friends of our who also stayed at the Bristol. On arrival we were welcomed in a very stylish and modern hotel with a high comfort factor. We were not exspecting everyone to be so inviting. The night of checkin - 11/11 we were told of a VIP party that was to take place at the hotel and asked if we would like to join in or transfer to a sister hotel. Well I think our choice to stay was exellent, lots of faces and money in the hotel that night and also so friendly. The night was called NIGHT CAWLERS and a must for a enjoyable evening. Before the party we ate at a resterant across from the hotel with very similar decor and EXELLENT food. All in all a very good weekend away and for a few other places to go:O'Rileys irish pub located just opersit the main railway stationRama V Thai resturant - located @ vilbeler str.32 - BOOKING IS A MUST! Enjoy if you travel to frankfurt

<Content>Last stop on a two week trip, interesting This was the last stop of a two week trip before our flight back to the states. We were tired, had just dropped off the rental car (a hassle) and just wanted to check in. Then the Bristol pulled the old bait and switch on me. They informed us that they had just opened another hotel right down the street, would we be interested in staying there instead. When I protested they only pushed harder. Eventually I agreed to take a look at the new hotel (called The Pure). It seemed nice so we agreed to the switch. I'm glad we did. The Pure was very nice, had an excellent breakfast buffet and was located just down the street. I think we may have been the first people to ever stay in the room. There was an excellent restaurant right across the street (I think called The Symposium) and we had a nice meal. This hotel was close to the train station and a 25 euro cab ride from the airport. I would stay there again.

<Content>Very convenient, clean and cheerful hotel This is a good place to stay if you want to be in central Frankfurt and near the train station, which is about a 10 minute walk. The hotel is modern, with small but clean and cheerful rooms. There is a restaurant with Asian cuisine and a wonderful breakfast buffet. During the summer, there is a delightful summer garden when you can get drinks and snacks until midnight. I was quite pleased with this hotel and would stay there again rather than staying at the airport if I had a flight the next day.

<Content>Wonderful Design The Bristol has the most amazing design I have ever seen, except maybe at W hotels. But the service and the food are also very good. Because I was there for a conference, I could say that the business facilities are also very comfortable.If I have to find a downside to this hotel, it would be the environment. It is close to the train station (a plus), which also means close to junkies, prostitutes and strip clubs. If I were travelling alone, as a woman, I would be a bit concerned to walk around at night. But that's central Frankfurt.

<Content>Fairly Average If you need or want to be by the main station then this is a very convenient hotel. It is clean and well decorated and the staff are helpful and friendly. However, I booked a single room and that's exactly what I got - a small bed against one wall and barely enough room to open a suitcase. The bathroom - or more properly shower room - was extremely compact. Probably fine if you literally want a bed for the night (which I did) but otherwise not very appealing. It felt more like a room in a university halls of residence than a hotel room.

<Content>German Luxury I don't think I can recommend this hotel enough. I wasn't expecting too much because of the two star rating that Orbitz gave it, and the fact that it was near the train station (the real reason I picked it). But this is a beautiful hotel. It has been recently remodeled, and everything is in great shape. They have a very trendy lobby and bar, they offer free internet access in the lobby as well.I don't know if I would say this is a family hotel. It is more for business travelers, and adults traveling in Europe. There is not much which is tailored towards children or families, but this wasn't an issue for me.The breakfast, particularly on Sundays was spectacular; much better than any other German hotels I stayed in, and rivaling any hotel breakfast buffets I've had anywhere.One thing that Americans might find offputting is the single rooms. I was expecting it to be small because I've spent a lot of time in London where single rooms are also this cozy. Despite its lack of roomyness, I really liked my room. It was just the right size for one person. It was also imaculately clean, and had a very nice bathroom.All this, plus the fact that it is a block and a half from the main train station, which also makes it about 12 minutes from the airport, makes this hotel an ideal choice for people looking for a nice and extremely reasonably priced hotel.
