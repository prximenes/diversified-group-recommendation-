<Content>Better than I thought it would be Making my first trip to Hong Kong, it was clear that finding a room at a reasonable price would be a challenge. I booked a room for 4 nights at the Stanford Hillview as it seemed to be one of the few hotels in the Kowloon area that were of reasonable quality and at a reasonable price (at least for HK). On paper, it also looked like it would be convenient to the Kowloon sites and a reasonable walk to the Star Ferry or metro station.I was pleasantly surprised. The room was spacious and the bed was comfortable with feather pillows which I need for a good night's sleep. There was a very small amount of mildew in a few areas around the tub which to a clean freak will be a bit offputting, but didn't really bother me. Other than that, everything was clean and well maintained and though the decor of the rooms is a bit tired and could use a freshening up, the room met all of my needs. Service was good from both the front desk and housekeeping. The toilet was not flushing properly when I arrived and someone appeared to take care of it literally within 3 minutes after I called housekeeping. The view was nothing much but I understood the hotel was not by the water and I was not expecting (nor paying for) the dramatic view of the HK Island skyline.I did not eat at the restaurant as I did not have breakfast as part of my package and I hate eating in hotel dining rooms anyway especially when you are in a one of the great foody havens of the world like Hong Kong. The really well done HK museum of History and also the museum of science are both 300 meters away, the ferry to Hong Kong Island is a 15-20 minute walk and there are loads of good restaurants within a few streets of the hotel on Knutsford Terrace and Kimberley Road (Try Yuen Lee on Kimberly for really good and inexpensive pork/goose/duck over rice plates). There is also a Wellcome mini supermarket right around the corner on Kimberly for cheap snacks and drinks.All in all, a nice room at a reasonable price in a good location on Kowloon. As others have mentioned, it is on a hill but there are ways to minimize the climb (for instance, enter through the garage instead of the main lobby, and if you are coming from Nathan, take the escalator and short staircase by the Baskin Robbins on Kimberley Road up to Knutsford Terrace and it is a level walk from there).It turned out to be nicer than I thought it would be and considering hotels in HK are extremely expensive with few real budget options beyond backpacker crash pads, I certainly feel it's a real good option for the price.

<Content>Excellent hotel - close to everything Can't complain about this hotel. it is well situated in a quiet area but close to restaurants and night life - within easy walking distance of the subway lines and the harbour. Staff were keen to help and exceptionally efficient the room was comfortable and very clean and the food at breakfast was excellent. I would recommend this place heartily.

<Content>Good value option We stayed for four nights in Oct 2008. Our room was quiet and comfortable and although the view was very ordinary (other buildings), it didn't matter as we spent little time there. Breakfast was of the usual international buffet type and sufficient for us. We didn't use the restaurant at other times so we can't comment on the quality of other meals. Other facilities at the hotel were adequate although the roof garden was nothing special. While we were there, the bar was running a half price promotion on all drinks after 2130 which brought the cost down to a realistic level. The location is excellent being only 250m from Nathan Road and about 15 mins walk to the Star Ferry. There are plenty of restaurants of just about every type (except Chinese) around the corner in Knutsford Terrace. If you prefer more local cuisine, the shopping centre on the corner of Kimberley Road and Nathan Road has several restaurants. The hotel runs a free shuttle bus to Kowloon AEL station several times a day. A taxi to the same place costs about HKD60.To summarise, the Stanford Hillview offers a well located quiet base from which to explore Hong Kong. If like us you don't want anything more than that, then this hotel is a good value option.

<Content>Good value hotel in Hong Kong For a city like Hong Kong this is a very good option with a reasonable prices (the hotel sometimes offers value packs at at their web site) and good location in the Kowloon area. The hotel is close to many restaurants, asian as well as western style. It麓s also easy to find a place where to have a drink in the neighborhood .We had a room facing the park wich was also something pleasant .

<Content>Brilliant stop-over hotel Our flight got in at 7am and we arrived at the hotel at 8.30am, expecting to have to wait until the 2pm check-in time, but they gave us our keys straight away, which was just what we wanted after an 11 hour flight. We asked for a high floor room, and they accomodated us straight away. Yes the view was of other buildings, but all buildings in Hong Kong are high rise!The staff were professional and helpful.It's in a great location, in walking distance to most attractions, although it is up a very steep hill, so some people might struggle.We found Hong Kong a great place to stay. We did a Hong Kong island trip with Tour East which was great value for money. We would recommend this hotel and Hong Kong.

<Content>Good value hotel in great location We stayed for 2 nights with our daughter. At our request we were given a larger room because of the extra bed which was good because the rooms clearly are not big. Certainly not a luxurious hotel but perfectly acceptable. Breakfast was good value. Location is great withing walking distance of the harbour and shopping areas. Don't worry about the hill - its only a short walk. Many nearby restuarants. Would recommend it as a reasonable value hotel in a good location.

<Content>Very Rude Staff!!!!! We booked the hotel through a last minute website. The confirmation came back with details of a shuttle bus. On the booking slip we had to include details of our arrival flight and we were arriving after midnight. We arrived at the airport at 1am and there was no one in sight. We eventually found a flight attendant who very kindly rang the hotel to find out what had happened. The flight attendant spoke to the Night Manager who told her it was bad luck and the shuttle stopped at midnight and we would have to find our way to the hotel. We eventually found a bus and got there after 3am! When we arrived and complained to the night manager he said it had nothing to do wth him and the booking company was at fault (even though he admitted the hotel provides the info to the booking company). Once we had voiced our concerns he upgraded' us to a room that only had a double bed and had not been cleaned properly as the tables were all sticky and dirty.Eventually in the morning the hotel manager swapped us to a better room.However beacuase of the lasting impression of the night manager and the treatment received on arrival, we will definitely not being staying here again!

<Content>Nice, quiet hotel in Kowloon I booked here following reviews on Tripadvisor and I wasn't disappointed. I had just one night in Hong Kong between flights and decided to stay in town rather than at the airport and this was an excellent choice.It's in a quiet little street on a steep hill, but just a few steps away from restaurants on Knutsford Terrace and loads of other activity at the foot of the hill. The hotel is really very quiet, with no traffic at all.The room was pleasant and well-equipped.I had a quick snack in the restaurant whilst waiting for my room to be ready and was well looked after by the staff.

<Content>The staff is a huge disappointment We were in Hong Kong on a short break from Guangzhou. Went to the hotel reception to ask for the price for two rooms and two nights. Louis, the receptionist told us the price, but he forgot that it was October 1st and no longer low season rates. When we were checking out, we had a big surprise waiting, double price. Louis or any of the staff of the hotel never admitted the mistake and so far there has been no reply from the manager Michael either. Not an apology, nothing. When you go there, be careful with what they say, it might not be true. I will definitely choose another hotel the next time in HK. For the double price we got old and smelly (of cigarette) rooms.

<Content>Great place I would really recommend this hotel. It is situated in a great place. Location is just perfect - 15 minutes walk to star ferry, 10-15 minutes walk to night market. It is in a walking distance to everything- subway, shops, restaurants. The hotel itself is nice. Our room was great. We were really surprised by high standard of our room as the hotel is not that expensive. Everything is really clean and nice. Staff at reception very helpful/ They let us stay till 6pm on our lats day at no charge...which was a nice thing. Normally hotels charge you for late check out. I really liked this hotel. It was a great stay. Great value for money!!!

<Content>Excellent stay, great value Found this hotel on Tripadvisor after having no clue where to stay. Such a clean and impressive hotel. Really helpful and polite staff and great location. Other reviews mentioned the steep hill the hotel is on which worried us before we went, but really this is no big deal. It's steep, but not a long road so minimal effort required! would definitely return.

<Content>Great value hotel The Stanford Hillview is a small but very well kept hotel in the Tsim Sha Tsui (TST) area. The hotel is located near fantastic restaurants of various cuisines as well a affordable Chinese eateries, a grocery, convenience stores, and coffee shops.I booked the hotel because it offered the best value of all available hotels for the same price. I didn't pay extra for in-room wifi, had discount on the buffet breakfast and had late check-out until 3pm.I had no problems with the staff. They all spoke good English, were very professional, polite, hospitable and helpful.The only drawback is that the hotel is quite far from the TST MTR station. Depending on how fast you walk and even if you take the Miramar shops and Knutsford Steps/Terrace shortcut it may take you 5 to 10 minutes by foot to search the MTR station.

<Content>Loved Everything About the Hotel!!! My friend and me were pleasantly suprised when we saw our rooms....nothing like 3 stars but more like 4 stars! Rooms were decorated nicely and our view was quite good. The fridge in the room had a good choice of drinks/soft drinks but they do charge for mineral water. Other than that, the bathroom was clean and even the beds too! The steep hill the hotel is located on is not that bad - its abt a 3min walk uphill and you can always take a shortcut from Knutsford Terrace/Steps to enter the hotel via the lift at the carpark.The hotel recep were also very helpful and polite......the hotel is also near the MTR station (TST) so no worries abt having to walk too far. If you are planning to go to Macau from HK, you can also walk to the Star Ferry Terminal and take the ferry to Macau. All in all- this is a very good location and good for value too!! I will recommend it to those who are intend to stay at Tsim Sha Tsui area!

<Content>Pleasure Hotel has a perfect location to discover Hong Kong. Museums, MTR, Star Ferry, shops, restaurants and bars are all within walking distance. The staff is friendly and professional; the rooms are clean and quiet; the food is fine. We stayed seven nights and never regretted our choice. If we ever visit Hong Kong again, we will certainly return to Stanford hillview.

<Content>OK, except... Stayed there for 2 nights with a girlfriend. I got a last minute deal (USD$60sth/night) and the hotel is pretty good with such a low price.Pros:- Located at Tsim Sha Tsui, easy access to shopping spots.- Right next to Knutsford Terrace, where lots of pubs and restaurants located.- Room is clean.Cons:- Located on super steep road, as other reviewers mentioned. Not recommended for elders.- 10 minutes walking distance from MTR stations.- Room is small, in OK but not new condition.

<Content>Really excellent hotel A really, really nice place to stay in a great location in HK (with the exception of the short but VERY steep hill up to it!!)Staff were warm, helpful and friendly and hotel was impeccably clean. Our room was booked as a standard twin but we ended up with a reception room, 2 tv's, 2 bathrooms and a whole lot of space. Beds were clean and super-comfy, bathroom was spotless. All the major Kowloon attractions are within walking distance, so much shopping, a great place to stay and very reasonably priced.

<Content>Yes, OK Hotel. Stayed at this Hotel early June 08. No complaints about the service, location, or condition of the Hotel; although, the room I was given was a bit 'oldish' but tolerable (depends on how much you pay I guess as to what sort of room you get...). Would stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Great Bargain My mum and me stayed at the Stanford Hillview for 10 days in November 2007. Overall, this a great hotel for seeing the sites of Hong Kong. It was a short walk (5-10 min) to the subway station and just down the road to the shops. Whilst it is situated on a steap hill, there are numerous secret ways to get to and from the hotel once you get to know the area (you can almost walk the whole way through a shopping centre which is much nicer than negotiating the busy streets).The hotel itself was basic but more than adequate for our needs. The room was big enough for us and our luggage. There was also a small table where we ate our breakfast in the mornings. The beds were comfortable and came with these extremely large pillows. We had to remind the staff to vacuum our room about half way through our stay. I think this had more to do with the fact that they were not use to people staying that long than being unclean. There was also good english TV chanels for when you needed to put your feet up.This is a great hotel for a girls getaway or the like as it is cheap ($100AU a night for me and my mum) and close to pretty much everything (including both the cheap and expensive shops and places to eat). The hotel has a shuttle service which takes you up to the ladies market. We caught it twice and then got the train home when it was late. We also caught the airport bus from the bottom of the hill.Sure you can probably find a nicer hotel in Hong Kong but you will pay for it. This hotel had all we needed for a great holiday in Hong Kong.

<Content>Lovely hotel, will stay here again! We booked this hotel after reading all the positive reviews and we were not disappointed. The hotel was excellent.Yes, the hotel is located on a steep hill, but its only a couple of minutes walk up the hill from the bottom. If you don't want to walk up the hill, take a left at the bottom and you will see the entrance to the hotel carpark. Go in and get the lift up!When you arrive in Hong Kong its definitely worth getting the Airport Express train - only 19 minutes to Kowloon and then you can get the Airport Express bus (K5) for free. This stops at the bottom of the hill, outside Empire Hotel on Kimberley Road.Also, if you're going back to the airport by the Airport Express train, you can use the Airline check in facilities at Kowloon station on your day of departure - so you'll be luggage free to enjoy your last day in HK and then get to the Departure Gate about 45mins-1 hour before departure. Its only HK$160 return, so well worth it.Check-in was a breeze and the staff were friendly and helpful. Rooms were clean, and not too small. Usual size for Hong Kong I suppose. Bathroom was small but clean and nice shower. It was always well stocked with shampoo, soap  shower caps. There were also a stocked fridge and kettle, with complimentary tea  coffe. We didn't find the beds hard at all, they were very comfortable.Housekeeping staff were excellent and whenever we requested anything (like extra hangers for our clothes) the lady brought these within 5 minutes! She was always happy and smiling whenever she saw us and our room was always very neat and clean. She definitely worked hard and it was a pleasure to tip her at the end of our stay.The hotel is in a perfect location - loads of restaurants nearby and easy access to Nathan Road.If you're thinking of going to Ocean Park and the cable car to the Big Budha, make sure you keep the tickets as on presentation of these (i.e Ocean park), you will get 10% off the other (Cable car ride).We booked through Wired Destinations.com and paid 拢757 for a 9 night stay for a triple room, which was cheaper than the hotel website. But on checkout noticed guests who booked directly were only charged HK$640 for a twin room (approx 拢42 pn). So its worth shopping around!All in all a very good stay and would definitely stay at this hotel again

<Content>Would Probably Stay Here Again We found the best deal for this hotel and booked the room on their web site. I was impressed with their quick and thorough email responses to the few questions that I had regarding my upcoming trip. They advised me about the airport shuttle that I assumed took me directly to the hotel but upon reading other recent reviews (after my trip) I see that it can鈥檛 make it up that all important hill. So, I guess it鈥檚 just as well that my husband and I missed the shuttle. You see it stops at midnight and our 9:30 pm airport arrival time was delayed until about 12:15 am.We then took the airport train to Kowloon and a taxi to the hotel from the train station. If you think you might have the same problem be sure to have HK$ since you need that currency for the taxi and most of the airport currency exchange booths are closed by midnight. I don鈥檛 know if the hotel鈥檚 front desk employee resented being on the graveyard shift, our late arrival, or just had an attitude problem but he was not friendly or overly helpful at all. Or maybe I was just overly sensitive due to no sleep in the prior 24 hours. The day shift staff seemed friendlier.The room was fine. It was clean and a bit roomier than I thought it would be. I don鈥檛 have much else to say since we immediately hit the sheets. Upon waking we had the hotel buffet breakfast. It was good and well worth the price. Since we were in transit to a cruise ship in Hong Kong we immediately left the hotel for limited shopping/sightseeing before checkout time at noon. Everything others have said about the hill is true so I won鈥檛 add more of the same. But, do take Knutsford Terrace. It gets you to Nathan Rd and you pass a great variety of restaurants that I would have liked to try had I stayed longer. Getting back into the hotel from Knutsford Terrace was no problem for 2 sleep deprived travelers but that hill would have killed us.

<Content>Pretty good for price Location: Yes, it's on a very steep hill, one that has a staircase up the sidewalk, so be prepared! Lots of good restaurants nearby, and close to a subway stop- maybe a 5-10 minute walk. Easy to walk from here to a lot of Kowloon.The Airport Express bus is K5- get out at the Empire Hotel stop.Accomodation: We had no problem checking in and getting our room. Although the internet description said rooms have in-room safes, some of them don't. Don't worry, though, you can use your own safe-deposit box at the front desk. There's a fridge in the room, a kettle, some teas and coffee as well. Internet was free- we had a wireless connection that the hotel provided a username and password for every 3 days. We were also provided with a power adaptor when we requested one. Housekeeping service was very attentive whenever you needed something, like when our kettle stopped functioning, they brought us a new one in just a few minutes.The bathroom is terribly dated and small. I felt like I walked in to my parents 1970s bathroom and the blowdryer looked like some kind of vacuum! Quite a riot actually! But the water pressure and hot water were always fine. The bed was like a rock as well.However, overall the room was adequate given we were barely there, and it was very clean.Overall: We couldn't get in to the YMCA Salisbury, so I think this was a good second choice. The staff were all very helpful and our room was more than adequate. I would recommend staying here to others.

<Content>What a hill! A pleasant, clean, if fairly budget hotel, in a really good location in Kowloon. The room was pretty small, but as we spent most of our time out and about this wasn't too important. Staff were friendly and helpful but, by God, when the brochure says that teh hotel is on a hill, it wasn't joking. OUr coach transfer dropped us at the bottom of the hill as it couldn't make it up there! If you have any mobility problems at all, then think again...

<Content>Nice hotel, bad location As a frequent business traveler to HK (about 4-5 times a year) I usually stay here or at the YMCA on Salisbury Road. However, visiting HK en route for our honeymoon to New Zealand and Australia, we stayed at this hotel for 2 nights as a couple for the first time and had an unpleasant experience.Initially, we booked for one night thru asiatravel and were planning to move to Shenzhen for the next 2 nights.1. While checking in, the receptionist asked us about the kind of room we wanted and also reconfirmed that we wanted a double bed. While, on entering our room we discovered that it had twin beds! On re-requesting for a double bed, we were told that there was no other room available in the hotel.2. The room was pretty shabby and had no toiletries in the bathroom. Also, the tub was old and in bad shape.3. The next day, on being pretty pissed off, I asked the receptionist that if we made a re-booking, for the second night (instead of moving to Shenzhen, that is), would they give us another room. Now, I did this knowing that rooms were available in the hotel and that too at a discounted price. However, not to my surprise, I was again told that there were no rooms available in the hotel and that we would not be able to stay here.... So, I booked via asiatravel and told the hotel to give me another room as we were on our honeymoon.This room was perfect, also, surprisingly it was large. And, I strongly recommend anyone checking in here, request for one of the corner rooms. As they are almost 50% extra sized than the others. Bathroom was fine, all was well. Except, to use the wi-fi in the room that is free, one has to personally go down to the reception to get his username and password. And, it has to be updated hourly. That is, to use it for 3 hours, I was given 3 various usernames and passwords for which I needed to maintain small 3 pieces of paper and log in every hour! How strange is that?4. In a place like HK, where one moves around on foot and MTR, one small difference in hotel location, such as moving up the next street, can change your entire HK experience. Stanford Hillview is located on a steep slope and is no where close to any MTR. It is at least a 10 minute walk to the nearest MTR station, Tsim Sha Tsui.I would not recommend this hotel for Honeymooners or Business Travelers. But, for sure would to those traveling to HK in search of their Bridal Outfit. As most tailors are right there.

<Content>Read and trust the other reviewers! This hotel is a gem! A very nice hotel and worth every dollar you spent. Location is in TST area, the central of 'real' Hongkong. Walking about 5-10 minutes to MTR station, near dozens of restaurants and shops, however still it is very quiet. A steep road is not a big problem, not at all. Room is very clean, spotless and the space is decent, it is more spacious than The Kimberley Hotel's room which is about in the same vicinity. I just praise HK's cleanliness standard. Both Kimberley and Stanford Hillview are very clean. Staff are helpful. And off course, the wonderful things added to the value of the hotel is the Knutsford Terrace. We spent every night drinks and have a light meal in different cafes/resto after all-day-long exploring HK. I will definitely go back to Stanford Hillview again on my next trip to HK. PS : Because they have other sister property at Stanford Mongkok, it would be easier (before you fly) to print out the name of the hotel in Chinese (it's in the hotel website). It might be not necessary, but just in case. Luckily I did that. When we took a cab from HK Ferry terminal, at first the driver is a bit confused given his limited English, however when I showed him the Chinese name printed, he was driving us right away.

<Content>Great Hotel Stayed here in December 2007 and found the Hotel to be great value for money. The rooms were fine and the buffet breakfast is a must for $60.The evening buffet is also great value for money. Although the hotel is on a hill I would not let this put you off what is a very good hotel that considerably punches above its 3 star status.

<Content>It's all true Yes, it's all true what other reviewer's have written about this hotel.Quiet, yet central. Clean. Rooms are small, but at the price represent good value in Hong Kong. We used the restaurant for breakfast on some occasions, we also used the buffet dinner a couple of times.. We had no complaints. I will say a special thank you to ALL members of staff. The service and helpfullness was excellent. We left a couple of bags with the concierge while doing a side trip to Macau. No problems. Also reccomended take a taxi to the airport, pointed out for two people only about 拢6.00 more than the hotel bus. Plus the conviance of door to door!

<Content>Superb Hotel This is a fantastic hotel in the heart of Hong Kong, The rates are very reasonable, the hotel is clean and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Although there is a steep hill up to the hotel you can access it from Knutsford Terrace where there is an escalator. Knutsford Terrace has a number of great restaurants. Only a 10 minute walk to the closest underground and the famous Nathan Road shopping centre. Would highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>quiet, clean, comfy hotel in a great location Stayed here for a full week, and we were very happy here. My husband is an insomniac, and I always look for a quiet hotel, which I thought would be difficult to find in such a crowded city. We stayed on the 10th floor, facing the observatory, and he slept great! Our room was always clean, beds were made with crisp duvets, with very large pillows. Breakfast buffet was fabulous, enough variety to please everyone from vegans to carnivores. Staff spoke great English. Internet is expensive in the business center, I think 60 HKD per hour. Easy access to bus routes on Nathan, subway stop also a quick 10 minute walk. SHH offers a free drop-off at the airport line subway station, so don't pay for door to door service if you can haul your own luggage. A group of three or more goes for much less than individual fares. Many restuarants nearly directly outside the front door, our favorite was the Indonesian called 1968. I would recommend the green papaya salad! Plan to return to HK again in the spring and will not even look for another hotel, we'll be back.DandTSalem, Oregon

<Content>Great Stay!! Stayed at the Stanfod Hillview Hotel in October 2007 and had a great stay. Hotel is ideally located to explore Hong Kong. Right in the heat of Tsim Sha Tsui you are never far away from Hong Kong's many attractions. The room was a good size and very clean and comfortable. There are pleanty of good places to eat on Knutsford terrace.

<Content>Only for short stopover Stayed for a night during Christmas period in 2006 as most hotels were either booked or too expensive. Having been to HK several times for leisure, I have always stayed at different hotels as there are plenty of choices to choose from and it's always nice to try out a new hotel.Stanford Hillview is old and the location is right up Observatory Court via Kimberly Road which means it will be a long walk from TST MTR station if you are not taking a cab. Rooms are old though clean but then again no one stayed in the hotel room when on holidays so this is only recommended for a short stay. Plenty of choices for food along Kimeberly road and if you want something non-Chinese, there is always the hip Knustford Terrace within walking distance.Didnlt try any of the F  B in the hotel when there are so many choices in HK.

<Content>good deal Room not as small as I thought it would be, I got a twin room on the 8th floor. It's not big, but had no problem moving around, bathroom a bit smaller, but very clean. Housekeeping very good, room very clean. Front desk staff never smiled but I didn't have much contact with hotel staff except check in and check out. Also very quiet. Overall a good hotel if you are not looking for a grand lobby and swimming pool...etc that kind of stuff.

<Content>Just perfect! You cannot find a better hotel in a better location in that price range! It was extremely quiet and clean. The room was perfect (deluxe twin). We loved having breakfast in the dining room and looking out the window at the beautiful huge banyan trees. You are close to everything, and there's even a supermarket just around the corner - convenient for bottled water. Be sure to check the hotel's Internet offer.

<Content>Excellent Value and the hill's not that bad! We stayed for one week from 11th September. We booked a standard twin room online through Wired Destinations, which seemed to be the best deal. I think the room was a Deluxe from looking at their website - it was quite compact (especially the bathroom!) but quite sufficient for our needs. It was clean and modern and pleasantly decorated. Yes, the beds were firm (!) but my back had no complaints.The location was fab - surrounded by loads of restaurants and cafes to suit all budgets, 7/11 around the corner and loads of other shops. The harbour was within walking distance, MTR stations only 5 mins away, but taxis, trams and buses really cheap. If you want excellent nightlife, go to Lan Kwai Fong in Central - easily reached by MTR or a short taxi ride away. Don't expect to get home before daylight though!!! Also the climb up to the hotel isn't that bad - yes it's quite steep but not at all long - it's also easier to enter the hotel from the basement and get the lift up to your floor.I have no complaints about the Stanford Hillview - it's excellent value for money. Don't expect service with a smile but it is efficient. We didn't have their breakfast as we preferred to eat out and it was a lot cheaper.By the way, internet access is only included if you book online using their own website so be careful about this. Otherwise, you have to pay.

<Content>Saved by the Knutsford Steps! Stayed in the Stanford Hillview hotel with my sister on the first leg of a three destination holiday during August. The weather in Hong Kong was very hot and humid but the air conditioning in our room was a god send. The hotel was very clean and our room was quite spacious. We had a five night stay and our bed linen and towels were changed every day. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. Even though breakfast was not included in our booking we used the buffet style breakfast a few mornings. The buffet selection was mind blowing with all kinds of conceivable goodies to whet your appetite and certainly keep you going for a good part of the day. Having made our hotel reservation based on the reviews by other tripadvisor users, the most helpful tip was how to avoid that steep hill. If you go into the Miramar shopping centre on Nathan road (and avail of the air conditioning!!), take the escalator for Knnutsford Steps passing by a pleasant cafe called Foccacino and turn left at Starbucks,through the double doors and up a short flight of steps and all the restaurants beside the hotel are on your left. Being able to take the lift to our room from the basement was also a help in getting some cool air.I thought the Stanford Hillview hotel was very pleasant and we certainly enjoyed our stay there. I would recommend it to anyone intending to stay in Hong Kong for pleasure purposes.

<Content>Nice central hotel that is good value We stayed at the Stamford Hillview during a stop-over on the way Europe for 1 night on the way there and back home to Australia. Great location, right off the central shopping area and near the subway. Very well airconditioned which is a must in Hong Kong! Our room was average with no view and the bathroom was very clean. Be wary of the hill though, it is certainly on top of a VERY STEEP hill! The shuttle bus from the airport won't go up the hill, and taxi drivers don't either so be prepared for a steep climb. Otherwise you can access the hotel via the auto garage at the bottom of the hill however there aren't any signs so I assume the hotel doesn't like people using this route. Staff were prompt and friendly and very willing to help point out nearby attractions and eateries.Good value for money, great location, I would stay there again!

<Content>great hotel for good value. Was staying at this hotel from 18th to 24th August, while visiting HK for a medical conference. Chose this hotel because of the review from Tripadvisor. It's near shopping centres, MRT stations (2), eateries etc. I enjoyed the food at Knutsford Terrace, about 5 min away. Staff are professional and super friendly. Very good service from them. Room is ok. HK's hotel rooms tend to be small. Overall, it's a hotel with good service and it's situated at a convenient location. The slope was really not a problem. We entered the hotel's B1 from Knutsford Terrace.

<Content>great location... rock hard beds This is a pretty good hotel for a reasonable price in a very expensive city. The staff were friendly and helpful and the room facilities were perfectly fine. The only problem was the bed. It was amazingly hard as were the pillows. It got so uncomfortable that I asked the manager if they had other rooms with softer mattresses.... they didn't. If they changed this one thing, I'd happily go back.

<Content>Great location..careful about their rate quotes Stayed here for 2 nights. Nice rooms and generally helpful desk staff. They were a bit disorganized around arrangements for airport transfer and required many phone calls and clarifications to get it right. Rooms were clean and good sized. Breakfast was oK if a bit pricey for what you get. One warning....I was quoted a price for a room by the hotel (in writing) but they would not honor it when I went to pay for the room. Much discussion at the front desk yielded no satisfaction. I was quite suprised that they would not provide good customer service by honoring their own price quote.

<Content>Great location We were on vacation during the first week of April. Unfortunately, as soon as we got to the hotel to check in, I realized that my wallet was missing, and was probably left behind in a cab. The hotel staff went out of their way to attempt to help us get in touch with various cab companies. They were very helpful with all of our subsequent questions about how to get to various places around the city. The location of the hotel was great. The walk up the hill, which others mention, is not bad as long as you don't have any major disabling conditions. The numerous adjacent restaurants were so much fun to eat at that we chose not to eat at the hotel. We took the airport express bus to the airport (takes about 45 min - 1 hr), which only ended up being about $60 -70 HKD for 2 people, and stops at a a nearby location on Nathan Rd. There are numerous subway stops within walking distance, as is the Star Ferry Terminal. We highly recommend use of the Visitor Center at the Star Ferry Terminal, which has very friendly staff and extra helpful tidbits about traveling in the city. The rooms were very clean, and the toiletries were replenished daily. We stayed in a twin double which was similar in size to many Europeand and Japanese hotels.

<Content>Fantastic location hotel The hotel was in a fantasic position for all the local attractions in Kowloon. Only a minutes walk away and you are at the terrace bars and restaurants just behind the hotel. Only a few minutes away are the main strip of shops, and Nathan Road. The street night markets are also very close and definately worth a visit. Many a bargain to be had!! There are also some amazing street carts to be found there offering the best vegetable rice ever!! And for about 拢1.50 as well. About 10 minutes walk away is the star ferry harbour which takes you across to the main parts of Hong Kong and Victoria Peak trams.

Breakfast was great, didnt have lunch or dinner. Rooms were very good, very clean, fast wireless was great, and the hotel is on top of a hill with no other building around so their is pretty much no noise at all!Would recomend this hotel for business travelers.

<Content>Great location for Shopping streets Hotel is well situated for Nathan Rd and Temple St markets, and is just a 15 minute walk to the Star Ferry terminal. Room was fine and bed very comfortable, two singles pulled together to make one huge double.Restaurant reasonably priced although there are plenty of other choices nearby for dinner, not so many for breakfast.Airport Exress train to Kowloon and then HK$30 taxi ride made for very quick and easy transfer. Hotel bus transfer a little cheaper but takes longer.

<Content>A nice little hotel We stayed a week at the hotel from Mar 28 to Apr 4. We read the reviews on tripadvisor.com before deciding to book this hotel. We liked this hotel because it is located in Tsimshatsui. We knew about the steep hill, but there was another way through the escalator and a flight of stairs at Knutsford Terrace behind Miramar shopping centre. We were pleasantly surprised by the size of the room, it is quite spacious in Hong Kong standard. The gym was not well equipped but there was no one using it and it was free to all the guests. We also looked into the driving range on the top of the hotel. It costs HKG$70 (less than US$10) for a bucket of golf balls and some clubs so we did not use that particular amenity but there is a decent view up there.During our stay the hotel was running a special on lunch buffet on weekdays and afternoon tea on the weekends. It was 25% off the regular price. We tried the lunch buffet once and we were quite happy with the food.All in all we will definitely return to this hotel again when we visit Hong Kong.

<Content>Not a bad choice... We stayed at the Stanford Hillview with a small group in January 2007. We found the hotel to be a reasonably good chioce overall.When you walk into the lobby the hotel is quite impressive and the counter staff are very helpful. The rooms were average in quality by asian standards and compared to other asian cities they are below par, however Hong Kong is much dearer than it's other asian counterparts, so we really shouldn't judge by these standards. The rooms were kept clean and were well serviced with a stocked minibar. The bathroom was large - though my main concern was a lack of toiletries - they had a magical foaming product that acted as soap, cleanser, shampoo and conditioner! To think I had been wasting my money on four different toiletries when one magical product existed! Apart from that the rooms were fine.The area was quite convenient. We walked most of the time and I can recommend this for active people as you see so much. The front desk staff were very helpful with directions and recommended some great restaurants nearby.Overall we had a very nice stay at the Hillview.

<Content>just the ticket Thank you trip advisor reviewers for your accurate comments regarding this hotel.It is excellent value for money in a decent location.Rooms are not new, but perfectly satisfactory considering that you only sleep in them.A decent buffet breakfast costs only 60HKD.and the whole hotel is kept immaculately clean.The big plus is the price compared to other hotels.I also managed to get a free late check out by booking through Virgin.I scoured the internet looking for a decent hotel at a reasonable price in a decent location.It came down to the Stamford Hillview or the Metropark in Causeway Bay.I think the latter is more luxurious.but I am glad that I stayed on the Kowloon side of HK..and would certainly stay at the Stamford again.If you are visiting HK, try to fit in a boat trip around Aberdeen harbour.Walk away from the boat owner until he agrees a price of 50HKD for the 30 minute trip.

<Content>Excellent Value! we stayed at the Stanford Hillview hotel for 7 nights during lunar new year's celebrations.. the hotel is perfectly located in the center of everything important: restaurants, all kind of stores, supermarkets, MTR  busses. room was kept very clean and unlike in other reviews, we thought it was spacious enough  very comfortable (standard room). worth mentioning that the small fridge in the room was quite usefull. air conditioning in the room was always working, even when we were out, so in daily returns, the room was kept cool  dry. a late check out was offered free of chrge. about the steep hill, there is a simple way to avoid it by taking the 2 segments of the escallator in kimberley Rd.(look for Knutsford steps) and enter B1 hotel floor straight to the hotel's elevators. defenitly would choose this hotel again!

<Content>Ideal hotel. My wife,myself and 2 daughters (21 18) stayed at the stanford hillview for 10 nights Feb 5-16. We all thought it was a fantastic hotel in a great location. We had breakfast included which was a great way to start the day. The hotel itself was always clean and quiet and the staff were always helpful. We actually picked this hotel by using the reviews on Trip advisor. We are glad we did.This hotel might not have 5 bars, pool/spas and expansive lobby area, but it offered a great place to return to at the end of a long day out and about. After 10 nights here we could not find fault with it although my wife thought the beds were a bit firm. The location was perfect. We walked to either 1 of 2 MTR stations,walked to the Star ferry and to the temple street night markets.Shops and restaurants surround the hotel and the Irish pub  The Fine Irishman was a great place for a beer and a feed. All in all a great spot to stay and we would thoroughly recommend this hotel to the tourist looking out for a nice hotel without the big costs.

<Content>A really Nice Hotel We got this through a package deal with travelhouse.co.uk. I will be consice about this hotel as I know it can be a bore reading through reams of text. The following are the opions of my friend and I, and ultimately you will have to make you own mind up wether to saty here:The Staff: Overall they are oaky. Not the most friendliest we have met but they were not rude. Language was a barrier but you will find that throughout most of HK.The Room: Our room was really nice - for a 3 star we were expecting something rather shabby but we were pleasantly surprised by its size (considering it's in HK where space means money!). The beds were very nice, comfy and seemed brand new. The bathroom was nice and clean and they provided all the little things you'd expect.The Location: One thing you have to remember about Stanford Hotel is that it is on a steep hill but its not as bad as the other reviewers have made out, in my opinion. It's a nice healthy walk up - my friend and I NEVER took at taxi up to our hotel. Please consider that we are 26 year old males. I guess if you are the elderly you may want to look elsewhere.Overall: The hotel has a nice rooftop restaurant and gym which is nice. The hotel is in a nice state and the cafe is very nice too. I would defo recommend this hotel for osmeone on a budget or who can live below 5 star :o).

<Content>Great value and location, very clean! This was a great little gem, especially for the price you pay. The rooms were not big, but were actually bigger than we expected for Hong Kong standards. Hotel was quite clean. There's a neat little terrace on the roof with a golf driving cage and places to sit. Staff was helpful. Was near a lot of hub-bub but tucked away from the noisiest parts. A new mall and street of upscale sidewalk restaurants are just a few steps away from the front.

<Content>Noisy Stayed 3 nights - rooms are fine for the price, not large but clean and beds are comfortable - but the background building hum made this the noisiest place I can remember staying in. It wasn't a major drama for us because we were too tired to care at night but it was very noticeable early mornings and I know others would be more concerned.This may have had something to do with our room being beside the lift and may have been more acceptable in floors above the 2nd where we stayed. Don't be put off by others' comments about the hill - it's only a couple of dozen steps and if you are coming from Nathan Rd can be avoided by entering the hotel through the basement lifts via Knutsford Terrace.

<Content>Comfy Room, But... The room was wonderfully cosy and the bed was fabulously comfortable. I cant stop raving about the bed. It was very soft with fresh sheets and really soft comforter. Great for resting your tired body after a whole day of walking around town.The only thing was the location of the hotel: it was on top of a very steep slope.....No one mentioned that! It was really terrible to have to climb the slope when you were already exhausted after a whole day of intensive shopping!The hotel staff were helpful but there were some confusion with the conceige on the basement and the lobby staff.Located near Knutsford, drinks and food were just a few steps away, when u get tired of going up and down the slope just to find food.

<Content>Great little hotel in Hong Kong. Had one night here in between Sheratons and a side trip to Shanghai. Expected the worst as the price is almost too cheap by Hong Kong standards. On entering the room, we were pleasantly surprised, and although quite compact, it was clean and had a good firm bed with very clean linen and cable tv. Bathroom also small but clean and everything worked well. The window even offered a view over the treetops (uncommon in Kowloon)! Staff very helpful. The area is excellent for eating and shopping and the most amazing Indonesian restaurant is ten paces across the road. We even walked back up the hill a second time to eat here when we checked into the Sheraton. This is a good value hotel for the budget-conscious tourist in a very expensive city. It seemed to have high-occupancy rates and lots of Western tourists coming and going. A good choice.

<Content>Lovely hotel in ideal location Just spent 6 pleasant days at the Stanford Hillview. We booked through Asiarooms (no trouble) on a BB option. The room was small but ample for me and my partner. Beds were comfy, bathroom was clean with a powerful shower. A/C worked a treat saving us from Hong Kongs humity. Staff were very helpful and efficient. Breakfast was a mixture of cooked western breakfast, pastries, fruits, yoghurts and some Chinese congees, very nice but wouldnt have taken it if it wasnt included in the room price. The hotel is located down a side street so is a quite haven in busy Tsim Sha Tsui, excellent for Nathan Streets many shops. Its also located less than 5 minutes walk from 2 metro stations and about 15 minutes walk from Temple Streets night markets. The hotel is at the top of a small steep hill but you can go through the basement car park to a lift. We took the airport shuttle (Vigor) to and from the airport costing less than 拢10 pp each way and it drops you off at the bottom of the hill and the bellboy met us there to take our cases.Basically, a great hotel. Thanks for a nice stay.

<Content>Very Happy with hotel Stayed 14th-16th August 2006A$75 ( thru wotif.com)Location- goodFacilities-goodStaff-goodHotel was well located in Kowloon. No probs with hill, not steep at all. Had a room overlooking the beautiful Banyan Tree on observatory rd. 4 star. Food good, service fast and friendly. Internet was very expensive ( A$12 an hour) although front desk offered to tell us where we could get it cheaper. Would stay here again.

<Content>superb choice for Hong Kong This is a great mid-range hotel to stay in for a visit to Hong Kong. As others have already mentioned, the location is almost perfect for Tsim Sha Tsui.....just set away from the busy and noisy Nathan Road but seconds away from Knutsford Terrace. Ignore the stuff about difficulty in getting to the hotel because of the hill......if you cant manage this slope then you really shouldnt be even contemplating visiting HK.Superior rooms are very spacious. Bathrooms excellent with better shower than any US/UK hotel I have stayed in. I only had the hotel breakfast once; although it is 66 dollars it is convenient. 65 dollars/hour broadband access is available, although there is a Pacific Coffee Company nearby (on Nathan Rd just as you turn left from Kimberley) that has free internet if you buy a coffee (supposedly.....many people dont).If you do choose this hotel, then dont get a taxi when you arrive at the airport. It is far easier and cheaper to take the Airport Express to Kowloon Station and then get a shuttle bus to the hotel, or get a taxi from Kowloon station to the hotel. Easiest thing is to buy an Octopus card straight away and load it up for use on the Airport Express.The concierge service is pathetic. You will rarely see them and even when you do they go out of their way to be useless.It takes only 5 minutes to walk to the nearest entry point for Tsim Sha Tsui MTR.....again, if this is too long, should you be in HK? Add another 10 minutes for the Star Ferry Pier and you have all the transportation options you need within 15 minutes walk.If you want a boutique/5 star/stunning harbour view hotel, then this aint it. For cleanliness, quietness and convenience of location for the budget traveller, this is the best.

<Content>Quite nice I got a good price ($82 for a single room). Everything was clean, and the bed had a very nice duvet. The room was tiny, no bureau at all. I am used to Hong Kong hotel rooms, but this was the smallest ever. However, I saw that some of the other rooms were much bigger, so perhaps my small price got me a small room (Room 503). The location is rather inconvenient. I would not stay here again, because I think a no-view room at the Salisbury YMCA makes more sense. But if you end up staying here, don't worry: everything is clean and the staff is fine. One good thing: a 4 p.m. check-out was offered for no extra charge, and the 6 p.m. late check-out cost me something like $15.

<Content>Great value for money We booked this hotel with hotel Travel which had the cheapest price and still has to my knowledge. Prior to departing the hotel arranged the shuttle bus from the airport for us at 80 hkd per person which we thought was great as we knew we could get there hassle free. We were very pleased with the location of the hotel, O.K. so you have to walk a bit to the MTR but you can get to lots of places once you have entered the MTR station and it's airconditioned so you stay out of the humidity on the streets. There is also the added benefit of being in a quiet location, which having heard the traffic on Nathan Rd, was a definite plus. The hotel was excellent value for money. The rooms were a little dated but immaculately clean and as you really only sleep in there it wasn't a problem. We also had a fantastic breakfast there for only 30 HKD. I would advise anyone to stay at the Stanford Hillview, it's a great hotel and won't eat into your budget too much. An excellent hotel.

<Content>Satisfactory, could not complain The hotel is just perfect for the price that we paid. We booked a Standard room thru Expedia for HK$500 per night. When we checked in at the hotel, we got upgraded to Superior room at the same price.Room size was OK, not cramped at all. I thought the beds were great, very comfortable. Fridge was a good plus, to keep our water bottles cold. TV was good, too. There was a channel that showed movies all day long, so my daughter was not bored while we relax in our room during mid-day. Bathroom a bit small, but not too bad.We didn't try the hotel's restaurant. We always had breakfast at Starbucks next door at Knutsford.The hill/steps that lead up to the hotel were not too terrible, they were manageable enough. The 2 times we took a taxi, the driver drove us up to the lobby level (instead of just leaving us on the corner of Kimberly).We booked a Victoria Peak half-day tour with the hotel's tour desk for HK$290/person. I thought that's a slightly higher price than other tour operators i found in discoverhongkong website. But because it's convenient, i decided to go ahead with the hotel's tour recommendation. When we got to the tour bus the next day, we were the only customers. So, it turned out to be a private HK island tour. It was great!We would recommend Stanford Hillview to others that are looking for low-priced accomodations. We had a great time.

<Content>Great value hotel Have just returned from spending 10 nights at this hotel. Good value, terrific location only minutes from most central amenities. Very polite staff, bedding changed every day if you don't stop them! Good breakfast buffet (but could possibly have got cheaper elsewhere). Room basic but comfortable, and even though our flight was not due to depart until late evening they let us stay in our room until 6.00pm on the last day. We were on the 5th floor, but not high enough to avoid the smell of food at all hours. Just round the corner from Knutsford Terrace -great Italian restaurant within 4 minutes tripping distance! Would recommend this hotel to anyone and would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Great location! It was my first time in HK and I stayed at the Stanford Hillview for 5 nights. The location is excellent, only 10 mins walk to the main shopping district and the Star Ferry. The room was larger than I'd expected and staff were polite and helpful, allowing me to check in early at no extra charge, and also looking after my bags when I'd checked out. I did use the hotel's buffet breakfast which gave an ideal start to the day. I got a good rate booking via Expedia and would certainly be happy to stay there again.

<Content>Great location, would stay there again Stayed for 4 nights. Best thing about the hotel is the location, with Knutsford Terrace just round the corner. Some excellent restaurants and plenty of bars. Plus only 10-15 minute walk to the Star Ferry.Rooms are clean and reasonably well equipped - my tour operator had requested an upgrade as I was celebrating my 40th birthday when I was there, but didn't get it.If breakfast isn't included in your booking, don't use the hotel's. There are loads of diner-style restaurants nearby where you can get breakfast at a fraction of the cost.Others have mentioned that the porters come down the hill to take up your luggage - don't know where they were when we arrived, but my poor husband had to haul two cases up the hill, which was exhausting after an 11 hour flight. Overall, though, it's a really good base from which to see all the sights in Hong Kong and I would recommend it.

<Content>Would Stay Here Again We stayed at this hotel for 16 nights, this was our 5th trip to Hong Kong but our first stay here, the room was much larger than we have experienced before, rooms were clean and well equipped, there were no in room safe but the reception staff were happy to access safes in Reception for us. Staff were extremely helpful and late check out was offered withiout additional charge. Location is excellent and entrance through basement just off Knutsford Terrace meant no walking up the hill after a busy day shopping. Buffet breakfast was good but try to get this included in your room rate as it is probably not worth what they charge for on a daily basis.Will definatley consider staying here again.
