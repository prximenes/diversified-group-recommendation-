<Content>A 5 Star Faultless Stay We stayed for a couple of nights at the Concorde and were mighty impressed. Well located for the zoo, shopping and sight seeing buses as well as a number of other Berlin attractions. Every member of staff that we came into contact with was helpful and attentive without being too intrusive. Our room was spacious and the beds extremely comfortable with high count cotton sheets. Despite being just off the main drag/shopping street we had a quiet nights sleep and certainly could not hear any of the other guests or activities else where. We spent a good few hours, after a day at the zoo, in the bar enjoying the cocktails designed by the head barman (really nice guy, sorry I can't remember his name), they were great and he shares a taste for good Gin. In fact every member of staff that we came into contact with was helpful and attentive without being too intrusive. The breakfast is something to behold for sure and is well worth making time for the excellent spread. There really is just about everything that you could possibly want on offer, from champagne to smoothies. The fried eggs were spot on. In summary, we've stayed in our fair share of 5* hotels, The Concorde is certainly up there with the best of them.

<Content>Glad we stayed Eventually stayed at the Hotel Concorde after much indecision but had no regrets . It is literally across the street from the Swiss Hotel but we availed of a very competitive 3 night rate on the hotel website so opted for the Concorde instead. We booked in and out with ease and all sfaff we encountered were courteous and helpful. Our delux room was spacious,stylishly decorated and very comfortable. We did not avail of the breakfast buffet which was crazy money per person but in terms of accommodation you could not fault the hotel. It is very centrally located and easy to find. The excellent Berlin transport system ensures that nowhere is too far away. Its a wonderful city and we adore the less frenetic and more genuine Christmas atmosphere it provides.

<Content>Great place. I'll be back. First I should note that I was a female traveling alone. I wanted some place with all the amenities and good security, but also a place where I could be more or less anonymous if I wanted to be. I got everything I wanted. The staff was first rate, friendly and efficient, always kind and helpful but never uncomfortably familiar. People have remarked that the staff is great on this website and I found it to be very true. I have only great things to say about the hotel employees. My room was on the 6th floor and at night I could see the Kaiser Wilhelm church and the Mercedes sign lit up like the moon. My room was gorgeous, super clean and quite large. The bathroom was fabulous. It had both a bathtub and a shower. The bath products were Annick Goutal! There is a small gym and a business center with computers and a printer. I never had to wait to use one which was nice because I found I could not freely surf the web from my laptop in my room due to some some situation (I didn't really understand the explanation) that blocked most sites. I only mention this for informational purposes. It didn't impact my stay tremendously.Anyway, that's all. I enjoyed it thoroughly and would go back in a second. It is a great value.

<Content>First class Concorde 11th December 2008Went to Berlin for the xmas markets, which are plentiful and quite enjoyable, some of them were more like eating festivals but others very good. Stayed at the Concorde which i feel is very well positioned, close to bus and u-bahn stops, plenty of good restaurants in vicinity, from the moment we got out of the taxi our stay was perfect, i could not fault the hotel,we had an executive room which is well worth the extra, staff are extremely friendly and helpful especially in the club lounge, look forward to our return.NICKIM

<Content>First Class Hotel The Concorde is a modern hotel just off the main drag in western Berlin. In terms of location, it's walking distance from the Kufurstendam, a major shopping street. The location is generally quiet, although a higher floor helps minimize the street noise. The lobby is unimpressive but functional. Stayed in a basic room. It was fine for one but would probably be crowded for two (as there was only one chair). There is a flat screen TV with many channels but not much for Americans other than CNN. The bathroom is spacious, with separate tub and shower, two sinks, and nice amenities, such as bathrobes. Bed was comfortable. Internet access is free (!) and easy, although wired (they will provide a wire). You can also access the internet via many computers in the business center.Breakfast is very nice with omelet/crepe/waffle station and almost everything you could want. However, at 24 Euros, the price may be a bit steep for non-Europeans. Dinner in the hotel restaurant was very good and the service was excellent. There is also a nice bar with a spacious sitting area -- great for relaxing with friends or business colleagues.The concierge consistently recommended excellent restaurants and site-seeing. If you're here for tourism, note that the hotel is about a 20-minute cab ride from the Brandenburg Gate and other major tourist attractions.The only negative came the last day when I wanted to send some items home via overnight mail. The business center hostess had never heard of FedEx. The concierge had, but the hotel could not produce a single FedEx (or other overnight company) box. So, I ended up carrying the items with me.Overall, I would highly recommend the Concorde for business travelers and for tourists, provided you understand the location of the hotel is not near most tourist attractions.

<Content>Lovely Hotel, pity about the lack of professionalism I am just back for a city break with 3 friends in Berlin. We decided to treat ourselves and stay in the Hotel Concorde, reviews on trip advisor were very positive and the hotel website was very impressive. The location was excellent for shopping and tour buses. We arrived at the hotel Thursday afternoon and were greeted by a very pleasant man at reception. He told us he needed to check something in our reservation and invited us to a welcome drink at the bar. We accepted. Next we were told that the reservation system they have is very bad and 'sh!t happens'so our 2 rooms had been double booked. Not to worry, they had found 2 rooms for us in the neighbouring Swisshotel and to compensate they had 2 suites for us for the friday and saturday nights. The hotel limo would come to pick us up whenever we were finished our drinks. We wondered why we needed a limo to cross the road...but continued to finish our drinks and decided it wasn't so bad. This way we get to check out another 5 star hotel AND stay in the suites. Our friend at the front desk then disappeared and we were taken by car to the Hotel Steinberger (?). Another 5 star hotel. The staff there were pretty rude to us and the rooms we were given were more like those in a Travelodge or Park Inn. There was a very nasty smell in my room, but we thought the suites at the Concorde would make up for it and it wasn't the Steinbergers fault Concorde had overbooked. The next morning we checked out of the Steinberger and our bags were being sent by the concierge back to the Concorde. There were a few more guests of the Concorde also having luggage transferred back so this is obviously a regular occurance. We headed off for a days sightseeing. We arrived back at the Concorde that evening and were told our 'rooms' were ready and we had access to the Club Etoile. This comes as standard with suites and executive rooms. We went to our rooms on the 8th floor. Myself and my sister have stayed in quite a few 5 star hotels and immediately knew that these were not suites. The front desk let us to believe that they were and given the condition of rooms in the Steinberger we couldn't be sure. On checking the hotel website this morning I now know we were given Deluxe rooms, one step up from what we had originally reserved. The hotel is beautiful and the front desk staff are very obliging, don'tget me wrong, but there were one or two other small incidents that make me question the professionalism of staff at this hotel. On the second day our room was made up my robe disappeared.I know this because I had used it the day before and as you only get one towel which is not so big you need the robe. My sisters robe was where she had left it. When out rooms were turned down for the night, only one bed had a chocolateleft on it. This may seem petty but we did joke about how we weren'tgiven a suite and now we weren't even being given a sweet! I later heard that one of my friends in the adjoining room had had a dirty cleaning cloth left on top of her pyjamas. I later saw the cloth and it was disgusting. The hotel is perfectly located and very tastefully decorated. If you are willing to take the chance that your reservation is not going to be double booked and the services you receive are not what you have been told, then this is a great place to stay. However, we most certainly left feeling short changed and I have stayed in better 3 and 4 star hotels.

<Content>Excellent hotel Perfect location on Kudamm near the Zoologische Garten Rail and Metro Station, with all shopping icons arround. Vapiano restaurant is below the hotel which means a lot after sightseeing Berlin. Rooms are large, well equipped, soundproofed. Bed was excellent. Only good words about the staff, always frendly and with good advices. Perfect hotel for business and leisure.

<Content>A wonderful stay! We stayed at Concorde Hotel for 7 days during August 2008. The overall experience was excellent! The hotel stuff was very friendly and willing to help in any way. We booked the Deluxe Room (1 King Size Bed) and were given for free an extra bed for our 7-year old son. The room (930) was extremely spacious with huge windows and a comfortable bathroom (double wash basin - shower - bath tub). The breakfast was royal with an ultra wide variety of things to eat and drink. The location of the hotel was very convenient: a few meters to Kurf眉rstendamm, 5-mins walk to the zoo U-bahn and S-bahn and the Zoologischer Garten. Also 5-mins walk to 100 and 200 bus station on Budapesterstrasse. These bus lines take you to the most popular sites of Berlin (24 hours a day).Note: Learn about the Berlin Welcome Card and use it!Next time we visit Berlin we will stay at Concorde for sure!

<Content>There's nothing more you could want Phenomenal breakfast and superfriendly staff!Just came back from a weekend stay at the Concorde. The hotel is in the middle of Berlin, at the Kudamm and within walking distance of Tiergarten, Zoo and other tourist attractions. But all the walking to tourist attractions won't help you coping with your figure and the breakfast buffet: It's one of the most diversified and various ones I've seen so far! Staff is extremely friendly and helpful, the rooms are quite spacious (even the bathrooms) and clean. There's not a lot more than you could want.

<Content>Truely 5 stars hotel HelloStayed in the Concorde for 5 nights in July 2008 with my wife.The rooms - very big and very cleanBreakfast - one of the best I have ever hadstaff - very polite and helping. Also used concierge services for booking restaurants, trip recommendations etc.No film channel only CNN BBC etc. renting a movie costs 14 euros  minibar is expensive as well. but that's the same in every hotel.Location: west berlin.Near by: (walking distance)Kudam street (shopping for wealthy people)KadeVe shopping center (good for women...)Story of berlin museum (in the Kudam passage. includes a bizare tour to an underground atomic shelter built during the cold war)The ruined curcheBuses 100, 200 right under the hotel will take you (10-15 minutes drive) to brandenburg gate, Reichstag (prepare to wait in line), Holocaust memorial, Unter den Linden (10 minutes walk distance to museums island), Alexanderplatz, Culture Center. M29 bus wil take you to checkpoint Charlie, Berlin museum, Juwish museum.One thing - the hotel rooms faces 2 streets - Joachimsta  Augsburger. Rooms facing Joachimsta are a bit more noisy at weekends nights since the succesful Maxim club is right under.No sounds of music but only some noises of croud outside the club. Our room was facing that direction and it did not bother us at all. But, maybee you are more sensetive than us.Overall: I recommend. Would gladly come back.

<Content>Excellent Hotel, Great Location This is a chic, sophisticated hotel with a great location just off the Kurfurstendamm in Berlin. The location, on Augsbergerstrasse, means that there is virtually no noise, but the hotel is literally about 100 feet from the Kurfurstendamm. The deluxe rooms are beautifully designed and above average size for a European hotel. The bathrooms are outstanding, with separate bath, shower, and toilet. There is free internet access in all the rooms (either wired or wireless) and free use of computers in the business center. We got an outstanding value--136 Euros per night for a deluxe room in July using the hotel's website booking engine. The concierges at the hotel are excellent and knowledgeable. The front desk staff are friendly and competent. The doormen and bellmen are very friendly and polite. All in all, this is a great hotel and an outstanding value.Here are a few recommendations. First, there is a great Turkish restaurant a few blocks down Augsbergerstrasse called Haris. Second, Vapiano's restaurant, a chain of Italian restaurants in Germany, is right next door to the hotel and offers good food at very inexpensive prices (for Berlin). Third, the hotel is right at the Ku'damm U-bahn station, but it's usually better to walk the three blocks to the Berlin Zoo station, where there is a much larger selection of U-bahn and S-bahn trains.

<Content>Horrible Treatment I have never been treated so poorly by hotel staff. Let me start by saying that I had pre-payed for 2 rooms for 3 nights beginning on the 9th of June 2008. We had just arrived from a long haul flight from Vancouver Canada, we were dead tired and travelling with a toddler. When we arrived at the hotel I was told by the check-in lady that there was a problem which was nothing bad and that her colleage was coming to talk to me. This colleage was the assistant front manager named Antje Kuschel. We were informed by Antje that the hotel had made an overbooking error and would have to relocate to another hotel in the area. All of my efforts to explain that I had booked the Cocorde because I specifically wanted a new, modern hotel with large rooms were in vain. I was told that the hotel was all full, and inspite of the fact that we had pre-paid to stay there, we would have to move. There was a convention taking place in the hotel at the time (Hewlett Packard). After buying us complimentary drinks in the restaurant, we were sent to the Streigenberger Hotel down the street where we were told that we were being given deluxe rooms, an apparent upgrade from the standard rooms which we had booked at the Concorde.The rooms at the Steigenberger were terrible. The beds were queen sized (not the king which I had booked at the Concorde), the rooms old and tired and the curtains did not cover the window and had big holes in the blackout. None of this was the fault of the Steigenberger, they made every attempt to accomodate us and find rooms which made us happy. Antje never checked back to see if we were indeed happy or made any effort to accompany us to the new hotel. We were simply dumped there.That evening I returned to the Concorde and spoke with Antje once again. She was made aware of my unhappiness with the substituted hotel rooms. She apologized profusely and said that she would absolutely get us moved back into the Concorde the next night. I asked twice if she had our contact info, she said yes, she would get a message to us at the Steigenberger ASAP. Long story short, I NEVER heard from her again in spite of checking front desk messages and voicemail repeatedly. Two days later I returned to the desk at the Concorde in order to ask Antje what had happened and was informed that she had been off for the last two days.In my opinion, the Concorde never had any intention of attempting to make the situation right. The whole experience was horrible and ruined our trip to Berlin. This hotel seriously needs to rehtink how it handles its booking process and customer relations.

<Content>Perfect Concorde as usual We have stayed in Concorde for 4th or 5th time already and it is definitely our favourite in Berlin. I know pretty all 5-star hotels in Berlin, but Concorde, and Swissote just across the street has the best value for money. Location, rooms, services, everything just perfect. I must say, I have never tried restaurants there, but the bar is really good.

<Content>Best 4 stars hotel in Berlin If you're still browsing reviews to make your decision, look no more.Very good location, excellent service, parking available. Clean and modern. The whole staff, from Maid to Manager, deserves an award. Everybody shows helpful, respectful attitude. Multilingual.Concierge recommended the hotel restaurant but since we wanted to do some walk, he mentioned a place for diner, 6 blocks away, off the touristic circuit: Die Eselin von A. Good choice! Loved the Wiener schnitzel with white asparagus. Hotel breakfast was pricey but worth it. We certainly recommend this hotel.Eva  Fabiano, stayed 2 nights during the 2nd week of May 2008.

<Content>Unbeatable Service at this modern hotel Stayed for a conference in October. Absolutely first class service from the moment I stepped out of the taxi to be greeted by the concierge to the moment I left when, as I stepped into the taxi, the same guy asked me whether there was anything about my stay that could be improved. I couldn't think of anything - which says it all.Rooms are huge, modern and very comfortable. Room service was spot on every time and housekeeping excellent.I know this is a 5 star hotel - but I have stayed in so-called 5 star hotels before and received 2 star service. This hotel lives up to it's billing.Highly recommended

<Content>A fine hotel We began our Elbe River cruise with 3 days at the Concorde in Berlin. There were no disappointments. The hotel is worthy of 4 to 5 stars. It's location is not the most convenient for the tourist sights but is very close to the Underground station. Then rooms are clean and well appointed The staff is polite and well trained. The breakfast is awesome. What more can we say? A bit pricey, but so is all of Berlin. We would probably not stay again but only because of the location.

<Content>Great stay We stayed two nights at the Concorde Berlin for a long weekend, and I must say that we enjoyed it intensely. We arrived around 10 am and received a warm welcome. The room was not ready, but we could check-in and leave our luggage with the bell-captain. The hotel is new and modern, Zen-like style; the atmosphere is cool but by no means unpleasant. When we returned around 2 pm we could go to our room and the luggage was already there. The room was very spacious, stylish with a very comfortable bed and a flat screen TV. The bath room had a separate shower room, a toilet cab卯n, a bath tub and two sinks with ample space to put one's toileteries. Our room was facing the back yard which was not so appealing, but being in a city one doesn't really bother (it was quiet). Breakfast was sumptuous and it was difficult to decide what to eat as everything looked so inviting and tasty. Service was excellent throughout the hotel, check-out efficient and corteous. We had an absolutely fabulous time at the Concorde and will certainly stay there again, the location is convenient just five minutes away from train station Zoologischer Garten. If you are looking for a good restaurant, try Bocca di Bacco at Friedrichstrasse; not cheap but great food.

<Content>Better hotels in Berlin than the Concorde I stayed a weekend in Hotel Concorde in middle of August. I booked this hotel as it was said to have the most spacious rooms in Berlin. I could not believe that the de luxe rooms really had 50 square meter. Because of all the wood and the outlay of rooms, rooms seem much smaller. Staff at reception is not friendly - more on the side of efficient - how can you enjoy your stay if you are not welcome. This seems a perfect hotel for businesspeople or groups but not for individuals. Although the architecture is phantastic, this hotel is not my No 1 choice - undoubtedly this is the Hotel de Rome. There are much nicer hotels for the money in Berlin! And Kurf眉rstendamm is not the No 1 location, this is Gendarmenmarkt. Here are a lot of hotels and mostly better. I would not go there again!

<Content>Great hotel, great value Great hotel for the money, large, high spec, modern and trendy rooms which are spotlessly clean.Hotel staff couldn't have been more helpful, both in terms of hotel info, but also info about what to see and do in Berlin.Location-wise, it's a fair walk from the main sights in the city (apart from the cool shops, which are just a few blocks away), however to get to the main sights, you walk through the Tiergarten, and believe me, this isn't a hardship.

<Content>Couldn't be happier We stayed here for three days and it was as good as the other reviews suggest.The room (delux) was very spacious and the bathroom was fantastic. The pics, candid and on the hotel web site, are exactly what you get. No unpleasant surprises.The staff are the best I have encountered, extremely polite and will do anything to help.The hotel is in a great location with lots to see and do within a short walk. Go to the zoo, a 5 min walk away, it's a great day out.Would I go again? Without any doubt at all.

<Content>Great Hotel The Concorde is a modern hotel in a street just off the Ku'Dam.I stayed in a deluxe room and it was huge. Very well appointed,nice duvets great bathroom. Stayed on the 8th floor but this was no problem as the lifts were very swift.Great hotel to spend 3 days in, just a shame Berlin isnt a great city to spend 3 days in.

<Content>Modern, sleek, efficient hotel We visited Berlin in August 2006 and chose the Concorde for its location (just off KuDamm, short walk from Kaiser Wilhelm Gedachtnis Kirche) and spacious rooms. Our room was vast, holding a kingsize+ double and a full-size single with loads of floor space. Fixtures  fittings to usual German high standard. The candid photos already posted tell it all. The hotel is essentially business class; some visitors might find it impersonal. Reception staff were friendly and efficient.Didnt sample the restaurant apart from breakfast which was a comprehensive hot  cold buffet. Can't think of anything that wasn't included but it seemed rather expensive (21 euros each).We would definitely consider staying there again.

<Content>Great quality hotel Stayed at the concorde for 3 nights.What can I say, relatively new hotel opened Nov 2005 and it's absolutely immaculate. Reception, large, staff efficient.Bedrooms good size, bathrooms fantastic. Large bath, separate shower room. Usual free toiletries. Place was spotless and room service did great job each day - even gave fresh robes once they'd been used, unlike some other places I've been that leave you them for the stay!Breakfast an amply stocked buffet with free champagne. Room service, efficent and great quality.what more can I say , fantastic hotel would stay again anytime.

<Content>One of the best For our first visit to Berlin we were looking for a comfortable hotel, not too expensive and central located.This hotel met all our wishes. Good and friendly reception, free use of sauna, steamcabine and fitness facilities. Spacious room with a comfortable bathroom (with seperate bath and shower) and also a seperate toilet. Our deal also included a free voucher for 2 coctails at the hotel bar and breakfast. Quality bed and little chocolates (from a famous choclate brand: Lint) on your pillow.For a price of 200 euro for 2 nights. What bargain!F. Man, Rotterdam, The Netherlands

<Content>Excellent choice Good rapor with staff from the first phone call to the end of our visit. Great hotel with comfortable,clean rooms and all the comforts to make a long stay enjoyable. Close to the Ku Damm and lots to see within walking distance and easy access to the efficient transit system. Definitely would recommend to anyone and will return on our next visit to Berlin.The buffet was pricey (22E)so went to the Department store across the street(6th floor) and had a great breakfast for 2 E.SDZander

<Content>Loved this hotel This hotel was excellent in every way except for the building work going on. It would have been good to have been told about this. On our last morning at 7.30am I had to ring reception and ask them to get the builders to stop hammering, I was told no one was working until 9am but they would check. When they rang back they told me maybe it was someone in the rooms, I was getting annoyed and asked them to send someone to the 5th floor, which they did and the hammering stopped for another hour. The building work did spoil our 5 day stay there a little as jack hammers went throughout the day on several occasions. But I must mention the consiege he went out of his way to be helpful organising a dental appointment for my husband, booking a boat tour for us at the last minute and getting us a cab so we were on time. Overall without the building works I would give this hotel the highest rating. It was also located near the zoo station which was easy to work out and take us around the city.

<Content>Hard to Breathe Here I am staying at this hotel as I write this. When I made the reservation I requested a non smoking room and had at least 4 subsequent email communications with the hotel informing them that I needed to have a non smoking room for health reasons. (If you don't like smoke you may want to stay away from Berlin!) I was given a room that did not smell of smoke but the hallway and lounge at the end of the hall were smoke infested. I called to compain and asked for a room on a non smoking floor and was told that my room was a non smoking room on a smoking floor. Needless to say I moved my room to a non smoking floor but I am still annoyed that this hotel is so insensitive to people needing or wanting clean air. The manager I spoke with was rather surly. The fron desk agents are very nice but they do not seem to want to rock the boat to assist a guest who is not happy. I am at a convention and can not get out of this hotel because of prepayment issues as well as no other hotel availability but I am not very happy at this hotel AT ALL,

<Content>Excellent stay After reading great reviews about this hotel on TripAdvisor, I decided to book a 3 night stay over the Easter weekend. The hotel wasin excellent condition, the room we were given (on the 10th floor) was quite spacious and had everything we needed and the staff extremely helpful. It was booked on a room-only basis and breakfast was quite expensive- 22 Euros each - but it was the most comprehensive buffet breakfast I've ever had! Transport from the airport was very easy - X9 bus to Bahnhof Zoo then a very short walk to the hotel. Will certainly stay there again whenever I'm next in Berlin.

<Content>faultless! My husband and I stayed at this hotel for four nights over the Easterholidays and I have to agree with the other reviewers - it was fantastic! From start to finish, we were made to feel really special,all the staff were extremely courteous and very helpful when asking for advice on what to see and do in the City. The hotel is in a great location, close to a couple of underground stations and the shopping on the K'damm is very exclusive, so have your credit card ready.We didn't have breakfast in the hotel, but found a fantastic cafe nearby called 'Marche' which offered a buffet selection of fresh baking, cereals, fruits, hot food etc at reasonable prices. Althoughwe only went there for breakfast, they offer an 'all you can eat' buffet deal for 11.90E which was great value.We booked this hotel via lastminute.com which was extremely good value. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone!

<Content>It is all about service From the moment of arrival my girlfriend and myself we were made to feel welcome by the Concierge team. Doors opened for us, always acknowledged weather in the lobby, arriving or leaving the hotel. If we were going out for dinner in the evening we were told to have a good night and welcomed with a smile upon our return. Having worked in five star hotels I know about service and what to look for. Can鈥檛 say enough good things, Thank you.

<Content>Simply Excellent Hotel in Wonderful Location TripAdvisor has now become our trusted method of Hotel selection and came through with full credit yet again. Based on other reviews we arranged a party of ten for a weekend in Berlin and chose Hotel Concorde. This proved to be the best decision of the trip. It is simply an excellent hotel, with efficient friendly service from registration through to check-out. Over a few days I do not think we had even the slightest cause for less than full marks. I suppose some may find the lobby/bar a little clinical but it is essentially good modern design which resonates throughout the hotel. The rooms are bright and spacious - with excellent bathroom facilities including a walk-in wet-room shower, separate bath and twin wash-basins. I know the hotel is relatively new - but the standard of workmanship and quality of finish is exemplary. The beds are excellent and provide firm but soft support which is enviable. Quality of the bed linen is again of the highest quality. Our rooms were on the eighth floor and were extremely quiet.Breakfast was again without fault with an extensive range to suit all tastes. I have read criticism previously regarding access via a communal lobby outside the meeting rooms which is tainted by cigarette smoke. This is true, but it was not a major issue for myself - and I am very opposed to smoking.The Doormen were extremely friendly - as were all hotel staff throughout our stay. We have just returned and have already received a customer satisfaction survey Email from the hotel - which reflects their interest in keeping high standards.The hotel location is wonderful - just off Kurfurstendam - which is about as good as it gets. We can't wait to go back. I doubt if any other hotel in Berlin beats the Concorde for quality at a reasonable price.And finally, we watched Ireland win the six nations rugby clash with England. The perfect weekend.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Service, Very Convenient I recently stayed for a week in the hotel during a company conference, which was also located in the hotel. The standard rooms are very well laid out, with a separate dressing area near the bathroom, and a desk. The hotel is new, clean, well designed and has some nice touches. On Valentine's Day, every guest received a red heart shaped helium balloon with a chocolate to weigh them to the floor. The lobby bar staff are very friendly, and the atmosphere very congenial. The breakfast buffet was top class, and the downstairs restaurant fairly good. Its well located near the Ku'Damm and close to transportation, Ka De We and other stores. There are some really nice restaurants in walking distance - especially Diekmanns (spelling?). I might not stay here on personal travel - although it was very nice - but it was a fantastic hotel for business travel. and cheap!

<Content>Luxury Hotel 18 of us arrived very early on a Friday morning, extremely smooth check in for a large group. The decor of Hotel is modern and simple but very nice. Staff are extremely helpful, Nothing was too much trouble, After we had checked in we had coffee in the bar and we were hungry but nothing on the menu apealled to us so they brought us out platters of delicious pastries. The room I stayed was large with a fantastic shower and bath. The bed was big and very comfortable. There was a large plasma screen billboard close to my window, which flickered at night and was a little annoying. Very Centrally located.close to the Ku'damm, Zoo Railway station and UBahn stations. This hotel is ideal for a luxury break in Berlin.

<Content>WOW...What a hotel! I booked at the Concorde after trawling through loads of other reviews. My husband and I had a 3 day break in berlin...we loved the hotel so much we ended up staying there the majority of the time.Check in was very smooth, Check in person was informative and friendly. Double room had bags of space, a luxury modern feel. Bed was very comfortable - lots of wood furniture. Bathroom was large with bath - walk in shower seperate toilet and double sinks.Complimentary toiletries, bathrobe and slippers. Mini bar was of a good standard - 4 euros for soft drink - it even had a can of oxygen in it! ( one wonders why?)LCD screen and great selection of movies. Special price of 27 euros for 24hrs unlimited use of all movies and internet. Personally I thought it was very good value.On the Kudamm - shopping galore - short walking distance to subway, and short train ride to every sight seeing place there is. I paid on average 拢90 per night with Hotels.com and would recoomend EVERYONE to stay here.

<Content>First class luxury hotel I stayed in the Concorde for three nights on a sight-seeing / Christmas markets break with my husband and mum and loved the hotel. The rooms were large with everything we needed and the service was second to none. The sheets and towels were changed every day , as was the robe my mum used . The breakfasts were excellent with a huge choice and , as a previous reviewer mentioned, champagne !The hotel staff were extremely friendly and helpful. One even pointed out the supermarket opposite the hotel where we could buy water, beer etc at a fraction of the cost of the mimibar.The only thing I could find to even slightly criticise is the style of the hotel. Its very new and modern and may to some feel a wee bit bland. Its in a great location just off Ku'damm which is a great street for shopping and , in December, is beautifully lit up and decorated. There is a great Christmas market on Ku'damm at the Gedachtniskirsche and a fabulous department store , Ka de We, which has a great food court on the top floor.If you are sightseeing I recommend the hop-on-hop off buses which are great value and take you round all the main sites.Overall, I'd thoroughly recommend the Concorde and if I go back to Berlin again thats where I'll stay.

<Content>Fantastic Luxury Hotel Stayed in this hotel for a weekend break from 24th to 27th of November. The hotel is only a 200m walk from Zoo Station and just off the Ku'Dam. Very convenient for shopping and the sites of West Berlin. It is a bit of a hike to the sites in the east but the hotel is close to the metro (U-Bahn).The rooms are huge and airy with full ceiling to floor windows, a king sized bed, safe, mini-bar, robes, slippers and LCD TV.Breakfast was nicely presented with a large choice (breads cold meats, cooked breakfast, champagne!!!).Couldn't recommend this hotel enough.

<Content>Ich Liebe Concorde! My boyfriend suprised me with a trip to Berlin for my birthday and was sooooo suprised by the Concorde! To say this hotel is brilliant really is a understatement! The doorstaff where friendly and very helpful, taking the suitcases to the room before we got there! I was a bit worried before I got there as I have heard people say that hotel staff are rude, but they where nothing but helpful to us! The room was huge and beautiful, especially the bathroom! HUGE bath and a walk in shower - what more can you ask for?!we never used the resturant or bar so cant comment on those but we did have room service one night which was lovely!I was also suprised by how beautiful the city was and how friendly the people where! I would definatley recommend this hotel to others and the city. It is in a good location 5mins from the bombed church and kudam plus close to transport to the east of the city. I cant recomend this hotel high enough!

<Content>Excellent choice Just returned from a 4 day trip (alas, too short!) to beautiful Berlin. The Concorde is an absolutely fantabulous hotel choice and - I'll say it right up front - the only reason I'm giving it 4 and not 5 stars is the bedding.I have back problems and prefer a soft mattress. The beds at the Concorde are firm. However, reception told me that they would take care of me during my next visit and provide some sort of cushion to go on top of the mattress that'll make it feel less hard. I was glad to hear that because I would definitely want to go back.The hotel is situated in a prime location, just steps from such famous sites and landmarks as the Ku'damm, Bahnhof Zoo, Ged盲chtniskirche, Tiergarten etc. Transportation is very easy from there as well. Buses, trains, and taxis, all right there. All the attractions this wonderful city has to offer (such as Potsdamer Platz, Brandenburger Tor, Museumsinsel, Gendarmenmarkt, Kanzleramt/Reichstag, Hauptbahnhof etc. etc.) can easily be reached within 10 minutes.Another wonderful pluspoint is that the hotel never felt crowded. You could keep an air of anonymity and not be bothered by other hotel guests. Sleek, elegant, modern design throughout. The rooms are very spacious, so are the bathrooms. Seperate shower and tub. Two sinks even in the smallest standard room (40 sq m). Nice amenities too.Very small but immaculately clean and modern wellness area with two treadmills, stationary bike, and ellipse trainer. Steam room and sauna. Tiny locker room with one shower. Complimentary fruit and water.Business center with complimentary internet access (at the front desk, you can receive a password for one of the six computer terminals).Concierge was nice and helpful, but unfortunately absent too often (that could be bothersome).One or two members of the front desk staff seem to have slept through their hospitaliy management seminar on customer relations, but overall, the personnel in the hotel was definitely very nice, polite, and helpful.Food was awesome on all occasions. Breakfast at the St. Germain offered scrumptious, varied choices (buffet with service - and they do cook up anything you could dream of). Lunch and/or dinner at Le Faubourg imaginative and heavenly delicious.Overall: wonderful experience. Can recommend it to anyone! :-)

<Content>Loved the Hotel Concorde We were not disappointed on booking the Concorde Hotel in Berlin after reading excellent reports on tripadvisor(--). ( opened November 2005) Just spent 5 days there. Staff extremely attentive and courteous in a very professional manner .We had a deluxe room which was huge - very modern and extremely comfortable. Large bathroom with double sinks, bath, separate shower room and separate toilet. Large excellent buffet breakfast with everything you would require to set you up for the day. Breakfast was included in our price. Very peaceful hotel - 5 minute walk from Zoological Garten Railway Station and shops. Easy public transport access to East Berlin for the major sights.Would certainly stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Great home base Just returned from a one-month trip to Berlin. My husband had work in Berlin, so we took a few side trips, returning each time to the Hotel Concorde. We found that the hotel made an excellent home base for us as the staff were so friendly and helpful. We stored bags at the hotel while on each side trip, and every time we returned the bags were already in our room. Everyone was courteous, friendly, helpful and very polite.The room was large and comfortable--the bathroom was HUGE! The breakfast buffet is fabulous--lots to choose from and these great teapots that keep your tea hot the entire time. Another perk was the free use of the business center, complete with printer and copier, and the free high speed internet in the room.We absolutely enjoyed our stay and would not hesitate to stay here again!

<Content>New location in the old heart of Western Berlin The Concorde Hotel is situated at the famous Kranzler-Eck at the Kurf眉rstendamm, the old heart of (Western) Berlin. The Swissotel is located vis-a-vis, the entrances of both five star hotel are facing each other.Compared to this hotel, the Concorde might be the smarter choice. The rooms are more spacious and well equipped. No espresso machine like in the Swissotel, but a free an fast internet connection (LAN-Cable available at the quick responding concierge desk) on the rooms. Spacious and luxurious bathroom, great open closet and a expensive but well fitted minibar.State-of-the-art design meets a friendlly and helpfully staff. Good rates via Internet travelling-companies! You should take some minutes for searching the Internet and you will find a great value for your money. Ideal location when you have to work or visit the Western part of Germanys capital, not so good if you want to get to the political centre Berlin-Mitte. But the great and world famous department store KaDeWe can be reached within a six minutes walk!
