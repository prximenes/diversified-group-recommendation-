<Content>Very charming hotel at a great location I had a romantic getaway in Paris with my boyfriend and we stayed in this hotel for a few nights. We had a great time. The hotel is really beautifully decorated. Great taste and attention to detail (I absolutely loved the painting in the bedroom). Lovely atmosphere and very nice staff. The location of the hotel is perfect.I would strongly recommend this hotel.

<Content>NIce hotel in Paris I loved this little hotel in Paris. It is located in a quiet street, close to Les Galeries Lafayette. There are only 28 rooms. They are small but very clean, with contemporary decoration. The bed was excellent and the bathroom and shower were very good too. The people at the reception were also very helpful and polite.I highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Clean and Comfy I took my friend to Paris for her 40th birthday and we stayed at Hotel Chaplain Rive Gauche. Our room was clean and the beds extremely comfortable for European standards. The minibar offered a large bottle of Evian, cans of coke, coke light and juice each day, and it was free. The staff understood and spoke English very well. Continental breakfast was provided in the morning offering tea, coffee, juice, selection of pastries, croissants and hard-boiled eggs. A very nice, relaxing and fun stay!

<Content>Great Stay in a Vibrant area This hotel is a gem in a great area! First off, we arrived by train (Subway/Metro) and walked for about 2 minutes to get to the hotel. It is right off the Vavin Metro stop. Once arriving, you will be able to tell this is a small and personal hotel. The lobby is small and entirely managed from the front desk. Meaning, the front desk, the small free internet corner, and the breakfast dining area is all within view and management from the front desk. It's modern, beautifully decorated, and in a word - quaint. Check in was easy. We went into the elevator and went up to our room on the fourth floor. Let me tell you about this elevator because it says four persons max allowed. It is the tiniest elevator I have ever seen. We had to go separately up on the first trip because we couldn't fit in there together with our bags. Really funny how small it is. Not a complaint at all, just SMALL. We got up to our room which is small but perfect. It is a cozy, comfortable room with a flat screen TV, safe for valuables, nice bed, enough lighting, free wireless internet, adjustable AC/heater, great toiletries, nice views, and just great comfort overall. We loved the room! It was great to just chill in the room after a long day sightseeing. The area that this hotel is in is perfect. It is in the area where the Crepe restaurant/stops are abundant and the best in all of Paris. There is an awesome bar right on the corner next to this hotel. It looks like an Irish pub, but it is one of the coolest, most stylish bars we have ever visited. We walked to the Eiffel Tower from here. We walked to the Tour Maine-Montparnasse which is a 5 minute walk. (Go here to see all of Paris from the rooftop. Tallest building in the city.) The staff at the hotel is great. The location is perfect. Best of all the Metro stop is right there so you can get around with ease. This hotel was perfect and we loved it!

<Author>thatsmystuff
<Content>Thoroughly enjoyable This is a three-star Parisian hotel with an edge. Fresh, modern decor, friendly and helpful staff and an atmosphere worthy of this city. It is ideally located for the Montparnasse/St Germain area, close to the crossing of avenues Montparnasse and Raspail, with easy access to the metro, as well. There is plenty of nightlife but less of the unsavory elements than you might find closer to the Gare Montparnasse. Admittedly, the standard room is not much larger than your average three-star room anywhere else, and you may find you are paying about as much for it as you would for a standard four-star business hotel, but the differences are palpable. Windows in both bathroom and bedroom, both giving onto a decorated inner courtyard, and the cyclamens in window-boxes outside, a tasteful decor along with modern amenities and quiet charm. The free minibar (soft drinks) and internet access are good perks. The bed was too hard for my taste and back, but it was a minor discomfort when all is taken into account. A few minuses: An unpleasant odor was present in one corner of the room. We alerted management when we left and it will hopefully have been taken care of for the next guest. Also we were not certain that the heating/airconditioning system was working, but luckily, the weather stayed pleasant and we did not need either.

<Content>Fabulous little gem Loved this hotel. The reviews on TA are all spot on. The rooms are small BUT spotlessly clean and boutiquey. Free wi-fi worked great. The contents of the minibar are free and replenished each day. The reception area has tea/coffee making facilities éˆ¥?again free. Great location, the river and Notre Dame is easily walkable. As well as Montparnasse Cemetery and the catacombs. It's also surrounded by cafes, restaurants and supermarkets. Totally recommended!

<Content>Loved it!! Very easy check in. Front desk guy (Dennis I think) was very friendly and helpful with directions. Room was small but as to be expected in Europe. The room was very clean. No view but the room was very quiet. The water and juice in the minibar were free. Free wireless. Bed was pretty hard but every bed I slept in while in France was hard. Not sure what that's about. The location was perfect. I will definitely return.

<Author>MerrimackMrs
<Content>3 1/2 stars Very clean hotel with very nice staff. I suppose it's my own fault for not booking the biggest room possible, but I went with the medium sized room. I just want to warn all Americans that this room is SMALL to say the least. I thought it wouldn't be a big deal since we were not in Paris to stay in our hotel room, but I was wrong. My husband is 6'4 and it was very difficult for us to maneuver around each other and our luggage while in the room. I got an opportunity to see one of the largest sized rooms at the hotel and that looked much more comfortable than the room we stayed in (#34). Unfortunately, they had no large sized rooms available when we got to the hotel... I asked.I got the opportunity to see a large sized room because the safe in our room was inoperable. We had a trip to Normandy planned for our first full day in Paris which meant getting up at 5:15 am to take the metro to San Lazare and take a train out to Caen. I had to bring all of our jewelry and passports in my purse with me to Normandy for the day because of no safe in our room. The next day after getting back from our Normandy trip I explained to the gentleman at the front desk that it was unacceptable for us to be carrying around our jewelry, etc. while touring the sites of Paris... Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomphe, etc. He told me that they had been waiting for over a month to get the safe serviced. Ahhh... life in a socialist country... ain't it grand? He explained to me that I could use a safe in a room that was unrentable due to ventilation problems in the room. Hello! Why wasn't this offered to me initially so I didn't have to lug our stuff around Normandy? Again, the people that work at the Hotel are VERY nice, but this was a big source of aggravation for us. So that's how I got to see their large sized room.I HATE being a party pooper here on Trip Advisor and I get aggravated when other reviewers are nit picky, but some of you have said how well the people that work at this hotel speak English. To be honest, that's not really true. The gentleman that worked during the day spoke the best English, but he was still a little bit difficult to communicate with. I'm only including this in my review not because I aggorantly believe that every French person should speak perfect English, but I write this as a warning to other Americans and Brits that go to this hotel and don't speak great French. Just be prepared... that's all. :-)The other thing that concerned me about this hotel was the security. This was my first time in Paris so maybe all the small hotel in Paris do this... when we left the hotel we had to leave our key with the front desk. When you come back from your travels you just say your room number and they present you with the key. At this point, it could be a different person at the front desk than the person you initially left your key with. Am I missing something or is this weird? Seriously, if you know how this provides hotel security and there's something that I'm missing please email me and explain.So to wrap it up. Very clean hotel with nice people working there, good location in the St. Germain Area of Paris, but unfortunately I can not give this hotel 4 stars because 4 stars represents above average. Would I stay at this hotel again? Maybe, but only if I could reserve their largest room.

<Content>Left Bank Luxury We are 4 well travelled, very particular Brits who have just spent 3 nights at Le Chaplain.. The interior design throughout the hotel is very smart and contemporary and, although the bedrooms were small, they were extremely comfortable (including the beds!). Everyhing had been put together in a very comfortably stylish way, with superb attention to detail. The staff were all very friendly but Denis has a special mention for being very helpful, kind and courteous. The hotel is quietly situated and the metro system so efficient that getting about was very quick and easy. There are some very nice boutiques just around the corner, so no need to go very far to spend some serious money! All in all a wonderful time - not nearly long enough. We'll be back!

<Author>bitsandpieces
<Content>Excellent but note this exception The service, the room, the cleanliness were all exemplary. I can add nothing to the praises already reviewed on this site. One note for those that care...the beds are VERY firm. My wife and I travel extensively throughout the world, and have never felt compelled to write a review warning prospective guests about the firmness of the beds. You will not sleep as well as you might think unless you love firm beds. The room (#21) was dead silent all day and night for our six night stay. Some people like very firm beds, but this was strangely missing from the reviews I read. The pillows are not down and of the variety that are quite flat. Two pillows were too much, one too little. However, considering the myriad of ways Parisian hotels can disappoint us travelers, this is a small note only and one we did not complain about (thus the four star rating). They worked extra hard to find us an massage place nearby which was in someone's home and was a terrific experience (shiatsu). 60E.

<Content>Excellent hotel My wife and I have just returned from Paris, and we loved our 3 nights stay at the Hotel Chaplain. The hotel is very charming. The rooms are not very big, but very well decorated and very clean. The bathroom, an important issue for me, is very good, in marble, and immaculate clean. All the staff was very friendly. The hotel is well located. The drinks in the mini bar of the room are free of charge, which is very unusual, but very agreeable. I discover the hotel here in the trip advisor and I strongly recommend it.

<Content>Incredible Client Service! This may be a first -- I didn't even STAY at the hotel and had a great experience! We stay in Paris about one week per month, at a similar hotel quite nearby. Due to a mix-up in our reservations at our 'regular' place, we needed a couple of nights lodging, and wanted to be in the neighborhood. Due to the fact that Paris was (is) basically 'sold-out' due to the Fashion Expositions, this was no easy task...I spent hours on several sites trying to find ANYTHING under 400 Euro/night. Finally, at midnight in Stockholm, we found lodging at the Chaplain Rive Gauche; fantastic. Booked it on Venere (via Trip Advisor) and got back our confirmation...and settled in for a four sleep before our flight to Paris.After landing in Paris, I received a confirmation directly from the hotel, saying that they would try and accommodate our early arrival - but it was up to the departure of the guest - whenever that would be. 'Hmm, curious response', I thought.Upon arrival at the hotel, I was greeted by Bruce Zeisler, who politely told me that somehow I had made my reservation for OCTOBER 23rd, not September 23rd....and that the hotel was 100% sold out. And here's the amazing part: Bruce had already made a reservation for us in another hotel...a near impossible feat, as I had learned hours earlier. Bruce did this for someone who wasn't even a client! The staff offered me a coffee, I used the internet for about 30 minutes - all the while laughing at my stupidity (I think they thought I was crying, at first)...it was really incredibly kind and thoughtful.The hotel looks really nice, the location is great - but the staff...well, if they take care of you half as well as they took care of us, then your stay in Paris will be near perfect!Thanks to all at the Chaplain Rive Gauche!

<Content>Quiet, Very Comfortable, Accommodating, Good Location We enjoyed our 3 night stay at the Hotel Chaplain. We arrived, after a transatlantic flight, and the hotel had honored our request for early check-in. Our room, #1, had a large queen bed. It was immediately inviting, very clean, and comfortable. The bathroom is very nice too. I really appreciated the air conditioning as it would otherwise be uncomfortable in Paris in July. The only things that would have made my stay nicer was some English channels on the t.v. and a more economical breakfast service -- 14 euros was too pricey. The front desk staff was very nice and helpful. I enjoyed the close proximity to the Jardin de Luxembourg and went for runs in the park in the morning. Two advantages of this hotel is Velib -- the Paris bike rental program -- is around the corner; the metro is just a few steps away. If you want to use Velib, make sure your credit card has one of the built-in microchips -- they're common in France. I would gladly stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Small, clean and new Spent a long weekend here for our wedding anniversary and had a lovely time. The bedroom was small but we expected this. The bathroom was immaculate, a big plus point (marble, sparkly taps, brilliant powerful shower, all new).Location is good, easy to get to eiffel tower, champs elysee and notre dame. Nice bars/boulangeries near the hotel and only a few tube stops from a really busy area with lovely restaurants.Only down point is the hotel staff don't have much knowledge in terms of recomending restaurants - a shame that we had to find the bars, restaurants etc ourselves. The only reason I'm not rating it 5 stars is that really could do with a few more recomendations by the hotel staff for people who've never been to paris!The staff were friendly and check in easy. The free mini bar is a really nice touch.Will book here again when we come back to paris.

<Content>Fantastic hotel for first trip to Paris I booked this hotel for a short 3 night weekend break in Paris after reading the reviews on Tripadvisor, and it more than met my expectations. Check in was especially quick and they were clearly expecting me. I was simply handed my room key and was straight to the room!I had read previous comments about the room size being small, but actually both the room and en-suite were a decent size. The room was immaculately clean and well decorated in a lovely modern style. The bathroom fixtures and fittings were also of a very high quality and very stylish. The whole hotel has been refurbished in the last few months.My room was on the 3rd floor overlooking the small internal courtyard and was therefore really quiet. In conjunction with the exceptionally comfortable bed this meant that I got 3 really good nights sleep!Other good points:1. The free minibar (soft drinks) that was rep-stocked daily.2. The location. A 1 minute walk to the nearest metro station with a further 2 stations within a 5 minute walk. Plenty of restaurants/bars within easy walking distance. Also close to the lovely Luxembourg Gardens.I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Chaplain and will definitely return to this hotel when I visit Paris in the future.

<Content>It's great! Talking about being nervous when picking up a hotel on the net based on reviews. But I just have to confess that this was a hidden jewel in Paris. I am very picky as a person and after having looked for reviews hours and hours from5 star to three I decided for Hotel le Chaplain.This is I promise you a wonderful, nice, modern and above all a CLEAN hotel. Fournished tastefully and hidden on a quite backstreet on 6th arondissement, this hotel promises you a nice enjoyable and a kind of de luxe feeling experience.The staff was very friendly and upgraded us immediatley after arrival..Of course the rooms are small do not be surprised but when it is as good as this then who cares?Enjoy your stay and I warmly advice you to stay at Hotel le Chaplain.

Aug 2008Had a brilliant stay in this friendly, lovely, small hotel - the staff were wonderful, professional and spoke fluent English. The room was great, especially the marble shower room. We loved the free mini bar and flat screen tv, and tea in the afternoon!The location is superb - off a side street, near the jardin du luxembourg. Also with cafes, restaurants and a small store nearby.I'd definately stay there again and recommend it.

<Content>A lovely hotel I booked this hotel very last minute after reading all the positive reviews on Tripadvisor. I would recommend anyone visiting Paris to stay here. There is only one negative, which I will dispense with first- the rooms are small, even by European standards. However, if like us, you are planning to spend your days out and about, then this will be no problem. One of the first real advantages of this place is the location. It is right beside the Metro and you can get the train straight here from Charles De Gaulle. The 6th is a great spot to base yourself for many of the major tourist attractions and the Boulevard Montparnasse has plenty of cafes and restaurants to frequent in the evenings.Upon check in, we were shown to our room straight away, no forms to fill in or anything, which was great after travelling. The room was newly refurbished, with clean en suite and linen, free mini bar and lcd tv. The breakfast was way over priced- 14 euro each but just on the corner from the hotel is a lovely patissiere where you can get fresh croissent, coffee etc every morning. The reception staff were pleasant and helpful, all spoke excellent English.I would recommend this place to anybody and would definitely stay here again if visiting Paris.

<Content>Small, but clean and great service We stayed here for one night during a stop-over in Paris. The room was small, but clean and well-appointed--for the price and location, very good. It was pretty quiet, overlooking the inner courtyard, though we kept the air conditioning on, and that was loud enough to drown out any noise through the walls that there might have been. Service was excellent: a friendly welcome and friendly, prompt service throughout. Lots of thoughtful touches, too: free wi-fi, free mini-bar (I think), and so on.

<Content>City of Love As an American couple who speak no French, the Hotel Chaplain Rive Gauche was extremely pleasant. It is a quaint but modern hotel in a safe area. They were able to give directions/answer questions in English anytime we needed and were very personable. The rooms are small but extremely clean and newly decorated. There were all the modern amenities including; free wi-fi, flat screen tv, mini bar, comfortable pillows and a great bathroom. They even stock the mini-bar with water (1 natural + 1 sparkling), 1 Coca-Cola, 1 Coco-Cola Light and 1 OJ - Complimentary! They refill it daily when they clean the rooms. The only downside for me at the hotel was that the king size bed were two twins pushed together. This being said the beds were new and comfortable.

<Content>What a lovely hotel! We spent one night at this fantastic hotel and would recommend it to anyone going to Paris. The frontdesk staff were very helpful and friendly and even let us check out late as the room wasn't immediately occupied. The rooms are beautifully decorated, immaculately clean and the bathroom is very nicely appointed with Hans Grohe  Duravit fittings (also immaculately clean). The beds were very comfortable and the airconditioning worked well. All in all such a wonderful experience and the first time I have been impressed with the service in a French hotel. We will certainly return to Hotel Chaplain Rive Gauche next time we're in Paris. What a find!

<Content>a pleasant surprise We ended up in The Chaplain by chance after another hotel overbooked us. The place was immaculate. Recently refurbished, the decor is quite design, and tastefully done. Although the rooms are not enormously spacious, the bathroom was on the large side. The hotel is tucked down a side street and both of our rooms overlooked the small courtyard, meaning it was absolutely silent at night. Ideally located for walking almost anywhere in Paris, I would highly recommend this place as a handy pied-a-terre for short Paris breaks. Staff were helpful and friendly, although they were not a goldmine of local information and struggled with restaurant recommendations etc.

<Content>Montparnasse Masterpiece We arrived at the Hotel Chaplain at night after a long trip and when we walked in the door, Nicholas, the night desk clerk greeted us by name without me having to introduce myself... proof that he was expecting us and was prepared. We were checked in and in our room within 5 minutes of arriving. Complementary refreshments stored in the in-room refrigerator were a very surprising treat! During the day, the day desk clerks, Bruce and Dennis, were also very friendly, profressional and helpful. The staff was also very efficient and showed interest in our comfort. The hotel is newly renovated and is crisp, colorful, modern and, considering the central location in the Montparnasse district within walking distance of many things, is very reasonably priced. It is right across the street from a laundry which is REALLY convenient. Our room was very modern with all new furniture, renovated bathroom with nice tilework and marble shower. The room has a wonderful view of the street below and has a very good air conditioning system, again with newly installed in-room controls. The room is also fitted with a wall mounted flat-screen HD television. All in all, a wonderful hotel and will be our first choice stay the next time we visit Paris. Thanks again to Nicholas, Bruce and Dennis for making us feel so welcome at Le Chaplain Rive Gauche !

<Content>Wonderful Find We loved our night at the Hotel Chaplain. The location is perfect, the room was beautifully appointed, and the staff were delightful and helpful. The first thing I did when we got back was to call my sister, a travel agent, and rave about the place. We recommend this gem for any Paris visitor. Suzanne from St. Louis.

<Content>Beautiful Intimate Hotel in Montparnasse Although I did not stay in this hotel myself (I wanted to, they just did not have an available room), the friends I was travelling with had a wonderful experience. I went to visit them at Hotel Chaplain Rive Gauche and was so impressed. The hotel has been completely remodeled and is beautifully appointed and modern. My friends' room was so comfortable and luxurious. I spent the better part of an evening there and the staff was extremely accomodating. The same was true the next morning when I went back to have petit dejeuner with them in their room before they left to go home to the states. I have been to Paris a number of times and this is a hotel that I would recommend to any friend who asked. Also, the location is excellent, just off of Bd. du Montparnasse and Bd. Raspail at Vavin Metro. There is a self-service laundry just around the corner - something that is much needed by travellers, but very difficult to find! Merci bien to the staff and the management of this great establishment. This experience topped off the trip to France for my friends who had never been out of the USA before.As for price, from what my friends told me, some would find it quite reasonable, others might consider it a treat for themselves, as they did. But, they also said that it was worth every euro and that while they worked to pay off the trip, the memories of that treat would make each payment much more pleasant. They felt in the lap of luxury during their stay. Mae ChamberlainSouth Carolina, USA

<Content>this place is a jewel - try it May 2008 found me checking into this jewel of a hotel in the St Germaine area of Paris, walking distance to Luxembourg Garden, on a quiet side street off Montparnesse. Newly renovated, it is quaint, artsy, pretty. The staff are wonderful - friendly, helpful, professional - they go out of their way to make you comfortable. The continental breakfast is delicious, a good value. Our room was comfortable and clean, lovely bathroom. The central courtyard adds a touch of serenity. The location is great - easy access by foot or metro to all of the cultural, culinary, shopping delights you find in this great city. Everyone should enjoy Paris at least once in their life, and this is a lovely and comfortable place to stay while you do it. I would stay there again without a doubt.

<Content>Unexpected jewel in Paris Hi, I travel a lot due to my work. Last may I had to spend two extra nights at Paris, and the hotel that I was living at was fully booked. Therefore I had to look for a new one. Since I was in a hurry for a meeting, I booked the Chaplain as it was the first available option I found. After a long day, I arrived at the hotel. From that point on, a feeling of quietness and easy understanding (if you have ever been to Paris you must have suffered it) got in me. The checking in process shocked me because it was not what you normally find in even higher stared hotels, it was really friendly and efficient. They even upgrade my room to a superb top floor bigger room with a little terrace where I spent a few hour just staring at incredible views from an unknown angle of the city.Room was very new, with cool decoration and an impressive paint on the wall, giving personality to the whole thing. The bathroom inside was also nice. It is easy finding leaking taps or loose hangers in other hotels, but this one was perfectly fitted.Breakfast was very nice, with good variety of delightfull French specials and service, not only at the breakfast launch but overall, excellent.Last but not least is the area. Luxemburg Gardens is one of my favourite corners in the city, not crowded with tourists and, therefore, tourists stuff such as full colour picture menu restaurants and micro Eiffel towers to sell. You get a real taste of what real locals do and live.Back home I showed my wife where I stayed (Hotel Chaplain) and got really shocked with some reviews I found. It really looked that I have stayed at a different hotel, and made me feel really anoyed, since I plan to go back there with my wife for our aniversary. I have found that most negative reviews were made back in 2007, with different management and before a hughe renewal of facilities. That is why I am writing this review, I think it is very unfair with the most positive hotel experience that I have ever had in Paris (I have been there over 10 times).

<Content>Perfect Location - Great Service I have been to the Chaplain many times in the past 15 years and always loved the location on the Left Bank, 6th arr, close to Metro and RER stations and the gorgeous Jardin du Luxembourg. After an extensive renovation, it is now under the management of Bruce Ziesler. Bruce and his staff went out of their way to accommodate us, allowing us to leave large bags in the back room while we went on side trips to Normandy and Burgundy. The breakfast was very nice and available early each morning in the comfortable downstairs lobby. Just off Montparnasse Blvd, the Chaplain is close to several nice restaurants: Chez Clement, Parnasse and Chez You. Sidewalk cafes: Le Select, La Rotonde are right on the corner as are 2 or 3 ATMs. Though a little pricey, you can't beat the location! Thanks, Bruce.

<Content>great discovery ! We've booked 2 communicating rooms , perfect if you have children (3 in our case) and you still want to keep your privacy as a couple. Great situation near the wonderful Jardin du Luxembourg (don't forget to visit the MusèŒ…e du Luxembourg , Vlaminck exposition until july !) .And if you are more into shopping, you will find everything you need within walking distance. Easy access by subway to visit the whole city. Perfectly clean, beautiful design, very nice and helpfull staff and excellent breakfast. Well worth the price.

<Content>Parisien Gem Having found myself stuck for a room last March, a friend recommended a small hotel he had stayed at on a recent trip to Paris.The Hotel Chaplain was a delight, and as a seasoned visitor to this fabulous city, a real gem! Great location, genuinely friendly and in an expensive city like Paris, very good value as well.I'll certainly be back, and next time for longer than a night.
