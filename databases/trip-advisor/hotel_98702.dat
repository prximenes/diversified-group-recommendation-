<Content>Grossed completely out !!! The website on this hotel was extremely deceiving. I would have never booked if I had read the reviews that are now posted. The only review I read was a good one. Don't know when it was given...must have been in another life. Walking up on the hotel - we immediately started to question our stay. Not kept up and smelled a little stale. Desk clerks very unprofessional. Got to our room - and decided we needed to wear flip-flops at all times in the room. We could not relocate - it was OU/Tex game. Our friends in the room next to ours found dirty magazines in the bedside table - these were discusting - photos of old people in compromising positions. There we no ice machines to be found in the hotel. We went to 3 different floors - all the machines were pulled out of the wall. We had coffee in the room, no coffee pot. We found hair in the bathroom (small curley ones - yes, you guessed it). The blanket on the bed was old and had holes. The sheet on our bed was paper thin and during the night it popped up from the mattress. If I had only known what I was about to sleep on.....the mattress was ripped all over and filthy. Not a little ripped - but big time ripped and filthy, not a little stained - major and there was no mattress pad. I was totally discusted and furious. It made me sick to my stomach that I had paid $140.00 to slept on that mattress. I can't believe a hotel is allowed to have these types of mattresses in their hotel. I could go on and on as to what we found but I'm sure you get the picture. I let the desk clerk know of my discust when I left. She had no comment. BAD CHOICE! I DO NOT RECOMMEND FOR MY WORST ENEMY! I'm still [----]!Liz McClure [----]

<Content>What a Rip!!! We were looking for a nice Hotel to stay for the big OU vs Texas Game. Not from the Dallas area this was the closest and most reasonable priced. I booked the room on line , but unfortunately did not read the fine print! After checking just a few hours later with Trip adviser and reading some of the reviews I had some questions! The next morning I called the desk and asked about some of the reviews and the lady said.  If you want to stay ok if you want to cancel go ahead but we keep all the money. After checking they had already charged my card the full amount within 10 hours and basically told me to bug off. I went ahead and canceled the room called my credit card company but it was too late to stop payment! I booked a room at Mariott and look forward to a great game! However they were the rudest bunch I have ever spoke with and I am sure they have a ton of cancelations and this is why they charge and give no refund. I lost $150.00 dont you be the next!!!!

<Content>The worst hotel i have ever stayed at. This was the worst hotel i ever stayed at. Beginning with the rude staff at the front desk that acted like i was putting them out for asking them to help me. Then i got to the room the air conditioner barely worked, cigarette butts on the balcony,hairballs all in the bathroom in the tub, sink, and on the floor, a roach crawling on the wall. The pool smelled and tasted like dirty lake water. You could tell there had not been any maintenance done to the pool area in years. A friend of mine stayed in another room and they could not even get there door to shut!!!!!The only good thing was they kept clean towels and sheets in the room.I would never recommend this hotel to people with children,college aged girls traveling alone, or elderly people. The only people that might be okay there would be guys on a low budget just traveling through town.

<Content>Don't be fooled! Good value hotel! Well, I must say that I was pretty afraid to come to the hotel after reading all of these reviews posted. However, when I first arrived, and throughout my stay at the plaza, I could not believe how wrong and misleading every one of these reviews was.. My stay, as you will read further, was certainly an enjoyable one as I spent three nights of my 4th of July weekend at the hotel.Check-in took about 2 min total. I booked my reservations online with the discounted $45.99 rate and reserved three nights in total for three people. My stay was actually split into two different reservations since I decided to add an additional night later during my vacation preparations. The front desk had not trouble at all with this and was able to continue my three night stay without having any problems. I did however have a little trouble with the first set of keys but the second set worked out just fine for the rest of the stay. Housekeeping was very nice and I got additional towels at the front desk upon request.Now, for the room: clean, organized, well furnished and free of foul scent of any kind. The room was like any other La Quintal or holiday inn room with an added bit of room to boot. The bathroom was clean, spacious and had all the amenities that I could ever want including shampoo, conditioner, hand soap, face soap, toothpaste, etc. etc.. The balcony looked safe and was very nice to walk out onto. The only thing I saw wrong with the room was a little coke stain near the door, that鈥檚 it! I was very pleased with the room, room service, guest service desk, etc.I went swimming in the pool after a light jog in downtown Dallas and it was amazing! The water was very warm and the area around the pool was nice and clean. Yes, there are a few holes in the wall area and the hot tub area is closed off but everything is still very nice. I鈥檓 not sure what people were expecting when they stayed at the Plaza but lets just say that I was very pleased once I saw for myself after reading the reviews. I continued to swim every morning and my buddies did the same as I reported how nice the facility really was..The wireless internet, although somewhat annoying to have to use the service in the lobby area only, works just fine and I enjoyed being able to use the internet during my stay.The 鈥渇itness center鈥?facility was a bit bare with only a couple of treadmills and workout stations. This is probably the worst part of the hotel: dark, stained, dirty, broken windows and cracked walls, etc. There were some pieces of equipment available that could prove useful if you were just determined to get some kind of a workout in. Actually, the center had about the same number of machines as any other hotel, just not as inviting and clean, big deal, I didn鈥檛 come to the Plaza to work out and neither should you. The hotel is somewhat of a 鈥渄eserted palace鈥?as I call it because there is nobody apparently taking advantage of the nice facility that the hotel really does encompass in some areas. The fitness center and outside appearance of the hotel is about the worst but areas such as the pool, rooms, lobby and hallway areas are just as good as any other basic hotel if not nicer. Sure, the hotel needs some work and the facility does show some wear in some areas, but you simply can not beat the online price that the hotel offers. You may not want to stay at the hotel for your honeymoon or anniversary, but the hotel is excellent for single men or college guys just looking for a decent place to stay downtown while they are enjoying the Dallas area. Not only was I able to enjoy the area but I also enjoyed the hotel鈥檚 accommodations as well.Except for the one night (Thursday), I did not see any homeless people, drug dealers, or *cough* women.. down in the parking lot like everyone on here is warning about. I did notice some 鈥渜uestionable鈥?guests checking in and out of the hotel, but these people would not harm a fly as they are probably from smaller towns and communities wishing to visit a larger metro area and experience the 鈥渃ity life鈥? Like everyone鈥檚 鈥渨arnings鈥?on this posting, I too am posting my warning too you: do not let these posting scare you, they are posted by mid-aged women and married couple who believe they have found a good deal at a five star hotel located in downtown Dallas, which simply isn鈥檛 going to happen. For the money, this hotel is fabulous. I am actually writing the rough draft to this review while sitting by the indoor pool on my second day of my stay. I am so confident in my initial impression that I decided to write this review to give those out there a sense of hope who want a cheap hotel for a good stay. I got nightmares at the thought that I had already prepaid for my stay at the Plaza and just now finding out how 鈥渉orrible鈥?it really is. Please, do not be worried, this hotel is not bad at all. If you read all of these other reviews and actually visit the hotel, you will be as surprised as I was when you arrive.. all is well.

<Content>Pay the extra to stay elsewhere!!! I booked this hotel for two reasons; It was extremely cheap, and it was the closest hotel to the convention center.I got what I paid for. The area wasn't the best. The rooms seem to be booked out by the hour moreso than by the night. I was warned not to walk anywhere after dark, because it wasn't safe.On my second day there, the maid left my door open, and when I showed back up, I found my camera was missing. I contacted the front desk and sat in the lobby until they got a hold of the manager. The front desk clerk, Sandra Aldarado, never called the manager like she had said she did. It wasn't until 2 hours later, and I was totally irate, that she finally called the manager on her cell phone, and finally let me speak to her. The manager said that she would handle the situation in the morning. When the morning came, all that was done, was to fill out an incident report. I had to repeatedly insist on calling the police, and having them file a police report.It's amazing that Sandra, the front desk clerk, could reach the housekeeper Janice Curry, to find out that she never saw a camera in my room. I guess she has a habbit of going through peoples luggage or, just flat out lying when she knows she screwed up. The really amazing thing, was that Sandra couldn't reach the manager, but her lies kept telling me that the manager was on her way, and would be back soon.I would advise staying away from this hotel, at the very least until Tiffany Macguire, the manager, Sandra Aldarado, the front desk clerk, and Janice Curry, the housekeeper, are all fired.Maybe once the owners do some housecleaning, the place will improve.P.S. The hot tub has been broken for quite some time, with no intentions of repairing it.P.P.S. There is no bar, lounge, restaurant, or room service.P.P.P.S. The wireless network connection only works in the lobby, and the business office computer is extremely old, slow and out of date, and also corrupted with viruses.

<Content>Seen Better Days - Fine for budget travellers The Con's. 1. Like I wrote in the title, the hotel has seen better days. Maybe back in the seventies and eighties it was pretty flash. Externally it is very shabby, internally it is a little careworn ! The windows needed cleaning.2. Not in the greatest area of town - next to the Interstate on the edge of downtown. Homeless people frequent the area - somewhat distressing to see from the comfort of your hotel. Did'nt feel threatened by them, though. Would not advise walking around this area at night.3. No restaurant/bar and none within the immediate areaThe Pro's1. Very close to downtown - walkable and is safe during daylight hours.2. Inexpensive. At $50 per night, I could'nt complain.3.Rooms were clean and comfortable ( apart from the windows, that is ! ).4. 'Business Room' with free internet access5. Staff were pleasant enough

<Content>The Worst I've Ever Seen. This hotel is filthy. The walls and carpets are dirty. The sheets were stinky like a homeless person had been using the bed. The bed blankets were at least 50 years old and had cigarette burn holes in them. The rooms are very loud with single pain windows and freeways surrounding the hotel. I went through two room before I finally just checked out and found a new hotel. It is in a bad area with homeless people everywhere. The front desk was not friendly, very indifferent. It is the worst I have ever seen and I travel a lot.

<Content>Complimentary Crack Pipe! I should have acknowledged all of the red flags. Our university travel clerk booked this for me after I sent her the link. It's so close to where I needed to be, I thought it couldn't be that bad.Wrong! Despite my confirmation page showing the promo rate of $45.99/night, the hotel clerk wanted me to sign for a totla of $153.xx. I called her out on it, and she said whoever booked must not have pushed the promo button, so the rate would be at least $119/night. Uh... where did the other 30 bucks come from? She finally relented and provided a receipt for me to sign with the total of $53.xx. Odd how it came to exactly $100 less than the original total.I got to my room, walked down the shabby halls with dingy carpet and peeling wallpaper, to find the room immediately to my left had no lock or handle...just holes through which anyone could peer. My own room was secure (especially once I propped a chair and ironing board up under the handle). It was too late for me to attempt finding another hotel, so I knew I was in for the night. I bring my own dream sack so I wasn't terribly concerned about unclean sheets. While looking for a note pad, I stumbled upon a crack pipe. Yes, a real one. I work with cops and have attended various conferences...enough to identify drug paraphanelia easily enough. I was surprised to find I had internet in my room despite the notice that it's available in their business center. (2 couches in the lobby.... if you can kick off one of the hobos)In the morning, when I was checking out, I informed the desk clerk of my pipe find. Her response, Oh. Someone must not have cleaned the room very well. !?!?!?While visiting the Dallas Police Dept., and relaying my encounter, they all rolled their eyes and confirmed they often see prostitutes entering and leaving. They insinuated the extra $100 charge was their pimp fee..... uh..... I looked like a prostitute... nice....This used to be owned by Ramada and when it was first sold to this private investor, they've promised it's under construction and will soon be renovated. That was 4 years ago. I can laugh about it now because I survived the night. I will never return!

<Content>Good deal for the price. I booked through the hotel website and received a great price of $40 per night. I reserved a month early found no problems registering online or calling and confirming the hotel reservation.For all the bad reviews, I was talking to an employee for the hotel and the hotel will be renovated in a few months. Another hotel chain will take over and the name along with the old building and interior will all change. Therefore, if you need an inexpensive place to stay, then you only have a limited time.Anyhow, the check in process was easy. No problems. The lobby shows it's age and 1 of the 3 elevators is out of order. The room was clean. The bathroom was clean, floor seemed vacuumed and the beds were made. The room furnishings, carpet, walls all show their age and the balcony is off limits. The A/C and heat worked fine. No problems with hot or cold water and there was daily room service. The pool doesn't seem clean, and the pool area is dark and not very inviting. I don't swim anyways so it didn't matter. From the outside, the hotel looks old and dated.I was hesitant to stay here because of the prior reviews, but I think the prior reviewers had higher expectations. However, for $40 a night, the price can not be beat. I was attending an event at the convention center and was easily within walking distance. Basically, the rooms are clean, the water was hot/cold, the heating and cooling worked. Sure, there are no warm cookies when you check-in, and the room isn't furnished with the newest and greatest. But then again, the rooms are $40, instead of $150+ average of other hotels in the Dallas downtown area.

<Content>Caveat emptor! (Let the buyer beware) My father is a 79 year old dentist from Oklahoma City who needed to attend the recent Southwestern Dental Conference in Dallas. All of the rooms at the host hotels where he usually stays were booked (Adolphus, Magnolia, Fairmont) so we new we would have to look around the Dallas Market or up Central Expressway. The Dallas Plaza is 1/2 mile from the Dallas Convention Center. The convenience to the exhibits was what drew us to this hotel. I had just been in Dallas on business myself and we have been going to downtown Dallas since I was a child 40 years ago so, we knew the area was potentially rough and possibly dangerous, but the price was amazing. I told him he might have to bop his way into the hotel each night. He informed me that he did not receive the King bed as requested but the room was large with two double beds and a good TV. He did complain that two out of three lamps in the room did not work. I called to see if he had arrived his first night by 6:00 p.m., it took several attempts to get anyone to pick up the phone, but once they did answer they were courteous. However, that courtesy was not a standard of the Dallas Plaza. I called the hotel two days later to find out when he would be returning to OKC and to give him weather updates. Again it took at least 150 rings before anyone answered the phone. Then the front desk person said they couln't connect me unless I knew which Room # he was staying in and that they couldn't (or rather wouldn't) connect me. I had to tell them he was a 79 year old man traveling by himself before they eventually connected me. BOTTOM LINE: WE GOT WHAT WE EXPECTED! YOU CANT FIND A HOTEL IN DALLAS FOR LESS THAN $100 PER NIGHT AVG. UNLESS IT IS A FLOP HOUSE (and then it's still liable to be a flop house unless it is costing $149 or better). I sill would have expected better customer service. Just because a place is older and has had some wear and tear on it, doesn't mean that the customer service should also be lacking. I can't wait to go back to Dallas next month and check the place out in person, however, I won't be staying there! But I can always use some comic relief when I'm traveling. The other reviews were awesome. Everyone should watch the movie Four Rooms. I'll bet it is a similar kind of place. Dad isn't one to complain having grown up during the Depression, so I'll have to see it with my own eyes to experience the real feel.

<Content>Halloween on New Years Eve Where do I begin? I wanted a New Years Eve Bash in the big D. I looked at many hotels but wanting to spend my money partying instead of on a room I wasn't going to be at all that much, this hotel was priced right. OMG! I'm glad I was half drunk when I got there. I had read the reviews, but I was a dumb ---. I thought how bad could it really be? After all there were 2 good reviews most recently.OK no. I should have heeded the previous reviews. The place was absolutely the most horrid thing I have ever seen. Even through my so-called rose colored glasses. Mold was growing on the inside of the windows and up the walls! How does that happen? Razor wire in the parking lot, the lanterns in the entrance were hanging askew. How hard is it to take a screwdriver and fix that? Broken marble in the lobby, filthy walls, bathroom had some kind of hair all in the tub and on the sink counter. Who stayed there the night before, Bigfoot? Ok ladies I know you would not like this place. Guys??? Well 99% of you wouldn't either but I was raised with 5 boys so I know about that other 1% of you. You'd shrug and think whatever, but I also know that you would not even think of taking your lady there. I consider myself to be a pretty tough girl, with a famine twist ;0) But I'm sorry. Even impaired where I was like that 1% of you guys out there, I just couldn't stay in this place. I couldn't even lock my door. Now what kind of craziness would that have been if I ended up next to some strange homeless man? The lady at the desk told me that on cold nights they allow the homeless who are sitting in the parking lot come in the lobby to get out of the cold. With a room that had no real way to secure my door, and having been advised when I asked to change rooms that all the rooms were like that. I just couldn鈥檛 hang with it. I had to beat feet out of that place. I'm glad they are looking out for the homeless, but maybe they should apply for some aide and make that a homeless shelter. As far as being a hotel, they aren't. There was another review I read that said if over half the reviews are bad don't stay. Listen to it. That person was right. People don't just write these reviews for their health. It's New Years Day and I could be doing allot of other things right now, but I am on this laptop warning others. Get the picture? Happy New Year everyone. Be Safe and let's all have hope for the new year ahead.

<Content>PLEASE STAY AWAY!!!! Why is Dallas Plaza Downtown Convention Center in Dallas TX on any reputable travel site? That place is the projects or a pay by the hour establishment. The balconies are condemned; do not step out on them. There is mold growing on the walls and in the bathtub. Homeless people hanging around the parking lot wearing big heavy winter coats with lots of pockets in September 90 degree weather in Texas....ok... The hot tub was broken; the pool was so full of chlorine you couldn't stand to go in the room for the fumes. No restaurant, no soft drinks or ice, VERY bad neighborhood. My God what a mess. The Manager was rude and gruff. He didn鈥檛 care that we checked in and then right back out. All he cared about was that he had already gotten his money from hotels.com. I don鈥檛 consider myself as a person who has to stay in an expensive hotel/motel, but I have paid less than $76.93 a night and the place was at least clean and semi safe. If you are one of those people like me that say well I just can鈥檛 believe the reviews, you鈥檒l soon find out when you take that loop up to that place what a mistake you鈥檝e made. From now on I will look at the reviews before I book and lose my money. There鈥檚 no telling what kind of bed bugs were in that bed which I did not get near. READ THE REVIEWS! Please please do not stay at this hotel or any that has mostly bad reviews. I learned people don鈥檛 just take the time to warn you for their health so I did my part and told you my story. I WISH I would have taken pictures with my cell phone to show you. Book at your own risk. I have checked the box that I am willing to be contacted by other travelers.

<Content>Looks like a Horror Movie Hotel The most horrifying experience I have ever had with a hotel, and that is before I ever parked. I booked online because their website pictures looked beautiful. First off, they have a banner for a sign and homeless people were sleeping in the parking lot and up by the front door. I saw what appeared to be a drug deal take place on the corner. The Dallas Plaza Hotel had metal balconies that were broke and dangling. There were windows that were also broke. You could film a horror movie in it without having to alter anything. The website is so misleading. Never, Ever, book this hotel in advance!!!!! I was so mortified that we didn't even go in.....I turned the car around and we stayed at a different hotel.

<Content>What a Dump !! Just a few observations:-Front desk could care less about anything-No internet except in their so called data center-The Data Center has one tired out PC with no speakers or printer and the keyboard is so worn, you can't see the letters-Pubic hairs all over the floor and tub. I doubt they even own a vacume.-TV sucks. gets very few channels and they are fuzzy-Wake up calls never came thru till the last day-Ice avail only on the 7th and 11th floor- No food or bar-Bed linens do not fit the beds-2 out of the 4 days I was subjected to this hole: - no trash cans emptied in my room - tub was NOT cleaned -toilet was not even flushed -Did not replace the soap, shampoo or toweelsNeedless to say NEVER AGAIN !!

<Content>not what you would expect with the name Could not believe the room pass key system was going to be down for three days. You had to be escorted to your room each time. No real checks made if you were actually registered to that room. Staff friendly but not professionalWork out room machines all in complete disrepair. Free parking the only plus

<Content>How can they stay in business? Our first clue should have been that the cab driver had never heard of the hotel. When we finally found the place, it was in a very run-down empty area of the south side lined with razor wire and we had to look pretty hard to find the sign. There were barely any other cars in the parking lot, and another newly arrived set of guests looked about as dazed as we did. Our hearts sank, but from outside, the lobby looked OK, so we let the taxi go. Closer inspection of the lobby revealed how run-down that looked too. On entering the room, we had to search for a light that actually worked and were disappointed in how dirty and old everything looked and smelled. We were afraid to turn down the bed. The view consisted of pure cement. We found a room at a nearby Hampton Inn (which had a 100% satisfaction guarantee, bigger, clean rooms and very nice beds) for only $40 more per night. When we called the desk about the cancellation policy, the woman didn't even ask why-she was probably used to it. She informed us that we'd have to pay for that night and have our travel agent cancel the second night, then hung up. Huh? She wouldn't give us a receipt for the first night either, saying we had to get that through the travel agent as well. While we were waiting for a cab (she had to give the driver directions), another customer was at the desk trying to lodge a complaint, but nobody was sure when the manager would be in. We have been home for 4 days and have yet to get a receipt. They keep promising to fax a copy. I don't expect that will happen. Between the text and the photo here, this is some marketing job. I can't believe that anyone would rate this place any higher than a 2. Were the others at a different hotel, or do they just not have any standards? I wish I had taken the time to read the reviews before going.

<Content>Horrible, Worst Hotel Ever It was the worst hotel I have ever stay in during many years of travel. The staff is rude, unfriendly, unkept, with no concept of customer service in any form. Found previous occupant's bodily hairs all over the bed sheets. Staff wanted me to change my own bed sheets. Located in a horrible part of town. It was a terrible experience. Wouldn't reccomend this hotel to anyone.M. Bilow, O'Fallon, MO

<Content>It was a fun experiance I stayed here when I was younger with my parents and little brother. I come from a smal town in KS and this place was amazing compared to any other best western I'd seen before. One night our card key thing didn't work and it took us over an hour and half for anyone to fix the situation, but other than that the stay was awesome. The view of Downtown Dallas from our 4th floor balcony was breath taking. We stayed for my mom's Mary Kay convention.

<Content>Stay away Don't go here.The barefoot check in person kept us waiting in the unairconditioned lobby for at least 10 minutes while she shuffled papers and returned the same stapler to the same spot over and over again. When I finally asked her if she could check us in, she said NO.Since we'd already paid for our rooms through hotels. com we couldn't walk out. We kept waiting until she decided we were worthy. By this time quite a line had formed.The room wasn't clean, (dried urine on the toilet seat). There's more to say, but you get the idea.

<Content>Unsafe and disgusting! This hotel claims to be close to the Dallas Convention Center -- it is, but you have to walk through a tent city to get there! The staff was non-existent, one girl on her cell phone the whole time. Remnants of the hotel's days as a Ramada were evident. They even left up the star certificates. The rooms themselves were not bad, but there was no way to lock them in a way that would make you feel secure. This was the WORST hotel we have experienced in a long time.

<Content>Horrible, horrible hotel!!!!! If you are interested in staying in a hotel that has the absolute worst staff ever assembled inside of one building, stay here! Rudest people ever! We had trouble with our housekeeper and the front desk people. First, we checked in late at night, the hotel is a mess to try and find! We get to our room and climb into bed and there is hair and make up all over the pillows. We left a note for housekeeping and she simply dusted the hair off and left the make up stained pillowcases there. Then, after we had left, we realized that we had forgotten my fiance's pillow in the hotel room. I called and told the front desk woman what had happened. She told me to call and setup to have a carrier to pick it up because they could not be bothered to help anyone out like that and she would put the pillow in a box for me. I called back today and the front desk person hung up on me twice after telling me that the pillow never surfaced. She was rude. She was hateful and I recommend that you spend your money in a better way!

<Content>the pitts The website said it had a restaurant and a salon. We were there in July the restaurant closed in Janurary, and we have no idea when the salon closed. There were no food places in walking distance. But the only good thing was it was only 1/2 mile to the convention center. There were us and another couple that went. Our room had a remote to the TV the other couples did not. We had an alarm clock but it looked like the bought it for $1 at a yard sale, the alarm didn't even work. The other couple's room didn't have an alarm clock. You weren't allowed to open the doors to get on the balcony.I would not stay there again.

<Content>Clean and cheap I have stayed in this hotel twice now i use it for when i want to stay in town just for the night but not pay for an expensive hotel. It is very close to the convention centre train station and it only costs between $5-10 to get a cab from downtown. The staff are friendly there is a free phone in the lobby which i used to phone expidia to book a room at a cheaper rate than what they were quoting me and it only took 10 mins for them to get the reservation. Clean and cheap but not an area you want to walk around.

<Content>Worst hotel Stay I've ever had I made the mistake of booking a non-refundable stay at this hotel for my 10 day stay in Dallas. They no longer have a shuttle bus or a restaurant, and the nearest place to eat is about a mile away. They are in a bad, deserted area of the city. The first day I went running, I did not feel safe in broad daylight. The worst part is that the hotel phone messaging service does not work and the hotel doesn't bother to tell you this. I had several friends call, and when the messaging service didn't work, left messages at the fron t desk - all of which were lost. When I complained to the manager, his attitude was worse than the front desk. The front desk in general was worthless, no one knew how to get anywhere in the area. The rooms are dirty, dark and dingy, and so are the hallways.

<Content>Very acceptable hotel I stayed at the Plaza Hotel for a few days in July 2005 while completing some medical appointments at Baylor. I found the room clean, with appointed, and very comfortable. I especially liked the wireless internet and the shuttle service which took me to Baylor and other downtown locations. Was very satisfied with the hotel and the price.

<Content>Vintage Charm Beautiful decor with veined marble floors and walls in the lobby and also on some floors. Stayed here while attending a conference in Dallas. The hotel is in the process of remodeling. The room I was assigned was clean with all the basic ammenities. The decor was esthestically pleasing. I give an average review because there were no operational vending machines for snacks or general stores in the very close vinicity. Sodas were available although the restaurant was closed. The gift shop was also closed. I was told this was because the manager of these areas had recently passed away and no replacement had been found. The excercise room had a good assortment of equipment to use. The staff were friendly and helpful. For the price it was a great bargain. I have stayed in other hotels and paid much more for less value.

<Content>Not worth the money!!! Our group stayed here, we had 20+ rooms, the rooms were somewhat clean and that is about the only positive thing. Some of our sheets would not stay on the bed. We did have water but barely any water pressure. We did not see any roaches and were thankful for that after reading the other reviews. Some of the food was ok, but most greasy and not so great. took forever to get waited on or served and the condidtion of the dining area made you a bit concerend about eating there. There apppeared to be major water leaks in all the ceiling tiles of the restaraunt, major mold!! The Lobby coffe was disgusting and that was all they had to offer in the morning, unless you wanted to go to the dirty restraunt for $10 breakfast. Several in our group came up with items MISSING out of their rooms while we were out for the day. We overheard the clerk offer someone a room for $49 a night and our group rate was $109, $49 is all I would knowingly pay for this property. They do offer a shuttle, but you have to wait a bit most drivers were great except one who about killed us all several times and was still allowed to drive us after we made the staff aware of his erratic driving. The pool was nice, but overall the hotel was unkept, outside in need of major TLC and the insdie was drity but they did a good job covering it up and painting over the filth!! Not at all what you would expect in Dallas for a discount group rate of $109.
