<Content>A change for the Worse I stayed at the MO Miami a couple of years ago. At that time, I would say it was fantastic. Sadly, this trip did disappoint. The views of course are still spectacular, and the rooms are nice. The quality of the toiletries in the rooms fell dramatically, to the level one would expect at a Marriott rather than a $450 per day room.. The tv was the old, large kind. There was a small sign in front of it stating that the hotel was in the process of upgrading to Flat screens. One stop at Best Buy could do that in a flash. At first glance the room appeared clean, but when I had to use the room phone, I noticed how really filthy the device was, Yuck.The food was mediocre. I ordered room service with seafood fried rice. There were a few large pieces of shrimp and lobster placed dramatically on top of a squared shaped mound of fried rice. The rice was ordinary at best, the only nod to extravagance was the replacement of peas with edamame.Will I stay again? No thanks. Poor value in spite of the great views.

<Content>My absolute favorite hotel in Miami My absolute favorite hotel in Miami I frequently visit Miami and had the chance to stay in several hotels. Having spent 30 nights there over the course of the past 3 years, the Mandarin is my favorite. The main drawback as most people familiar with Miami know is that the hotel does not have a real beach. Also, the pool is a little small. Other than those two things, the hotel is excellent. The staff are very good. Very helpful and friendly. While the staff at Caf茅 Sambal are quite good, they can try to be a little more proactive. For example, at breakfast they see me carrying several plates from the buffet back to my table for my kids and they don鈥檛 volunteer to help me, however, when I ask them they do it very eagerly. At breakfast (especially during holidays) it gets crowded and the service can be slow and a little frustrating. The room service menu is VERY limited after 11pm. They are in the process of upgrading the AV equipment and during my most recent stay the equipment in the connecting room for my kids was upgraded but not in the suite. The SPA is AMAZING one of the best in the world. The ambiance is very relaxed. One of the things I look for in a spa is a separate locker/shower from the gym and the pool and at the Mandarin spa the facilities are top notch. They have a large number of treatment room and therapists on hand so getting an appointment is not a challenge. Even though it does not have a real beach its is on a small key/island and is very well integrated with the surroundings. There is a very pleasant walkway circling the island and it鈥檚 a good 30 min walk. There is a small park with kids playground that the island residents use and my kids love going there. The concierge were very helpful in making my arrangements but they really put a big surcharge on transport and car hire. The hotel has an amazing lobby with breathtaking views of the ocean and the Miami skyline. During prior stays it was very lively with good food and beverage service and live entertainment (afternoon/evening), however, during my most recent stay I hardly noticed any live entertainment or food service. I found out coincidently that the hotel has an arrangement with a nice beach club on Miami beach (South Beach) which hotel guests can use, however, I wish they made this more obvious. Overall, its an excellent hotel, with some room for improvement.

<Content>An oasis of calm!! I'd give this hotel four and a half points if half points were possible!. I've subtracted half a point merely because the hotel is expensive, and you will need to get a cab whenever you want to go out to the shops or bars (south beach is around 20 minutes drive). BUT if you're happy to relax in the hotel - or if you're a business traveller - it's perfect. You cannot fail to feel pampered and relaxed. We thought the service was impeccable and I was surprised to read some of the negative comments. Every member of staff (front desk, spa staff and pool staff) were focused on making sure we had a comfortable stay. We loved the complimentary smoothie samples by the side of the pool!! I would also recommend Azul (the hotel restaurant) which serves delicious asian fusion food and fantastic wine.

<Content>Hype...Just a Lil We just completed a seven night stay at the Mandarin in Miami. Overall we were pleased with the stay but felt the hotel did not live up to our expectation of service from a Mandarin. Noone ever addressed us by name. I thought that was a signature for Mandarin. The service is definitely on the cold side except for the housekeepers They worked very hard and were always asking us if everything was okay and if we needed anything. They were just great.Front Desk left a lot to be desired, especially considering the usual standards of Mandarin Hotels. We asked on numerous occassions that the luggage needed to be brought up, but time and after time they forgot and we had to call and ask again. One morning we were awakened in error by a wake up call that was meant for another room. They apologized for the error.The hotel lobby and pool grounds are beautiful. The rooms are medium size, well appointed, and views are okay, nothing too great. There is construction going on next to the hotel and there are two big construction cranes. We could see one of the cranes from our room.The food and drinks at the pool were pretty good but nothing fabulous.I did not see anyone using the pool with the palm trees in it. They never offered to set our chairs up in that pool as it pictured on the web site photos. The pool with the palm trees is much smaller that you would think from looking at the web site photos.The hotel is a great respite from the constant action on South Beach. Every time I entered the hotel I felt like I was in my own sanctuary. Very quiet, great smells fill the air, it really is a relaxing environment.Free bottles of water at the valet desk and use of hotel umbrellas is also a nice touch.We went to the health club on a few days, it is very large and seems to have all the equipment one could need. The views of the city are nice, expect for the building across the stree that is under construction.We spent a lot on cabs, but felt the cab service we received was very good.We secured a great room rate throught Travelocity, we paid $200/night for all seven nights.We enjoyed our stay but really have to say that we were disappointed that the hotel did not meet our preconceived notion of Mandarin service standards.

<Content>Disappointing I recently stayed 4 nights at the Mandarin Oriental in Miami and to be honest I鈥檓 glad it was only 4 nights. True the hotel is a spectacular building in a fabulous location however the moment you enter you can鈥檛 help but feel that something is missing. The entrance lobby is has floor to ceiling glazing which offers fantastic views across the bay but little else. The large open space doubles as the hotel bar which lacks any kind of atmosphere, that been said, the rooms are large and very comfortable with fantastic bathrooms and great views from the balcony. The pool area is small and the pool (almost an infinity pool) is not heated and is consequently pretty cold. Incidentally the comments from other tripadvisor reports is unfortunately inaccurate, the service around the pool area is not just poor its pretty much non-existent. On all but one occasion I had to make up my own sun lounger and get my own drinks from the bar, my only comfort was the fact that this was the case for most pool users, unless they happened to look like a movie star or a model.With the exception of a couple of the valet parking guys I would best describe the Mandarin鈥檚 staff as being aloof and unhelpful. There are on two restaurants plus pool caf茅 at the Mandarin which given the fact that it鈥檚 located on an island and a good walk 10 min walk from alternatives, means that choice is strictly limited. Despite this fact the food is very good, expensive but very good. I would strongly advise making a reservation at the Azul restaurant as this does get very busy especially over the weekend. A great alternative to the hotel restaurants is the Island Market Place, a small super market / deli that serve good coffee and hot food as well as some fantastic sandwiches. The Island market place is a short walk form the hotel towards the centre of Brickell Key 鈥?I would urge you to try it.On a number of occasions I found myself being disappointed by the Mandarin. These disappointments largely relating to the fact that I felt I was being exploited. For example;鈥here are no tea and coffee making facilities in the rooms or complimentary drinks in the lobby which means if you fancy a drink you have to pay $7 for a coffee from the restaurant.鈥?Distilled water was placed in the rooms however if you wanted spring water it was in the mini bar and was chargeable 鈥?penny pinching!鈥?Internet access was charged at $15 a day.I would expect the above to be complimentary in any half-descent hotel, but for some reason the Mandarin considers itself to be far too superior to offer these amenities to its guests. The Mandarin Oriental Miami could be a fantastic hotel it has a great location and has good rooms however the attitude of the hotel staff really lets this place down. If I go back to Miami I鈥檒l be staying elsewhere.

<Content>Great choice for liesure or business Just back from 4 nights in Miami staying at the Mandarin. This is a great hotel if you want to have excellent service, large rooms, luxury amenities and don't mind driving 20min to where there is more action. The concierge was able to ensure access to the happening hotel bars in South Beach so no need to stay at a hotel that doubles for a club. The hotel is on a little jetty so many of the rooms either look on to the causeway or else downtown miami and both are lovely views. Great gym, nice pool and there is a lovely small fake beach with big beds to snooze on under the palm trees. Didn't use the spa in the end (and they were a bit odd in not wanting to let me view it unless i was going to use it) but it had a large selection of treatment - albeit very expensive. Meal either for breakfast or by the pool were delicious and I would particularily note the excellent quality sushi. Only 15 from the airport and just about 15 min to anywhere we went. Valet parking was swift and efficent. Only complaint was that housekeeping forgot to make up the room 2x in the 4 but management sent a bottle of wine as an apology so no grudges. Although they couldn't give us a late check out past 1pm, they stored our luggage and provide access to a another room to shower and change before our flight. This was indeed a top quality service experience all around - even put 2 chilled bottles of water in our car for the drive to the airport.

<Content>Not quite the MO I booked (what I thought) was a good internet rate direct with the hotel online at $200 a night. When I checked out 3 nights later, the bill for food, spa and the fixed 18% gratuity cost me over DOUBLE of what my room cost! The staff did try their best, but I don't think their service warranted the 18% gratuity I was forced to pay at the restaurant , room service and spa.Whilst this hotel was a fairly decent hotel, the image on their website is decidedly different to the actual hotel. If you saw a private beach on the website, you will be surprised to find something similar to a sandpit with a couple of deck chairs and a few sad looking cabanas. The pool was small and chairs were placed closely together. The Spa was a reasonably sized where I had body, face and hand treatments. I had to shuffle between 3 different rooms, which defeats the purpose of relaxing, having to dress, undress and walk around the spa to get from one room to another.I was surprised the hotel room just had a bulky old TV that didn't even have an entertainment system. No movies or music on demand. The selections on TV were similar to those found in Holiday Inns. Complimentary toiletries were very limited - just had shampoo, conditioner, soap and lotion. The bathroom had a big bath, but no bubble bath to put in for a good soak. The tap on the sink didn't extend long enough into the sink, so water went everywhere when you tried to wash your hands. The gym was located in a weird place - by a door next to the M Bar (!?) Or you can go via the Spa by lift. This hotel is nothing to rave about for the price that I ended up having to pay for the extra services. It was not quite the MO experience I was expecting being from Hong Kong.

<Content>WIsh We Stayed Elsewhere for our Weekend Getaway If you are traveling on business this is a great hotel; but for those of us wanting to get away for a long weekend in Miami go to South Beach.The hotel is very nice. However it is a bit of a bait and switch. The rates are great, but once you get here the drink/food (and cabs...because it is near nothing of substance) gets to be very expensive. As a matter of fact I spent more on cabs then we did on airfare from NYC. One-way cabfare is approx $30 to South Beach.

<Content>Service Not Good Enough at Mandarin - Lauran Childs and Prime 112 Trump Again! The Mandarin has the reputation of having the best service in Miami, but it's still a shocker!Quite a nice hotel - we liked our room, and the bay view, although hearing the noisy hotel guests next door was not a pleasure. Obviously the Mandarin needs to sound proof it's rooms, as should most hotels.Service around the pool is terrible. If you can get the attention of a waiting person, they will often nod their heads and say yes, they'll get your order - and then it doesn't appear. Some friends of ours arrived and wanted a drink above the pool, and had all manner of problems getting served there, including being ignored. When eventually they got a drink the champagne was served in a plastic glass, even though they were well away from the pool. Not good.Other than that, it was a delight to be able to go to see Lauran Childs' art studio again in South Beach (www.MiamiArt.biz). One evening we went there and bought a couple more paintings, then went on to Prime 112, which had wonderful food, of course.Service in the Mandarin is slow and often inefficient - for example room orders were often not quite right, although I might specify, for example, that I want warm milk with my coffee, then cold milk would arrive. This is not acceptable for a luxury hotel.

<Content>Great room, mediocre pool service We had a very relaxing stay at the Mandarin Oriental Miami, the Front Office staff was lovely and the service excellent. The room was simply perfect, relaxing like a spa-suite and had a gorgeous view. The only thing I could complain about was the service at the pool and the beach. That was absolutely not what I know as the Mandarin Oriental Standard. The waiters were unfriendly and barely took a look if we needed something. I couldn't even recognize a smile during my whole stay. There can be improved a lot, especially if I compare it to a hotel like the Oriental in Bangkok... They should go there and see what real 5* service looks like.Besides that, great place!

<Content>Fabulous Hotel Stayed at the Mandarin Oriental last week and have to say that everything is simply top notch. Excellent food and service, attention to detail is phenomenal. Furnishings and comfort of bedrooms and public rooms is second to none. We are returning next month and would not contemplate staying anywhere else in Miami.

<Content>Savage Hotel. Perfection My husband and I stayed at the mandarin for eleven nights in January. Everything about the hotel was fantastic. The high prices truly reflected the facilities , the standard of service and the quality of the food. The breakfast buffet was wonderful and served always with a smile. We have no hesitation in recommending this five star hotel to any five star travellers- young or old. We are both in our mid twenties. We will be going back !!

Only place to stay in Miami!

<Content>Lovely and relaxing we checked into the hotel after our cruise and the hotel was fab. we got a great rate online, I think this may have been reflected in our room as the balcomy was more of a one person standing area but never the less it was a great room and the view amazing. As it was our honeymoon we had a lovely message and strawberries in our room and rose petals on the bed - I'm not sure if this is normal , but it was fabulous.The Concierge were great, recommending a great restaurant in south beach. It was fantastic food.The facilities at the hotel were great, lovely pool, we didnt go the beach area as we had too much shopping to do! We went to a big Mall that you can get to on the train its basically the end of the line. There's a cheesecake factory and all the normal shops nine west, macys etc. cost there and back was $6 each! and you get to see some of Miami.We also went to the everglades which was a great trip - organised through the hotel.All in all a great couple of days to end our honeymoon - would I recommend the hotel? - absolutely!

<Content>Loved the Mandarin - great Zen experience The hotel was beautiful. We stayed on South Beach for a few days and then checked in to the Mandarin Oriental. You feel relaxed as soon as you enter the hotel - the atmosphere is beautiful, very serene. Our rooms were wonderful - spacious, modern and had all the amenities one would need. Staff was very helpful and professional. This is not the hotel for you if you'd like the typical South Beach experience - it is for those who would like to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city, in a wonderfully calm and zen environment.

<Content>Good for relaxing but far from everything else I went here with my boyfriend in June for a short 3 day trip. We were really excited because we had seen all the pictures on the website and of course Mandarin has a great reputation. They happened to have a cheaper rate that weekend so we decided to book this location.The GOOD things first - The hotel is beautiful - the lobby was clean with modern decorations and very sophisticated. The people in the lobby were helpful (although a little too helpful wanting to take your luggage for the tip). We checked into our room and it was beautiful - the bathroom especially. There was an opening between the room and window that could be closed with a shade. A glass shower, tub and bathroom closet. The not so good things - Pool is NOT what is pictured on their website. I was expecting a huge large pool, but it was really small. There weren't that many chairs, and if you didn't get there in time there was no room. Drinks were way overpriced. The private beach area they claim to have is just a small man made area of sand (no water to even go into) and some beds / chairs. Hotel is very far from everything else. Very few restaurants in walking distance and cabs were really expensive to get into the main part of Miami.Would recommend this hotel for those wanting to just stay at the hotel and only relax there. If you are wanting to experience the rest of Miami, go to the beaches, go out, not the hotel to stay at. We probably spent more money on cabs than food.

<Content>Perfect place to relax After a busy stay in New York, the Mandarin was the perfect place for me and my wife to relax for a few days. The hotel itself is excellent. Our room was spacious and had a great view. The bathroom was massive. Staff were always polite and very helpful and we made good use of the fitness suite which was fairly well kitted out. The pool was a little small for the size of the hotel, but overall it is a great place to stay. As other reviews have said, it is about $25 taxi to south beach, but there are a few nice restaurants close by in a small complex just off Brickell key.

<Content>honeymoon heaven Staying at the Mandarin Oriental in Miami for our honeymoon was truely a wonderful experience. From the moment you walk into the foyer, you enter a calming, relaxed environment. We found the staff to be very friendly and extremely approachable. The concierge provided great information on restaurants to visit. Staff at the pool and the beach were very attentive, making up beds and bringing water throughout the day. The beach is beautiful and extremely relaxing and the pool and outdoor spa bath also ideal.The rooms were extremely spacious,especially the bathroom and were kept immaculately clean by the maids who visited twice daily. Every day, a goodnight mat was left on the floor, alongside a next day weather report and a quote with an orchid. each of these little touches added to the experience.The views were simply stunning looking over biscayne bay.Although the hotel is located in downtown Miami and requires transport to South beach, the superb facilties at the hotel encourage you to spend most of your time at the hotel which we did. There are plenty of places near to the hotel to eat and drink, one of the best being the Rosa mexicana only a 5 minute walk from the hotel.I would definately recommend staying at the Mandarin in Miami as I found it to be very luxurious. I am now looking at staying at one of the hotels in another country as I thoroughly enjoyed my holiday in the Mandarin in Miami.

<Content>Nice Hotel but.... I stayed at the hotel recently for 3 nights. The Hotel location was a disappointment. Although you have a nice view over Biscayne Bay, I would have preferred to be on South Beach which was a $25 cab ride each way. The hotel is not really up to the usual Mandarin Oriental standard. Having stayed at Mandarin Oriental properties in Asia, this one looks dated. The rooms are nothing special. Very little asian influence and very bland. The bathrooms are a good size and well equipped, but again, nothing special. I guess I have high expectations of Mandarin Oriental and have never been disappointed (up until now). On the plus side, the concierge, and Giselle are worth a mention. She was fantastic in assisting with restaurant reservations and an excellent choice of bars/clubs etc. The pool at the Hotel is also a good size, but again, looks dated. The private beach is really not much bigger then a sand-pit and not at all what I expected! Would I stay here again, well....you know what, probably not. I bet there are other properties in Miami for a similar price but of a much higher standard and in a much better location. I guess to sum up, the hotel was average and more worthy of a Sheraton, but not a typical Mandarin Oriental.

<Content>Excellent Stay I recently had a fantastic stay at the Mandarin in MIA. The service was excellent from start to finish. The door/valet staff was friendly, engaging, and above all knowledgeable! The room was spotless, all of the mundane details that some places miss were addressed with overwhelming consistency.They truly exceeded my every expectation which is not an easy thing to do. Great job!

<Content>Very luxurious, Service Without Exeption was Perfect!!! Overall a fantastic property with incredible levels of service. The only downside is no beach - but, took the shuttle/option of using Casa Casuarina (former Versace mansion) on South Beach one day and it was such a nice change of pace. Pricey but worth it - you don't mind paying premium prices when you get what you pay for. Just be aware the hotel is NOT on the beach and in fact has very little beach/swimming compared to actually being on South Beach. On the other hand, it is more relaxing and not as hectic as the overall South Beach experience. Rooms are perfect - no problems - great bed and great bathroom. I have stayed in two room types and any room at this property from a furnishings/functionality perspective is very nice. No request went ignored and overall staff training/experience level is second to none.

<Content>Mother's Day Bliss My wife, 2 year old daughter and I spent a wonderfully relaxing Mother's Day weekend at this Mandarin Oriental. It is the 2nd one we have been too, and it was just as enjoyable as the one in San Francisco. The service was excellent (including taking care of the crib upon our arrival at 3am after it turned out they didn't have it in the room). 2 1/2 days felt like a week and my wife enjoyed her half day spa treatment. The room was clean, comfortable and had a wonderful view with balcony over the bay. We did not have a chance to eat at the hotel restaurants for dinner, but did have one very wonderful breakfast in the Cafe Sambal. The hotel is about a 15 minute drive to South Beach and 15 minutes to Coral Gables. We highly recommend this hotel, we are Fans.

<Content>We love this place This is the third time my husband and I have stayed here and we have enjoyed each of our stays.Check-in鈭?Fast, no wait, polite service鈭?Booking was easy, did over the phone, however I requested a crib and high chair for our 6-month-old baby and we did receive an email confirmation confirming my request however when we checked in there was no record of this. It took a very long time for the crib and high chair to be brought to our room鈭?We valet our car, however they did not retrieve our entire luggage and we had to call down to request that everything was brought up- they apologized about the error and we had our remaining bags within 15 minsRooms鈭?All of the rooms offer nice views of either the bay or the ocean 鈭?The amenities are very nice鈭?Rooms are spacious and nicely appointed in calming tones鈭?I think all of the rooms offer soaking tubs 鈭?The hotel provide slippers which is a personal pet peeve I have with hotels that charge high high prices but can not even bother to provide slippers. I mean how much can they really cost and who wants to walk around barefoot after getting out of a shower on hotel carpet鈭?Beds are comfortable and linens are nice鈭?The baby crib we requested was very nice to look at, however the mattress in it was horrible, very soft and not comfortable at all鈭?House keeping was good, not great but well enough. A few things that should have been removed remained in our room the entire time (example empty paper cup of coffee)Food/Pool鈭?Did not get room service so no comment鈭?The two restaurants offer a good variety of food options, enough so that you do not need to leave the Mandarin to go elsewhere (provided you are only staying one weekend)鈭?Service is very, very good. The staff at Sambal remember us by name the second day, which was very nice, servers who did not wait on us even asked us where the baby was.鈭?The pool is unusually small for the size of the hotel however I have never found it to be crowded鈭?Pool offers wonderful view of the water and it is truly a very peaceful place to relax鈭?Poolside service is fast however the food is not the best鈭?Poolside service is just ok, hard to flag a waiter, hard to get more towels, etc鈭?Spa/Gym鈭?Great gym as far as hotels go. Lots of new equipment to work with鈭?Spa is beautiful and treatments are worth the price鈭?Spa exercise classes are a mixed bag. I have taken yoga twice and the first time the instructor was great the second time she was just awful to the point I thought she may injure some new students in the classOver all we love this hotel, however this last time left a few things to be desired. We will return in the future.

<Content>Pre-Cruise stay was the real Vacation We booked into the Mandarin Oriental Miami for Easter weekend before leaving on a Royal Caribbean Cruise from the Port of Miami (a five or ten minute drive from the hotel).We took our five year old son.Every single aspect of our visit was perfect. The staff was kind and professional. They treated us very well. We participated in their easter celebration which was lovely.The room was large and clean.Oddly, it was the best part of our trip. The Royal Caribbean cruise sucked.

<Content>Best Hotel in Miami We just returned from a fantasic weekend trip to the Mandarin Oriental-Miami. This was our best experience ever in a hotel. Service and attention to detail was the best we have ever experienced. From the time we droped our car with the valet on Brickel Key until we checked out, we were treated like VIPS. The room was wonderful. We were there celebrating our 15th Wedding Anniversary and they had roses in the shape of a heart on the bed. The view from our balcony was breathtaking. We saw the boats sail through Biscayne Bay. Everthing about this hotel is world class. It was such a unique experience, very different from the chains. The room included: bathrobes, a Bose radio, stocked bar, pillows with goose down feathers, clear glass shower etc. We ate dinner at both restaurants. Azul is the eclectic restaurant with food prepared by chefs. Cafe Sambel is the daily place with out of this world food. We were delighted in how our food was presented and prepared in unique ways. I had the Hot Stone massage at the Spa and it was the best massage I have ever had. We went swimming in the Infinity Pool and had drinks afterward on the deck. We also sun bathed at their private white sand beach under palm trees. We will remember this trip for a long time This place is expensive no doubt, however, for a SPECIAL experience this is a place to consider. I choose this hotel because it was ranked #1 in Miami, and I now know why. Think of this as an investment in your relationship.

<Content>Spectacular Hotel I was not sure what to expect with this hotel being downtown, but it was perfect for a weekend getaway with my husband. The service was excellent, the views were remarkable from every angle of the hotel. If you are looking for the South Beach scene, this probably isn't for you - it's quieter and much more low key....but if you are looking for a nice weekend to lounge at the pool, take advantage of the spa, etc., pure relaxation, it is lovely. Only caveat - there is a man-made private beach,but not a place where you can swim.

<Content>Very nice hotel, but not for everyone Excellent service, beautiful decor, very attractive setting, lovely ocean view. But for the price, it did not offer what I would look for whether I was there on vacation or business.For this trip I was there on business. I was 'upgraded' to a deluxe room with small balcony and view. But the room had two standard sized DOUBLE beds, not even queen size. For $500 a night, my feet hung off the end of the bed. Room had internet hook-up but no wireless and they charged $15/day for it. C'mon! even the Hampton Inn provides free internet!The pool area was very small for the size of the hotel. There was a private beach area but it is also small and it's man-made so it's not like enjoying a long stretch of Florida Beachfront. Except for being on the water, It's not particularly well situated for much else. It's a cab ride to everything. There's a walking path around the site, but there's no place to walk to. There did not seem to be anything of interest on the city side.On the plus side, the room was well appointed (except for the standard double beds) and had a fabulous bathroom. The conference area was spacious and well organized. We only had buffet style meals so I can't really comment on the food, but our buffet meals were very good.There is a spa but I did not see it and since I'm not into the spa experience, for me it doesn't add value. I did not mind staying since it was business and I wasn't paying, but I would not consider coming back here for my personal holiday.

<Content>Miles From Anywhere Stayed 6 nights - big mistake as it's just so isolated - perhaps good for business travellers but not for holidaymakers. Just to go anywhere else do something like visit Coral Gables/ South Beach/Bal Harbour involved a 30-45min cab ride so added at least $80 a day to your costs. Ghastly fake beach - no shade - very windy so be careful if you go outside in sun. Pool looked totally uninviting and a bit dirty. Hard old sunbeds. Most souless atmosphere in Sambal Cafe where you ate breakfast/lunch/dinner - like being in a concrete open fronted warehouse. No flowers anywhere to add some ambience. Azul Restaurant supposed to be highly desireable in area but very expensive. Was well annoyed at being charged 18% gratuity PLUS local tax on everything which added 25% to prices shown on menus, whether breakfast, snack or drink. Maybe I'm stupid but America is seriously expensive even with the Sterling/Dollar rate at present. Cost $5,000 for 6 nights with only 3 dinners!!! No champagne either. Bedroom was very comfortable - but no catering for overseas guests - i.e. no channel on TV for foreign services like BBC World which you get everywhere else - all American stations only. Staff very nice though but so they should be at those prices. Would never go back - view was okay if you like looking at office buildings and a bit of water. Such a disappointment really for the money.

<Content>Great Hotel We stayed at the Mandarin for a few nights in March. I have to say that the service was excellent. The entire staff team was extremely gracious. The 1.3 mile loop around the hotel was wonderful for jogging/walking and the fitness center was very well-equipped.The only complain we had was that the pool is a little too small - especially when the hotel gets busy.We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel and Staff My wife and I just spent a long weekend at the Mandarin and it was super. The staff was attentive, the spa, pool and beach wonderful. Spectacular views! Good food! I would recommend this hotel for a business stay or as a destination for a long weekend. The hotel offers garage service for a fee or you can use a cab. There is minimal other transporation.

<Content>Completely Relaxing Experience I stayed at the Mandarin for two nights, and have never received such great customer service in my life. The staff was friendly and professional, the rooms were amazing, and the food at Cafe Sambal and Azul was phenomenal. And the martini bar has over 250 types of martinis! The only downside to staying at this hotel - for me - was the beach. While laying on the man-made beach was nice, there isn't any access to the ocean... which is a big negative for me. The pool nearby is very nice though, so at least there's some water. This is not the place to stay if you're looking for an active nightlife (the hotel is about a 15 minute cab drive into South Beach), but it's a great way to pamper yourself!

<Content>Modern Zen Hotel Have been there about half a dozen times before, always enjoy the peaceful zen spirit. This weekend was no different, but some observations. The hotel service was top notch, although the restaurants were somewhat slow; waited 25 minutes for a sandwich and sushi roll. The pool area is very small (although hip and easy access to cocktails and snacks), but the fake beach was very relaxing and quiet. This is not a hotel for small kids; better for business people and hip couples. The views of the bay are amazing, and the food and drinks at all the restaurants are high end and healthy. Small aside: Lobby chairs were stained, needed replacement. Overall, the meditative quality is worth the price tag, and the hipness of the clientele adds to the overall star quality feel.

<Content>What you get for $655 Sorry but I don't get the hype here. For $655 a night, one gets a 4 star hotel room -- an old, medium-sized TV, worn curtains, carpets and armoire, a stained white sofa, and a lousy shower head. The bed, though, is very comfy. Plugging in my computer required unplugging the one desk lamp as there were only 2 sockets available (the internet charge is $15 per day).There is no coffee/tea maker in the room and so, if you order the SMALL coffee from room service, you will pay $13 (once you add in the $3.50 delivery charge, 20% service charge, and sales tax). Be warned that the room doors are constructed so that they will slam shut if left on their own to do so (NOT suggested for those who like to sleep in).As for the location, you are near nothing that is within walking distance and so be prepared for 20-30 minute cab rides if you haven't rented a car.I will say that the staff are all very friendly and helpful.

<Content>Very Restful This hotel is a welcome oasis very near all the hubbub of South Beach. PROS - Beautiful Lobby, Attentive Staff, Fabulous Gym and Spa(one of the best massages I've had in a long time). The beachfront area was pleasant and not overly crowded. Food at all the restaurants was excellent. The room was large and very comfortable. CONS - For such a high end hotel ...NO FLAT SCREEN TVs....only the old Sony's. Also NO WIRELESS in the rooms...need to attach to the internet (it was high speed though). Coffee in lobby in morning is extra...I hate being nickeled and dimed...just charge $25 more a day and give the free coffee. Lastly, No Salon for hair services on premises. Which was annoying after having spa services.The Mandarin in NYC is much higher end....time to put a little TLC into the hotel....

<Content>A tranquil oasis The Mandarin Oriental Miami is a tranquil oasis. If you are not into the hustle, bustle, noise and crowds of South Beach, this is a perfect spot. The lobby and restaurants are stunning, and the rooms have a spectacular view of the city and the water. We found the service to be impeccable, and particularly liked the pampering we got poolside- a terry cloth cover for our beach chairs, big fluffy towels, and ice water without having to ask. With our mojitos in hand, we enjoyed the view of the infinity pool and the boats beyond.The bed was absolutely to die for 鈥?so comfortable we were asleep in about 15 seconds. We also enjoyed the big soaking tub and separate shower in the bathroom. As for nightlife, the hotel bars were attracting a very fashionable crowd on the weekend. If you want to venture beyond the hotel, it is an easy 10-minute walk to get to the 9th Street and South Miami Avenue restaurant area. We had a lovely candlelit meal there at Dolores. The Mandarin is serene and elegant. We would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Nice hotel The hotel is located in downtown Miami walking distance to the financial district.The room:The rooms were large and spacious decorated as if you were at a beach house. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom was very good with a large bathtub and seperate shower. The ammenities were excellent. The location:Good business hotel location within walking distance of the financial district. On the bay so nice views and lots of delis and restaurants including a Vietnamese  Thai which served sushi restaurant the hotel reccommended which was great. It is a good 20 minute drive to South Beach.Would stay there again if the trip was for business purposes however ours was a stopover on route to pick up a cruise so would have rathered a South Beach location.

<Content>Mandarin Oriental, Miami We stayed at the Mandarin Oriental for four nights last August. I have been meaning to write a review, so I figured a few months late is not too bad. We have previously stayed at the Ritz Carlton on South Beach, but wanted to try the Mandarin since we heard and read great things. Below is my feedback:** Lobby ** The hotel lobby is really nice. Has a beautiful view of the bay from anywhere you stand. There is also a coffee bar which is available in the mornings and an actual bar available in the evenings for pre/post dinner drinks. ** Location ** This is probably the only complaint I have about the Mandarin. A cab ride to South Beach costs $30 each way and we went out to dinner every night, so it ran between $70 -$80 a night for cabs (this excludes other cab rides while in South Beach). So if you do actually plan to spend most of your time in South Beach, I would highly recommend not staying here. I would recommend the Ritz Carlton on South Beach as the alternative. ** Service ** The service was fairly good. If we had any request (no matter what time of day or night), they would accommodate without issues. The only minor complaint is that they are fairly slow at the restaurants. When we had lunch our first day there, it was so slow that we decided not to eat there again. In terms of the food, it is very Asian based so keep that in mind if you do or do not like Asian food. We thought we loved Asian food, but four days of Asian lunches will take their toll 飦?At the pool, food/drink service was fairly quick, but I think it鈥檚 because the pool was small. We ordered room service each day for breakfast and they do a good job with that. On a side note, definitely check out Barton G restaurant in South Beach. They had a good scene and great food. ** Pool **The pool is actually not that great. It鈥檚 very small and you only get sun all day in half the area. Other areas get covered with shade fairly quickly. Also, as you probably all know, it is not on the beach. They have a little sand area but it feels like a cheap park rather than a man-made beach. Quite random actually. They would have done better by making the pool larger and more luxurious.** Gym ** The gym was excellent. They have new equipment, it鈥檚 very clean, and they provided water, juices, fruit, etc. They also have a path for jogging along the bay which was very nice. ** Spa ** Also excellent. If you are going to the Mandarin to get away and simply get spa treatments and stay at the hotel, I would definitely recommend it. But again, if you are planning on spending time at restaurants in South Beach, it鈥檚 a hassle.** Rooms ** We had a room with a view of the water and the city. For the most part, a majority of the rooms look like they would actually have views. The hotel is fairly new and well kept so that is another positive. It is also very clean. The bath products they provided were great. The only thing to keep in mind is that the bathroom has an open window to the sitting area/bedroom. So if you are not with your spouse/significant other, it may be uncomfortable. You can close it with a little pull-shade, but it鈥檚 still somewhat intrusive. It didn鈥檛 bother us since we are married, but if I was with a friend, it would have been a little uncomfortable.** American Express **For those of you who use the Amex Platinum travel service, the amenity you get is $100 credit towards lunch. You have to use it in the actual restaurant though (of course we didn鈥檛 so we didn鈥檛 get the credit so keep that in mind). You also get the usual free breakfast and late check-out. In terms of the upgrade, we were supposedly upgraded two room types, but I didn鈥檛 see that. Seemed like the same room we booked. So with all that said, if I was staying downtown for work and spending my time there, I would stay here again. If you plan to come to South Beach to go out and go to the beach you are better off at the Ritz Carlton or another hotel directly in South Beach.

<Content>Expensive but worth it First: This is a very expensive hotel, located in an expensive area of an expensive city. Having said that. . . it was still well worth it. Great service. Everyone is exceedingly helpful. The on-site restaurants were great. The room was a decent size, was high-end throughout, and our bay-view, high-floor room had an incredible view of the Miami skyline. Its location on Brickell Key is great: a small semi-residential island just off of downtown Miami. Nice pool, great jogging path, even a small beach.Yes, its expensive if your company is not paying, but I think you get what you pay for in this case.

<Content>not worh it We stayed at the MO in Miami for 5 nights during the New Year's holiday. Although we had a nice time and enjoyed the views of the bay, I would have to say that the service of this hotel is not up to par. We found the concierge(s) to be more dismissive than helpful. We found it difficult to get service at the pool or beach and the food was very slow in the restaurants. We also had to call three times to ask for help with our luggage. We ended up carrying all of our heavy bag ourselves. Not what one would expect at a 5 star hotel. The prices for food and amenities (not to mention the rooms) is astronomically high...and I'm comparring that to NYC.I also found it irritating that the service was already included with each check. That standard gives very little credit to the customer. I also think the hotel is too small. Granted it was New Year's weekend and one would expect a large crowd of families and europeans, but the pool was jammed packed all day as was the so called beach. These areas are just far too small to accomodate the hotel sufficently. The service could not manage to take care of everyone' s needs and keep the place clean. The pool area is way to small. It was difficult to even walk past the pool without almost falling in. The beach area too - Guests would leave books and such on the beds early in the morning and then not show up to use the beds till the afternoon. Subsequently there were not even enough beach chairs for everyone that wanted to sit on the beach.Some these things are understandable and I am not that high maintenance of a travellot. Ultimately I still enjoyed the hotel, but for the price you are paying they should be able to meet everyone's needs.

<Content>Best Service in MIami I just spent a week at the Mandarin with my partner and my family and we had a terrific time. The rooms are quite luxurious, the service is divine, and the food always brought a smile to our faces.Room--Very comfortable and spacious with a terrific balcony. I especially liked the marble bathrooms! The beds were very easy on the back and the sheets and linens have thread count galore.Maid Service--One of the best parts of the hotel. Rooms are cleaned in a timely fashion and requests can be made with ease for both daily housekeeping and turn-down service. Who can resist the little orchid bud they leave on your bed each night?Restaurants--Quite tasty. Good Asian fusion and we like how grams of protein and calories are listed for several of the choices. Azul is quite upscale, but the cafe downstairs is simple and consistent.Public Spaces--I loved going down for coffee each morning at the coffee bar across from the front desk. The lobby is filled with light and the faint scent of something delicious always hung in the air. The tranquil music was also a good touch.Service--Yes, yes and yes! Miami is not known for its excellent service, but the Mandarin delivers here. Everyone is gracious and willing to work with you to get it done.Price--A bit tricky here. The hotel isn't cheap and the constant add-ons--from the morning coffee to the expensive lunches--added up fast, but it was worth it....Interesting Side-Trip--Check out the Casa Casuarina, which was the Versace Mansion on South Beach. Now it is a private club and hotel. For $175 a person you can spend the day there through an agreement they have with the Mandarin. Yes, a bit pricey, but when else will you be able to swim in Versace's pool replete with gold tiles? Tacky, sure! But what fun!Overall--A great hotel. Two weeks prior to this trip I stayed at the Four Seasons in Miami. The verdict: stay at the Mandarin.

<Content>One night of pure relaxation Spent one day, evening and morning at the MO Miami in December 07 prior to a flight back to London. Never left the hotel, which made it easier as the location is very specific for where it is - that is, not close to anything really, so taxis are necessary. Have done South Beach a lot, so decided to stay on site and make the most of the spa, pool, room, balcony and restaurants. Service was good - not as exceptional as you get in the MO hotels in the Far East, but good nevertheless. The Azul restaurant was excellent and we had great advice from the sommelier who really knew her stuff. The standard room was chic and comfortable, with open plan bathroom (with a silk screen divider if necessary) but separate WC, so nice to be able to lie in the bath and chat to someone else relaxing on the bed. Balcony with both sea and city views. All in all a very good stay, and served its purpose well for a relaxing one night stop prior to a 9 hour flight.

<Content>Hanging out with the Fresh Prince... I stayed at the Mandarin Oriental Miami in November 2007 and the hotel seemed very quiet during my 3 night stay. The hotel is set just off the mainland of a small island that encompasses a number of other residences. Word is that Will Smith stays here, but alas no sign of the Fresh Prince during my stay!I paid around 拢110 per night only a room only basis, which I thought was good value for such a renowned branded 5 star hotel. Staff at the hotel were all accommodating and made my short stay very pleasant.My room was a reasonable size and I had a small balcony that overlooked the front of the hotel. Bathroom was excellent, good power shower, soft bathrobes and some reasonable slippers.The hotel has a small outdoor infinity pool and hot tub. A nice touch is the small private sandy 鈥榖each鈥?littered with hammocks and excellent double bed proportioned sun loungers.Valet Parking is the only option at the hotel 鈥?with US sales tax that鈥檚 an extra 32USD per night (plus tip!) which is quite an extra expense to consider if staying here for an extended period.

<Author>puma1.716v
<Content>very good indeed !! My partner and i have just completed a one night stay at the Mandarin Miami.What struck us the most was the size of our room, it was huge! The bathroom was well appointed with high end extras for you to use( we took these home)and i particularly like the BOSE sound system,very swish.One down side about the room was the lack of Plasma/LCD tv,just one of those old boxy things. The room did not have tea/coffee facilities so if you wanted a cup of either you hade to use room service,this can be expensive but also a chore.We did not eat at the hotel but at a nearby Italian restaurant which was excellent . Would i stay again?....yes if the rate was good as you do pay for every thing and i mean every thing so your bill soon mounts up.

<Content>Lovely hotel...but more trendy than great I stayed at the MO for 4 days. The hotel is up to the standard you would expect for a 5 star property, although the land constraints of downtown Miami mean you don't get the wild size and luxury of some other properties. The rooms are lovely and the staff mostly helpful and knowledgable. There is some tendency to trency over great...which is what seperates it from my favourite recent hotel - the Four Seasons Boston.

<Content>Something of a disappointment in comparison with other MOs I have always been a big Mandarin Oriental fan but must confess that the Miami one was a disappointment and I would not return. The famed Martini bar is very small and the infinity pool minute (three strokes and you've reached the other end). The service, although always given with a smile, is slow and the automatic gratuity added to the bill simply an irritant. Moreover, should you go onto the private beach section, be sure to spray yourself with anti-bug bite spray as otherwise you will be eaten alive. But on a more positive note, their restaurant Azul is superb and having the Tasting Menu is a must.

<Content>2 Star Service at a 5 Star Hotel I recently stayed at the Mandarin and expected much better service than I received. The service turned bad when I returned to my room to change for the evening and realized that the hanger that I brought with me to hang my suit on was missing from the room. I searched all over because even at 2 star hotels the maids know not to throw anything away unless it is in the trash can. Well the maid threw it away so I had nothing to hang my suit on for my travel back home. I then called the housekeeper to get them to bring me a replacement plastic hanger but was delivered a bulky wooden hanger. They later brought me a wire hanger, once again not what I asked for. When I spoke to the manager on duty he assured me that he would get what I needed but he never even called to say that he couldn't get it. I guess I was a little dissappointed since I am accustomed to the Ritz who will send someone across town to get whatever it is that you desire if they don't have it there. I have to say that when I checked out the lady at the front desk was very apologetic and tried to compensate me for my inconvenience. So FYI, don't leave anything lying around that you don't want to be thrown away. Other than that, the hotel was wonderful.

<Content>Excellent! I stayed at the Madarin Oriental for 2 nights at the end of October with my parents and my now new fiance. When we checked in we were giving an upgrade to a bay view which was lovely and having got such a good deal due to the time of year we were even more pleased. The hotel was fairly empty during our stay but I liked it as the there was plenty of room round the pool. The staff's attention to detail was excellent, on the trip my boyfriend actually proposed and had asked one of the hotel staff to set up our room for us. When we arrived back from shopping I walked into our beautiful room with candles round the bath and rose petals on the bed and a sushi shaped cake, it was lovely.The manager of the hotel was very friendly and extremely helpful. The location I liked, yes it is a little quiet and very different from South Beach but I enjoyed this, you would definately need a car though or to take cabs. Overall our stay was excellent. Having been to Miami a few times now and stayed in a few different places I would definately come back to the Mandarin Oriental for the right price.

<Content>Great stay One of the best hotels I have experienced.The view on the ocean is just amazing from the rooms  suites.Valet parking was a bit slow, even when called from the room with nobody waiting before or after me. Like all chain hotels, relationships with staff are a bit cold  impersonal but at least, no intrusion to bear with. Ideal for corporate or leisure stay, except your eally need a car to go out, or use a taxi.

<Content>Make Mine Mandarin The Mandarin is a beautiful hotel with first class amenities including a terrific spa, and most notably, an amazing pool that overlooks the Miami harbor and skyline. The hotel bar is hip and the overall atmosphere of the property is chic but doesn't guild the lily, it is quite tasteful. One problem is the hotel is somewhat isolated form the rest of town (need to cross a bridge to get to it), and of course, being a Mandarin hotel, it is pricey, but overall, the Mandarin Oriental Miami is a wonderful hotel. The room was exquisite, the staff was friendly and helpful, and we had a balcony with an excellent view of the city. Highly recommended.

<Content>Excellent Hotel and Staff I stayed at the Mandarin Oriental for a conference, and it was unfortunate I was traveling by myself because the hotel and its location are fantastic.The hotel itself is situated on Biscayne Bay. I was fortunate to get a room facing the bay and took full advantage of the private balcony that comes standard with every room. (Have a room service breakfast on that balcony and you'll know what I mean)The room itself was done in rich mahogany and the bed was extremely comfortable and very sleepworthy. The bathrooms were superlative and done in marble. It was really a nice treat to sleep at night with the windows to the balcony open and the ocean breeze blowing in.In regard to items outside the room, the lounge on the lobby floor of the hotel was superb and as you would expect also provides great views of the bay. The pool scene is also top notch, but the wait service by the pool could have been more timely. There is a walking/jogging path that winds around the hotel and hugs the bay through some adjacent condo buildings.The only minor downside I would state is the ability to walk to anywhere notable from the hotel. Its location on the bay also puts it at almost a required taxi (especially given Miami's heat) to anywhere notable. But taxis are always available and immediately summoned by one of the valets. However, given that significant upside of the views based on the hotel's location, this would be a trade-off I would make anytime.In terms of security, this has to be one of the most secure hotels in which I have ever stayed. First the only reason you would be on the road to the hotel is to visit the hotel---so there is no drive-by traffic at all. In addition, there are security/concierge staff all over the lobby and curbside areas and they know what they are doing. For example, I went out for a run and exited through the back of the hotel but entered back in the front. I looked less than attractive upon my return, but the hotel staff opened all of the doors upon my arrival no questions asked. On the other hand, one of my clients who was dressed in a business suit who was not a guest at the hotel was questioned (in a subtle gracious way) if they could be of assistance, which is hotel code for What the heck are you doing here?Finally and certainly not least is the staff. Absolutely first rate and ranks with the best I have ever experienced. Everyone at the ready to assist, with attentiveness that was both subtle and gracious. As an example, I walked up to the concierge and asked him to FedEx a golf club. (Do you know how hard it is to package a golf club?) Rather than the anticipated drill of filling out numerous forms and time taken for them to find materials, the concierge simply took the club, had me fill out the destination for the club and that was it!! (Of course, the charges were billed to my room) But the whole experience was effortless.Bravo to the Mandarin Oriental...

<Content>Great Business Hotel I stayed at the Mandarin Oriental Miami on a business trip in October 2007. This hotel is exactly what I like in a business hotel. The room was tasteful and modern with a view of the Miami skyline. The bathroom was very large and had a window as well 鈥?a nice touch.The service was great. Check in was quick and courteous. At 6:00 am I got a bit turned around looking for the gym and the coffee bar attendant walked me all the way across the lobby to the gym entrance. The gym was well equipped with modern equipment.Both restaurants at the hotel are good. I had a business dinner on a previous trip at the formal restaurant, 鈥淎zul鈥?and the food, wine, and service were excellent.My only small complaint is that for a hotel of this caliber the rooms should have flat screen TVs not standard TVs.

<Content>Great Stay in Downtown Miami We chose the Mandarin Oriental as we felt to old for South Beach and we were glad we made the right choice. The hotel is lovely - all rooms have balconies and we chose the Executive Suite - lots of space and a lovely bathroom. A cab to SoBe was $30 and if you're staying at the M.O. then this is a small price to pay. The service was very good, prices for meals and drinks expensive as you would expect - no point in whinging about a $12 martini if your paying hundreds for the room. For those of us visitors without cars, taxis were easy to get and there is a new complex called Mary Brickell Village which has some good restaurants and is a 10 minute walk away. The in-room facilities have it all, although no flat screen TVs yet. The amenities are Aromatherapy Associates of London - smell of lavender and rose - delightful, conditioner is great. Load of fresh fluffy towels.Pool is a bit small but adequate, the gym well equipped but not used much.Azul was a fantastic meal - delicious contempory food and slick service but the only detractor was that it arrived on a cold plate. The only other detractor was the bar - off to one side of reception and seemed like a last minute thought - slick service and a list of over 200 martini - we were sorry we didn't stay long enough to try them all.

<Content>Nice, BUT... OK, it's a very nice hotel. I did not like the area though - it's completely dead and you have to drive anywhere/everywhere. In addition, I found that the place is packed one night with people en route to cruising, and empty the next. The lobby is very cold and terminal-like. I am a regular fan of MOHG and stay with them 40-60 nights per year around the world. I will not go back to this place and in fact, I moved over to Miami Beach just to be able to see some live people about (another story of a severely over-rated and overpriced hotel). In any case, the rooms ARE nice and if you don't mind treating the hotel as a bolthole, you're set up good here. If you like to have a walk seeing people going about life, it's not the place for you.

<Content>A destination onto itself - Excellent Hotel The Miami Mandarin is an excellent hotel all around. My wife and I stayed at there over the Labor Day weekend and loved it. This is one of the best 5 stars hotels we have stayed at. I was not that that impressed with the lobby but our room was excellent and the service was superb. Considering the class of the hotel, the prices for everything including the restaurants were reasonable. The attention to detail was amazing. The pool area is a little small but we loved the man made beach. We will take the Mandarin man-made beach over South Beach any time. We made a couple of trips to various area beaches. We will definitely go back to the Miami Mandarin and consider its other locations around the world.

<Content>Mandarin is a class act all of the way... Stayed at this hotel over Labor Day Weekend with our 6month old baby. The hotel staff was fabulous. Many staff members remembered baby's name and ours. Azul tasting menu is superb. Sushi Cafe Sambal was really nice for a hotel in Miami. We stayed 3 days and never had reason to leave the hotel. The hotel is exceptionally clean which is a must for us. No complaints about this mini-vacation... Only that the pool could be a bit bigger.

<Content>Five Star All the Way! We just returned from two nights/three days at the Mandarin. It was fabulous. It's worth staying here for the gorgeous views of Biscayne Bay all around. The hotel is located on an island and there is a lovely jogging, park area that can be enjoyed. The locals call this are little manhattan and it is aptly nicknamed. The hotel is very oriental in decor and rather minimalist in design but made for a beautiful building. The room was well appointed, bedding comfortable and a nice balcony. The service was superb on every occasion. We enjoyed the pool area and ate in the restaurants onsite. The only qualifier here is the prices are also 5-star. Valet parking pricey and the cost of drinks at the bar were the highest I've encountered (outside of NY). Also, this is not a resort and not the hotel for you if you are looking for a beach trip to FL. The beach is a short drive away (10 minutes, plus time for find parking). But, if you want a hotel convenient in the city of Miami, with great service this is it.

<Content>OK for Business Overall the Mandarin is great for business travel. The rooms, service and staff are excellent.However, it is not on the beach but in the city. The beach they have is man made and does not have access to any water. Cab fare to the beach is $30 each way.The pool is very small and overlooks the bay and city.There is not much dining around the area at all.Very convient for business but not a place for vacation unless you are looking for a spa vacation.

<Content>Great Hotel!! Just got back from a 2 night stay at the Mandarin. Very pleased with our experience. The hotel during the day doesn't seem like much as far as decor goes but at night it's transformed, due to great lighting, into a very chic hotel. The staff is extremely helpful  friendly--maybe not as top notch as the Four Seasons which is across the bay--but still very good.Ate at Cafe Sambal--food was excellent. In fact, the two restaurants at this hotel are worth staying here alone. Also ate at Azul (my second time) and it did not disappoint. The service is 5 star as well as the food. Only one complaint--could not believe that a family had decided to bring their 2 year old in here and at 10:30pm!!! I was told by our waiter that it's a cultural thing  there's not much they can do.Took advantage of the spa too--pedicure--good but not $88 good. But the facial was one of the best I've ever had. Ask for Courtney  the reguvenation facial. Relaxing, amazing--no extractions or deep cleansing on this one though. It was a nice change.Great hotel  would definitely return!

<Content>Soooooo fabulous!! I have stayed at lots of hotels and this is the nicest one I've ever stayed at. Simply fabulous!! I attended a corporate event/meeting held at the hotel. The room was beautiful with a view of the city and water. I ordered room service for breakfast and it was really excellent. All the food at the event was excellent also. I can't say enough about this property. It is truly beautiful and luxurious.I would recommend this to anyone wanting a gorgeous hotel. I guess if there is one small downside it's that the hotel is further away from most things - you'd have to take a cab.

<Content>A beautiful city hotel Lovely hotel with great staff. It is slightly out of the way from the hub of down town miami but i prefrred that. Ocean drive was about a 15min taxi away. We stayed 3 nights on two separate occaisions on a 15 night holiday to miami and the Turks and Caicos. Two nights prior to travelling to Amanayra in the Turks and Caicos and the second time for 1 night on our return back to miami. The second visit wasn't planned, but we loved it so much on the first leg of our holiday we decided to return on the last leg. That, and the fact that our original hotel we had booked on return from amanyara to Miami was just not nice at all, not when we compared it to the oriental in miami and to the Amanyara hotel in the TC.Some minor points for this review, the beach area for the hotel is man made, a strip of land with sand on it with no access to the sea. Personally, i think they would have been better placed to use this space creating a larger pool area as the pool area, although nice seemed a little small and slightly crowded at times. On our first visit we had a marina view room, with balcony etc which was great, but on our second visit we opted for the basic bay view as it was only for 1 night. To be honest we preferred this room. Slightly different design to the marina view and also slightly bigger. Pwerhaps we were just lucky. All in all a great hotel, perhaps not up to the same brilliance to its sister hotel in Bangkok, but great all the same, and for me a preferred option to the delano, tides, ritz carlton etc and even the setai on ocean drive.It was great going to ocean drive for a drink etc, but it was also great to be able to get away from it and return to a refined, luxury hotel.

PROS:Bedding was CLEAN and comfortableRoom was designed well (bathroom and lighting overall were standouts)Hallways were a bit dark but coolLive music in the lobbyCLEAN everywhereJogging path around the hotel islandBeautiful pool areaService was attentiveCONS:A bit isolated from the rest of MiamiDefinitely don't go there for the 'beach' (its on a bay and far from a 'beach vacation' hotel and/or destination)Billing problems seem to be the norm (I had one also)Restaurants were expensive (but good)$5 for internet in the business center?! Come on...Did not allow late checkoutOverall I enjoyed the hotel and that's hard for me to say at the prices they charge. Its not good for a beach vacation but its a great hotel nonetheless.

<Content>Very unique experience I had a beautiful experience with Mandarin Oriental.Beautiful room and views. Staff a bit obnoxious, helpful though. We used the private beach which is not really a beach, it 's just a stripe of land with sand, so do not expect to dip into the sea. However that was nice too. Nice balconies.We also used the hotel's gymnasium. Fantastic equipment and helpful service, although there was no qualified instructor.Overall a beautiful experience at the Oriental.

<Content>Liked the service but ... Have travelled to Miami several times in the past and just stayed at this hotel for the first time on a business trip.I thought that the service was above-average for a Miami hotel. From the reservation process to the arrival, the check-in and check-out, felt as if I had been treated well.Another positive (and negative) is the location. The hotel has views of Biscayne Bay which make for a very peaceful sleeping environment. This perhaps augmented by the balcony which would allow those to open windows and sleep with nice bay air (definitely a plus on cooler evenings). However (as a business person dressed in a suit and tie), I felt a little isolated at the Mandarin given that a taxi is a must if you choose to go anywhere on a normal sunny, humid day.Some not-so-positives:- Toiletries were sub-par compared with other hotels; especially missed were mouthwash and a razor - would it cost that much more to provide these staples? - Bed mattress was sunken; woke up with a back-ache.- Hallways were a bit dark.- Neither lobby bar opened until 5pm. The only other place to get a beer before 5pm is the restaurant on level 2 -- which unfortunately is just not comfortable. Still shaking my head on this one.Overall, I may opt for another hotel next time.

<Content>How this place is 5 Stars I'll never know????? I am typing this review as I lay in bed at the Mandarin (literally, I'm in the room!). We checked in yesterday at 2:30pm and only had to wait 3 hours for our room to be cleaned. That's right; we couldn't get into our room until after 5:00PM!! Then, they called to ask if we had received our luggage (shouldn't they know?). I actually had to go downstairs, find a bellman, and demand that he take me to the location where the luggage was stored to identify my luggage (it wasn't tagged properly). Had I not gone downstairs who knows how long it would have taken them to figure it out? By the way, the front desk was completely useless. All they could say is sorry, your room isn't ready. So, the hotel is ok but not great. Last night we had some sushi, a couple of beers, Tai pai noodles and a club sandwich for about $70 and the server was gracious enough to actually refill our water glasses once (over an hour).Today, our housekeeper took all our snacks out of our room (maybe now we have to raid the mini-bar?). Literally, we had some Pringles, MM's, and other snacks in our room and after returning from the beach they were GONE! I called the front desk to complain, they advised they would call housekeeping and call me back. That was 45 minutes ago and I never received a call back. The service at this hotel is a COMPLETE JOKE. I've been on multiple cruises, stayed at three different hotels in Hawaii, and dozens of other hotels across the U.S. I'm fairly well traveled and I can say with confidence that the service at this hotel is [--] (pardon my French). STAY AWAY; go to the Ritz Carlton on Key Biscayne or anywhere else but here. The beach is nice but there is no water access and did I mention the service is terrible?? Five stars my [--]!!

<Content>Not up to expectations This was an awesome property years ago, but it appears the Mandarin Oriental chain is not investing to maintain its standing as the best hotel in Miami. It is hard to understand that there is no wi-fi access in the rooms, that TVs are not flat screen. The rooms look worn out. Very friendly staff. Would go again for business meetings downtown but only at discounted fares. The hotel is not up to its reputation.

<Content>Really a grand chain It is difficult to know what to say about this hotel having stayed there with my partner for 5 nights in April on a short break before moving on to NY for a business trip. The rooms are spacious and the bathrooms are a treat. That is the best feature of this hotel. The hotel is situated in barren condo land in the financial district. The guests are definitely of the large chain variety -families etc. As a luxury hotel, it just doesn't quite click.The service is patchy. For example, we had to call for our bags to be delivered to the room. We would have done it ourselves but they had been whipped away when we checked in and then they were forgotten. In the Martini Bar, after ordering and receiving our drinks, we asked for water but it did not arrive, even after Certainly. On the other hand, the young woman on duty mornings at the Concierge's office is excellent.The biggest disappointment is the food. The breakfast is very poor value for money (72 USD for two) with different and therefore additional prices for hot and cold buffets which means you pay a separate and additional price, if you have eggs. The breakfast is very average for this class of hotel with quite poor quality bread and eggs. Hot chocolate and a single portion of toast late in the evening cost 20USD. You are better off leaving the hotel, crossing the road and grabbing breakfast in the local gourmet supermarket. The spa is phenomenally overpriced e.g. 271USD for a massage and you have to arrive 45 minutes before an appointment.

<Content>Service issues spoil a great venue Attended the hotel on a business trip combined with some pleasure with my pregnant wife.Called hotel concierge a day in advance and booked a prenatal spa treatment for my wife. Explained that she would be checking in ahead of me and should be told upon check in that her husband had given her a gift of massage and she should book a time of her choosing. Called wife and found that this was not communicated. Called concierge to confirm that they did not communicate this to her-asked that they send a bellman up to her room to hand-deliver the message. They did send someone but they enclosed it in a sealed envelope with my name on it-my wife doesnt open my mail especially when I am on business. The concierge was unapologetic, unwilling to make any concessions and generally unresponsive to my requests. I wont stay there again. After reading other reviews-its no surprise that my experience is similar to other people's in remarkably similar circumstances.

<Content>Beautiful Place but Inattentive When it Counts My boyfriend and I stayed at the Mandarin at the beginning of February. We loved our room, the spa, and the little beach area. The hotel is beautiful and conveniently located. We had a nice time overall. The food, however, (and particularly the room service), is overpriced ($70 for breakfast for 2). Unfortunately, our stay was spoiled when the hotel incorrectly billedmy boyfriend's credit card at the end of our stay instead of mine (the weekend was my treat to him and that was made clear to the hotel). In the end, we felt that they took their time resolving the matter weeks later. They didn't seem particularly interested in doing anything of value (to us) to compensate for the error and inconvenience. This was an unfortunate end to a stay that was otherwise very nice.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel! Just wanted to say that our stay at the Mandarin Miami was fantastic and we will definately be back. The valet, concierge, martini bar (we spent alot of time there), and resturants were all meticulously accomodating. We also really enjoyed the beach and the view from our room. In addition, it was my husband's birthday and they were thoughtful enough to provide him with a birthday cake. Again just wanted to say ythis is a fantastic facility. Will be back soon!

<Content>Elegantly Fabulous Our stay at this hotel was an absolute dream. Really. Our room was average-size, but well appointed. It was on the balcony deck, so we had a lovely balocony in which to soak in the wonderful weather. The staff was great. They catered to every request - from numerous mojitos at the pool/beach to extra chocolates every night, they were great. The food was good. Just had the sushi, which was good. Nothing spectacular, just really good quality.  I loved the bath products, LOVED them. The soap, lotion, shampoo and conditioner was great. The gym was adequate, really sufficient. Many hotel gyms, IMO, are subpar and an afterthought, but this one, while small, met every need. A nice feature in the hotel, there were large bottles of Evian water and bowls of fruit (Asian pears - my fave) for the taking. I would stop by before heading out for the day get some water and a pear for a snack. The spa was exquisite. Guests get complimentary use of the spa and it was really nice. Boyfriend and I both took steams after working out and the entire spa experience was just sublime. I really enjoyed the pool/beach area. The Mandarin has a a great little beach area on the bay and it's fabulous. They have those great, big beds on which to lay and it's just so relaxing. One thing I didn't like (and it drives me crazy at all hotels), they charge $5 per 15 minutes for internet usage. I know it sounds petty, but when I am paying $500 for a hotel room, for a property to charge so exorbitantly for internet time is just petty. But they're making money, so I would do the same if I was in that position. Overall a remarkably relaxing, special stay. Cannot wait to return.

<Content>Mandarin Oriental Miami = dreamy I just spent a night at the Mandarin Oriental - Miami this past weekend as an escape from South Beach where I live, and also to celebrate a birthday. From start to finish the experience was dreamy. I had read that service could be iffy, that the pool was small and cramped, and that the bill might include extra charges. The pool was area was small and cramped (but the pool itself was empty), but the service was fantastic and the bill was correct.When we checked in we did not wait at all, and the very friendly man at the front desk (Raul) brought us up to our room, which had been upgraded to a junior suite with a huge balcony and a great bathroom. It's true that the bathroom (tub, sink, shower) are open to the bedroom with a screen that can be lowered, but the toilet is separate and has a door. We liked the unique design feature because it made the room feel even bigger (but then again, we got up at the same time as each other). The TV was old and had no movies (but we weren't there for that, so we did not mind.) Five minutes after we entered our room, just as we were cracking open some champagne, room service brought up a delicious birthday cake as a surprise! (There was also a box of chocolates, which I presume is always there.) Turn down service that night left us bottles of designer water as well. That night we ate at Azul, and the great service continued. (Another birthday surprise after dinner too!) The 2 sommeliers were attentive and helpful. The food was delicious - I particularly recommend the rainbow of oysters appetizer if it's still on the menu, ditto the salmon tartare and the surf and turf. The scotch selection was impressive. The scotch was brought along with a cup of ice each, so we could control how much ice we wanted - nice touch. The cheese selection, on the other hand, was weak. There were only 5 options, and 1 was out. Still, overall a fun, delicious experience.The next morning we ate at Cafe Sambal. The food was good, but exactly the same prices as room service - in other words, overpriced. It was a bit chilly in the morning and the maitre d' noticed I was cold and offered to bring me a wrap - another nice touch. The individual syrup was also warmed up - again, nice touch. The buffet did not look particularly appealing, so we ordered from the menu and were happy with what we received.We spent the day at the beach, enjoying the raised beds and hammocks. The attendants were great - not intrusive, but they did bring us water frequently. At the pool (where we went to each lunch and to swim a bit) the attendants provided ipods, magazines, water, mango sorbet, etc. For lunch we ate sushi which we found generally to be overpriced and not particularly appealing. After the beach we took advantage of the spa by booking a couple's suite for a few hours. As spa waiting areas go, I expected a bit more, but it was relaxing. There are two showers, which separate the sauna from the steam room. No jacuzzi. I would have preferred to have showers near the lockers  vanities. The 2 toilets were also separate from the lockers  the showers. The relaxation area itself was pleasant, although there was a guest snapping pictures, and talking on the phone! Anyway, the couple's suite massage treatments were delightful. We started out with rose petal foot treatments, while we watched dolphins dancing in the bay below. Next we chose to have sea salt exfoliation scrubs, then massages (aromatherapy  hot stone  swedish for me, deep tissue for him), then clay scalp massages. In between the salt exfoliation and the massages, the massage therapists exited the room so that we could shower (in the suite) and return clean to our massage tables. An absolute delight.Overall, despite the hefty price, I heartily recommend the hotel for spa, dinner at Azul, romantic getaway or just rejuvenation in general.

<Content>Elegance Embodied Excellent hotel, especially in overpriced Miami. Reasonable rates for the room. Very elegant styling, beautiful views, quiet, and safe. Only drawback is no place to buy simple amenities. Not on Miami beach, however we enjoyed not having to deal with the crowds.

<Content>One of the top three in Miami Definitely in the top three hotels in the Miami area - I have stayed at most of the decent hotels in the last couple of years. The Setai is the best (and most expensive by a long way) and then it's between the Mandarin and the Four Seasons for second. The Mandarin wins in terms of style and facilities, the Four Seasons on pool area. The Ritz Carlton would be next and then the Shore Club, Delano, Victor, etc. below that.For my long weekend stay, was given a Bay View King room on a lower floor, which gave good 90% view over bay towards Miami Beach, and a decent sized terrace with loungers. Room was asian-infludenced in style and consisted of large room with separate bathroom with a bath and a shower. Room amenities were a bit sparse for a 5-star room (standard shower kit, etc.) with no handy extras (razor, ear-cleaners, etc). Also the TV only had standard cable channels (plus a couple of premium movie channels) but no pay-per-view.Pool and outdoor area are small and slightly cramped - we visited during half-full weekend and by 10am all the beach chairs were full and packed in like sardines. The beach-area, outside gate across path, with a few cabanas and beach-beds, is much better - it gives you a better view, is quieter and you have more space and sand between your feet. Pool menu is asian-based and while not extensive was of a good quality.Breakfast at Cafe Sambal is a good option - an extensive menu at decent prices and there's both inside and terrace tables - note: the outdoor tables get very busy and the queue one morning was 30 mins.The 2 main bars at the Mandarin (Lobby and Bar M) are small and disappointing and should be avoided for all but an emergency last-minute drink.Service was impeccable at all times - e.g. lady delivering breakfast set up the table on the terrace at our request, and upon spilling a few drops of milk on the table, came back 5 minutes later with more milk and a few extra pastries.If you have the money, stay at the Setai. If you want 5-star luxury and to lie by the pool, stay at the Four Seasons. if you want 5-star luxury and impeccable service and style, stay at the Mandarin Oriental.

<Content>Well below expectations My husband and I stayed at the Mandarin for 3 nights at the end of February. We were assigned a room, and told that the bellman would be up with our luggage shortly. Unfortunately, when we got up to the room, we realized that we were not the only guests staying there - someone's whole luggage (including a women's purse) was spread out in the room. We went downstairs, received a lukewarm apology (the bellman was more apologetic about the situation), and were assigned another room - turns out this one is a lower category than what we paid for! My husband called the front desk, where they told him that the hotel was completely sold out and that the soonest they would be able to move us would be hopefully the next day - after I got on the phone (I am currently 5 months pregnant and had just about enough for one day) they said that a bellman would be up right away with a new key for another room. It took 2 more calls and a total of 45 minutes to have this happen.More unpleasantries. There was another guest staying in the hotel with the same last name as me. Surely something that happens quite often in large places, as my name is not uncommon. This issue, however, was too much for the Mandarin staff. The front desk, the spa, the concierge and even the pool bar ALL confused our names, despite the fact that every time I called I left my room number. We received the other guests confirmations for spa appointments, were billed for their food, given their restaurant reservations. Again, a barely lukewarm apology from the front desk regarding our issues at checkout, even as they were taking the other guests charges off our bill.Also, the directions the concierge desk gave to any location were always wrong - this was shocking to us since there were multiple staff giving us directions at different times!We did try the spa, and found both therapists very good for the massages (I had the prenatal massage, my husband deep tissue).We would not return to this location, rather opting for the Four Seasons where our experiences have always been positive. Further, based on this stay, I doubt we would ever stay at the Mandarin chain again.

<Content>tripadvisor review right on the money It's true -- the shower door leaks; there are strange charges added to the bill; the management tries to make good when problems are pointed out -- the general impression I got from reading other visitors' comments was an accurate one.In my opinion the hotel tries to maintain an high standard but the staff is not necessarily up to the task. The service was uneven. For instance, when we opened our box of welcome chocolates, they were half eaten. When we tried to consult the hotel information guide in our room, many of the pages were missing. An 18.5 percent tip was added to the checks for breakfast and refreshments by the pool, but not to the dinner tab. When we checked out the guest in line in front of us was explaining that his family had not used the mini-bar. Our bill had two nights' valet parking fees ($64) but we didn't have a car.Overall, we had a pleasant stay and particularly enjoyed the hotel's quiet location.

<Content>The best in the City This Hotel is the best large Hotel Operation I have seen in Miami.The guests rooms are very well done perfectly maintained and offer everything you would expect from a TOP 5 star hotel.Employee鈥檚 attitude is simply unmatched more like Asia then any other hotel I have been in the USA.I consider out of the 10 Spa Operation I did visit in Florida this Spa as the number one, design, service, and quality of the treatments beat all the rest it offers everything a Spa can possibly have.The food quality and presentation n all Restaurants as well as in Room Service is simply perfect, the outlets are well decorated and beautifully located and are for sure not expensive.Check in check out is perfect; Guest Relation services are Top of the Line.The pool, garden and beach area is well maintained and beautifully planed, missing nothing.I could not think of anything missed in guest services or employees attitude great and beautiful Resort Hotel with best possible quality service.

<Content>very enjoyable stayed at the MO Miami for two nights in february. this is the 8th time we've stayed at the hotel and we always enjoy it. Summary: MO Miami has excellent design, a very relaxing and tranquil location, but the service level keeps it from rating 5-stars. Room: reserved and received a deluxe bay-view room. great balcony with room for 2 lounge chairs, nice view over the bay and downtown miami, very comfortable bed and nice furnishings, and love the layout of the room with the view from the bathtub. Food: Ate at Azul - always excellent. The food as well as the service from the wait staff and somalier were great. They do a great job with both fish and meat selections and have an really fantastic wine list. Also notable - great selections from room service - pad thai and shrimp dumplings were fantastic and a nice alternative to the usual room service fare. Deliveries were always within 30 mins of ordering. Beach: They brought in a lot of sand to create a beach area with very comfortable lounge beds and great food/drinks service. You can't get access to the ocean from here, but the view is relaxing and they do a nice job pampering the guests. Pool: smallish pool with lots of chairs packed in. We opted to hang at the beach instead but the pool area was very popular. Service: The only down side. Although room service is very quick, the front desk staff is not up to the same level. We had to call down several times to report that our neighbor was smoking a pipe in his room (we were on a non-smoking floor) and the smell was coming into our room via the balconies. Each time they said they'd call him; finally after the third attempt they actually did and the smoking stopped. Overall: relaxing and enjoyable oasis within downtown miami.

<Content>Got Engaged here... I stayed in their deluxe skyline rooms. Incredicle room with crown molding gorgeou bathroom (open to the entire room). In the evening, I rented out their private beach for a propsal to my GF. I had everything i needed at my fingertips. It was amazing. This hotel is 5 stars. Second to none. From the service to the fantastic room, to the private beach, it was unbelievable. I would recommend this hotel for anyone looking to romance their wife, gf, or for a honey moon. Great for a private getaway, away from all the noise on Southbeachl. Very private, secluded place. Excellent hotel. Worth every penny.

<Content>Great food and spa I took my mother, who lives in south florida, on a long weekend to detox and relax. The hotel had a great rate for floridians. When we got there, they said they had bad news. The room we had book, a bayside twin bed  was not available..so they gave us a suite...for no extra charge!! It was ver ylarge and comfortable and the bathroom was enormous. The balcony was the length of the room with beautiful views. There were two tv's (not flat panel but who cares). The decor was minimalist, not plush but comfortable and in perfect condition. Housekeeping was discreet and capable.It was fortunate that the room was so big as I got ill and for 36 hours had to take to my bed..not a bad place to be sick tho.The Azul was closed but we took out meals at the Cafe Sambal..the sea bass is to die for and the pad thai is beautful.. The hotel does a great mojito as well. Breakfast was great but too big. If you are paying extra, I suggest splitting one breakfast for two.Thee beach was a disappointment as it is really just some sand with loungers and you cannot acces the water. The pool was beautiful if a bit small, but as it was off season it was empty at most times.The spa, while expensive, was wondeful. We had booked half say sessions and all the services were perfect. I had the hot stones and refexology and my mother had a facial and hot stones and hody scrub and reflexology.I reccommend this place for a spa break..do not come looking for a seaside location. It is beautiful relaxinf, but rather expensive. Enjoy it if you have extra money. As my mothe says..it is better han giving it to the doctor!!

<Content>Never wanted to check out We spent 2 nights at the MO for our anniversary in January. It was a splurge but having stayed at other MO hotels we expected the best. We loved our stay. We were upgraded to a suite. The views are gorgeous . I loved the large balcony. The staff could not have been more accomadating. The pool is lovely and the beach beautiful. It was expensive but definitely worth the money. Using AM EX Platinum we also enjoyed a 6 PM checkout. The restaurants were outstanding also. I did not want to leave.

<Content>Could be much better We spent 2 weeks at the MO (12/21-01/03) and had many bad surprises, like a crowded pool and no seats at the beach (except if you tip the beach waiter to reserve it), what I think is totaly unacceptable when you're a guest.I saw for exemple many daybeds reserved for an entire day without anybody on them...and some clients could not enjoy the beach, ridiculous !Go for a deluxe bayview room, they are much nicer than the ones in the back of the hotel.Room service will charge you even a glass of milk for your baby (10 US $) if you don't make complaints to the manager.Service at the Cafe Sambal for breakfast is very good and the buffet too.Sushis are very expensive (almost 100 US $) for one party !There's a very good market on the island where you can eat or buy food and drinks. Read carefully each line of your check when you checkout, they tried to put 1500 US $ not due (like valet parking, mini bar, ...)If you want to get great service you have to make complaints every day about everything, and finally you forget about it, because you don't come for that and you're fed up.I think this is more a business hotel than a tourist hotel even if the clients are more tourists than business men, that's the reason why there's a small pool, a small artificial beach, small restaurants, small bar,...It is surely not mandarin oriental class !

<Content>Pretty Good...But... We went to the Mandarin Key Biscayne over Labor Day, 2006. The purpose of our trip was to decompress for 3 days... basically do nothing but sleep in, eat great food, work out and enjoy the spa -- the Mandarin Oriental was pretty on target for our objective. The gym is OUTSTANDING. The Spa is luxurious (expensive, but worth it in our opinion). The bedding was extremely comfortable. And, the service was very, very good.However, the food was not perfect: The casual restaurant is nice -- not great -- but nice. Azul (the fancier restaurant) is above average... not excellent (we actually bellied up to the bar and had the very knowledgeable bar tender wait on us one night, which was the highlight of our Mandarin dining experience for the weekend). The pool-side bar/restaurant is below average, which is consistant with the pool in general....which is why we give this hotel a rating of above average, instead of excellent. If you are looking for a beautiful, spacious pool with wonderful pool-side service, this is NOT the place for you. The pool is almost laughable, so it was a good thing we weren't banking on that for the perfect vacation. For the size of this hotel, they should have a pool that's triple the size with five times more lounge chairs.As well, if you are looking for onsight consistant dining options, this probably isn't for you either. We ended up hiring a car service to bring us to South Beach for dinner (which ended up being worth the 30-40 minute car ride).Bottom line -- if you want a hotel that has a really terrific spa, very nice service and a great gym, and you are ok with 'average' onsight dining options and a below average pool scene, this is a good option for you. If you want an expansive pool scene and multiple onsight dining options, and aren't willing to leave the locale to dine elsewhere, this probably isn't the place for you.Note: There is virtually no beach at the Mandarin Key Biscayne.

<Content>40th Anniversary Stay We loved staying here. The service was excellent, the restaurants were superb! We even had rose pedals on our bed in honor of our anniversary. Our anniversary dinner included a complimentary dessert with a written message in chocolate. From the bellmen to the maid service, everyone and everything lived up to its name. The staff at the pool were accommodating. Room service arrived promptly. The bathroom was to die for. The views from our balconey were great. They even had a menorah next to the Christmas tree in the lobby. The only fault was with the Concierge, his directions were not accurate and he took care of phone calls before people standing in front of him.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Location My Wife and I spent the second week of our honeymoon at the MO, after the Bahamas, in early November 2006. I chose it as Brickell Key was quieter than, but in easy range of South Beach and close enough to the centre of Downtown. (From the airport, it is 15 mins  $25 in a taxi). And because, having spent hours on Tripadvisor, it came out very well. We had a suite (an upgrade!) overlooking the bay - which was amazing, particularly in the early morning and at sunset).The hotel is superbly positioned, the building is very impressive and the staff were, without exception, excellent. They couldn't have been more helpful/ attentive. It is not cheap, but every bit a 5* hotel.We had breakfast each morning in Sambal - great, again, the staff and the food are superb. Supper there was also very good, particularly if you like Sushi. I don't, but found plenty to order instead.We didn't eat at Azul, but people who did, raved about it. The Sushi bar by the pool was also very good and the staff were constantly bringing round chilled water and sorbets - a nice touch.The pool is, as some other reviewers have said, a little small. However, it was never that busy and if the sun beds are a little close together, there were never so many people that it was a problem. (This is a business hotel; I saw more people wearing suits and looking wistfully at the pool than I did actually in it).The spa seemed very popular, though my wife didn't use it, so no personal comment. The gym is very well equipped; a good range of machines and free weights - and never that busy, even at peak times. There is a map with a couple of running routes in the room, which is helpful - a reasonably traffic/ road crossing free route.There is internet in the rooms - if you have a lap top, or about $6 per fifteen minutes at the business centre. Business hotel - what do you expect? There are internet cafes in downtown (10 minute walk) for one dollar per hour.We loved the hotel. It isn't, as several reviewers have said, cheap, but it is definitely 5* in every respect and you get what you pay for. I would certainly recommend it to anybody.

<Content>Stay somewhere else - waste of money! This hotel is not up to the guiding lines of the Mandarin Oriental hotel chain. A waste of money. Stay somewhere else.My stay was a huge disappointment to my sister and me. We were staying for 5 days. Already at the check-in they assigned us to wrong room. We had booked a deluxe twin bedded room. And we got a king bedded room, but had to change it into a twin bedded room, which they managed to do - after a long wait!!Further on, there were not much deluxe over the room. On the positive side the room was large and had a nice balcony. But it had only very basic things; like an old fashioned television, a cordless telephone (which did not work) and a radio. There were no dvd/cd-player in the room. No international plugs. Nothing extra at all!!! The beds were fine and good size (but I have experienced better beds). But lightening in the room were terrible, no bedside reading lights, and so on. Also, terrible bathroom solution...I mean the bathroom in itself was beautiful, but only thing that seperated the bathroom from the bedroom was a single, thin and sliding screen. So it was impossible to have an early morning shower without waking up my sister. Cause all the bathroom noise goes out to the bedroom. Not very smart solution!!! I prefer privacy when I am in the bathroom and beside this stupid screen there were no locks on the bathroom doors....The housekeeping in this hotels are the worst ever housekeeping I have experienced in any hotel. And it is such a shame that a hotel like Mandarin Oriental offer so poor service to their guests. The second day there were no towels provided, the third day there were no toiletries provided, the fourth day there were no water provided, and the fifth day there were no newspaper provided. I had to call for everything. This is not up to the reputation of the Mandarin Oriental. The business center was nice, but kinda pathetic that they charge you for using the internet there. I think it was 6 USD per 15 minutes, which is very expensive. Food was so-so. Tried the food at the beachside restaurant and in the Sambal Cafe. The sandwich at the beachside restaurant was very plain and tasteless, but the lunch in the Sambal Cafe was quite good.A nice feature on turndown service is that the hotel provides complimentary water from Voss. The onsite spa and pool was very nice, and the best thing about this hotel, I think.The service here is very slow and extremely inefficient. It took them like 30 minutes to get some towels to my room. The doormen outside are more busy talking private stuff, than opening the doors for the guests, you have to stand in line to talk to someone the front desk (which is unusual for a MO-hotel), the concierge is good (when he is actually on his desk). I also find some of the employees to have attitude-issues, which is not proper for a 5-star property. The concierge for example was kinda unpatient and rude when I wanted to ask about the limo-service. And an evening in the pool I was approached by a member of the security staff, and he told me in a very rude way: You have 10 minutes to leave the pool, I think it is kinda rude to talk like this to guests. Where are the humble hospitality?? I was told at the check-in by the manager on-duty that I the pool was official closed at 9 pm, but I could use the pool at my own convenience after this. So, I did at 11 pm. And then this happened. I tried to explain to this guy that I was told something else by the front desk. But he told me something else, and that I had to get out of the pool. I think this guy was very rude, and it is incredible that this can happen. All this made me very angry. I also notified the front-desk about the phone in my room was out of order. They said they would send someone up to look at it right away. But it never happened. I think I reminded them about 4-5 times during my stay, but NOTHING happened.The location of this hotel is depressing and out of nowhere. There is nothing to do there. You better have a car, or prepare use taxi every time you want to go somewhere. You can still walk downtown or to Bayside shopping, which is 25-30 minutes walk away. This was my first visit to Miami, and next time I go to Miami I would rather stay in South Beach/Miami Beach area (Delano Hotel/Setai/Loews Miami Beach Hotel), cause there you will find the points of interests. There is nothing to do downtown, and there are no good shopping options around (except Bayside). You have to go up North Miami or down South Miami or to Miami Beach:)I think this hotel are on a very wrong course, and that the management should be replaced. This is far by the worst 5-star hotel I have ever stayed in, and it is incredible that this can be a member of the MO-chain. Well, I will never return to this hotel. I'd better stick to Four Seasons Miami - which is a beautiful and a serious hotel. Great service at the FS too!! Miami was an amazing experience and a wonderful city, and I will go back without doubt, but not to the Mandarin Oriental!!!I sent a complaint to the hotel manager, but did not receive any reply at all.

<Content>PAST ITS PRIME ? Stayed for a week at this hotel. Overall a very good hotel to stay at, but has lost its sparkle compared to the Four Seasons. Okay so most of the staff are friendly  helpful, but too many mistakes, it took 4 attempts just to get complimentry tea  coffee in our room, wake up calls at 4am which we had not booked, only one bed turned down at night when previously two were. Silly mistakes that should not happen in a 5 * hotel.The rooms are large  the beds were great, even better then my own. The pool area is just far too small. On the website, a very good photographer makes to pool look huge, when in reality just too small,  not enough room for all the sunbeds which are squeezed in, the beach area needs to be cleaner as well, not nice to see cigarette butts laying in the sand.Prehaps I'm being far too picky, but pay a small fortune to stay at the MO, i expect over and above the norm. If you want to see how/stay at a 5* hotel should be, then go for drinks at the Setai on south beach. Wow is an understatment !

<Content>Luxury in the sun This hotel lives up to its reputation. From the minute we arrived the staff were nothing but helpful and friendly. We mentioned that it was our anniversary and got upgraded to a better room with a view overlooking the bay. The hotel just oozes class, with a beautiful lobby, great rooms and friendly efficient staff. The one slight negative is the pool area is slightly small with too many sunbeds packed into the space. However the staff are great at the pool, they come round with free iced water and differnt ice creams throughout the day. It's a nice touch and makes you feel special. The pool itself is nice and was not that busy when we were there.The cost of the hotel and everything in it is not cheap but then you have to be willing to pay premium prices for a good 5 star hotel.Overall a great hotel in a good location.

<Content>Luxury Returned from honeymoon tour of the USA and this was clearly the best hotel we stayed. Such a great spot for downtown and biscayne bay views and our room was immaculate. As being such a high profile hotel, we were dreading ignorant staff and expensive prices but we found the opposite in both cases. Every member of staff we dealt with were very friendly and professional. The room bar, room service and pool bar were more than average as you would expect in a 5star but well within budget for the surroundings where we were and not a complete rip off as some other places are. Definately worth a look and the private beach just outside with the four poster beds brought a whole new sensation to sunbathing at the beach.Could have a bigger swimming pool maybe but everything else was truly excellant.

<Content>Not quite MO Stayed for the third time at this hotel in early October. First time, back in Feb. 2004 we thought it was wonderful - great contrast to just about anything else in Miami. Next time on business thought it was OK but not as sharp as MO ought to be. This latest visit confirmed it. Compared with MO's in Hong Kong, Bangkok and even Singapore this just doesn't get anywhere near. Obviously American service can't touch that of Asia but the rooms can and should be a lot lot sharper for the money. Front desk service just the same as any American chain. No real personality or any attempt to make you feel welcome or special. We do stay quite a lot in MO properties and normally our welcome is effusive. Here we even had to suggest that our AmEx Centurion booking came along with some benefits. Couldn't really see what they were - even to the point of being chased out of the hotel with an attempt to get a 'late charge' for our complimentary continental breakfast!Our upgraded room was remarkably small and ordinary with the view only so so. Water pressure in the shower wasn't very forceful, so quite a big effeort to clean off the soap and shampoo with the very very softened water.Minibar had plenty of gin but no tonic, forcing an order from room service and a truly incredible bill of $ 16.00 (plus tip) for two small bottles.On the plus side the AZUL restauarnt preented us with the best meal we enjoyed on our arduous 10 day (different hotel every night) trip. Super food, very well presented and delightfully served. None too pricey either for the quality.All in all a good hotel but one that does not reach the heights of a hotel group that I have long thought is about the best in the world.

<Content>WOW! This Hotel is Georgous!!!! The decor and ambiance was second to none. What an outstanding experience. The whole building is specatacular. The rooms are exquisite, and the service was impecable. I highly reccomend anyone to take the extra step and treat themselves to a world class establishment. I don't think one detail is overlooked. The view was so beautiful, I couldn't contain myself.

<Content>Loved this hotel I disagree with some of the reviews i have read on tripadvisor re this hotel. we stayed one night at the loew's hotel miami beach where we have stayed many times and then moved to this hotel for 2 nights. what a huge difference! the mandarin blows loew's away...and we will be staying at the mandarin in the future.From the time you walk in the door, this hotel makes you feel welcome. the staff goes out of their way to make sure you are happy and comfortable. there were always two doormen opening the lobby doors and my car door, offering bottled water for my drive; the front desk walked us to the elevators; the room attendants were dressed nicely and left special touches in the room and the room was very clean - my husband and i took a bath both nights (we never do that); the bath towels are luxurious; the room size and the bathroom size are larger than most; the bed is very comfortable; the hotel is very generous with room amenities; the food at cafe sambal was delicious (azul was closed for renovations). Yes the pool is small but the last thing i want to do at a hotel is sit around a pool with a lot of people. the beach was magnificent. I suppose the thing that stood out most to me was the friendliness of the staff; if they weren't genuine, they certainly fooled me and my mate. i loved every aspect of this hotel and i will definitely be back, especially to go to the spa. the spa looks unbelievable and unfortunately, we were on business and did not have the time.

<Content>Good Am a frequent business traveler (4 stars plus hotels) and spent an unexpected long weekend in Miami in August 2006. Have become very selective about rooms, service, etc. so decided to stay at the Mandarin Oriental - have never stayed before. (First - there are no real unobstructed views of the Bay - all rooms have skyline views although some have more Bay views than others.)Problems started upon check-in - I explained that I wanted high floor, quiet and great views of sunrise - as was off-season was offered upgrade to junior suite for slightly higher rate, accepted, went to room and realized it was handicapped accessible and for some reason had a crib in it, and the only views were of the skyline! They found me another room - not a jr suite - but said could see sunrise and had good views. Next morning, I realized the sun was rising on the other side of the hotel! Called manager and left message to complain, said they would switch my room - they did not call until 8 pm that evening. I said really too late and I may be leaving next am. Trip was delayed 2 days so was working at desk next day when noticed stream of ants around the wastebasket! Called manager again, heard voicemail, went downstairs to speak with manager directly - alerted whoever answered phone I was doing so.When got to desk, manager apologized about all issues and said she had upgraded me to best suite in hotel and could stay for my remaining two nights at current rate. The suite was amazing. They did not have to upgrade to this extent - I just wanted a room with no ants. Found out upon leaving that they discovered there was an ant problem along the same vertical of my initial room - and they were able to take care of the issue.GOOD: Rooms - large, renovated, nice amenities. Manager - really trying with service, manager I spoke with seems very competent - hopefully she can get things turned around in service area - she was excellent. Food - good, quality as expected. Beach area - nice, good service, did not notice any bugs. Location.EXCELLENT: Spa - took full advantage, had two of the best massages ever - ask for Beth - pricey but main reason why I would return to this hotel. Also had pedicure - always feel these are overpriced but this was worth it. Staff at spa were wonderful.POOR: Pool area - small and gets noisy. Service - getting through issues.However, am planning on returning - for the spa.

<Content>Good experience but... I have stayed at the Mandarin Oriental in Miami on 2 separate occasions. The first time (about 2 years ago) was just amazing. We had a beautiful room and were just in awe of the pool, restaurant, service, etc. The second time we stayed at the Mandarin, last year, it was still very nice, but there were a few notable problems and one in particular that still really bothers me. First, the island was riddled with mosquitos at the time. When we ate breakfast at Cafe Sambal, I was eaten alive. But the worst area was the man made beach. When we went down there, mosquitos swarmed around us to a horrific level (picture 6-8 on your body at once), and we turned around and ran back to the pool and jumped into the water for relief. I guess I would have thought they'd post a sign or something at least to warn patrons they were having this problem!The other issue is that instead of locking my purse up in my room while I went to the pool, I buried it in the bottom of my garment bag. The day before we checked out, coming home from the pool, I noticed my bag had been tampered with, but I didn't think anything of it. We ate at Azul that night and we charged everything to the room, so I didn't end up taking out my purse. However, the next day, upon checkout, I took out my purse and noticed that $40 cash was missing! We complained to the hotel and they apologized, but that was it. Sure, part of it was my own stupidity for not locking my bag, but we just felt so comfortable at the hotel. I'm not saying I expected a free night out of the situation or anything, but maybe a gift cert for a lunch at Cafe Sambal or some other token of apology would have been nice. This year, every time we went down to Miami, we just stayed at the Shore Club. There are so many great hotels in Miami, its hard for me to stomach going back to the MO after what happened. I guess I expected a little better customer service there.

<Content>When Expectation is Not equal Perception! Well, I must admit, this particular brand (Mandarin Oriental, MO) demands high expectations! I guess, one can not simply clone a service culture, a culture that has its roots in the Orient. If I may state, compare to the Oriental, Bangkok, this particular property here in Miami really does not seem to have a soul (i.e. Leadership)...though, I must add, the property itself is charming, even some employees, but again, a brand of that caliber ought to be more than just a beautiful building. The way I perceived the property in Miami, I do dare to say, is far from being a soul mate to its flagship in Bangkok. Such traditional brand must not be compared to SoBe standards. If being compared to South Beach Hotels than simply because Mandarin Oriental as a brand failed to deliver its promise: Home away from Home. By reading past comments/comparisons of MO vs. SoBE, I urge every Floridian to visit a MO property in Asia. I do hope that in the not so distant future other oriental brands such as The Peninsula and/or Shangri-La finally bring a property to Miami, so that my fellow Floridian have a chance to truly experience a service culture beyond traditional ratings.Suggestion:聽 Great seeting, building, etc. but again, if you are used to MO service, AVOID this particular property in Miami !!!

<Content>Mandarin Report My wife and I flew down to the Mandarin based upon many of the reviews from this board. Here's my review:Arrival:We arrived at 11 am on a Friday via cab from the airport (about $35 including tip). When we arrived, the attendants were there to greet us and immediately took advantage to look at our luggage tags to identify our name and call us by name as they asked how our trip was (pretty classy). I don't know if the staff has a listing of the expected guests, but it's a nice touch.As we checked in, we were OK if the room wasn't ready. We could simply wait, hang out at the pool. Reception offered us a choice of rooms, so we decided to take a room we could get in immediately. An attendant was immediately available to take our luggage and take us to our room.Room:We had a city view with balcony on the 11th floor. The bed was very comfortable. The attendant introduced us to all the amenties of the room as well as telling us to use the direct connection to the internet. He retrieved ice for us and insisted we call them if we needed anything.The room overlooked Brickell Key Bridge. It was nice enough view of the city and partial bay. We weren't concerned about the view as much as the relaxation aspect of the hotel. We put on our suits and headed down to the poolPool:The pool area is small. I was surprised by how small the area was. They had nice 70's 80's music playing around the pool. It wasn't obnoxious, but occassionally the blender would override the music. They offer complimentary ipods, lotions, cd players, water, sorbet, so you really won't need to want for anything. We would have liked to ordered some drinks, but our attendant never asked if we needed anything for the 2 hours we were there. She simply continued to walk by us. (I'll get back to this later).The menu at the pool has some unique drinks. The primary food served is sushi and it was great. They also have sandwiches and some salads, but nothing like chips/salsa, nachos, or any mexican flair. It is primarily a sushi bar with nice salad presentations, which I believe is perfect for the setting. The manmade beach is nice, but there are several boats that patrol in and out of the bay area. May get a little annoying, but with an ipod, who cares. An attendant can help get you set up for your own private bed to catch the rays, but in the heat of August, it's nice to have the pool nearby.Recreation:The excersize room is mainly for cardio. They have some free weights and some other life fitness machines. It's true you can watch t.v. while you're doing cardio. They provide some fruit and water for your pleasure during your workout. I would have liked to have a few more weight machines, but my workout was just fine. They also have a great little outside walk that runs around Brickell Island that is nice to run. It's a little over a mile, but a great running/walking track.Attendants in the work out area didn't smother or bother you. Depends on what you're looking for.There is a small playground for children, but other than that, there is nothing for them to do. This hotel DOES NOT cater to families. It is designed to be an oasis for the business or weekend travelers. Room:Room was nice. Comfortable bed with lots of pillows. The attendant was very good. They had pull down service at night. There was a little switch you could push if you wanted or didn't want them to make up the room each day or night. Issues: I was surprised to see that the television did not offer movies as an option. The television was your basic television. Someone mentioned the bathroom shower door being an issue, we found that as well. Water would fall off the door onto the floor causing a slippery service. Neither of these were of particuliar concern to us.Room was pretty much what you see on the website.Restaurants:We didn't do Azul's, but we did eat at Cafe Samba. Service was a bit slow but breakfast was good. We didn't do the buffet. We ordered ala cart. We decided to venture out for dinners. We chose Duo on South Miami, a small restaurant with a nice brazillian environment. They offered a variety of foods from seafood, to steak, to lamp, to pork, to duck. The salmon and steak were delicious. I would highly recommend this. We walked BACK from to the hotel after dinner, about 6 blocks. Tab for 2 including drinks $122. The following night we ate at Mortons, about 4 blocks from the hotel. Mortons, is Mortons. I believe I would prefer Duo's.It's nice to walk the streets of Downtown Miami back to the hotel. There's a nice breeze along the bridge back to the Oriental.Issues:We had some issues at the pool. The servers aren't very open to asking you for orders, similar to what you may have at a restaurant. They pretty much leave you alone until you tell them you need something. Some people may like this, but when you can't get one to stop by and offer anything, it's an issue that I raised with management which they addressed and made sure they met with me before leaving.On Sunday, it seemed like family day at the pool. It may have been a layover hotel for the day for these families, but kids were all over the place, the lobby, the pool, the restaurants. These families basically took over the pool and made things very loud. I have 4 kids of my own, but if they get too loud, and they are bothering other people trying to relax, I say something to them. These families didn't do that, so we eventually left and went back to the room.Would we stay there again? Maybe. I think we would try the 4 Seasons or another more posh South Beach hotel.

<Content>Former star, now declining 8th time visiting... before, they knew who I was, what I liked, bent over backwards to please from the moment I drove up to the hotel... now, no one opening front doors when I arrived, no one took my luggage, at the front desk I was asked if it was the first time visiting. valet service slow.... didn't go to azul restaurant, but cafe sambal's overall quality is lacking, compared to just a year ago when I last visited... overall, energy is gone... before, it was the place to be... now, it's just another hotel with much reputation not being lived up to it...

<Content>Cl;ose To Perfection ! Why is it so rare to leave a hotel feeling as satisfied as I was with MOMi? From arrival to departure the staff seems to want only to be sure you are having a perfect stay. Their apparantly liberal policy regarding upgrades and late check out won me over. Isolated (which is exactly what I wanted) on Brickell Key your dining options are limited to the Hotel but breakfasts and dinner at Cafe Sambal were excellent. The AM buffet with coffee and juice for $20 is well worth it. Dinner (did the tasting menu with paired wines) at Azul for a birthday was excellent: entertaining and delicious (am a fish lover but the veal roullade is out of this world) with flawless service and an engaging, informative sommelier who knew exactly when not to intrude!They do not have a resort fee , a policy I detest, and use of the gym and the lockers/ showers/ sauna and steam are free to guests as it should be. A Deep Tissue Massage was done right though the very comfortable high tech mechanised massage table was amusing.My only gripe would be the steepness of that valet parking fee but didn't bother with a rental car til the night before leaving.Note breakfasts/ lunch and poolside barservice incur a standard 18 % tip but I found service almost flawless and (be aware) many Miami establishments routinely do this as many foreigners are used to service compris.Will return.......a worthwhile indulgence!

<Content>Elegant My wife, myself and 2 1/2 year old daughter took a long 4th of July weekend down to Miami, we originally had booked a stay at the Ritz Carlton Key Biscayne. We left the Ritz early because of the poor service, small rooms and because the management was requiring guests to wear permanently attached orange vinyl type medical bracelets to access the pool and beach areas. We had American Express' Fine Resorts and Hotels program cancel the rest of the Ritz stay and move us to the Mandarin Oriental Miami. What a wonderful decision that ended up being!!!!The Mandarin Oriental Miami is just simply OUTSTANDING, they truly understand customer service, their 5 star rating is richly deserved. We were warmly greeted and treated as we entered the hotel. When we checked, in our room was upgraded to a Brickell Suite (via the AMEX Fine resorts program), they told us they had other rooms available if it was not to our liking. As the bellman took us to our room, he was careful to point out the fire exits on our floor, certainly a sign of a well managed hotel. One should note that on the higher floors that the fire escape path may actually lead across the exposed roof of the lower floors.The room was a joy to behold, bamboo flooring, a large living space with couches, chairs, TV, guest bathroom, desk and balcony. This was separated from the sleeping quarters by a very nice piece of cabinetry with sliding rice papered glass doors. The bedroom was equally huge with a wonderful feather bed, nice sound system, TV and balcony. The bedroom had direct access to the master bathroom with a free standing two person tub, dual sinks, and separate shower area. The entire bathroom was well finished with a nice Spanish marble. The bed was VERY nice with a soft feather top. The crib that was sent up to our room was just glorious, a wonderful chrome design lined with goose down, our daughter loved it. (certainly much nicer than the ratty wood thing the Ritz Carlton had)The lovely view from the room was of the bay and the Miami Skyline. My wife enjoyed the spa services. The Spa keeps an oriental motif, the lighting is low, the fragrances are earthy. The steam room and sauna are nice, the whirlpool is outside though, by the swimming pool. The showers in the spa come at you from all angles. The spa has a nice feeling to it, it certainly does not have an industrial feeling.The private island is nice too, there is a running path all the way around the island, a playground area for the kids, and a man made beach. Please note however that there is NO ocean access from the beach. If you want to swim in the ocean, go to the concierge and he/she can set you up with passes to one of the beach clubs in South Beach. The hotel pool is nice, but not huge, it does feature an infinity edge.Dining at hotel was also a treat, first we tried the Sanibel cafe, the food was interesting and the views were relaxing. I suggest trying the mildly hot banana ketchup, and the boneless beef ribs. The service was relaxed, but probably only rated 3.5 stars. The kid's menu was standard fare. The only negative thing I saw at the hotel occurred at the cafe, the sight of an anorexic european woman rubbing her pregnant belly before she lite up her cigarette was unpleasant enough to kill my appetite.We also had dinner the Hotel's 5 star restaurant, AZUL. It defiantly has earned its 5 stars. The food was interesting with a lean towards a seafood bent. The service was just truly gracious. The kids menu is shared with the cafe and again is standard fare and certainly not 5-star.In summary, almost every bit of service in this hotel is spot on perfect. They actually understand what service is, they don't just mimic it. Even as you check out of the hotel, the valet hands you a bag with assort fruits and 2 bottles of water; nothing less than a godsend if your next stop is the Miami International Airport.

<Content>Four stars from this reviewer, 2nd business trip to this hotel I was here on business. This is my second business trip at the hotel. The service at the front desk, spa, gym, restaurants, concierge....all the service people were excellent.I drove over from the west coast of Florida where I reside. The only parking at the hotel is valet which is $30.00 per day which I thought was too high. I didn't care for the food at the hotel which was also too expensive. Keep in mind my tastes are not that sophisticated, so others may like eel, and other things that I have not eaten before. I liked the gym, the treadmills and stationary bikes each had individual television sets with headphones. There were different newspapers at the gym. There is an attendant in the gym who is very helpful. The sauna and steam room and shower facility is about the best I have experienced, as are the complimentary robes. By the way, there is no additional charge to use the gym, sauna or steam room. The rooms are really beautiful and relatively spacious with spectacular interior decorating, bathrooms, showers, etc.Overall, I would give four stars because of the beautiful rooms, excellent employees, and very luxurious steam room, sauna, and shower facilities.

<Content>*** WOW *** I just returned from an amazing weekend in Miami with a very special friend of mine. I havn't seen her in a long time so I wanted it too be very special and based upon the great reviews on this site I chose the Mandarin Oriental for our stay.From the moment we entered the hotel we were both absolutely blown away by the attention to detail this hotel shows. I have stayed at many nice hotels but I have NEVER been treated to something this special. This hotel will make you feel like a true VIP and by the time you leave you will know that you have just experienced something very rare!Thanks to the Mandarin Oriental I was able to show my friend the special time I had hoped and I am sure that we will do it again soon!!

<Content>Best in Miami After staying in the Mandarin Oriental in San Francisco, my wife and I were excited when the Mandarin opening in Miami. We finally took the ride from Fort Lauderdale to stay a weekend in July, and the hotel is my new favorite in Miami. Prior to this stay, we would take an art deco hotel in Miami Beach but not anymore. We really enjoyed the quiet and privacy of Brickell Key Island, a step off the mainland but it feels a mile away at night. Service is key - don't bother looking for much (ice, soda, etc.) you won't find it. Just ask though, and you will receive.

<Content>most luxurious in miami! After investigating where my husband and I should stay in Miami for a long weekend, we decided on the Mandarin Oriental! Thank goodness! This was a fantastic, pampering hotel! The staff everywhere was curteous and helpful. The infinity edge pool was the best! Ice water with lemon brought to us every 1/2 hour, spoons of homemade sorbet brought to us as well. You can ask for just about anything, and they will bring it. A couple next to us asked for suntan lotion and magazines, and they were brought to them right away. The beach area was beautiful, right on the bay, however, there's no swimming. We walked on the 1.3 mile walking path every morning, which goes around the island of Brickell Key. We each had spa appointments, which were VERY expensive, but wonderful! We ventured out and checked out some of the other hotels we were thinking of staying at (The Ritz, key Biscayne and the new, Acqualina), but this was by far the best! The rooms were beautiful and the bathrooms were to die for. Wonderful surroundings throughout the room. We're looking forward to trying their new resort opening in Mexico next year!

<Content>What a place! My husband, two kids and I stayed at the MO on a 1 night layover from the Four Seasons Exuma on to the Four Seasons Nevis the next day. Wow, what can I say. Without a doubt the poshest hotel in Miami. The lobby was stunningly beautiful with a commanding view of Biscayne Bay. I was hooked on it the instant I walked in. Wish I would鈥檝e had a chance to relax there.   I loved the pool, recently in Travel and Leisure Magazine, they named it the best pool with a view in the world. Very Impressive. Private Beach was very nice as well. Though the real highlight of the MO was the view from our room. We booked a Deluxe Bay View ($330, great value, normally $500+) which had a spacious balcony overlooking Biscayne Bay with the city in the background. The city lights at night are spectacular! The room it self was unique and flawless. Loved the complementary truffles on arrival, very elegant. They also had complementary milk and cookies for my kids, nice touch. Bathroom was stunning, one of the best I鈥檇 ever seen. My one complaint was the hotel's shampoo, definitely a man's shampoo, did not like the fragrance. Though I guess it is a man's business hotel after all.Azul was also a wonderful experience. In my opinion not overrated at all. I forget what we had for appetizers and entrees but it was some of the best food I'd had in a while. Had a very extensive wine list, definitely right on par with The Inn at Little Washington. I loved the $15 Vanilla souffl茅 with raspberry sauce, really hit the spot. The bill of our party of 4 (on child) was exactly $330. Honestly I expected it to be more, especially compared to our $421 meal at the dining room of the Four Seasons Nevis. Didn鈥檛 get a chance to eat breakfast at Caf茅 Sambal, really wanted to eat breakfast outdoors facing the sunrise. Our flight left to early to eat out, we had room service for breakfast instead. Very nice and professionally presented.Service- Best of the Best! The concierge and Bellman were so friendly and professional in accommodating our needs. We accidentally walked in on housekeeping refreshing our room and they were literally on their hands and knees making sure every last detail was perfect. Incredible! And that is what the MO prides it self on. Didn鈥檛 get a chance to even see the spa, sure its top class though.Overall- Great Place, so posh! Definitely the place to be in Miami whether for business or pleasure.

<Content>Now, I am a fan. In a word, the Mandarin has ruined me. Why? Well, I just don't know how I can return to the mediocrity of Marriott-land and Sheraton-ville after staying in the most peaceful, welcoming, blissful and professional hotel I have ever stayed in. The staff is absolutely top-notch. The rooms are serene. The sushi is melt-in--your mouth fresh. The spa is literally to die for. This place takes pampering to a new level. Guests are cared for from the moment they check in to checkout time. Complimentary truffles and soothing tunes waiting for me in my room upon arrival? Check. Turndown service with a freshly-cut orchid and a note wishing me sweet dreams? Check. Sumptuous robes and comfy slippers waiting for me at the end of a long day of meetings? Check. Treat yourself right and book a room here. You will not be disappointed.

<Content>Simply Amazing!!!!! Thank God my Fiance  I stayed at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel. We were debating on whether we should stay in a hotel on Miami Beach or stay away from the beach  be on a private island. As soon as we pulled into the front of the building, the doormen were there to greet us  valet parking parking was a breeze. As we entered the double volume grand lobby, the 24x24 Spanish marble floor tile  wall finishes caught our attentions immediately. We entered our room  was amazed at the quality  space that was provided to us with an open balcony. I highly recommend this hotel for a wkend getaway.

<Content>Great for Business The Mandarin Oriental is beautiful - great rooms, great decor. If you are traveling on business and need to be downtown, this is the best option. And the fake beach (wish you were able to actually swim there) is great with it's beds - makes you feel like royalty.The down side is that everything there feels extremely overpriced. Massages at the spa were over $200 (!) and dinner in their restaurant was good, but definitely not worth the price tag (although being from NYC, I'm used to the best restaurants). And the service in the restaurant was extremely slow. Actually, I would rate much of the service there in regards to their waitstaff at all the restaurants and pool bar as poor - generally always very slow.Also, if you're planning on going out a lot, most of the restaurants and entertainment are in South Beach, so I would probably recommending staying there so you don't have to drive all the time and deal with parking.

<Content>nice but overpriced My friend and I stayed at the Mandarin at the end of April, and even though we got a discounted rate, we felt it was still overpriced. The hotel is nice, first class, staff is great, but for the price you pay, I was expecting a larger room. The view of downtown and the bathroom was very nice though. The fake beach and pool are nice to relax at but feels odd since you're looking over a view of downtown rather than an ocean. I have no qualms over my experience at the Mandarin - the staff really goes out of their way to make you feel special and get to know you. Be prepared to spend a lot though.I feel that if you're looking to be in South Beach more you could get more for your money over there and won't have to deal with driving or taking a cab to party at night or go to the real beach.

<Content>Probably the best hotel in Miami area We were here for a family wedding on South Beach and rented three separate rooms. This hotel is lovely...very soothing zen-like decor. Nice crisp sheets, rooms are well sound proofed, even the views over the city and bridge are nice. We did not hear any traffic noise from the bridge because we were on a high floor (rooms on the 9th, 14th and 19th floor). Be careful as shower is all glass and does leak water onto very slick marble floor, so use lots of towels. One of us was traveling with a baby, and the room set up was a little awkward for a crib (you couldn't put the baby down in a separate area in their cityview rooms...so there isn't a way to stay up and watch TV once you put the baby down...perhaps a room with a different configuration would've been better). Pool is small but lovely setting overlooking the bay. They have created a small sandy area with beds to lay on by the bay (great views), but they have no real beach. Waitstaff isn't as attentive as they should be...at the pool, they never came by to take drink orders and they should be much more attentive for a resort in this cost category (we had to flag them down when they finally stopped chatting with each other by the bar). A few teensy things you might want to know...don't try to book a room through American Express platinum card travel services...the rate Amex will quote you is at least $200 more per night...go onto the MO hotel's website and click internet rates for the lowest rates. We got a rate of $489 a night and Amex was quoting us $699 a night for the same room. Also, don't buy into the whole Amex upgrades...one in our party was promised a room upgrade upon arival, and this upgraded room was identical to the other rooms we rented at much lower rates (same views, same size). I will say that the front desk staff at this hotel needs improvement. Although they were pleasant at check in, they were clueless...after handing us the keys and telling us we had been given a room far from the elevators, just as we requested, we got off the elevator and our room was next to the elevator bank...some charges ended up on our room that weren't ours but they were promptly removed at check out (like extra valet charges). Valet is $30 a night and you can't self park. Bellhop staff was always eager to help and we never waited more than 2 minutes for our car from the valet. Meals at this hotel are outrageously expensive...if you can avoid eating here, go offsite for your meals. South Beach is only 10-15 minutes away and Ft Lauderdale is no more than a half an hour. It's an easy drive if you fly into Ft Lauderdale airport. I heard horror stories of some South Beach and Ft Lauderdale hotels (we cancelled our reservations at the Westin Diplomat due to Dateline NBC story about bed bugs there), so this is probably one of the most luxurious hotels in the area...but very costly!

<Content>Surely not the best in Miami!! My husband and I stayed recently for one night and were glad it wasn't for more nights. We had previously stayed for a few nights in South Beach and wished he had returned there again.What we enjoyed the most were the views of the city, specially at night time but although there was nothing terribly wrong with the hotel, during our short stay we encountered a few problems which in our opinion, should not have happened in a 5 star hotel of this level. These are a few: *On arrival our booking had been cancelled. Luckilythey had rooms free so we were accomodated. Unluckily, the room was overlooking the bridge/road. *The only bar at the hotel opened at 6pm, could not have a drink or a coffee before then (there was one bar inside the Oriental restaurant, but the smell of raw fish was terrible and it was raining outside). *The choice of restaurants/food was poor (They were there, but they had very non-flexible opening times and you have to hope for good weather). *We decided to order and expresso and a hot chocolate from room service. They literally took 30 minutes to bring it and then both items were cold and weak. Cost $26 (on saying this, on departure we mentioned it and they very kindly discounted it from our final bill). *On leaving our room we turned the do not disturb light on. After 10 min. we returned to our room to find a man cleaning our windows inside out. He smiled at us, took his time and left without saying a word. We watched him seating on the bed for about 5 min.!  *On the pool, my husband moved his sunbed about 10 inches so he could face the sun better and was immediately told off for moving it. They are not to be touched, we were told. All these (and a few more) during a one night stay... It might be a Mandarin Oriental, but it lacks of the class, customer service and touch you find in hotels in the Far East. Not worth the money.

<Content>Best in Miami This is by far the only luxury hotel in Miami I would recommend. The rooms are beautiful and the restaurant and spa should not be missed. The only drawback is that it's not on the beach... But, you'll only have to drive about ten minutes for that.

<Content>Shame about the flight path We stayed at the MO for one week in February whilst the Boat Show, President's Weekend and the Food and Drink Fair were on; consequently the hotel was very busy. There is no doubt that the MO is very luxurious, however be careful that you do not end up with a room overlooking the bridge road, as we did initially before they changed it the day after checking in. The hotel is in 3 sections of a curve and one third of the back section looks over this bridge, so ask for either the centre section or the section overlooking the pool. The reception staff vary in their desire to accommodate any disappointments, so if at first you don't succeed, try again with someone else! It is a particular concern that there is a major flight path right over the hotel, which seems quite bad at certain times of the day: the very expensive breakfast on the terrace was somehow marred by this experience, as were our sessions by the pool. I can't believe no one else has commented on this. Regarding the spa, I paid for a rather useless pilates session: like a previous reviewer, the teacher was a sweet girl and I did not like to complain about her, but I had thought the MO spa would ensure that all their staff were excellent in their field. My final negative comment is that the beach was out of bounds more times than not during our stay due to private parties and the time taken to set up these parties: although it did not bother us, I'm sure some people would mind if this was one of the features which attracted them to the hotel.Despite these comments, our family did enjoy our stay!

<Content>Mostly great but a few disappointments We recently spent one night at the Mandarin Oriental Miami. The room was immaculate and attractive. The bathroom is large and open to the room, however you can pull down a shade for privacy. (The toilet was behind a door, at least).The infinity edge pool is really nice and the service all around the hotel was very friendly. My disappointments were: (1) I had an extrememly mediocre massage at thh spa, which normally wouldn't have bothered me so much but because I paid $185, I was expecting a really good one.(2) We ate lunch at Cafe Sambul and the restaurant at the pool and the meals were just average. Again, normally I wouldn't be so nitpicky but because we paid between $70-$90 for the two of us, I was expecting much better food.Overall, a nice hotel but they have you where they want you...that is, if you want the convenience of eating at the hotel, you'll be overcharged. As for the spa, I suppose it is my fault for not complaining, however, I felt uncomfortable complaining because the massage therapist was so nice. I usually rely on the reputation of a place and was never disappointed with a spa service from a top-rated spa until this one.

<Content>Amazing honeymoon, Beautiful hotel, great atmosphere. Helpful and polite staff My husband and I stayed in this hotel after reading great reviews about it here. It's all we read and more! Very very helpful and kind staff. Definitely first class. The rooms are cleaned once in the morning and once in the evening and they leave an orchids in your bed) The bathroom is very spacious. The Decoration in the room is modern and it gives you a feeling of 'tranquility'.No, the hotel is not the cheapest, but we don't regret it since we had a great time. You pay for quality :) and since we were honeymooners we got an upgrade of room on arrival which was great.And the atmosphere!! they have different soothing instruments being played at the lobby every day (harp for instance). Very nice.It's not very close to south beach, which for people that loves to party might be inconvenient... NOT FOR US though. You can always grab a taxi (they ARE expensive around 25dlls to drive you there), the hotel will arrange one to pick you up within a couple of minutes.They have a couple of restaurants in the hotel, they are good. But if you are in Miami you might want to explore a variety of food there, many restaurants at better prices. If you don't want to get out of your room, ask for room service (but remember that again you will pay that) Romm service in good hotels is never cheap, just keep that in mind and ENJOY it.The hotel doesn't have a beach itself (they have an artificial one which is nice), but you do have oceanviews from the rooms.I would definately recommend this hotel. A+ for Mandarin Oriental in Miami.

<Content>Save Your Money! the hotel was over priced and did not deliver value. They prices you pay are for the reputation of the OTHER mandarin's because this one was a disaster! At this property the level of service and attention you get is directly correlated with the amount of revenue you bring to the hotel! So yea, we all have price tags in there...

<Content>Best Hotel in Miami Incredible. This is what MO is all about. Stunning, oriental-influenced decor, posh luxury, top notch furnishings and in-room electronics, great food, and attentive staff.The skyline view rooms are actually less expensive, but in my opinion are much nicer (Miami is quite a sight all lit up at night). The beds are among the most comfortable, and the bathrooms are huge and neatly designed, with window into the bedroom.Food at the pool-side sushi restaurant is fantastic, and the Martini bar is very chic.The only qualm is that we tried to make an appointment at the spa... but they never returned our call.In summary, an incredible hotel, the quintessential MO. If you don't need to be in South Beach proper, then definitely stay here.

<Content>wonderful experience was upgraded upon arrival - beautiful room with large balcony...the kobe burger from room service was delish.....wonderful service at the pool...recommend the lobster trio roll at the sushi restaurant by the pool...would stay here over and over again! i have stayed at a lot of hotels in south beach/miami and this is by far the best hotel....if you are going for a party weekend in south beach then this is not your scene as it is too far from the beach but for couples, business and spa weekends this is the ultimate!

<Content>Best Hotel in Miami I really love the Mandarin Oriental in Miami. My wife and I have stayed there twice in the last six months. On our first stay, we were upgraded four categories to a very nice suite at no charge. The second stay, we were upgraded two categories to a very nice room at no charge. Seems to be a great central location. Quick access to American Airlines Arena, Bayside Shopping Center, South Beach, etc. The staff is very friendly. The hotel/rooms are very clean. The food at the restaurants is mediocre. Room service is definitely the way to go if you're looking to dine in. Would recommend this hotel.. Just be prepared to spend some money!

<Content>Wow Stayed here between Christmas and New Year wow! Fantastic rooms all overlooking the water and all with balcony (we were lucky enough to see a Manatee from ours), bathrooms were amazing clean and spacious. We ate in Cafe Sambel one of the hotel restaurants, food was really good and you should save room for the deserts out of this world. With it's own private beach and good size pool you won't want to leave.

<Content>A Classy Hotel My wife, 8 year old son and I completed a very successful and enjoyable 7 night stay at the Mandarin Oriental, Miami on January 3, 2006. Our room was a Dynasty Suite on the 9th floor, comprised of a living room with sofa, 2 chairs, a coffee and end table, and a desk with a separate chair. The living room opened to a continuous balcony that extended past the bedroom (which also opened to the balcony) and wrapped around the corner of the hotel, so that we had views to both the west and north. There were built in cabinets on the wall of the living room for the TV and mini-bar. A powder room adjoined the living room. The living room appeared to be about the size of a normal double room at the hotel.Our bedroom 鈥?slightly smaller than the living room because of the curvature of the building, contained a wall of built in drawers and two closets, along with a king bed and two end tables. The bedroom adjoined the bathroom, which had a separate shower and tub and one sink. Although I would have preferred two sinks in the bathroom, the powder room off the living room proved helpful when both my wife and I needed a sink at the same time.All the appointments in both rooms were in keeping with a hotel of the highest quality. In contrast to some of the earlier reviews of the hotel I鈥檝e read on this site, all our furniture and floors were in excellent condition. Frette linens were in the bathroom (I didn鈥檛 check the sheets, but they were of the quality I鈥檇 expect of Frette).I鈥檓 a harsh critic of the tendency of some hotels to put 54 watt light bulbs in the fixtures so that the rooms are dim and unwelcoming. Although the Mandarin was not overly lit, the brightness and placement of the lighting both in the bedroom and the living room was such that I did not have a complaint. There were several locations in both rooms where I could easily read at night. Housekeeping was prompt and efficient 鈥?although turndown had not shown up one night when we returned from dinner at 9:45pm. The concierge staff was terrific. I relayed dinner reservation requests in advance, and the arrangements were handled perfectly. During our stay, 3 concierges were on duty most times during the 9am to 9 pm period.Caf茅 Sambal 鈥?the informal restaurant 鈥?was fine for breakfast, although the service was not quite up to Mandarin standards. The breakfast buffet was adequate (the baked goods and fruit selection were terrific, the hot foods a touch pedestrian). We ate dinner one night at Azul and had an excellent meal.Valet parking was decent. We retrieved our car 16 times during the stay, and on about 4 occasions had to wait 5 or more minutes even though I had called from the room before heading out. None of the waits was longer than 10 minutes, and on at least half the occasions the car was waiting for us when we made it the front door.The front desk operated efficiently. We were in our room within 5 minutes of arrival, and our luggage arrived almost simultaneously.My son and wife enjoyed the pool (it鈥檚 small, but perfectly adequate for an 8 year old) and beach (the staff didn鈥檛 blink an eyelid when my son decided to excavate rather than sunbathe).The public spaces were elegant and well appointed.Brickell Key, where the hotel is located, is mainly residential, and is in no way a hot spot for nightlife. That wasn鈥檛 a problem for us, since we weren鈥檛 interested in clubbing. Since we ate dinner each night at a different location (and never in Miami Beach), I found traffic to and from the hotel to be light.My only quibbles with the hotel would be (i) the lack of a separate easy chair in the bedroom, (ii) somewhat dirty furniture on the balcony and (iii) slightly disinterested service in Caf茅 Sambal. Not a bad quibble list for a week long stay, and the positives greatly outnumbered the negatives. I鈥檇 be pleased to have another stay at the Mandarin Oriental Miami.

<Content>Gorgeous hotel This is the most beautiful hotel I have ever stayed in. The lobby is spectacular and the rooms are very luxurious. Only weird thing is the window from the bedroom to the bathroon. We went on a platinum Amex deal and got a free upgrade for an extra room. The service was very friendly, if sometimes slightly forgetful. But the views and the general ambience made up for any flaws. I would highly recommend for a luxury stay in downtown (business) Miami.

<Content>A sad example of a great chain Stayed one night end of November. Dinner at hotel restaurant Azul -- glacially slow service, double billed for one item, mediocre food. Had booked a rate including breakfast. Was billed a surcharge of $11 which they claimed was for ordering tea rather than coffee. Upon return home received a mini bar bill for $25.79 and we never opened the bar.Our other experiences at Mandarins have been great -- this one is a disaster.

<Content>Great views - need a cab or car to get around Great rooms, good food and lovely martini bar. We stayed at this hotel for a long weekend and found the service and quality of hotel to be great. It is the usual Mandarin prices - so even if you get a great rate for the room - watch out for the extras (food, drink etc) The spa is great but I think over priced. Pool was great and has its own beach!

<Content>Horrible Service Went to the Miami Madarin 1st week of Jan. 2005. Service was the worst. They have a check in desk with only one person working and she had no idea what she was doing. The concierge was rude and only cared about getting a tip for a service he could not provide. Pool is very small and beach area had dirty day beds and no service.At over $600 a night, I would never stay again.Also there is nothing around there. Better off going to SOBE for less money and be right in the middle of everything. They also have the nerve to charge almost $40 a night parking.Room was nice but I sometimes came back to the room at 10:00 pm and it still was not turned down.

<Content>Spectacular hotel but some service problems Okay, there is no question that this is a five-star hotel, and I would highly recommend it. The rooms are great (comfortable beds and large bathrooms) and we had a great view of the water. All the facilities are first-class.Nevertheless, I was suprised by some service issues that we experienced at a hotel of this caliber. Despite our reservation, the hotel was not able to get us a room until at least one hour after the advertised check-in time. We did arrive early to the hotel but then had to wait several hours for a hotel room. Even worse though, once we checked into our room, we were unpleasantly suprised by two other guests who were apparently given keys to the same room! We then had to sit in the room with a strange couple while the hotel figured out what had happened. I certainly did not expect to receive a free night for the hotel's snafu but expected some sort of token gesture for the inconvenience. We also had an issue at least one night getting the turn-down service.On the whole, I agree with the rest of the reviews that this is a great hotel but was disappointed to some extent by the service issues.

<Content>Refined, Luxurious treat w/ World class friendly service Treated myself to a long weekend at the Mandarin for my birthday and it couldn't have been a better thing to do for myself. If you want refined elegance where service is with a welcoming smile, then this is it. Perfect for a meditative retreat - very restorative to the soul. The pool is not large, but it was never very crowded. It's an infinity pool so the views are nice, especially when you're in it. Water temp was always perfect. The constant refilling of ice water with lemon, gratis, was a most welcome touch for all the guests at the beach and pool. Pretty much did not need to leave the hotel as lazing by the pool and man-made beach w/ teak canopied beds was too perfect. Rooms were spacious and impeccably clean. Food at Cafe Azul was extemely good. High caliber fitness room (and of course their well-known spa which I did not try). There's also an easy jogging path around Key Brickell (about 1.3 miles) which the Mandarin gives a small map for. I've tried the Ritz Carlton in Miami as well with friends and I have to say I like them both equally but for different reasons. They are both high quality hotels well worth their 5 stars, but if you're looking for some privacy away from the crowds, then the Mandarin is a better bet. And yes, they brought me a lovely cake while I was away as well as received a lovely happy b-day message from their GM, Jorge Gonzales. Quite the nice surprise-- as I said their service seemed genuinely sincere and thoughtful. Would definitely stay again and plan to make this an annual trip. You really should try one of these wonderful hotels as it really does help to enhance the SOBE experience. Also try their web-site for some seasonal specials; you won't regret it.

<Content>Amazing hotel We stayed at the Mandarin Oriental in July for 5 nights and had a wonderful experience, for the most part. The room was beautiful with a view of the bay and had a large balcony. The bathroom was amazing; all marble with a stand-up shower, a bathtub for two and they provided the most wonderful bath products each day. We arrived quite late the first day, after midnight, and therefore ordered room service which was quite good and I didn't think badly priced ($15 for a huge chicken ceasar salad which we ended up sharing). We ate at Cafe Sambal every morning, the food and service was very good. Overall, the staff was wonderful, especially Carlos at the concierge desk, I cannot say enough good about him - he took care of all of our requests, some of which were a little extreme, with such ease and always with a smile. Everytime I picked up the phone for anything at all, I felt like someone was knocking on our door before I could hang up the receiver. Everywhere you go, the staff always stops to great you, from management all the way down the chain. The infinity pool was beautiful, get there early on the weekends before all of the chairs get taken though. The food / beverage service at the pool was a little spotty - we had to ask for a menu four times and wait 20 minutes for the waitress to finally come over. We ordered a cucumber - avocado roll and they forgot to roll the avocado in, when we brought that to their attention, they just put some chopped up avocado on top of the roll rather than roll a new one which was a little disappointing but in the scheme of things not a big deal at all.Our only complaint about our stay was when we had our final dinner at Azul, the only AAA 5 Diamond restaurant in all of Miami. We sat outside which I would not recommend unless it is a little cool because there is no air circulation at all. The food was wonderful, as a matter of fact it was the best meal we had down there and we consider ourseleves to have fairly sophisticated palates. The server who took care of us was, in the kindest word I can find, ATROCIOUS!!! We ate there on a Sunday evening and earlier in the day had brunch at the Biltmore where, anyone who has had the brunch there can tell you, you practically have to roll out of there you eat so much. Since we were not starving, we decided not to order an appetizer which our server clearly had a problem with, mind you this was right after we selected a $150 bottle of wine. Everytime we had a question about the menu, he had something obnoxious to say, for example when we were looking at the desert menu I asked what exactly the peach melba was, he responded with such attitude, It's peach! That was it for us and we made a complaint to the manager on duty and eventually followed up with the hotel General Manager the experience was so upsetting. Overall, we enjoyed the hotel very much but our experience at the restaurant always pops into my head when people ask about our mini vacation. We will definitely stay at the Mandarin Oriental again but we will NEVER eat at Azul again, there are so many wonderful resturants in Miami that will not treat you the way we were treated when you spend $300 on dinner so I suggest you spend your money elsewhere.

<Content>Marvelous hotel I had a wonderful stay at the Manadarin in July. An excellent five star hotel. I stayed in a Superior Bay view room on the 16th floor. The room was clean and spacious with all the emities that you would expect from a five star hotel. The room has three phones one which is cordless, bathrobes, slippers and an umbrella. The room had a balony with chairs and a table to enjoy the view of the bay. The only problem with the balony is, if your room is in the middle of the hotel your view of the bay will be partly block by what appears to be a condo building directly in front of the bay. I didn't get to try the restarants at the hotel, but I did ordered room service. The food came right on time as schedule with all the condiments you can think of, but the food was very mediocre.I enjoyed a day at their spa, which was very nice. The lomi lomi massage is done in a special suite of the spa with a very nice view of the pool. The pool was nice as was the manmade beach. The hotel didn't seem to be crowd at all even tho I was told it was booked solid. It could have been because of Hurricane Dennis. But the weather there was perfect. It didn't even rain.I would definitly stay again.

<Content>Fantastic... ,ade our honeymoon I cna not praise this hotel enough, the staff the quality of food, service, rooms, facilities.And although some say it is expensive; we paid less for a two course meal with drinks here that at The Wyndham Miami Beach which was horrible!!!! and although room service was pricy the bar drinks and Cafe Sambulwere no worse than other hotels we stayed in and at least here the service and place is great too.I would definately rccomend this hotel if, but be prepared for a bit of a journey to the Art Deco district and Lincoln drive where the restaurants and night life are (about $22 to $30 each way)Fantastic place i wish i could holiday with them all the time.

<Content>Spectacular Hotel 5 star plus! Stayed for three nights in January. The hotel was superb from check in to check out. The architecture is spectacular and the lobby truly elegant with lovely views and gorgeous materials. Even though we had an entry level room it was fantastic. Spacious with lovely soothing decor and very comfy bed. Bathroom worthy of a maharaja. The pool is nice and service great. The food at Azul to die for. Room service was excellent, and the staff ultra professional. The hotel was peaceful and relaxing as opposed to the frenetic pace of South Beach. The Mandarin Oriental Miami is as close to perfection as it gets. We actually extended a night it was so enjoyable.

<Content>The reviews say it all! After staying 2 nights at The Tides on SOBE we decided to try 3 nights at the Mandarin. There was absolutely nothing wrong with The Tides however our move was due to the excessive weekend rates that are applied to Miami hotels. If you want the exclusivity the Mandarin Oriental is the place to stay.Like other Mandarin Orinental hotels that we have stayed in the Miami hotel exceeds in customer service. The staff are helpful, friendly and are taught to make the guests feel welcomed. The conceirge service seem to have the answer and connections for everything! We stayed here for my husbands 30 Birthday and he was pleasantly surpised when the hotel delivered a Birthday cake to our room. The timing was impecable - the cake seemed to coincide with our perfectly with a short afternoon visit to our room.We chose to stay in a ocean front room. The furninshing were solid and were in line with a 5 star rating. The bathroom was a decent size with a opening in the wall between the bathroom and room separated onlywith a blind. This did not bother us as a married couple, however just to highlight, the tolilet itself had it's own room with a door.If I was to ever visit Miami again, I would definately choose this location over South beach. The Mandarin seems to have everything, including a man made beach for bathing, plus more!A fantastic place to get away from it all!

<Content>very posh and pampering, a treat for adults (not kids) I stayed at the resort for a business conference. I have stayed at many five star resorts throughout the united states, this was one of the best. Although at no cost to me because I attended for business purposes, the hotel is very very pricey. I'm not sure I would stay on my own because the rooms go for over $500 a night. My room was on the 7th floor; beautiful view, BOSE radio in the room, stall shower and a bathtub. Turndown service, perosnalized wake up calls, the whole nine yards. The rooms are decorated in an asian style with bambo shades and rich brown and white colors. The food was excellent. I also used the spa; this is where I thought they could have done better. I had a spa manicure and pedicure and it was over $125 dollars and I swear the nail salons in Manhattan do a much better job. It was really nothing special. Also, there is not proper gift or amenities shop. But that's no big deal. The pool ara is small and there is no beach. There is a faux beach area where they have it filled with sand. A beautiful serence retreat and visit the bar, they make great mojuitoes!!!!!! Oh, and there were star sightings as well; Colin Farrell, Lindsay Lohan, Penelope Cruz and Matthew McCaughneny ( I can't spell his name.)

<Content>Good business hotel Has everything you would expect from a good business hotel. Bathroom can also open up to the bedroom so you can watch TV from the tub. A bit tricky to find the turning to the hotel since it is not signposted off 8th. Check-in staff a bit teutonic. Concierge was more friendly, helpful. Nice gym, pool. Parking is USD24/night.

<Content>Very refined Got a great deal on the internet (40% off advertised rates) and used it as a one night stopover en route back to Heathrow. Building is impressive (although dwarfed by surrounding financial HQs and the like) and about a 15 minute cab ride from the airport. Staff are superb throughout the hotel. Our room was a bay view - all fittings were excellent and my wife revelled in the bath. And the ridiculously overpriced spa where she had a number of treatments, all preceded by the ringing of a small bell. Ahem. We ate in the Cafe/restaurant where the food was very good and again, the service top class. If you can get the rate this is a great stopover and the staff have a lot of nice touches like getting us some water for the cab ride back to the airport.

<Content>Complete relaxation My husband and I spent a week at this hotel after a hectic week in New York. We got a great deal via Lastminute and were a bit worried in case our room reflected this. We needn't have worried. A huge room with sofa, balcony, great big bathroom. The food was amazing as was the beach party on Friday nights (although lots of teenagers). We really really loved it. We stay in a lot of luxury hotels and this one truly is wonderful. Not much going on in the local area, but 拢15 in a cab to South Beach.

<Content>Top Hotel, wonderful experience My girlfriend and I stayed at the MO April 22-24. The minute you step into the lobby, this hotel will overwhelm you. The decor and even scents throughout are amazing. The service is the best I've ever experienced. All employees are constantly asking if everything is alright and if you need anything (almost to the point of annoyance, but very accomodating). Our original room had a small balcony compared to other rooms and we requested another room. A bellman was sent right away to meet us at our new room. The pool and pool area is a bit small for the size of the hotel, but no real complaints. The beach area is great. There is no access to the water, but there are nice mats set out and even raised beds with canopy for shade/privacy. I cannot comment about the food beyond breakfast and lunch at the pool as we ate out most nights, but it was very good (but also very pricey). The service was good, but slow at times.I would recommend this hotel to everyone. You definitely get what you pay for, which is a lot. There were two celebs staying at the hotel and even hanging around in the pool area. Was a bit awkward since everyone stared, but a new experience. I can't imagine staying at a better hotel.

<Content>The Shiznit If you can spend $300/night, you will not regret it. If you've never been to Miami before, note: It's a 20 minute drive to South Beach.

<Content>Well worth the money. Awesome location + Great decor + Good service = Great ExperienceStayed here recently and had a great time. Service is a little hit or miss- sometimes it's awesome and other times you have to wait 1.5 hours for the bellman to get your luggage. Overall they make up for it with excellent rooms, breath taking views and an amazing spa. DO NOT LEAVE WITHOUT GOING TO THE SPA!!!!!!!!!!!

<Content>Great Service except at the Restaurants! My wife and I stayed here for a business meeting and we were very pleased with the excellent service, the spa and our room overlooking the bay. They even have umbrellas to use in case of rain. The bell staff are so helpful, too.One thing spoiled our otherwise excellent stay- The lousy service at the Restaurants- very slow, not at all the caliber of service that the Mandarin Oriental boasts about.Moreover, we booked a reservation at Azul for lunch upon arrival. We were not advised of any dress codes at the frontdesk, during my phone reservation, or even at the Hotel Services section of the booklet at our room. After bringing us to our table outside on a balcony, they announced that they could not serve me as i was wearing my long shorts. The maitre d' even boasted to my business guest that he sent me back to my room to change- which added more to my embarrassment. I have recommended to the hotel to at least advise their guests about any dress codes, or even to have a discreet sign outside the entrance.Unfortunately, I never had a reply from the hotel, or the restaurant maitre d' about this matter. For restaurant service, try the four season's miami. My wife and I had such excellent service there!!!

<Content>Almost Perfect.... We stayed pre-cruise in January 2005 and what a treat this hotel was to stay at! Very well run and service was excellent! I normally would never stay in a Mandarin Oriental because they are very EXPENSIVE, but we got a very good room rate through the cruise line. The nice sized rooms are very simple, decorated in Asian theme. Beds were heavenly and our bathroom was huge. Loved the chocolate truffles!! This is more of a business hotel than a resort hotel, but perfect for staying a couple of nights to see Miami. They have a great walking trail around the hotel. Wish I could afford to stay in Mandarin Orientals more often!!

<Content>An Excellent Hotel Upon arrival attentive valets took care of car and luggage, check-in a very relaxed experience, was given a gorgeous room but with a tiny balcony, however, a quick call later and I was upgraded to a better room with a large sunny balcony. Very quiet, perfect bathroom, well appointed. The beach and pool areas all top notch. I will definately stay here again.

<Content>No wonder it's number 1 From the moment I walked in the door til the moment I reluctantly checked out a week later, I enjoyed the Mandarin Oriental enormously. The decor everywhere is simply breathtaking. I had a beautiful king sized bed, a nice sitting area and a glorious bathroom with wonderful Moulton Brown toiletries. The quiet of the rooms is remarkable. The terrace with its skyline views was a wonderful place to chill out as was the lovely pool and the artificial beach. I also appreciated the absolute calm of the place and the crowd that stays there. Since this was a business trip, I needed the services of the Business Center and everything was handled with great efficiency and, like everything else at the Mandarin, the service is first rate.Even the maid service is remarkable. It seemed done before I even came back from breakfast...which is particularly nice when you are using your room for work part of the day. The turndown service was equally well timed--although I must confess to having provided one maid with a fully Monte when she came into the room after a single bell ring. The food is good but pricey. I found dining outdoors on the terrace perferable to the somewhat noisy Cafe Sambal. The Martini Bar off the lobby is fun. The pool Sushi bar is a great place for lunch. And then there's the spa. A truly wonderful place where I had a treatment that was simply unbelievably good and incredibly expensive. But I would have to say worth it. Finally for the guy who groused about the lack of nightlife, there's the Friday night party at the Beach--now one of the hottest tickets in Miami. The night we were there the crowd was gorgeous, swaying to latin music and just a lot of fun to watch. As a hotel guest, you have instant entree to what is a undoubtedly one of THE weekly events in Miami. Now one other thing....South Beach has had it. I have seldom seen such a really dreadful looking crowd anywhere--a lot of Europeans enjoying their inflated Euros and dressed so badly....it was very sad to see. We were initially supposed to be there but I am so glad we had the luxe and the splendour of the Mandarin to look forward to. I'd go back in a shot...even if I were paying for it myself.

<Content>Mostly excellent, just a few negatives Just returned from a 4 night stay--very pleased overall with the service, room (cheapest room still had a nice view of the Bay), breakfast was outstanding (full American breakfast was included in our rate booked on the hotel's web site). Loved the pool, beach, and walking/jogging path along the bay. Drove into South Beach one day and was happy to return to the relative quiet of the MO. There were several conferences going on at the hotel but it didn't seem to affect the service. Particularly impressed with the wait staff at the Cafe Sambal and the concierges.Now just a few small things I noticed: the furniture in the room looked a bit worn and cheap for a luxury hotel, although the bed was extremely comfortable with topnotch linens. The desk clerk at check out was very nice but there were a lot of mistakes on the bill--ie charges for breakfast that was included in the rate still appeared on the bill; minibar charges appeared and we did not even open the bar. The clerk did take the charges off the bill without a problem but it still was rather inefficient.Would definitely return though...

<Content>Relaxing Stay I enjoyed a 2 night stay at the Mandarin on February 20th thru the 22nd. It felt luxurious walking into the lobby and seeing the great views of the bay and the skyline. My room was what I expected but I have to admit that the room size was not worth the price tag of $495 plus a night. Prices are high during this time due to peak season. I was welcomed with a greeting card and Joy of Life chocolates which were superb. The marble bathroom is fantastic and huge compared to most hotel bathrooms. I received the best service from the valet attendants, room service staff and maids. For example, I returned to my room while the maid was still there and I was going to go get some ice. The maid insisted on getting the ice for me and she did which was very nice. The valet attendants were very nice as well. The Front desk clerks were less attentive in their service. When I checked out, the front desk person didn't even ask how my stay was or if everything was met to my expectations. I also tried the Ayurvedic Holistic Body Treatment at the Spa in the Hotel and it was definately different than a regular swedish massage. I really enjoyed the spa lounge rooms with its sauna and steam room. The treatment room that I was in had it's own shower inside! I also ordered room service and the food was fine but nothing special. I would recommend getting the sorbet medley as a dessert since it was delicious with coconut, rasberry and mango. My stay was relaxing and very quiet. I never heard any noise from any of the rooms next to mine. The hotel is very close to all the freeways that lead to Miami Beach and you will get to Miami Beach in 15 minutes with no traffic. I noticed that traffic started between noon and up going to Miami Beach. Don't get scared away that you have to pay 20 or more for parking at Miami Beach. I parked at South Point Park for only $5.00 for all day and walked my way all along Ocean Drive and up South Beach. The real down side is that you have to pay $24 plus tax on valet parking at the hotel. The hotel is also located very close to Little Havana so you can grab lunch or dinner there too. I would stay at this hotel again since I did not experience any rude service or noisy atmosphere and the rooms were a delight.

<Content>Sweet and Sour My wife and I stayed here for two nights in January, each separated by a week as we traveled abroad. The first night was fantastic, among the very best of our 2 week/4 country vacation. The room was huge and beautiful - filled with delicious incense as we entered for the first time. Room service was great and, I thought, very reasonably priced. The staff was very friendly and gracious (void of the South Beach attitude). We left the next morning very much looking forward to returning for another night a week later.Unfortunately when we returned we had a completely different experience. The staff seemed completely inundated with a conference that was being held there and we were obviously not the priority - we didn't even get assistance with our luggage. Our room was right next to the elevator despite the fact that I had specifically requested one away from the elevator (and it's in my 'profile' with MO). When I asked the manager if another room was available he said he could give me a suite for a good rate!!! They tried to up-sell me after giving me exactly what I had asked not to have - I felt like I had been scammed. An experience I would never have expected to have at a service oriented 5-star hotel.That experience burned me so bad I'm not sure I'd go back, despite having had a wonderful stay on the first night. My advice - ask if there will be a conference while you're there. If so, check out the new Four Seasons.

<Content>loved it!(thanks again tripadvisor) Probably like you I like to think when I stay somewhere I want to get it right.So as usual I refer to this website.Staying here was a fantastic experience(7nights Nov 2004).It may sound far fetched but It was just out of this world.The staff could not do enough for you,rooms fantastic,good gym,top restaurants and fabulous pool/beach area.Beds on the beach how cool is that?I was concerned that the hotel was 15min in the car from South beach but after going there the Mandarin was a tranquil haven.Checked out the Delano,Tides and Shore Club all nice but not a patch on this hotel!We took a 7month old baby and had no problems.

<Content>An Oasis My wife, 8 year old son and I had a wonderful stay at the Mandarin Oriental on January 4, 2005. Stunning architecture. We had a deluxe (five star) room with a great view of Biscayne Bay. The room was well appointed, stylish, clean with a comfortable bed, and large bathroom with a picture window into the bedroom. Bellman/valet service was excellent (we checked out at 4 am to catch an early flight and the car was waiting). The waiters at the resturant and at the pool provided prompt and pleasant service. The infinity pool and sand beach area are marvelous. The front desk service was friendly but below average for a hotel of this quality (computer was down at check-out and room needed a 30 minute inspection before we could complete somewhat early 1 pm check-in).The hotel is ideally located (on a small key) for access to the downtown Miami business district, but it's several miles from South Beach and Miami Beach. One negative is that during rush hour (4pm to 6:30 pm) traffic out of the downtown area is very heavy...it took us nearly 35 minutes just to get to I-95 at 5:45 pm on a Tuesday evening and almost 2 hours to get to Pro Players football stadium for the Orange Bowl.

<Content>Dissapointed! We spent 5 days at the Mandarin during New Year and were really looking forward to our stay. On entering the Lobby we foung there to be no atmosphere and the hotel had a very corporate feel about it. When checking in we asked waht was happening and were told Nothing. We were also informed that we would not be able to eat in any of the restaurants on New Year and would have to eat in our room, not exactly the New Year we had in mind! We went on to buy tickets for elsewhere only to later be told that there was a going to be a New Years Eve cocktail reception, but when returning from our party at the gorgeous Delano Hotel we knew we had made the right decision! We waited two hours for a pizza and salad at lunch time and consistently waited over an hour for room service, even for a pot of hot water. We were charged to use the internet which we were able to use for free in the Shore CLub and Delano, which we had previously stayed in and a short phone call home cost us $90!On the plus side, the staff were very polite, the rooms were big and comfortable and after complaining to the hotel they did refund us the cost of one night, but in general the hotel just did not live up to expectations.

<Content>Outstanding One of the best hotels in North America. Amazing rooms, amazing workout facility, breathtaking views of downtown Miami. Staff was friendly, fast, and responsive. Azul restuarant is outstanding. Even saw a few models and celebs down by the pool! This place is totally over the top. Well worth the expense. You're better off to ignore the negative reviewers on this -- most were probably just upset about spending more money than they could afford in the first place to stay here and had unrealistic expectations -- I could find no fault with this property whatsoever (and that's very rare in my case).

<Content>Overrated and full of attitude... I stayed at this hotel during New Years, paid thru the nose and was treated to the following:(1) Valet lost keys to our car on a Saturday night and told me Hertz was closed until Monday unless I went to the airport - myself by cab. Then we (myself, girlfriend and 2 other colleagues) were suggested to take a cab until Monday morning and I was to pick up the costs of both cab and the car rental because they were too busy.(2) The spa messed up our his/her in room massage scheduled 3 weeks in advance and we were told to book the next day but in our spa since we don't have availability for in room massages anymore.(3) Housekeeping was sorry it was 8PM and the maid hasn't cleaned the room - they have other guests and events (not rooms) to attend to... towels did show up 2 hours later after a 3rd call but the room was never cleaned. (4) Concierge screwed up our New Years Eve reservations so badly we were in a cab (thanks to #1 above), going to a club they never followed thru on putting us on the guest list for (even though we were told it was taken care of 3 weeks in advance) so we showed up and had to wait an hour to get in after midnight.This year the same blunders seemed apparant when they couldn't confirm having any reservation for a suite and they were now sold out. As a result I am going to a boutique hotel in South Beach that has already confirmed in writing all the clubs, hotels and restaurants I wanted. I just don't understand why the Miami MO can't figure out how to act like an MO.Having stayed at 18 of the top Conde Nast hotels around the world and 4 other MO's, I found the staff rude and lacking in customer service. Overall, the location is good for business travelers but lacking for visitors/explorers. I will admit the rooms are nice with all the amenities and deserving of a 4, not 5, star rating given their narrow orientation but people, an overall 5 out of 5 is absurd for the money they charge.

<Content>Hotel Great, Staff service quite cold and unprepared First of all, I agree with most of the reviews on trip advisor that the hotel grounds and facilities are excellent. The staff however, could use a lesson or two on customer service and manners. In my opinion it's the service you receive that seperates the high end hotels from all the rest. The front desk clerks and concierge were of no help and were quite snobbish. We were in town for business, unfortunately during the time Hurricane Jeanne was due to hit north of Miami about 60 miles. Definitely not the time of year you want to be in Miami, and I realize we were lucky we didn't have a home in danger down there. I realize that it's not their choice to evacuate but when we were told at 10 am that we had to evacuate by noon and that they were not able to help in arranging an alternate hotel you realize you're not getting 5 star customer service. They gave us the names of hotels that they knew damn well didn't have any rooms available. Basically wasted our time on the phone when we should have been packing up to leave. I called down to the concierge and told him it would be well worth his time to help find us another hotel on the mainland and he basically blew me off with nothing I can do. No apologies or an attempt at being courteous. We later found out that other hotels on the water had reciprical arrangements with mainland hotels throughout the Miami area. You would think that a hotel that touts itself as Miami's finest, would be a bit more prepared for events such as this. You would expect this low level service from a cheaper hotel, not a highly touted 5 star establishment. Bottom line is, if you want to spend a lot of money and don't care about the poor service you receive this is the place.

<Content>Miami at its best If you are one that has travelled to Miami frequently and are tired of the South Beach scene..escape to Brickell Key...there is no better place than the Mandarin Oriental. Step into the lobby and inhale relaxation, have a martini on the balcony area looking over the water, hang out at the custom-made beach area..no swimming though. The rooms are amazing, immaculately clean and the bathroom, ah the bathroom, makes you want to spend all your time there! South Beach is greatly overrated, do not miss an opportunity to discover a little bit more of Miami!

<Content>Wow! I'm sorry this review is so late but just found this site. Stayed here for two nights on our anniversary in November 2003. This Hotel is amazing from the moment you enter the lobby and the room was spectacular. We had an amazing view of the bay and city. The Spa, according to my wife was next to none. She did a full day treatment and was rejuvinated. The restaurant in the Hotel called O is mouthwatering. The concierge was a great help in assisting me to get a bouquet of flowers for my wife and they were stunning. Oh, and if you want to bask in the sun there is a private beach and the pool is great. Or, you can do like I did and find your hammock in the shade and just relax. This hotel is a must if your coming to Miami and it's about 5 minutes to the Port (cruise ships)and approximately 20 minutes from the airport.

<Content>UNMATCHED IN MIAMI....AND FEW MATCH IT ELSEWHERE As someone who has spent between 100-125 nights a year in hotels around the world for the past 30 years, it's a pleasure to recommend a U.S. property that reaches beyond the expectations of both business and high-end leisure travelers. If there are faults to be found with anything at this hotel, they are so minor as to go unnoticed in the fully enveloping friendliness that is projected by a well-trained staff. The rooms, the food and beverage service, and most of all the employees are top-notch. And having stayed in Miami many times, that is more than a compliment, as it is a market fairly devoid of properly trained hospitality crews. Bravo Mandarin. You've earned the accolades.

<Content>A Great Find!! Wonderful experience! The architecture is amazing, and the rooms are decorated beautifully with Asian touches. The bathrooms are enormous, and have sunken tubs. Our room had a stunning waterfront view of the city. My only regret is that we didn't spend more time enjoying the room.Although we arrived at 1:00am, the service during check-in/out was superb. And, the concierge was super-attentive. We had an early reservation (7:00pm) at Azul, and decided to dine outdoors. There are only a few tables outdoors, and by 7:30pm, they were gone! During dinner, which was exquisite, we enjoyed an amazing sunset. The ambiance was sophisticated, and the presentation of the food was excellent. Our brunch experience at Cafe Sambal was mediocre. The food was exceptional, but the service was below average. It took the waiter 20 minutes to take our order, and over an hour to serve us.

<Content>A wonderful weekend getaway... My wife and I snuck off for a quiet weekend at the MOMi...we had a Mandarin suite with a wonderful, large balcony and view of the city...the service was superb in all respects, from check-in to the concierge to the guy mixing drinks at the M Bar to the manager of Azul...yes, it's expensive...very, very expensive...the chef's tasting for two at Azul was nearly $400.00...and a day at the spa for you and your spouse can easily run $600...it's not a hotel for the masses, but if you've got the wallet to enjoy it (including the man wah noodles with duck breast and shrimp at the cafe for lunch...yum) then you will have a wonderful, relaxing and exceptionally enjoyable time there on Brickell Key...

<Content>Had a wonderful time My friend and I stayed at the Mandarin Oriental May 14-18, 2004 and we had a ball.Check-in was efficient and courteous. Our 12th floor room had breathtaking views of Biscayne Bay and Downtown Miami. We loved the chocolates offered as a welcome gift. Beautiful modern furniture, carefully chosen colours, everything seems designed with serenity and peacefulness in mind. Turndown service is excellent: a flower on the pillow, two bottles of mineral water for the night, the weather forecast for the following day... High-speed Internet connection works like a dream.Food at Caf茅 Sambal is top notch -- special mention to the lobster and the eel maki. Room service is impeccable (the missing butter on the breakfast table one day was provided immediately and with many apologies).The swimming pool isn't huge, but it wasn't overcrowded either. Swimming pool staff was always ready to help.We'll never forget the spa, the most amazing we've ever been to. Sure it's expensive, but we felt like different persons when we left.I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a luxury environment far from the hustle and bustle of SoBe.

I felt the services of the hotel were world class. I felt as though I was in a luxurious tropical oasis. The safff met and anticiapted all of my needs. I was very impressed. I highly recommend staying at this superb hotel.

<Content>Fantastic Weekend is far from Fantastic Have been visiting Mandarin Oriental for years. This one in Miami absolutely does not match the reputation of any Mandarin Oriental. Book and paid for the Fantastic Weekend package including a Porches Boxster and American breakfast more than a month ago. We even called twice to reconfirm our booking. All along no one told us any specification or requirement etc. Then, We ended up with an old, dirty Corvett which already has 15K mileages on it. Reason? We were told no luxury car has neither GPS nor automatic shift. Corvett was all they had ... for the same price (???). The front desk repeated THREE times to us. That sound STUPID especially we drive CLK 55 AMG Benz and SC430 Lexus day in and day out. They did not know what they're talking about. There is no American breakfast sent to us also. Reason? We should have told the front desk for proper arrangement when check in (???). There is no newspaper, no room charge info on TV. Complimentary shoe shine service was only a shine wipe job. We were patience, nice and polite during the 4 nites stay. Instead of embarassing the front desk clerk, we decided to clear the bill the night before we checked out. But the Asian guy at the front desk on 5/09 night was not professional at all. Not only defensive and arrogant. He has no idea how to run his business. Yes they refunded the American Breakfas to us but it took two times to get the price right. The point is not the $, it is the service. We did not experiece any service. It's a very bad experience. Will not make any recommedation to any one that we know. Positive note: Wake upcall service and room service were fine.

<Content>Loved the Mandarin With the reputation that Mandarin Oriental has, we felt we we would get a 5 star hotel, with 5 start treatment. And generally we did. The room, might not have had the best view, but it was lovely. The most comfortable bed ever! The hotel pool and beach area was very quiet and relaxing and the spa is highly recommended. The only poor service we had was in the bar one evening, otherwise the staff were great. Also, the location is in the downtown/business area, which means a $25 taxi round each way to the south beach. We got good value for money, as we got a great deal, but wouldn't pay the full price, as we would have prefered a better location

<Content>Nice Hotel but Poor Service I stayed at this property for three nights over Easter weekend. The property itself is nice other than the balcony which is not private, it has a screen which you can see through and see your neighbors you do. However the service leaves a lot to be desired. First at the beach area it took between 30 and 40 minutes to get a drink. This was every time you ordered a drink. When we received the drinks the plastic cup of champange had about 3 oz. of champagne, half full. Although it was a good quality of champange, Veuve Clicquot, I expect more than 3 oz. for $20. $20 is certainly an acceptable price if a proper glass is served with ample portion. Second, there are no umbrellas on the beach to block sun, however when I inquired prior to booking I was told they were available. Even the bellman when I arrived told me they had umbrellas on the beach. However the beach attendants will tell you they never had them. Third, the room service staff attempted to pick up the table from the balcony after breakfast and many glasses fell and broke. They never returned to clean up the broken glass. It took three calls and still no response. Finally a call to the manager on duty and an hour later it was cleaned up; that was at 8:00pm in the evening about ten hours after the incident occurred. The manager on duty, Ewon, did not display a positive guest service attitude or desire that the service be improved. I even phoned the general manager but he never even returned the call. On a postive note the breakfast was rather good. After all we decide to check out a day early and go over to the Ritz Carlton South Beach. It was amazing, what a difference great service makes. The staff at the Ritz where all over, smiling, asking if we needed anything, etc. You can really tell that they invest in their staff. If you go try to Club Floor its outstanding. It costs a little more than the Mandarian but its well worth the money.

<Content>Nice, but never again... We stayed at the hotel for a week and the price was too high for whatwe received. The problem that makes me feel like not staying there again is that the room was full of ants. We founded it out because theyattached all our laundry bag, in the closet. Full of cloth waiting tobe picked up. They where very small black sticky ants, those you cannottake away with nothing. I felt horrible about this. It was discusting! I felt really ashamed and didnt whant anyone to see that repugnant scene. And the room, even though it had a beautifull bathtub in the middle of the room, separatyng sleeping area from bathing area, it was really small for the price payed. Decoration was excellent. Nice colors, very relaxing. Nice vanity staff. But the ants thing , made me feel very bad!! puaj!! Never again! I cannot forget the hundred ants all over my cloth! puajj!

<Content>The Mighty Mandarin This hotel is absolutely wonderful in every respect (except for high winter time prices). It is well worth the usually high price tag. My last stay was about a year ago, but I still have terrific memories of the beautiful setting, the superbly appointed rooms, and the friendly staff. The room service breakfast is not to be missed -- each item, from the fruit salad to the wheat toast looks as if the chef has given it careful attention. The location could be inconvenient, if you're looking to spend all your time on South Beach. But if you have business downtown or on Brickell Key, it's perfect. Unless I'm on a budget (and heck, maybe even then), I would not miss an opportunity to stay at this hotel.

<Content>The best hotel in Miami ! My husband and I recently returned from Miami and stayed at the Mandarin Oriental. I love this hotel ! From the moment you walk in you feel zen. The colors were soothing and the view of Biscayne Bay was beautiful. We had a skyline water view room, nice size room and balcony. I fell in love with the bathroom, most hotels no longer have deep soaking tubs but the Mandarin did. While soaking in your tub you can also see the skyline/water view .. very nice. The service was excellent, if you needed something it was only a phone call away. The room did not have a cd player so I called and to my suprise they sent someone from engineering to put together a complete stereo system in my room. Another night we needed to use their business center and it was late. We called and they said it was closed but they would send someone to open it just for us. If you have a chance you must go down to their man made beach area, quite beautiful with all white canopy style beds with sheer curtains to make sunbathing that much more confortable. Order a tropical drink and relax. Overall we had a great time and that's the only hotel to stay at while in Miami.

<Content>Absolute Perfection I've never wanted to take a picture of any hotel's bathroom before. We apparently didn't have the best view the hotel offered, but you could've fooled me. (Our room faced the city). Not one detail was overlooked, from the gorgeous room, to the unique lobby, to the poolside service. But what makes it sheer perfection was the service. Any hotel can be pretty, but service is everything. And trust me, I felt like royalty!

<Content>The definition of hospitality The Mandarin Oriental-Miami leaves 'no stone unturned' when satisfying their guests. The approach to the hotel and entering the lobby, gives one the immediate 'sense of arrival' that most hotels fail to capture. Having been in the Hotel industry for several years, I take a personal interest in 'critiqueing' each place that I stay. I can honestly say that after staying here for several days, I could not find any noticable flaws worth mentioning. The staff is extremely courteous and professional, the rooms are tastefully done, clean and well-appointed. The small touches throughout our stay gave my wife and I, the feeling that they have truly done it all for us! Without hesitation, I would highly recommend the Manadrin-Miami. They know the true definition of hospitality! What a great job they've done, what a great stay!
