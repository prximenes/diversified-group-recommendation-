<Content>Great Location!!! This hotel has a great location but small rooms. We stayed for 3 nights last June, 2008, we averaged about US$290 per night. Not cheap, but the amenities inside were plentiful and the room was clean. This hotel has the best location in terms of the best food and best shopping. Its right beside a 24hours grocery store (Wellcome), and across Winsor Mall, where there's a KFC inside for fastfood cravings. But if you want, you can also buy food inside the 24hrs grocery, its much cheaper and quite tasteful. Try the sweet and sour Porkchop topping, and the fried rice. Then just buy disposable utensils inside so you can eat in your hotel room. For dessert, theres a haagen daz right below the Parklane, so just ride the elevator going down and buy a strawberry flavored ice cream, haagen daz in HK is cheaper than the Philippines, so I suggest you indulge!!!

<Content>Average Hotel, Good location I stayed at the Park Lane for a business meeting for about 9 nights. The location is excellant when you want to be in the shopping area of Hongkong. Also the access to other sightseeing pointsis good. Rooms are spacious and clean, but service is average, especially the receptionists need hours to check-in guests and check-out is the same. I have not trusted in fast check out which was a good decision because the bill showed some irregularities and this needs immediate discussions. We have been waiting half an hour to check-in on a Satruday afternoon. Have to admit, that the lobby was as crowded as a train station due to holiday season and low shopping prices. Breakfast is very good and offers everything- for Asian taste as well for Western taste, so this is a big plus. Meeting facilities are good, view on the 27th floor is perfect. Due to the fact that service and crowdedness of the hotel, I rate only average with a tendeancy to above average when it comes to location and view.

<Content>Great Location - Good Room Great location, right in the heart of one of the busy areas of Hong Kong and across the road from the harbour. I was given a room upgrade on arrival that had a nice view of of the sea. The rooms themselves are clean, modern and contain all the amenities you would expect in a 4 star hotel.The hotel is located in a great area of Hong Kong and the shops blend into the hotel so you can move from shopping mall to hotel with out really noticing.Overall I enjoyed this hotel and would happily stay there again whether on business or pleasure.

<Content>Lovely hotel! This is a really nice hotel with great staff and service, we used the trip service to book a day trip to Lantau Island to see the Big Buddha amongst other trips and they were all brilliant. A great base for sightseeting too, there is an MTR station just round the corner and we used this to sight see - it was so cheap and easy to use. This hotel was a great place to stay and we really enjoyed it - only downside was the price of the mini bar!! Go to a Seven Eleven if you want drinks etc as the mini bar prices are HIGH!

<Content>Great Business Hotel I usually stay at the Park Lane for business. Location is very convenient--- free bus shuttle from the airport express, 5 minute walk from the MTR, hotel is right beside a huge 24 hour supermarket, across a mall with dining options and Toys R Us (a must for traveling parents). It is above HMV, Ikea and a lovely store, Initial. Walking distance from shopping mecca LCX and Sogo. The rooms are nicely upgraded and are bigger than the standard. They have a nice view of Victoria Park, a welcome respite from crowded Hong Kong buildings. Love the LCD TV. I always feel safe and relaxed at Park Lane after a busy day.

<Content>Value for the price I have stayed here several times for business over the last couple of years. They have nice meeting room space, and the rooms are reasonably priced. The hotel is in a convenient location, walking distance to many areas.The hotel is across from Victoria Park, which is great. Many rooms have a harbor view. The rooms are recently renovated, and much improved. Very good internet access in the rooms, and wireless in areas of the hotel. Room size is average.Buffet breakfast is very extensive. It was included in my room rate. A very large variety of western and Chinese selections. The lobby level has a coffee lounge that serves light snacks and is a nice gathering spot.Good service overall.

<Content>new hotel with a shopping mall I have stayed there for two nights, and enjoy its services a lot. The stuff are nice, and patient. They take good care of your luggage when you arrive too early to check in in the morning, and when you leave too late on the day you check out. The room is spacious, as well as the bathroom. The buffet-style breakfast has a lot of options, but I did not find a lot I personally liked. It doesn't have a restroom on the first floor, which makes it not as much convenient as you have to take the elevator to the second floor to look for a restroom.

<Content>Park Lane Experience We stayed for 3 nights at the Park Lane on our way to Bali. The hotel is overlooking Victoria Park where you can watch the local people doing Tai Chi in the morning. The MTR station is about a two minutes walk away and there is a Starbucks around the corner which is handy for breakfast rather than paying the hotel prices.The hotel is ideally situated if you like shopping with many shops in walking distance.The hotel room was very comfortably furnished and we had a harbour view which was spectacular at night and ideal to watch the nightly laser show from Kowloon opposite.We didn't eat at the hotel as there was so much to do outside the hotel. Unfortunately on our third day a typhoon struck Hong Kong but we only stayed in our room until about 11.30am and then went out but it continued to rain all day. I would think twice about going again in June as that time of year is prone to quite a lot of rain. Hong Kong is a great city to explore and the Peak Tram is a must along with Chinatown. To eat is very cheap but drinking is a little expensive. I can recommend eating in Soho. Soho boast the longest elevator in the world and you can have a drink in the bars here and eat food from around the world. We ate at a mexican called 'I Caramba' and it was good food and cost about 拢20 for a starter ans main and a couple of beers. We also eat in a Greek/Lebanese restaurant called Olive and that was a little more expensive but the food was really nice.The third night we ate in a Cantonese Restaurant where you picked your fish from a selection of tanks where they were happily swimming around unaware of their fate until the Lady 'Grim Reaper' of fish turned up to end their fun. We chose a selection of dishes (Meat) as I couldn't stand the thought of eating something I had seen alive minutes earlier, but you won't get any fresher. Just be aware that the traditional way to eat is to bring the bowl to your chin and use the chopsticks to spoon the food in and rice is always brought to you as the last dish. They do look a bit strangely at you when you ask can we have the rice now. We were the only westerners in this restaurant and it was packed with locals who seemed very amused at our eating habits. But hey we'll never see them again!Hong Kong people are always in a rush so when you re on the numerous escalators stay to the left as they will race past you. The MTR is brilliant for getting around and really cheap. Taxis are also very reasonable.All in all a great city to explore.

<Content>Great Location and Hotel Park Lane is at one end of Hong Kong Island (Victoria Park). Which means it is ideal to travel from one end to the other by walking which takes approximately 3 hrs or by Tram which is only equivalent to 14p. Tram stop is really just over the road from the hotel. Breakfast is superb - Steak for breakfast is just brilliant - which means that you do not need anything until evening time. Toilet unfortunately flooded however we reported it in the am and by the time we came back it was clean and tidy. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. Great value for money too!!!

<Content>WOW!! What a Hotel What can I say about this hotel. Amazing!!. The Park Lane is located on Hong Kong Island and right in the heart of the shopping and restaurant scene. As soon as you walk in you know this is class hotel. The staff were very courteous and helpful. The view from our room was just fantastic. The rooms were spacious. The pillows were very good. Gotta have good pillows. The bathroom was very nice also. They had plenty of amenities and they provided free bottled water. We also had cable television and free internet connection. The Park Lane hotel has a free shuttle bus that takes you to the main train station to get back to the airport. This is a professional and classy hotel. No complaints whatsoever. Shame I was only in Hong Kong for 2 days.

<Content>Long lines for check out and Nonworking Sun Beds If you like long lines then this is your hotel. We waited for about 30 min to check out. Counter staff more interested in checking guests in than out. Gym sunbeds; pretty hopeless. An enquiry revealed that since it was only me complaining about the old tubes and thus tanning power that they (the gym management) would do nothing until they got another complaint.

<Content>Nice hotel in a convenient location We stayed there from March 7-10. We had an early arrival, and they let us check in at about 10am which was great. We too took the MTR to Hong Kong and then we took the airport shuttle bus to the hotel. We had a nice room on the 17th floor, and we had a pretty good view of the harbour, although the smog or fog meant that the view wasn't always great! We found the location really ideal, and we would head off each day for various locations, taking little mini buses, to places like Stanley Market. The Concierge was very helpful. Also, at the airport you can get lots of info books about Hong Kong. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel, rather we went to the Starbucks which is on the 2nd floor of the building next to Toys R Us, which is opposite the hotel. Again, everything was very convenient. Hotel room was fine - I thought the glass walls in the bathroom was interesting, but glad that there was a curtain too!All in all, a nice hotel in a convenient location. Price was ok too.

<Content>Will not stay again Positives:Great location. Well appointed 'deluxe' rooms ( the 'standard' rooms are much inferior). Good view provided you stay on the side overlooking the Victoria Park for which you pay extra. Very good broadband internet speed even though not wireless (I prefer the wired ones as the wireless network in most hotels is generally unreliable)Negatives:Housekeeping: The bathrooms smell even when you check in and they supposedly have been cleaned. I found this every time I stayed there in the past couple of months. The shower curtains stink. One Sunday, I had the chance of looking at the housekeeping staff as the bathroom was being cleaned: The guest towels are used for cleaning the floors, sink and the wall tiles (even though I know they may be washed before being kept for reuse, the thought of using a towel on my body which has been used for cleaning the sink and the floor, absolutely sucks).Overall cleanliness in the rooms is also poor. My three requirements in a hotel are (in that order): Cleanliness, Soundproofing and good broadband internet availability. This hotel has the latter two but FAILS on the first

<Content>Great hotel,Fantatic location. We stayed at this hotel in Feb.Was worried before we went on whether we had made a good choice or not but couldn't of been better.The location is great close to everything you want,Right oppisit Victoria park.Right next to some shopping centres.Time square is 0nly 5 minutes walk away.To get a tram to the peak is only 5 minutes in a taxi and is so cheap.The veiws are breath taking.Not far from the jumbo floating resturant but I thought it was over rated.Be ok if you went by yourself but we booked it though a agent at the hotel and it was a set menu.Not the nicest i've had.Now our room was fantastic we upgraded to a delux park veiw.Big room on the 17th floor.Glass wall around the bathroom.Great veiw and the bed was so comfortable.Our only bad experience was as we chose to get engaged out there,we thought we would have a good meal no expense spared.We went to the restrurant on the top floor of the hotel.Great setting looking over Hong Kong at night.We spent about 150 pounds on a meal and it was crap,I've had better fast food and I don't eat that really.Was really overrated.My salmon was raw and had to go back.Which ment we ate sepratetly to each other which annoyed us,Plus it just didn't taste good and the Champane was horrible.All in all a dissapointing evening.Found lots of other places to eat in time square several floors up.I would stay here again its a great choice.It's just hard to get your bearings and know where the best places to go are when you are only there 4 days.

<Content>good choice We just went to Hong Kong last week (jan.14-16). There are 4 adults 1 child and 1 baby, and they got us a connecting room as we requested. They have a promotion for an upgrade to a new delux room with an extra of HK$200/night/room. And it's worth paying, the room is new and looks spacious. Very nice bathroom with the glass wall on one side. Very good location....IKEA just down below the hotel and Toys R us just opposite hotel. Causeway bay has everything you are looking for food and shopping......All imported brands and HKG young designers' are just few steps away, the area is so lively.....many shops open until midnight. There is a big supermarket just right next to the hotel. Times Square is only about 5-10 min walk. Along that walk, u'll never get bored!! MTR is so close...and you can get to Landmark in central or Pacific Place in Admiralty within minutes. Hotel food is also quite goood if you happen to get hungry and dont feel like walking around. But heard from my friend that the old standard room is small and not very impressive. BTW..there is another good hotel nearby (the Excelsior hotel) but I think Park LAne's new delux room is nicer than Excelsior's delux room (although Excelsior has very nice complete harbour view while PArk Lane has only half harbour view+city view.)Anyway......I recommend you book at Park Lane for a standard or superior room and ask for and upgrade to new delux (with park view) with a littel extra money. You wont be disappionted.

<Content>Great as Usual I've stayed at the Park Lane many years ago and found it a great hotel. Coming back after probably 10 years, it still meets my expectations and more! We got upgraded to a deluxe room -- for what reason, I don't really know -- and the room was beautiful. I had a nice view of the Victoria Park and the city's skyline. The facilities were first class and the breakfast buffet was filling. Service is quite fast and good too. My dad got a bad case of bronchitis too while we were there and thankfully, the hotel had a doctor who had consultations daily. He was able to give us the necessary antibiotics and other medicines for my dad's illness.

<Content>stop-over We stayed in Hong Kong on the way home from a holiday in Australia. We had a room overlooking Victoria Park and the room was very comfortable and clean. Good location, god views of park and harbour. The hotel staff were very helpful and polite. Enjoyed a meal and breakfast in Cafe One. All-in-all a very pleasant stay. Not sure Hong Kong is one of our favourite places but it was an experience we wouldn't have missed.

<Content>Park Lane was ok but ask for the newly rennovated rooms We were in Hong Kong August 30-September 2 for a conference and had to stay at Causeway bay to be near the venue. We chose Park Lane as recommended by our travel agent. Line to check-in reception took 20 minutes as the hotel is full, according to reception desk. My husband  I decided not to upgrade as we expect to be out the whole day and my travel agent assured me this is a premium hotel.  I made sure upon reservation that I want a double or queen sized bed but to my dismay, we were given twin beds(2 single) and the bed seem like tired. And the bathroom smells musty. Fixtures have seen better days. It is a non-smoking floor but the room smels smoke. I am sensitive to this. I tried to call reception but nobody answers the phone so I tried to call concierge and he was the one who connected me to reception. After minutes of waiting, I was told I cannot transfer to another room because the hotel is full. What's the point of making a reservation 2 weeks prior to our arrival??? Anyway, they assured us that they will move us to another room the next day. The room they gave us was much better, smells clean  smoke-free, the bathroom looks newly renovated (glass walls that look into the bedroom). Next time, ask for the newly renovated rooms and that overlooks the park. The view we had on both rooms is the back of an apartment building and you can see clothes hanging out of their windows. The good thing we love in this hotel is their LCD tv.   Location is good, SOGO is like a 5mins walk, MTR station is about 3mins walk. IKEA is at the basement of the hotel. And a Wellcome Supermart 24/7 is just next door. We love the peeled fresh fruits stand by the door. Saves you from the long check-out lines.   We didn't try their buffet resto at the g/f but it was packed with diners during the friday  saturday we were there. My husband  I always go to our favorite, Happy Garden Noodle House on Canton Road in Tsim Sha Tsui even if it meant taking the MTR.  Will I stay again at Park Lane? Maybe, if only because of another conference. But we will still go back staying at Kowloon side hotels because it is more convenient for shopping.

<Content>Great Hotel! We stayed at the Park Lane for 5 nights in the middle of August this year before heading onto Dubai.We arrived at the hotel at around 1am and were told that due to our late arrival (our flight was on time, but it was late in the day) the room category we had booked was no longer available and therefore they would upgrade us to a Premium Club room.The room was beautiful with lovely views over the harbour. They did advise us that there was some renovations going on in the hotel, but to be honest, we never once heard anything and were never disturbed. The hotel breakfasts were lovely and and catered for all tastes. We also had a buffet lunch there once and that too was fantastic.The hotel is located within a few mins walk of the metro station, but there is also so much shopping to be done in and around the Causeway Bay area. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpfull. When we checked-out we must have somehow forgotten our passports and tickets on the table in the room. As we were leaving the reception the receptionist called out to us and informed us that housekeeping had just been into the room to clean it and had seen it. My husband was about to go back up when the lady who was responsible for fininding it came downstairs and personally handed it to us. She insisted that we check everything was as it should be and said the minute she went in the room she realised we were leaving and called straight down to reception. We were so grateful, we would have had all sorts of nightmares if we hadn't realised till we got to the airport! This hotel has a great location and so many places are easily accessible from here (either by foot or via the metro) and if returning to HK, we would definately stay here again.

<Content>Nice hotel.. good location We stayed in the hotel as a stop over before coming back to the UK. We booked a park view which was fantastic. Overall we were impressed when we first arrived. The porters took care of our bags and the service was very good. The room was spotless and luxurious too.We had one niggle though.. when ordering room service the food arrived nearly cold and the cost compared to what we received wasnt that great. I made a complaint and I received a very sincere apology from the head of catering along with a gift for my wife.Customer service is very good in this hotel.The breakfast was excellent.. huge array of pastries, american breakfast, fruits, dim sum and juices. I was very impressed with the selection.I would recommend this hotel... but park view is a must.

<Content>4 day stop-over Stayed here for the first four nights of our honeymoon. Chose to upgrade on arrival to the premium club rooms (30 uk pounds per day) -excellent value. Room overlooking harbour, private lounge, breakfast,free drinks (premium brands) between 6pm-8pm, free internet, + other ameneties. Can't speak for other rooms, but ours was modern, stylish and had great view over harbour.All staff without exception have been extremely friendly, courteous, and polite. The attention to detail at the hotel has been impressive (albeit this is in the premium lounge). Location of hotel is excellent (as previously mentioned in other reviews). Would definately recommend staying here - and would particularly recommend upgrading to the premium club.

<Content>Convenient location My husband and I stayed at the Park Lane from 18th to 26th February. The lobby was nicely decorated for Chinese New Year. All of the staff, without exception, were super friendly. Out travel agent made a mistake, so we ended up having a room looking out onto a back of another building. But the room itself was modern, clean with a lovely bathroom, that had a glass wall instead of being enclosed. The breakfast buffet was included in our package and there was a lot to choose from. Either continental style or Chinese. The food was fresh and they kept topping everything up. Best of all was the location of this hotel. The MTR (subway) is only a block away and this takes you to all the popular places. But Causeway Bay itself is so exciting with so many shops. Try Sogo or Times Square. The Windsor House opposite is being renovated. There will be many more shops just across the road. A bonus was Victoria Park, also across the road. Nice for a peaceful walk after breakfast. If we visit Hong Kong again, we will definitely stay at the Park Lane again.

<Content>Lovely Hotel, Good Location I stayed at this hotel with my b/friend 17Feb - 21Feb Room (908) was lovely, bed so comfy, shower always had hot water! and the room was HUGE, we over looked the park so we had a great view to! Room was clean everyday with fresh towels left, Staff were very helpful, i.e they booked us a table at the Jumbo resturant! and gave us any infomation we asked about regarding tourist attractions Food in the cafe one was lovely, perhaps a little over priced for what of the buffet we ate, but if you do like lobster and sushi etc it would be well worth the money!All in all i enjoyed my trip to hong kong! but i think if i went again i would stay on the other island, as there are more designer shops (gucci, tiffanys, louis vuitton etc) and also all the well known markets are on the other islandHave a great Holiday

<Content>Great location, but hotel nothing to shout about! Stayed at the Park Lane Hotel for 2 nights from 26th December '06, on the way to Oz. Hotel has an excellent location,which gave me quick and easy access to all the places I wanted to visit. The Hotel itself was of a good standard and the service I received was excellent, but the hotel lacks character. It appeared to me that staff were more interested in accommodating the locals who were attending wedding functions etc. than tourists (such as myself). Overall, I did not allow this to spoil my experience, and would recommend this hotel for a stop-over as I paid a very reasonable price for my stay.

<Content>The worst part of my trip! I stayed at the Park Lane for 4 nights and those were probably the most unpleasant I've ever encountered, ever.We requested for early check-in as we had an early flight but when we arrived at 1.30pm, we were told that our rooms werent ready and we had to wait till 2pm (their official check in time). I started to get slightly irritated but i didnt want it to spoil th rest of the trip. Hence. we sat around the lobby and it was only 2.45pm that we got our room!!!!!! Front desk staff were not the least bit apologetic. I was fuming by then and when I sat on the bed, I almost fell right through it. It was low, soft and we suffered backaches every morning for the rest of our stay. The room was depressing as it seriously needed refurbishment (carpets stained, furniture chipped -- I can go on and on). As for food, we ate breakfast there once, and dinner at the top floor one night (cant remember the name because it wasnt worth remembering). Service was average. Overall I really wouldnt recommend this hotel -- hop over to the Excelsior next door.

<Content>Get a good room We stopped in HK for two nights en route to Oz. The Hotel is well situated and the lobby and public areas were smart.The first room we were shown was pretty ordinary though considering the hotel were aware this was our honeymoon trip and it overlooked the roof of an adjoining building. We asked for another room and for a minimal cost we were given an exec room with all the extras which had a great park view.Staff were efficient rather than friendly but overall there was nothing to complain about. The hotel was professional if characterless. Also don't expect to be able to get a drink after midnight anywhere in the hotel. There are limited bars with restricted opening hours. Get a cab to the night markets instead.

<Content>WORST HOTEL I HAVE STAYED IN EVER I had the displeasure of staying at this horrible hotel. They have old and refurbished rooms and unfortunately I ended up in one of the old rooms so this review pertains to my bad stay in this room and the bad hotel management. BAD THINGS ABOUT THE ROOM : It does not have temperature control, you have to adjust the low, med, high until you get the it right. Sometimes the low is quite cold and you can switch it off and wake up hot in the middle of the night. There is some kind of flying insect in my room. I killed one yesterday and there is another flying around as I type this. RECEPTION and CHECK IN : I asked for a room upgrade and was denied one unless I pay a certain amount for the upgrade. I was also told that there were no refurbished rooms available for me to move to. That same day my colleague checks in and she gets a upgraded refurbised room without paying an additional fee. Wonderful. To provide some constructive criticism, perhaps they should note down the people who request for an upgrade and give it to them in the order it was asked not as and when they feel like it. When I asked about this, the reception manager jessica was unable to give me a room (as usual) and offered to give me one the last night of my stay which doesn't make sense because of the trouble it takes to move everything for one night. I hope I never stay in this hotel again.

<Content>Probably great, if you are white! I hate having to write this. I am of Indian origin. Today, I went to the Premier Club (where I have been going almost daily for the last 12 days). For the first time, I wnt in flip-flops. Upon walking in, within 30 seconds, I was told I had violated the dress code and needed to weart shoes. So, OK. Rules is rules, right? I went to my room, got back, ate the (pretty nice) hors doeuvres. Sitting next to me, with their legs otustretched, in all their flip-flop glory were a white man and woman. The same lady who noticed my flip flop in 30 seconds, completely missed the outstretched white legs.So, like I say, good if you have the right skin color. Be prepared for poor treatment otherwise.

<Content>Top Marks for Park Lane Just returned from Hong Kong after staying there whilst on honeymoon. We had never been before and were a bit nervous about the whole trip. After a long flight we were whisked to the hotel in a limo which took around 40 minutes. On arrival at the hotel we were greeted with the friendliest and most curtious staff ever imaginable. The check in was bright, spacious and very friendly. the member of staff dealing with us spoke excellent english and gave us a very warm welcome.After being assigned our room the bell boys took our baggage to the room and dropped it off with a smile. The room itself overlooked the victoria park and was on the 23rd floor. Great facilities, i.e- lcd television, mini bar, etc. Once we settled in we took off for a walk around, facilities were second to none, shops, restaraunts, health spa, hair dressers, etc.We went to see the hotel concierge and once again were greeted with the most friendliest of staff who helped us to no end.Needless to say we had a fantastic time in this hotel and would have no hesitation in either staying again or reccomendation. Top marks...

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Location Stayed here in July on the way to Australia. When we got to the hotel we were really suprised this was the cheapest of all the hotels we had booked and for the money it was fantastic. On arrival we got a free upgrade on a high floor looking straight over to the lights of Kowloon. The room was very nice and every day was cleaned well. The breakfast was very good and the menu food was too.The location is causeway bay which is a shopping area and the shopping for women here is amazing. Just round the corner of the hotel was the underground so getting anywhere was very easy. There are not too many bars about as the tax on alcohol is 40% steap !! But if you want a night on the beers go to the area Lang Kwai Fong which is a full street of top bars and clubs we got very drunk on one of our nights in Hong Kong. Also taxis are cheap in Hong Kong (a tip is to get a business card from your hotel as its name is written in English and cantonese so you can just show the taxi driver the card to avoid any confusion). Use the Star Ferry go for one close to 8 o' clock from Hong Kong to Kowloon and see the light show for 17 pence, great. Then go to the Peninsula for cocktails or go to the Temple Street Market or Ladies Markets.

<Content>Great hotel and location We had a great stay at the Park Lane Hotel HK, we booked through Expedia and got a free upgrade onto the 22nd floor (premium club) overlooking Victoria Park. Room, staff were all fabulous and we have no complaints - would recommend this hotel to anyone.An added bonus was the complimentary breakfast, afternoon tea and cocktails in the lounge area of the 22nd floor. A lovely touch.

<Content>not happy Family group travelling ,We booked directly online with this hotel and were given a confirmation that we would receive a deluxe room overlooking the harbourand park.On arrival when we booked in we were given a room overlooking another building and the room was only set up for a couple. It took the hotel nearly two hours to rectify the mistake and little compassion and no apologies for the mistake.

<Content>City View Nice and clean rooms ... very clean actually.Bathroom wall was fun ... curved glass.Great beds. On the right side of hard.Could do with wifi but hey ho.When I checked in, I asked for a non-smoking room. The desk responded by saying that I was scheduled for a smoking room but with a view of the harbour/victoria park. If I wanted to be in a no-smoking room, it was a city view -- but the room was on a higher floor (18 Vs 4) and was bigger. They showed me a pic of a cityview room complete with HK skyscraper skyline visible thru the window.I agreed providing it was no extra $. They confirmed same price and made me sign I'd been told cityview.I should have known.View was directly into someone's front room across the block. If I craned my neck, i could just about see the harbour.Apart from that, nice place reasonably priced.

<Content>Great location! We had the rare opportunity to stay in three different room types in this hotel! I was there for business, and my husband came along for fun. So we started in a standard room with no view. Actually, the view was an ugly courtyard with air conditioner units. But the room was fine. Typical hotel room, and we didn't experience any of the noise others have encountered at the hotel. Good amount of space, had a table and chair. Very polite wait staff, pretty good buffets at Cafe One. But the location was great. Every night, we'd wander the streets of Causeway Bay and soak in the electric lights and lively crowds. You're close to the subway, which we took everywhere. It's very safe and easy to use - and sooo much faster than cabs. Anyways, after my work was done, we stayed for the weekend and upgraded rooms to a Deluxe Standard with Harbour/City views. The city views were magnificent! So much better than the ocean, even. And this room seemed to have been recently remodeled. Cool glass walls around the bathroom (there is a shade if you need privacy), comfy bed, plenty of space. We did experience some noise on our last night in this room, however. We called the front desk and were informed that we were under an event room, so they upgraded us to a suite for our final night! We moved, even though we really liked our room. And I must say, we prefered the Deluxe Room over the Suite. The suite had tons of space. A separate sitting area with flat screen TV. The bedroom is bigger, and there were one and half baths, a stand alone bathtub. So there is TONS of room. However, it was not renovated like our previous room. There was cheap fake wood-like panelling and it was just not very nice. Great view, but no better than our other. It was great to have the space, but unless you need it, opt for the Deluxe Room for the money. Overall, we loved the Park Lane and would stay again. Not fancy, but very nice, terrific service, great location. Oh - another tip. Some Korean friends of mine were visiting and shared a gem with us - near the hotel is a massage place called The Big Bucket. The hotel didn't even know it. It's totally legit (just massages) and cheap. It was like $35 for an hour long massage. My husband had a body massage and I had a long foot massage - amazing! Great way to end a long day of shopping at the Jade Market!

<Content>Fantastic Location This was a great hotel to stay at. The rooms were extremely spacious, stylish and always look clean and new (have been told that this is a rarity in HK)and the maids were very friendly and assisting - always giving us at least two bottles of spring water each day.As mentioned by alot of others, is can get quite noisy so bring ear plugs with you as the front desk won't supply them - and do not stay in room 2612 (on the 26th floor) as it is directly under the stage in the ballroom and it was shaking at one stage from the music above. We were upgraded to a premier club room from a deluxe, and it is very comtempory looking and stylish, but you actually get a little less room as the bathroom is made bigger. If you get upgraded for free it is fine, but if you are paying for it, i wouldn't bother. The fitness centre is quite expensive (70 HKD per day) and it is not worth it. There is a great jogging track in the park across the road, plus other things for exercise with tennis courts, swimming pool and tai chi classes you can join in on. I'm a 23 year old girl and went some mornings by myself before it was even light and felt completely safe as there are hundreds of people in the park at all times, and they are really friendly. Causeway Bay must be the best place in HK to stay, it is close to everything, has restaurants just down the road, and isn't a very touristy area. I would definitely stay in Causeway Bay again and at the Park Lane Hotel again :)

<Content>Average, at best I have been staying at Park Lane for many times over 9 years (my Company's choice). Certainly over 50 stays.I never ever got any recognition for being such a loyal Client (I settle my own accounts).I have to say that service is just average (it became better when business was down in HK, but now that demand is high, service is back to minimum...), and understanding of English seems to fade away.Noise (as mentioned by others) IS an issue, so is the freezing temperature in the rooms, even when the AC is off. I could never figure out the reason why hotels are maintaining polar temperatures in HK.Location is great, honestly, this is why I keep staying there. If you are just visiting HK, and expect a good, friendly place with good service, you might consider other alternatives.

<Content>Park Lane Great Location First I'll get the negative out the way - we were on the 26th floor with a great view but the 27th floor is the ballroom  every night there is something on  it is quite noisy - our room was not too bad but one couple on our party complained  was shifted to another floor. So ask for a lower floor.Apart from that the hotel rooms are very spacious - we were in deluxe rooms  everything was great - bathrooms small but had a bath with toileteries which was lovely. They give you 2 bottles of water every day.Did not include breakfast as expensive but the supermarket is 2 doors down the street  you get fresh pastries every morning  make a cup of tea in your room.We exercised in Victoria Park (over the road) every morning which was amazing.Causeway Bay is so nice - we caught the trams just down from the hotel  there was not a lot of western tourists so we felt like the locals. Did not love Kowloon - people were very friendly on Hong Kong Island.

<Content>Travelling with a toddler! We have just returned from a 7 night stay at the Park Lane, Causeway Bay HK. We are a family with a 22 month old boy. Prior to booking a hotel, we had certain criteria in a hotel room that we wanted including enough room to fit a cot and close walking distance to the MTR (wife is 5 months pregnant). Most of the HK hotel rooms are fairly small in the 3 star range, so we had to resort to a 4-5 star hotel. HotelWe ended up with an upgrade to Harbour View on the 14th floor. Our room was newly renovated (although no plasma TV!!) and was spacious enough for a cot, walking room and shopping storage!! (He ended up sleeping in our bed instead). Our boy had enought room to run around. Unlike previous reviews we did not experience noise problems. We were told at check in, that they were renovating and could expect noise during the day. We heard nothing during the day or night (we must have had either no neighbours or very quiet ones) The room was clean, though the bed was hard, especially for a heavily pregnant woman. Our Harbour View was really of Victoria Park but if you look to the left you could see the water. The Victoria Park view was nice, as we could see the Tai Chi people each morning and on Sunday we saw the entire Indonesian community having picnics. The service was always prompt, courteous and professional. We always got a good morning whenever we passed them in the corridor.We arrived in HK at 5.30am and they were able to give us an early check in as the hotel was not busy. We were also given a 6pm late check out as we had an evening departure flight.LocationThe location is excellent. The MTR is, as the previous reviewer said, literally less than 100m from the hotel. Did not have to cross any major roads to get there (which is good for us with a pram). There is easy access to shops, in particular Time Square, Sogo and Windsor House. There is an impressive 24 hour supermarket (Welcome) literally under the hotel where you can buy practically anything. Travelling time (Mid Feb)The weather was comfortable, only drizzled once. Did not seem crowded as it was post Chinese New Year. ShoppingBear in mind, that shops generally dont open till 1030-1100am. They close at 11pm. This gave us some nice strolling time in the morning, slowly looking for breakfast and the streets are not as crowded. We were there during the last days of the post New Year sales, so was able to pick up some great bargains. EatingFantastic!!! although you need a local to advise you where to eat. If you like wandering the streets and eating at the local joints, then there are plenty to choose from around the hotel. For the parentsWe didn't take over a pram and based on advice from this forum , we bought a cheap (HK$300 - AU$50), 2.5kg stroller from ToysRus (opposite the hotel, Windsor House/Plaza). It was a basic stroller which was extremely portable as there are alot of stairs/ turnstiles to navigate through. Our boy didn't really like it as it didn't recline, so when he was asleep his head was unsupported. Overall it was sufficient for our needs. HK is not particularly child friendly, though the people on the MTR are so much politer than Australians. They always offer you their seat if they see a child with you, especially if you're pregnant as well. Pushing the stroller on the streets is not too bad. People will generally move out of the way and if they dont, couple of nudges at their ankles gets them moving along. You don't see many pregnant women or children around. They must all stay at home or drive around. Eating in restaurants may at times be difficult as there is not much room for a stroller, even when collapsed. There is never a high chair or booster available. In case you're wondering, they do sell fresh cows milk (AU$3.50 for 1 lt)Ocean ParkExpect alot of walking!, uphill and downhill. Not good for pregnancy. Pregnant women are not allowed on any rides even the Ferris Wheel. DisneylandDidn't go.Transportation and MiscEven though the MTR is efficient and an easy way to get around, do consider catching taxis as these are relatively cheap and can save you walking.For all public transport (MTR, tram, ferry) we bought an octupus card (available from airport or MTR stations). You can even buy groceries with this card.Mobile phonesWe took our mobiles over and bought a prepaid SIM card from Seven 11. This was really useful as we had relatives and friends to contact locally. Much cheaper than using the hotel. (approx HK$48 for 300 minutes). We also bought one for international calls (HK$100). Flight advice (Cathay Pacific)On return we had a night flight and was allocated bulkhead seats (because of our boy). This was not a good idea as we were right next to the toilets. We could hear the flushing all night, and the lights constantly going on and off. Our leg room was used as a thoroughfare and in essence, we only got 1-2 hours sleep. Fortunately our boy got 4-5 hours.SummaryWe had a great time and we thoroughly recommend the Park Lane to anyone, particulary those with small children. There was sufficient space in the room without having to feel cramped. Time of the year was good, weather was comfortable and one week was sufficient.

<Content>Good Hotel, great location First things first, when we arrived at Hong Kong International Airport, we went through immigration and reclaimed our luggage. We headed towards the train station which was very well sign posted. We eventually came to some kiosks and for about $HK 160(拢16) we purchased 2 single journey tickets to Hong Kong Central station. After 2 minutes or so we boarded the train and within 25 mins we reached the Central station.Because we did our research we knew to look for the free shuttle bus which would take us directly to the Park Lane Hotel. Again the buses was very easy to find because the station was very well signposted. The bus we needed to catch was the H2 bus which was like a mini-bus and catered for about 16 people. The buses run approx every 24 mins and again within 5 mins we was sat on the bus and on our way. The journey which was very pleasant took approx 30 mins and it gave you chance to have a first look of Hong Kong.Anyway arrived at the hotel and immediately the Bell staff took our bags and gave us a slip with a number on it. We proceeded to check in and was greeted by a very friendly woman who spoke in English and offered us an upgrade immediately to the premier suites. The upgrade was around $HK 300 per night (approx 拢24). After much deliberation we decided to have a look at the standard room and then decide whether we wanted to upgrade.We made our way to the room which was on the 11th floor and ahortly afterwards the bell man came with our luggage. I gave him a small tim of around $HK20 (approx 拢1.80) of which he seemed very pleased with. The room was of adequate size, simple decor, clean with all basic amenities which included a kettle, mini bar, fridge, TV with 5 0r 6 English speaking news channels etc. However we did not have a view, we overlooked a car park to our disappointment.Anyway, we decided not to upgrade and simply try the room out for a few nights. One thing became very clear as we did not spend much time in the hotel, the room was adequate. Also as the days were often moggy, distant views were restricted. Therefore if we paid the extra money for the upgrade then we may not have been able to see the views because of the weather.After previous reviews I was somewhat worried about the noise at night but the 7 nights we stayed in the hotel there as absolutely no noise whatsoever.Location was just brilliant, Causeway bay although nt my favourite of the islands in Hong Kong, it is still fantastic. Shoppers paradise, many restaurants and a beautiful park (Victoria Park directly infont of the Hotel). Hint get up early and go to the park and just watch all the people practice Tai chi.The hotel is about 100 metres away from the MTR underground service which is so efficient and connects to all the major islands in Hong kong within minutes. Also there is a 24 hour convenience store about 50 yards form the hotel. It sells everything you need and more. I just wanted milk so I could enjoy a nice cup of tea.Last but not least on the day of our departure, we checked out at 12 noon and left our case with the bell desk a a charge of $HK 120 for the two cases for the day. We also booked the Airport coach which takes you directly to the airport for a further $HK 180 for the two of us. The journey took about 30 -40 mins.Overall this hotel is great and we had a fantastic time in Hong Kong

<Content>Good location I stayed on the business floors - I think this may be necessary to avoid the congestion.The rooms are reasonable sized.  yes they do come with rather powerful stereos. But as with most hotels it is best to wear ear plugs as a precaution. Hong Kong is a transit stop over and people arrive day and night. Somebody arrived in the next room at 04.30 and proceeded to play Celine Dion at full blast!!Room cleaning leaves a bit to be desired. It's not dirty it is just they didn't clean to the edges. But service was great.The Internet access in room is by ethernet cable and is outrageously expensive. It is now 2006, they need to wake up. Bizarrely you can get free Wi-Fi access in the lobby, restaurant and lounges.

<Content>Good location, shame about the TV noise Stayed at this hotel for one night as a stop over on our way to Australia. Hotel lobby is very posh and the staff were friendly. However, as this is a top notch hotel, expected better facilites re a larger lounge/bar/restaurant area. Internet prices in their business centre are a rip off, try elsewhere. Our room was very nice, over looking Victoria Park, we were 'upgraded' to the 23rd floor, as they were updating the rooms on the 19th floor. The only problem I have with this hotel, is the same as one of the other reviews below - ie the TV noise! There I was lying in bed (with our TV on) thinking the guy's review below was rubbish and that he just had jet lag. Well, I apologise for that, as soon as the people got back in the room next door and our TV was off, I totally agree with you! It's all very well having these nice plasma screens in the room, however, you would have thought they would have checked our how noisy they were before installing them! My only advice therefore, is if the next room has their tv on, put yours on as well, then you are at least listening to something you want to hear! Would have been annoying if we had stayed there for longer. Overall, the hotel is in an excellent position. If you turn right out of the hotel and right again (Patterson Street), there is a taxi rank, so use this instead of waiting with all the business people in the queue at the hotel! We got a taxi to the top of the Peak for $80 Hong Kong dollars and then once you have come back down on the tram, is a really easy walk down to the Star Ferry terminal. The ferries are SO cheap and easy to use, we went over to Kowloon and its an excellent way of seeing the city. The view from the Peak wasnt that good, as it was a cloudy day but well worth going up there, just for the tram ride!

<Content>Just an OK! In genera, I rate it average. The room is clean, nice modern design with pretty cool bath room. The bed is comfy. The flat screen TV gives the room more space. We upgraded the room to habourpark view. However, it was not really habour view. Habour view was like on the far left side of the window. However, it was alright since we rarely spent time in the room anyway. The only thing which so dissapointed me was the SERVICE. The staff were not very pleasent. Just seemed like they didn't know how to smile. They did their job correctly but I could not feel they had a service mind which I find it an important attitude of working in a hospitality industry.

<Content>Expectations not met Me and my wife stayed five nights at the Park Lane, after reading the reviews I was looking forward to staying there, but...in terms of especially service and facilities it was pretty disappointing. I should have know already, when I called the hotel from overseas to reserve the room. It took about 10 minutes before somebody picked up and another 10 minutes waiting for reservation (for expample the Shangri La Kowloon picked up right away, was much friendlier and faster, even though they were already booked out).We had booked the Premier Club Room, where you have certain priviliges. The check-in on the 26th floor was everything but especially welcoming. Afterwards nobody lead me to the room. When I entered the room, the view was right onto a depressing, dirty back of a building amd a small dirty courtyard. Calling the reception that I was not happy with the room, the inital response was a but you booked city view. Just on requesting again, wether they don't have another room the reception called back 10 minutes later and asked me to pick up the new key at the reception. So I grapped my luggage and picked up the new key myself. Entering the second room I right away got a headache from the intense smoke smell inside (I am a occasional smoker, so not too sensitive!). Another call to the reception, another wait, one more time I was asked to go down tot the reception in order to pick up the new key myself. The new room was everything but a room with a nicer view, but I was already to tired to make further complains. Besides the service problems (too many to tell now, just if you stay there, get used to 10 minutes wait, if you call reception), the facilities where not that great. I knew they don't have a pool, so I entered the gym. It turned out to be a window less hole on the fifth floor, depressing and on top you have apparently to pay extra for it.The location is good for shopping, but the lobby is always hectic and crowded, maybe with shoppers. Entering the hotel doesn't give you the feeling being in a special place and actually...you are not.
