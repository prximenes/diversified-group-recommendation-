<Content>not at all Chic and less than basic We booked chic and basic after reading reviews on trip adviser..The place just looked ok.the hot water lasted just for one bath.we had a 2 bedroom apt and we were four of us..staff not very friendly or helpful.Found the area sleazy with a lot of noise at night.would not feel very safe.did not like the overall experience. Would not recommend this place to anyone.

<Content>Unique  This unusual hotel in my favorite area of Barcelona definitely sticks to it's principles of chic and basic. I'm sure anyone reading this now has already gathered from previous reviews and pictures that this hotel has a crazy colored light thing going on. Other than that, everything else is starkly white, giving the room a super-modern, clean and sleek feel. The lights are fun and the premise is interesting, but I have to say that it did slightly lose it's appeal as our stay went on. I really don't have many negative things to say about our stay, however. The hotel's basic policy seems to be that rather than have the staff serve you, you should already have pretty much everything you need. This was true for the most part, although it does lend to kind of an impersonal experience. We fully utilized the help yourself room which comes equipped with free water, coffee and tea, as well as a little loungey area and a computer hooked up with free internet. There's also a little vending machine stocked with juice, beer, snacks, etc. for a reasonable price.The location was great - right in between the historic area of the Born district and the park. Born is packed with cute cafes and shops, so we had a lot of fun just browsing around the area. We had a street-facing room which opened to a small balcony. I don't usually mind background traffic noise (living in NYC), but there was some construction going on while we there that tended to be extremely loud. I'm pretty sure they were even doing some work out there in the middle of the night one night, which did not make for a good night's sleep. The bed was super comfy, though, so I guess that made up for it to an extent.In summary, I would recommend this hotel to a younger crowd looking for a funky, unique hotel experience. My husband and I were actually on our honeymoon, and it was perfect for this kind of trip. I probably would not want to stay more than a few nights though.

<Content>Old People Will Love It Too We stayed in Barcelona for 3 days after a transatlantic cruise back last March and picked Chic and Basic Born mainly for location ... but also because all we read told us that it fit the artsy eclectic city that Barcelona is ... We were not disappointed in the least ... Perfect location for the turistic tours ... a lovely park nearby ... nice restaurants and nightlife close by ... and the Chocolate Museum ... across the street just for my wife ...Rooms were clean and comfortable and ... interesting with the inroom shower beads and lights ... walking down the halls was a bit like a San Francisco hippie commune from the 60's ... but what the heck we were young then ... The internet was always available ... the staff helpful and courteous ... The only drawback was the lack of anything on TV in English to fall asleep to ... so we rented movies ...I'm writing this now since my son is spending a week there now ... and it brought back these great memories ...

<Content>Cheap  This hotel should be named CHEAP  Basic or perhaps CHEAP  Nasty. Everything about the hotel is CHEAP and it looks more like a brothel with red lighted curtains in your room and a shower and toilet just in the middle of th small room allowing absolutely no privacy what so ever. The hotel does not provide any of the basic needs that a hotel guest might ask for such as a good confortable bed, a private loo, somewhere to put your clothes, a safe for your lap-top, working air-conditioning or quiet surroundings at night. Avoid this hotel at any cost!!!

<Content>Great location with nice facilities We stayed here the night before a cruise. The location was a pleasant surprise in a very lively and fun area of Barcelona. Great restaurants all around and within walking distance to the center of the city which is crowded and not where you want to be late at night. The area around this hotel is much less intimidating. The Picasso Museum is 2 blocks away.The rooms are small but cleverly decorated with the shower in the middle of the room. Front desk was very helpful and perfect English was spoken. The hotel is in a renovated, historic and beautiful buidling. This is not a typical chain hotel. It is just the opposite with some clever extras and tongue in cheek signs. Try it.......you will enjoy your stay. We paid under US$200 which is a bargain today in a European city.

<Content>Perfectly situated, but might stay elsewhere next time This was our second stay at this hotel. The first time was in Sept. 2007. We planned a quick, 4-day trip in Barcelona, and decided to stay here again, as our last stay in this hotel was only for one night. When I arrived around noon, I asked in Spanish if the clerk spoke English. My boyfriend and I speak as much Spanish as we can (no matter how poorly) when we travel to Spain. She actually rolled her eyes at me and said impatiently, in English, yes, of course. It was a bad start. It certainly didn't make me feel very welcome. I found out that the room wouldn't be ready for a while, so I wandered out. When I returned, it was the same clerk, but somehow, she had transformed into a very friendly and helpful person. I was glad. She did a lot for me in as far as continually checking with the maids and trying to make sure I got the first clean room available. She was so helpful that I forgot about my greeting.The room itself was as nice as before. It was clean. I love the design. We both love the shower in the middle of the room. I don't mind the lack of space in the room either. There is no proper closet, but there is a small area with a little bar with hangers on which to hang your clothes. The hotel is in our favorite area of Barcelona--the Born district. In our opinion, it has the best bars, restaurants and shopping. I love that area. The Metro is about a 5 to 10 minute walk from the hotel, which is nice. We would get home late and take advantage of sitting on the tiny balcony, which was particularly good for people watching.One reason I wouldn't stay here again is that the bathroom/toilet room isn't very private. It's glass, with a partial smoky glass area for privacy, but the door has an open space at the top, and in addition, our door didn't close completely. The only other complaint I have, but it's tiny, is that the maids walked in on us, even though we were yelling, in Spanish, please come back later. We thought it was weird that they walked in because hall noise was visible from the room--another minor complaint. Those are the only complaints. If you wouldn't be bothered by what I mentioned, I would highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Fantastic Anniversary Break We recently stayed at the Chic and Basic for our first wedding anniversary. They could not have been more accommodating - when we arrived it was pouring with rain, so when we checked in (early and not a problem) he noticed our room smelt of sewage (just dodgy Spanish drains I think!), so the manager called our room and offered to move us. We accepted and were moved to a room at the front of the hotel with a balcony and some beautiful original features etc. The rooms are not huge, we booked a large and it was ample, but as the building is so old, I imagine every room differs somewhat (we saw 2 and they were similar sizes but very different shapes). The lighting is a real feature and a novelty! The bathroom and shower are really original too. Beds really firm (we both have bad backs!) There is a free safe you can use and the free refreshments are brilliant. Excellent location, literally 3 minutes from the Born area and all other areas lead off that too. We ended up eating and drinking in the Born area as it was more our style (little funky boutiques, jewellery shops, bars, cafes, restaurants) and very local. We ate in various places and would highly recommend each - Bilbao Barras - fab relaxed Tapas help yourself to as much as you want - great for lunch ( a bit smoky - there is no ban in Spain!). Cheese Me - if you love cheese and wine, you will love this! Then a lovely Tapas restaurant with loads of vegetarian options - cannot remember the name, but on the street behind Santa Maria church, down from the Gaudi Museum and opposite a Tea shop (it's black and white and modern looking). Excellent service, brilliant english, fresh, well made food. We loved all the wine shops that were also cafes too as well as the Chocolate and Churros!!! Barcelona is an exhausting city but there are so many places to sit and chill as well we loved it! The only down sides for us were the weather and the fact we flew with Ryan air who fly into Gerona, not Barcelona - although the bus system is VERY well organised, it cuts into your time there (1 hr 15 on bus). Overall Chic and Basic is V reasonable for the location, service, style, facilities and we would definately return. The White Bar (part of the hotel) says it is a cocktail bar as well as restaurant, it isn't - but looked good if you dont want to walk anywhere. We booked direct with the hotel as none of the discount sites had rooms avail and it cost us 拢270 for 2 nights in a Large room.

<Content>Loved Chic  Chic  Basic in Barcelona was wonderful. Loved the personality of the place and it's in a great area. Close to shopping, dining, sites, the harbor everything.We stayed in the XL room. The configuration of the room makes it a bit difficult to get around with a lot of luggage. But I would totally stay in that room again. Overall the hotel was quiet for sleeping. Loved having the large doors that opened to the balcony.Hoping to visit Barcelona again in December, I will 100% stay here again.

<Content>More than what I expected When I booked this place, I did not have that high expectations, considering I paid 96 euros for the M room. So I kind of expected a 1) small room (since I booked the smallest room) 2) overdone led lights 3) no service. In fact my experience was the complete opposite. The room is a comfortable size for one person. It has a double bed, door to the courtyard which lets sunlight in. The room is very well designed. It had everything I needed. Clean uncluttered space, fantastic flat screen interactive TV - reminds me of the Singapore Airline interactive TV. The led lights were in fact quite fun to play around with - set different moods with the different lights. The service is friendly. Internet is FREE. Coffee, tea and the most essential water which seems to be sorely lacking even in more expensive hotels in Barcelona is in abundance - just help yourself in the self service area. The neighbourhood is absolutely great. If you like the alternative type neighbourhood - with the best small shops and cafes/ restauraunts nearby, and the Metro about 10 mins walk away. I completely loved my stay there and I will be recommending to all my friends without a doubt.

<Content>Perfect place to stay for a Barcelona city break We had a great time staying here. In terms of value for money, facilities, and location, I can't really fault this place.The location is superb, I've been to Barcelona a few times, and I think this is one of the best areas to stay. Its where all the good bars and restaurants are, it has character, is within walking distance of all the main attractions, and is far enough away from the tourist trap, Las Ramblas.Rooms are clean, and of an interesting design. The staff are friendly - the owner even lent me his bike so I could cycle up to Parc Guell.

<Content>A Great and Unique Hotel Experience I stayed here in early March 2008 with my fiance. We booked directly with the hotel and booked an XL room (only one available at time of booking). A friend had previously stayed in a large room and found this more than adequate so if price is an issue, there's probably no need for an XL room.The hotel is really unique. The only staff you'll see are one receptionist and occasonnaly a cleaner, so it's really light touch in that regard, which I loved. The building itself has a real depth of history and they manage to combine this really well with the stark whiteness of the rooms and the funky decor and lighting, it did look a bit tired in areas (window frames needing a lick of paint) but this didn't detract from the whole experience. The help yourself bar of coffee and bottled water and vending machines of other drinks including alcohol were great.All this coupled with a really good location in the Born district made for a perfect weekend visit. The only off thing was outside the hotel where there was a really funny sulphuric type smell, but don't worry this didn't permeate inside. I would probably suggest that this is not really a hotel for older people or families. Whilst I could be wrong on this, I simply say it as i can't imagine my mum and dad getting it at all.Go stay here, it's great.

<Content>Chic and Basic - perfect name for this good hotel My husband and I ended up staying at this hotel because the place we were originally staying at mixed up our booking. They booked the Chic and Basic for us for 2 nights. We really didn't know what to expect!When we arrived and checked into our room we were more than happy. We'd never stayed at a hotel quite like it! The decor is white, with coloured lighting and curtain type things made up of individual crystal effect strands - these are in the corridors and bedrooms and give a great effect.Our room was the M type (120 Euros per night), which was fine - really comfy queensize bed and a big shower enclosure in the middle of the room, with one of the crystal curtains around it (which you could pull around the clear enclosure, or not!). You get shower gel, robe/slippers and mineral water. There was also a TV. One of the things I loved about the room was being able to change the lighting from blue, to green or red. The only thing we didn't like about the room was that it didn't have an opening window - just a frosted glass window with a blind that seemed to overlook a narrow internal courtyard. Some of the other types of rooms do have an opening window or balcony.The location is excellent - the Born area has loads of great bars and restaurants, there are a couple of metro stops nearby (Jaume I the nearest I think) and its not too far to wander over to the Barri Gotic or las Ramblas.We didn't have breakfast in the bar/restaurant, The White Room, but we did have a drink in there. Really nice cocktails and good atmosphere.The 'Common Zone' was great - free tea, coffee and mineral water, sofas for lounging on, free internet and a vending machine with beer and chocolate.We would stay here again and recommend it to anyone looking for something a bit different and in a great area of Barcelona.

<Content>Best hotel we've stayed in yet! My husband and I stayed here for 4nights, we booked an XL large room and our stay was fantastic. The staff are extremly helpful, the hotel itself is unique, with the shower actually in your room! and loved the added message logos on everything, also having the 'break out' area where you could help yourself to refreshments for free was great and very hard to come by in most hotels and having the balcony was an added bonus. Great location as your right on top of the born district with great bars and restaurants. We would recommend this hotel in heartbeat and are currently looking into staying again this october and can't wait!

<Content>An absolute great hotel My boyfriend and i stayed here for 3 nights. We had an XL room, which didn't disappoint. It had a comfortable queensize bed, flat screen TV, balcony, hanging rail, and a couple of drawers for storage as well as a hairdryer - so girls, no need to take one with you.The shower in the middle of the room is a great novelty, as is the different coloured lightingThe lounge offers free interent access and free tea, coffee and bottles of water.The room didn't have a mini bar/fridge or safe, but this was no big deal.The hotel is in a great location. It's literally about 10min walk from the train station 'Estacion de Franca'. It's far enough out of the chaos of Las Ramblas, but a close enough easy walk into the centre (about 10mins). It's also a few mins walk to both the chocolate museum and the Picasso museum.My boyfriend chose this hotel for our stay and i can say i was most pleasantly suprised. It is a clean, modern, unique place to stay in a great area - definitely not fuddy duddy!!Would stay here again, if visiting the city again

<Content>Super fun hotel I stayed here with my family at the end of December and had a great time. Don't expect fancy soaps or room service, but do expect a truly unique hotel setting and friendly employees. The cute slogans they have printed everywhere are just icing on the cake, as are the groovy neon lights and the superb location within the Born neighborhood.

<Content>"Different" hotel Stayed at hotel last week in Octeber before our transatlantic cruise. Wonderful coloured lighting. The lounge/sitting area in on the second/third floor with plenty of free tea, cofee, bottled water, free internet. The young receptionists are very helpful with info and maps. No door person but on arriving they helped us with our many cases from the taxi into the hotel. Very clean rooms and very good soap and body wash. NO WASH RAGS. We tried to get some from housekeeping but they do no provide them (as many hotels in Europe) so take your own. Our balcony overlooked the street with wonderful views. Very quite room. Bathroom is in the middle of the room but there is a floor to ceiling curtain for more privacy. Many large, good towels. It is about 5 minutes drive to the port and about 15 minutes from the airport. Very good location to shops, restaurants, Las Ramblas only 5-10 minutes walk. Took many pictures and will add as soon as I figure out how to.

<Content>Nice design Hotel in Barcelona I had a very good time at the Chic and Basic Born hotel. Very good situation in Barcelona. My room was in the second floor and it was not noisy at all. Confortable bed, nice shower. The young lady at the reception could have been more friendly, she did not seem very happy to work but it's O.K.I would stay there again as I think it is a nice hotel not so expensive for Barcelona.

<Content>Disappointed My husband stayed at the Chic  Basic Born from Aug 26th to the 29th. We purchased the extra-large room with a balcony on Expedia. They gave us room #1. It did not have a balcony (they told us not all of the rooms have them even though I had emailed them before we left verifying that we got a balcony). The strange thing is that it didn't have any windows at all, which made it really claustrophobic! It had 2 windows that when you opened them, you looked out on an old elevator shoot. That must be how the roach got in the room! It had some cool skylights though in the ceiling. The problem with that is that they had a sky light directly above the shower. As I took a shower, I looked up into the blue sky and a man on the 4th floor of the next building who was looking down watching me take a shower! I couldn't believe it. He even had to put his hand up to block the sun's glare a few times. This made me mad. Needless to say, we asked to be moved and told them about the guy on the roof. No apologies, but the next day we got a room with a balcony. The bad thing here is that we couldn't sleep the next few nights because of all the street noise. (We were on the street with all the large garage bins and a yappy dog who barked constantly. There must be a dozen different trash companies, because they came at different times one morning to get the trash). We won't be staying here again. It was a disappointment!The good things included the location, the air conditioning the cool lights  the free water.

<Content>Anyone Young: Oh so Cool you Gotta Go Ok I am 24 my husband 34 and he is a dentist for a little fyi. We travel the world and try to stay at the nicest yet hippest places at the places we go. Chic was unbelievable the staff was so nice, all young so they were all understanding and helpful. Now for all honesty the rooms are basic with very basic amenities, but the bag and the presentation makes up for it, hilarious really! But I mean who now a days does not take shampoo soap etc.. But the bed was comfy the shower was so unique I just loved it. I mean to put it in the middle of the floor surrounded in glass with the beads hanging down and the lights below it at night so neat. The common area was nice, computer to use, free espresso, free water, and vending machine with beer! Also the bar was really great you gotta try the Sex in Barcelona so delish, and I do not like fruity drinks. But the best was the location in walking distance to everything worth seeing, the Born district is super hip with great restaurants and shopping, we know it is pricey and you can go to other parts of Barcelona to shop for much cheaper but oh well! Loved it, if we ever go back to Barcelona before having kids we will for sure stay here!!

<Content>Brilliant hotel, brilliant area! I was taken in by the great website that this hotel had (having chanced upon it when searching the internet randomly) and thought the rates were reasonable. We arrived from Girona airport and walked to the hotel from the Estacio Norte (?) bus station in less than ten minutes. The staff were very friendly and had better english than me!!The room was very cool (ie chic) and cool (ie not warm) and just what we were looking for. THe lighting in the rooms was exceptional and although not massive (we stayed in a medium room) had everything we needed. The attention to detail was impressive and although the minimal white walls, linen, corridors etc might not be to everyone's taste we thought it looked great and was really clean and fresh feeling. The hotel had a really great mix between old (cornisting, tiled floors, marble bannisters) and new (neon lighting, balearic music, and young, funky staff).The best thing for us (a couple in our mid twenties who like art and design and nice bars etc) was the area. It's well away from the tourist trap of La Rambla in a semi-residential area but right next to the beautiful park, 10 mins from barceloneta beach, 2 mins from a metro and right next to a vast range of really cool bars and restaurants (esp Pitin bar and Santa Maria). I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough (we were actually supposed to stay for 3 nights but ended up staying for 6 because we weren't very impressed with the other area we had booked in - Eixample). I just hope it doesn't get too popular so we can get a room again when we go back, which we definately will.

<Content>Absolutely fantastic! We are a female couple (23 and 25 years old) who were travelling for the first time to Barcelona. We went for four days and I was hesitant to book ChicBasic Born because some reviews commented on the noise - Wasn't a problem at all. Staff were friendly and helpful, we were upgraded to a large room for no reason (lovely surprise!) and we thought the coloured lights were fun and a bit different. We were both EXTREMELY HAPPY with the hotel and it's well worth the money. Good for young/young at heart couples, prob not someone you don't mind seeing you naked in the shower. But highly highly recommended!

<Content>Funky  My boyfriend and I stayed here for 3 nights in June and thought Chic  basic was a fab hotel. The lighting system is great fun and the bed was so comfortable we didn't want to get out. The street outside our room was quite noisy but closing the balcony doors and using the air-con (unusually efficient for a hotel) solved that problem. The location of the hotel is excellent. It is only a short walk to the centre and there are plenty of bars and restaurants in Born itself. It was also only a 5 min walk to the train station - very handy for getting to and from the airport. I wouldn't recommend booking anything smaller than a large room though. There were a couple of things missing like a safe and drinks making facilities in the room but these are free in the lounge area. This is a hotel for a young couple looking for something different to your average hotel but on a budget and who are not shy about showering in front of each other.

<Content>Fantastic stay in great hotel Stayed here on a long weekend in May. We arrived late from Girona airport and fortunately the hotel is only a short walk from the bus station. The staff working in reception were very helpful and provided us with a welcome pack. The room was very open and funky with lots of gadgets. Would recommend to people wanting to stay in a central location at a reasonable price.

<Content>Don't stay there! It's a youth hostel! Me and my boyfriend stayed for one night and this hotel. We had looked at their web sight and booked a suite. It looked very stylish but lacked everything when it comes to function. It was impossibel to get any sleep at all due to thin walls (could hear the cuple next door talking), a building designed lika an amplifier and people closing and opening doors thru the whole night. There were very posh windows in the ceiling and guess what happened and 6 o'clock in the morning? the whole room lights up as the sun comes up. Impossible to sleep! I would only recomed this hotel to someone who wants to have so many drinks that they become unconscius. There were stains on the bath room floor and towels big like stamps, one of them broken. A youth hostel would have more exeprienced and more helpful staff. A great suggestion is to get off the phone when hotel guests come into the lobby. It doesnt cost anything to be polight.

<Content>Really stylish and cool place! I stayed at the Chic  Basic Born Hotel for one night on 6 June. The hotel is a great choice, particularly for a younger crowd or those who favour style, and at good rates. It must be one of the most stylish hotels where I have ever stayed and it is also very comfortable. It is in C/ Princesa, in the very trendy Born district and you can walk to many attractions from here. The room I had was very comfortable and stylish, and really enjoyable to stay in. I requested a quiet room, so I got one facing an internal courtyard and not the main street, which was great for me. The different lights in the room are really cool and you can modify the colour of your room according to your mood.Following recommendations from tripadvisor, I skipped having breakfast at the stylish 鈥榃hite Bar鈥? and had a massive cheese sandwich and coffee in the caf茅 just around the corner for 4 euros. There are plenty of good restaurants and cafes nearby, so do explore the Born area and the city. The cathedral square is just 5 minutes walk, and you are in the Ramblas in 15 minutes.The staff in reception and the cleaners were very friendly and efficient and the breakout area with free coffee, cool bottles of water and internet station was also great. I really recommend this place and I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>So stylish! I love this type of hotel and if you look they have lots of this type of thing in Sapin. I'm talking about these new hotels that are like 'design' or 'boutique' hotels without paying the silly expensive prices and they are not part of a big hotel chain.Chic and Basic in Born is set in a beautiful old building yet all the rooms are up to date and very stylish. I agree with all the previous reviews saying that you must know your travelling partner very well as the shower is very see through! The whole idea of the room is very 'chill out' or night clubbish. The location is totally unbeatable as you are staying in the most interesting of areas for little shops and restaurants. If you want MacDonalds etc then stay somewhere else. In Born you will find lots of little shops where you feel you are buying souveniers or presents that are really special.We walked the whole of Barcelona and couldn't find a better area. Inside the room the television is a huge flat screen with loads of multimedia (but why would you stay inside all the time)?! The shower and the toiletries are all so stylish. It is true that the door had to be slamed quite hard for it to shut properly, so you also hear your neighbours trying to do that. It can be loud. Also the noise outside on Friday and Saturday nights can be loud as Spanish people stay up late partying!I love Barcelona and I love Chic and Basic and I would recomend it to all of my young friends. I have travelled the world and was in Paris the week before, but this hotel gives you an experience that makes your stay more special. They even have an area with free internet, free Nespressos  free water and tea!I can't wait to go back

<Content>Beware!!!! The Chic  Born is an interesting hotel property. It is in a great location for touring, but poorly managed. The locks on the hotel room doors did not function, the lighting in most rooms did not function, and the staff is very young and inexperienced. The cleanliness is much to be desired. Very dusty. The hotel could have been great, but is very flawed. Among other things there are no safes in the rooms and the security is very lax. During our visit we were robbed one day and physically attacked in our car the next. All in front of the hotel. Bruises were sustained, 450 Euros stolen, and another purse with business information as it's contents stolen. The hotel staff seemed slightly concerned and gave the overall impression they knew the thieves/attackers. By the way, I am a 43 year old woman based in Michigan who is a travel agent. I've traveled the world many, many times and never have felt as falsely safe as I did here. I will never recommend my clients this hotel and location.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel!! My friend nd I have just returned from a 3 night stay in the Chic and Basic Born. The hotel is in an excellent location Its a short walk to Las Ramblas and has loads of windy streets around it to explore! There are also great bars and resturants in the area which are not used by tourists that much so give you a taste of local life!The hotel staff were friendly and check in ws quick.The rooms are amazing. Very cool and sophisticated with excellent lighting! The beds were comfortable and the room was very clean. The only dissapointment with the room was that there was no windows or balcony. There were sky lights which were covered from the outside with a curtain so you had to guess what the weather was like!! I'd request a room with a balcony if staying again. Although, if like us, your out and about all day its ok. Safety deposit boxes were available at reception but I think a 3* hotel of this calibre should have them in the room.The shower is in the middle of the room which is not clear from the pictures on travel agents websites!! There is a curtain which you can pull round but if you're at all shy I'd give it a miss. This probably makes the hotel more suited to couples than friends but we survived!Definately avoid the breakfast. We went once and it was awful. There was no butter or jam so my friend had dry toast. There wasn't much of a selection either.Other than that I loved my stay in this hotel and would thouroughly reccommend it.

<Content>superb hotel, made me fall in love with Barcelona This was our second trip to Barcelona, the first time we stayed in the very disappointing Cram Hotel, which probably contributed to the fact that I did not exactly enjoy the city that much. But this time it was different! The hotel is just a great place to be, it quickly fills you up with energy after a long walk and you are ready to set out to discover Barcelona again. The cool atmosphere, the very stylish but never embarrasingly overdone design, the adjustable colours that you can set according to your mood, the perfect location, everything about this hotel just makes you want to return again and again. The personnel was genuinely kind and always smiling, which is also a big plus. Just one minor note on the downside: the breakfast was nothing special, rather simple, but too expensive for its worth. All in all it was our best hotel experience so far, I highly recommend it to everyone!

<Content>Made my stay! This hotel lived up to all my expectations. A place to be cool and romantic. A fantastic size of bed, the brilliant 'glass pod' shower. You can't fail to fall in love with your partner again here.I was beset with flu and a chest infection on my visit...even so my stay in Barcelona was made more than bearable by having this place to come back to. The lighting was funky and easy to use.. those that say it confused them must be a bit silly. Just keep practicing pressing buttons on the remote control and you'll get the hang really quickly.Do not miss the restaurant downstairs! Amazing food, great value for money.I would love to have somewhere like this in the UK....

<Content>Discombobulating Diva! The Hotel Chic and Basic whas, quite frankly, unlike anyother hotel I've ever stayed. In its essence, it remains a totally wacked out place that I would recommend highly to the following people:a)young travelers, b)travelers with a sense of humor c) uninhibited couples d)fashionistas....Chic and basic combines old Barcelona with CRAZY Nuevo fun. All staircases are old marble, while the walls of the rooms are covered in mirrors, shiny plastic, and colored lights. I recommended it for the youthful, as there were some room set ups that i feared my parents would break a hip on (the 2 steps to the bathroom can be terrifying at night)...As for the light curtains, the verdict is still out on them...they reminded me of trecking through the forest with a buddy...if yer not considerate of yer friend whist amidst thick forestation, yer friend is bound to get a mouthful of plant....chic and basic's curtains were of these same variety and I, unthinking, slapped my dude with a heavy curtain on a number of occassions.As for the uninhibited, the shower is something out of Barberella- a glass enclosed tube that, unless yer travel partner has seen you bathing naked, you may be aghast about (so much that i would say i probably wouldn't be keen on staying here with good friend..(i.e. without privileges)However, I found the place fun, totally disorientating, but a hoot...very clean, and personally, i loved the design, though if yer looking for something old school BCN, this may not be the joint.Negatives: we never got our volume to work on the super cool flat screen TV, and, by Friday, they stopped stocking the help you bar with water. I highly suggest leaving the place for a cafe con leche and bocadillo at the various cafes around the place, as while the breakfast at the white bar was fine, at 8Euros, i found it a bit pricey for continental.
