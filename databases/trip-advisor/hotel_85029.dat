<Content>A La Cart Charges for everything Let me just start by saying that parking costs $34 dollars a day. I may have been ok with this had I known, but I did not see this anywhere when I booked using the hotel website. The manager was quick to show me where the charge was buried in the website rather than to come to some agreement since this was a suprise. Be careful when staying here.....there is a charge for just about everything including to use the gym.

<Content>Wonderful Relaxing Hotel! I recently stayed one night prior to cruising at the Port of Miami. We had a room on the seventeenth floor overlooking the bay. When we woke up in the morning it was nice to see our ship before we set sail, it just added to the excitement.We arrived around 6pm and we quickly checked in. The front desk was helpful and told us that there were dining facilities within the hotel but we decided to head over to Bayside Marketplace instead. It is pretty touristy but we found a Cuban restaurant(more like diner) that we very authentic. We were the only people in the restaurant that spoke English and our waitress was friendly even though we had a little trouble communicating. The restaurant was The Latin American Cafeteria. Very good! Highly recommended.We walked around and then headed back to the hotel. There is no where in the marketplace to buy supplies for a cruise but we asked a friendly bellhop and he directed us to a CVS two blocks up the street. Just hang a left out the front door and head up two blocks. We stopped by Starbucks in the lobby but ended up going to the breakfast buffet that was provided in the hotel restaurant. It was pricey $57 with a tip but we really enjoyed it. Very relaxing and much better than an old baked good at Starbucks.The gym is really nice. They do charge and extra $15 per person for a 24 hour period. Since we checked in at 6pm we used the gym both the day we checked in and the next morning. I tell you it is the best $15 I ever spent. Not so much for the gym (which is very adequate, free water too grab and extra for later). but the spa! With the fee you get to use the steam room, they have chilled towels for when you get out, a drench shower with soothing music and lights, a green tea energy drink. Then the ladies room has towels, soap, shaving cream in the shower, hair gel, dryers, and almost anything you need. They do provide a robe and slippers to use in the sauna. It was the BEST! I would have stayed for a week just to use it.The cab rides in Miami are a little expensive just like any other city. From the airport it was about $25 and to the cruise port about $10. I did notice though that there was a monorail to the left of the hotel and the map was posted if you wanted to get around. It came by quite often.I have read reviews of this hotel and cannot imagine how anyone encountered rude staff. The staff here was nothing but helpful and friendly. The rooms are clean and comfortable and very spacious. The televisions need a little updating(still big and bulky) and the ironing boards are a little flimsy. The views are wonderful from the higher floors. The elevators were not slow when I was there and most times I was the only one in it.Check out was under 5 minutes for me. I would recommend staying here post or pre cruise for the right price. I cannot comment on what it would be like to stay for business since I did not need any of the business facilities. At their normal rate of $350 it is a bit steep but if you can get a deal or want to splurge and are looking for a nice hotel then you will enjoy the Intercontinental.

<Content>Check Out Takes 40 Minutes, So Plan Ahead Stayed this hotel for 3 nights for a conference. Hotel interior and exterior is nice and restaurant food and services are good. But front desk has problems. We had to spend 40 minutes because a woman in the front desk could not get a correct charge amount. She did not understand how to split two-night charge among three persons and one-night charge between two persons. Due to this long waiting in check-out, I barely caught my plane, yet the woman refused to apologize. She said I misundertood and am here to learn. Why do I need to apologize?

<Content>Choose another hotel or go to another city I stayed here because my conference chose this hotel. I wish they had selected a different property, in fact, a different city would have been preferable. Some helpful people worked there, esp. in the restaurant, but mainly I thought the service seemed grudging, haughty, and often it took a long wait to even receive service (e.g., at front desk, concierge). The pool has about one hour of sun per day, so keep that in mind. No hot tub. The other MAJOR issue I had with this hotel was the $34/day parking charge and the $10.95 per day internet fee. Can you say nickel and dime??? Also, terrible fridge/minibar (even if you take out their stuff to put your stuff in, there is almost no room.) Also, check your bill carefully when checking out because they made numerous mistakes on mine that if I hadn't caught would have led to over $50 in extra charges. Also, no WiFi access in conference rooms, although at the front desk they think there is WiFi so they don't seem to think this is a problem. Slow elevator service, often waiting for a long time to get an elevator. Every complaint was met with attitude. I finally called the main hotel headquarters upon my return home to complain. Also, my credit card information was stolen at some point during my trip to Miami. It will be a cold day in you know where before I return to this city or to any Intercontinental hotel. On the plus side, the hotel is a short walk from the Bayside mall which has a nice selection of restaurants with nice waterfront views.

<Content>Great stay!! Beautiful view, very clean and accomodating. Lots of restaurants in the area. We had a meeting there and the food was fantastic, buffet filled with great food and fresh sushi. The bar is a fun night spot. The staff was friendly and provided excellent customer service. Hotel rooms are big! Price is pretty good for the type of service you receive. The only bad thing is the distance from South Beach, it is a bout a $15 - 25 cab ride.

<Content>Just what we wanted We stayed 2nd weekend of November with Priceline rate of $72. I ummmed and ahhhhed about whethet to give this a 4 or 5 star and I went with 4. It was a great rate considering south beach this weekend was about $190 for a similar rated hotel. Something just was a bit amiss with this hotel. The room looked a bit sparce. It had everything, in fact had shedloads of storage space, but it just didn't gel well in the way most hotels I've stayed in did. It wasn't diappointing, it just didn't have the wow factor. Some very nice touched though, such as the storage space, drawers and closet space aplenty. The best was gorgeous, wasn't so much a pillow top, more a duvet top :D A nice few of the 22nd floor. There is a free downtown monorail (monomover or something like that) and we ate at PF Changs at lunchtime before heading off to South Beach (bus about 100yards from the hotel was $2). It overlooks the park, and just the other end of the park (5min walk) if a Hard Rock cafe and Bubba Gumps. Just a bit along from that is the American Airlines Arena so perfect to the see the Heat play. We were very happy we stayed here and would stay here again if we ever took a trip to Miami again.

<Content>Very disappointed! We arrived at 8:00 pm after a long day of travel and were greeted with we don't have any record of you requesting double rooms. I had booked through Priceline and knew that I needed to call and request double rooms at their discretion. I was assured two weeks prior that it was taken care of and was no problem. After 45 minutes of standing in the lobby, we were given two double rooms. Great, all set. Went to the Bayside Market for dinner and got soaked on the way back, but still had fun. We went to bed and at 12:30 pm we were awakened to someone opening our door. luckily we had on the security lock, but it was scary. Then the phone rings and a lady demands to know who is in the room. I explain who I was and thought that was the end of it. Then the door opens again and they are pushing against the lock. By this time I was getting ready to call security and lo and behold security calls me and says they are on their way up and demanded ID. I showed them my ID and my room keys and they said I could stay (thanks!). It seems they had overbooked the hotel and were having computer problems. I then asked to speak to the manager and was informed he was busy. They were having some sort of pagent and several weddings in the hotel, so I figured I would take care of it in the morning. After a night of little sleep, I went down to check out and asked to speak to the manager again. He was still busy (VERY BUSY GUY). At this point I just wanted to leave and start my cruise. The gentleman behind the desk just kind of shrugged and said he would tell the manager what happened and we left. I was very disappointed and if this is 4* treatment give me the Holiday Inn.

<Content>Good Stay We stayed here for 6 nights in August and had a fantastic time. Except for the last couple of days being a little rainy and wet, we were very happy with the hotel. Being priority club members, we had to check in on the 29th floor and were upgraded to a nice spacious room with bay view on the 17th floor. We had a card welcoming us to the hotel and bottled water waiting in the room, which was nice, especially after a long flight from the UK. The room was very clean and the house keeping staff came round in the evenings to offer a turn down service. They would fill the ice box with ice, prepare the beds for sleep if needed and leave a card with the weather forcast for the next day. We once left a note to asking for teaspoons in our room and this was delivered before the end of the afternoon. Room service was very good too. We only ordered tea (as I had a fllu for a few days). This cost us $14 and we got about 6 herbal tea bags with lots of honey jars and lemons to last a few days!! We used the restaurant 3 times. Twice for breakfast and once for dinner (the Miami Spice offer). We were very happy with the food and service. The breakfast in particular had a lot of variety ranging from fresh fruit to cereals, cold meats, cheeses, pastries and hot foods. We have never had such fresh pastries in a hotel before. $21 might seem like alot to some people and we thought it at first but then, for the food we got, it wasn't bad at all. Both times we had breakfast, we didn't feel hungry at all during the day and only had a snack or light meal in the evening. We didn't use the pool but did have a look and wouldn't have minded relaxing by the pool except for the weather preventing it. We spent a lot of time away from the hotel, sightseeing the everglades, Key West and Key Biscayne. Overall, we enjoyed our stay. The hotel is in downtown Miami and right by the water front with views of Miami Port. Transport by trains and buses are a little inconvenient (time consuming) so we hired a car for a few days so we could explore the city and beyond. If you want a lazy beach holiday here, then stay around South Beach and Miami Beach. It takes about 10-15 mins to drive to the beach area from downtown and you have to pay for parking. The Bayside Mall is just near the hotel and has restaurants, shops and boat trips. They also have live entertainment in the evenings, which is nice to enjoy. There isn't that much to do in downtown so plan your trip well and make sure you know what you're doing. Having a car is an added bonus. We were happy to stay here as we loved the relaxing grounds of the hotel and short walk to the Bayside mall. Our room was very comfortable and we loved the views we had.

<Content>We got staff infections! We all got Pseudomona a water born staff infection caused by poorly maintained hot tubs. It causes large painful sores all over the body. The hotel staff was very nice until the illness erupted and then they were horrible. The money we spent in medical bills made the trip very expensive. They charge you to use the fitness center which we discovered after paying was under construction. During the construction the fitness center consisted of a hotel room with a few pieces of work out equipment in it. There is one overpriced restaurant, one very overpriced bar/lounge and the most expensive Starbucks I have seen outside of Japan. The fancy decor did not make up for the wicked experience we had here. I reported them and the hotel was inspected.

<Content>Top rate hotel - stingy with service Hotel is great - nice view, beautifully appointed rooms BUT beware - do not touch anything in the fridge as the items are electronically monitored and if you so much as lift something up for more than 30 seconds, even if you did not consume it, it will go into your bill. You will not be able to use the fridge in the room as it is well stocked up with drinks, etc. Intercontinental offers fridge for a fee of $30 a day! Little hotels like La Quinta Inn, Best Western, etc all have fridge in their rooms and do not charge for it. Also, their website says they have internet in the rooms. This is misleading, you still have to pay for use of internet. Plus point is that it is very close to the Bayside Market place.

<Content>Attitude at the front desk. One of my collegues spoke to Enrique to request to have an international newspaper to be printed in advance and have it readily available at the front desk for me. I made this small request in advance because I know that it takes a good twenty minutes for this special newspaper to print; and I couldn't be late to work. Once I arrived to the front desk I speak to Lauren Perez and advise her that I'm here for the paper. She replies, There's no paper here! and her response was accompanied with urban hand gestures, the rolling of eyes, and a clear view that she seemed bothered. I explained that I made this request in advance about 30 minutes ago. She asked if I spoke to someone and I told her. Lauren called Enrique and asked, Did anyone request a paper? Once she recieved the response she hung up the phone turned to me and abruptly said, Nope! No paper! I continued to say that I'll still wait for the paper because I HAD to show up to work with it. I also added if there was anywhere that I can eat breakfast in the mean time. Lauren suggested Starbucks. I replied, Is that it? So then Lauren replies, Well, everything else in here is too expensive! That left another bad taste in my mouth. Why is she assuming its too expensive for me? Isn't she supposed to promote the hotel? Who is she to judge? Is she implying that I can't afford it? I ignored her and proceeded to the hotel restaurant for breakfast which clearly was not expensive. The restauarant was very good and the waiter Vincente was very clean, prompt, and attentative. The eggs benedict were cooked perfectly with a correct portion of potatos. Overall a good experience at the restaurant. When I was done I went back to the front desk to pick up the paper and another agent Patricia helped me. Patricia was very kind, attentive, and professional by asking if there was anything else that she can assist me with. I thanked her very much and went on my way.

<Content>Great location, great views, but ready to nickel and dime you Was here for a conference that was split between the main convention center and opera house/hall that collectively comprise the Arsht Center (previously known as the Carnival Center).The hotel's location is probably the best location of any hotel downtown. Across the street from a Metromover station, right on the waterfront (with wonderful views of Biscayne Bay), 5-minute walk to Bayside Market. This area of downtown probably has the most restaurants/shopping of anywhere in downtown (as the area north of the causeway is a wasteland and Brickell is pretty much a business district). Not exactly convenient to Miami Beach or South Beach, but $1.50 direct bus ride gets you to both in about 1/2 hr.Didn't try the restaurant or bar as I had heard they were extraordinarily expensive. For us, the Starbucks worked as an acceptable breakfast option and all the restaurants at Bayside Market provided plenty of variety and prices ranges.Room was small but with a view to die for and convention rate was reasonably priced. Furnishings were in good condition and housekeeping was thorough (although slow, they typically didn't start working until mid to late afternoon and we needed to hang out in the lobby more than once while they were finishing up).Unfortunately, the pool is only open during daylight and one must walk through the spa in order to get to it (very odd layout). Nothing special about the pool area but attendants were attentive. Now to the nickel and diming. A $3/day housekeeping fee was added to the final bill. When asked about it, we were told that it was in lieu of a housekeeping tip and it was only added on the final five days of our stay (we were there nine nights altogether). So apparently, if you don't tip housekeeping staff, you get reported and it is added to your bill. We were also billed for a bottle of red wine (which we never even saw in the room) and a number of items from the fridge (which was opened and items removed to make space for a gallon of milk but the items were replaced by us the next day). We explained to reception that we didn't consume any of the items and that housekeeping never 'replenished' anything (as we put the original items back in the fridge) and reception was very good about taking the charges off our bill. Didn't go for the $12/day internet access because the conference provided internet terminals (what is it with 4  5* hotels charging an arm and a leg for wireless, but motel chains give it to you for free?).As long as your careful about the nickel and diming, this is a stylish hotel in an excellent location.

<Content>It does not worth the price This hotel is quite expensive. I was travelling on business, the hotel is luxury and well located, this is ok. However the remaining it does not worth the high prices. The service is just regular, the vallet price (if you rent a car) is out of this world - too expensive, the breakfast too. Even if you travel on business, I recommend you to save some dollars and patience staying at hyatt regency next to it.

<Content>Generally good but a couple of drawbacks for conference travel Won't repeat the many good reviews of the overall conference/business aspects of the Intercontinental, but a few things were minor but consistent hassles throughout a recent five-day stay:1) The Internet access is painfully slow, buggy, and unreliable, with webpages sometimes taking three or four refresh attempts in order to load at all. Would be fine at a Motel 6 for free, but nowhere close to par for a high-end conference hotel that charges $10.95 per day for Internet access on top of the room charge.2) The hotel restaurant is severely understaffed, at least at breakfast. Long waits to order, longer lines at the Starbucks dealing with customers who gave up on the restaurant, etc. Makes it a challenge to get to conference sessions or out touring on time.3) Hotel gym is brand new but extremely underequipped and small for a $10.95 per day supplementary charge. Great for basic cardio machines and free weights, but if you need balls, mats, or other equipment you'll have to look elsewhere.

<Content>Loved it!! I got my room for $128 on Hotwire.I LOVED this hotel! We stayed there one night, during a 3 night Memorial Weekend stay with the other two nights being in SoBE.I loved loved loved this hotel! I wish we could've stayed there the entire time. Check in was painless. There was no line and no hassles at the front desk. The elevator service was quick and our room was easy to find. The lobby and room decor was brightly colored and very contemporary. The hotel has a very metropolitan feel. The guy at the front desk was great.We didn't spend much time in the room because we were in MIAMI and ready to party! My only complaint is that ordered room service late that night and they never delivered it to my room. I wasn't too upset though because I was a little tipsy so I just fell asleep. The next morning I ordered breakfast in and they delivered that very promptly. At check in they tried to charge me for the room service that never came but once I explained what happened they immediately fixed the mistake.The hotel is about a $20 cab ride from South Beach so if you stay there but plan to visit SoBe you should keep that in mind.I don't have any complaints about the hotel and I would stay there again.

<Content>Fabulous Hotel Close to Shopping  I booked this hotel through easyclicktravel.com for $250 a night. I would have never paid the listed rate of $550.00! My best friend and I stayed here for 1 night before our cruise the next day. We were on the 25th floor  paid a $30 upgrade fee for a view of the cruise port ~ it was worth it. What a beautiful hotel. The staff were all super friendly  very helpful. Our room was fantastic with two very comfy queen beds and a wall of windows overlooking the bay and shopping area. The bathroom was huge with a wonderful tiled shower  big tub. The sink, vanity  closet area were separated by a door from the toilet and shower. There was also a very plush bathrobe available. Beware of the mini bar! The items inside were very expensive  if you as much as lifted them out of their spot, you were immediately charged for that item. Somehow the fridge was electronically connected to the front desk. We were able to walk right over to Bayside Marketplace for lots of shopping, restaurant choices and live music. In the morning we took advantage of the Starbucks located right in the lobby of the hotel. We went ahead  checked out early but asked if we could leave our bags with the porter. They charged us $1.00 per bag which is not much, but we felt was really not fair. We could have just left them in the room  checked out later. We said as much but they would not budge. So we just let that per bag charge be their tip for putting the luggage in the taxi when we came back. Overall a wonderful hotel  I would definitely stay there again. Very up to date with all the modern conveniences  absolutely spotless. Fantastic views. Short walk for shopping  restaurants. Five minutes from the cruise port.

<Content>Good hotel This is a good 4 star hotel for people who are going on cruises or wanting to be close to downtown Miami. It's about 10 min by taxi to South beach which was not that bad for us.If you like to sit by the pool all day DON'T stay here- the pool gets pretty well no sun in the afternoon due to a condo that is directly beside it. The service was great at the hotel and the rooms were comfortable and clean. There were a few issues with getting internet service in the rooms but guest services was quick to deal with all problems. I would stay here again.

<Content>Classy Hotel Really glad we stayed here. The room was clean with never ending hot water. The bed was very comfortable with great linens. The gym was well supplied with equipement, and was open 24 hrs. We ate at the restaurant our 1st night there and the food was tastey and reasonably priced. The conceiges gave accurate advise. The Enterprise car rental was close by and we left the car in the hotel lot, and they picked it up, nice service. The pool area was nice and clean. We would definetly stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Good stay at the Intercontinental Miami I've stayed at a number of hotels in the Miami/Coconut Grove area when I visit for the Sony Ericsson tennis tournament and they were all booked, so I made a reservation at this hotel. After reading the reviews on this site, I was worried about my stay. I didn't have to be. I found everyone at the hotel friendly and helpful and the rooms quiet and clean. I ate one meal at the hotel and the food was good. I was there for 4 nights and had no negative experiences. The location of the hotel was convenient for my trips to Key Biscayne.

<Content>Conference Style Hotel Enough good things have been said about this Intercontinental, and I'm in agreement with them. If you like mega-hotels that can hold large conferences, this is the place. Bellmen and concierge are cheerful, helpful, friendly- they are what made the stay such a pleasure, and somewhat compensated from the cold, sometimes rude reception staff. If the fitness room is important to you, then check before you book to see if the new spa/fitness area is finished constructed. As of 3/17/08 it wasn't, and the fitness center is nothing but machines crowded in individual, cramped rooms. The pool is great- heated and clean. Ask for a room that looks out to the bay (and pay more) or you might find yourself staring at the bricks of a high rise. If you're lucky, you'll spot dolphins and manatees swimming in the bay!The price of food in this hotel is robbery. $21 for a breakfast of eggs? Watch out for other acts of apparent greed: a $1 charge for each suitcase you want to store with the hotel, even if you've booked under their priority club program ($150 a year fee). They should mention that this goes directly to the bellmen, or allow them to just keep it as a tip. With all the additional costs tacked on here and there it leaves a bad taste to your stay. A farmers' market takes place near the hotel that shouldn't be missed (tomatoes, orchids, avocados, grapefruits). Public transportation (buses and the monorail) leave you right near the hotel as well. Taxi prices can add up, and if you're going to South Beach, it is a pleasant, short ride on the bus.Overall, it was a pleasant stay.

<Content>Bellmen wee the best!! Excellent stay! Family of 6 with a three year old in a luxury hotel! We pulled it off! Very helpful staff at the door. Room was clean, bathroom great with large area for dressing, did not feel like a hotel bathroom. Gorgeous view for a thirty dollar upgrade. This was a priceline deal, two rooms Feb 29th, 2008 for $205.00 each. It was worth it. (Didn't like view of first room we had, so husband went down and payed the thirty extra for better room.) Watched everything happening outside including helicopters flying by, cool! Regular room rates are $439. and up. Not sure I'd want to spend that. Pool was fantastic! WARM, VERY WARM! That was GOOD! Felt so relaxing and spa like. Outdoor bar area. No other children in sight. Not a super family oriented hotel, but you can make it work. Nice playground/park area steps away from hotel. Did not get a chance to get there, visit was over to quickly. Bayside was okay. Not what I thought it would be, and be careful at night. But, on the other hand my 23, 21, and 19 year old daughters LOVED bayside shopping. My daughter fell in love with a straw hat on Espanyola Way, but didn't want to spend the $38.00 on it. She found the identical hat for $15.00. My three year old grandson had his picture taken while holding huge parrots for $20.00 He loved it! He held a baby alligator and snake as well! Almost took a flying leap down the stairs of the lobby, embarrased myself and scared the life out of myself, but it seemed no one saw!! Then a few moments later the lady from the front desk came and helped me with my bags. She didn't say a word, just helped me. Nice of her.Bellman negotiated the taxi fare with driver who wanted to overcharge us. He just told the driver how it was going to be! Thank you Mr. Bellman! Sorry, can't remember his name, but again bellmen were the best! They helped us get a stroller for the day that was a lifesaver!!!

<Content>Fabulous!! I planned and hosted a conference at the hotel and was very impressed with the accomodations and the staff. The staff was extremely friendly, helpful and the hotel is gorgeous. The room was luxurious, the bed comfortable, and the view of the harbor and port and Miami beach - awesome. I loved the beautiful bathroom and the shower was great. It also has a nice pool area with a heated pool and 2 jacuzzis that were very relaxing. The hotel food was also delicious. I couldn't say more great things about this hotel...I highly recommend it!

<Content>Beautiful Hotel, great pre-cruise location Stayed one night pre-cruise. Could see our ship from the hotel. Beautiful views of the bay from the hotel poolside bar. Short walk to Bayside area - lots of shops and restaurants. Short cab ride to ship in morning. Felt very safe in area - even walking through park at night.

<Content>Pleasant Stay Stayed at this hotel about 7 yrs. ago and had a good experience so we chose it again for a 2 night pre-cruise accommodation. LIked the convenient location as well.We got a a good rate through an agent for a nice upper floor view room of the harbor area. Check in was in the early evening and went quickly and the desk staff were very polite. The room was fine overall and generally well appointed and the beds were very comfortable. We decided to see what the additional cost would be to upgrade in order to have access to the Club Lounge. The rate was reasonable and more than covered what the cost would be for breakfast and drinks and snacks each day, so we went ahead and upgraded. Were pleased with the breakfast available and all the other food and drink service throughout the day and into the evening. Also nice to have free internet. All of the lounge staff were really very polite and helpful with any requests we had and went out of their way to make sure we enjoyed our time in the lounge. Definitely made our stay all that more pleasant.

<Content>Very nice, comfortable hotel We stayed at the InterContinental during our trip to Miami for the Orange Bowl. The hotel is not on the beach, but it's in a great location in downtown Miami.Our one complaint was related to check-in. We arrived on New Year's Day, and LOTS of people were checking out and checking in that day. It took about 5 hours for the hotel to get us into our room. I know it was a busy day (and a holiday), but this seemed like an extraordinarily long time to wait.Nonetheless, the room was very spacious, and the bed was was comfortable. Our room had a great view of Biscayne Bay.

<Content>No Value Here! We were leaving on a cruise and needed one night prior in Miami for a hotel stay. I called Intercontinental and the hotel sounded like a good choice. The rated quoted was $239.00 for a double room. I went a head and booked it. I wrote down in my day planner $239.00 and gave them my credit card. When we checked in the front desk told me my rate was $525.00. I was shocked. I would have never booked a $525.00 for one pre-cruise night! The desk insisted that is what I was quoted and would not hear my plea. I wanted to find a different hotel, but was told my credit card was charged and this room was NONREFUNDABLE. I was stunned any rate for $525.00 NONREFUNDABLE.I lost the argument and we went up to the room. The room was nice for $239.00, but had no value for $525.00. It was just a standard hotel room, small, two twin beds and an average sized bathroom. The only thing special was that we had a nice view of the port.The hotel is large and full of groups and cruise passengers. I hope they all got better rates than we did! The lobby is stunning with fresh flowers and big dramtic sculptures. We had breakfast at the hotel in the lobby. The setting was dramatic and the food was good. However once again it was high priced and I felt ripped off.This is a good hotel. I have few complaints about the level of service, decor or comfort factor. I was amazed at the room rate and totally felt the hotel made a mistake. The attitude of the front desk and management was - we don't care. If I got a better rate at this hotel I would stay here again, but never again at this rate.

<Content>Don't stray off the beaten path Stayed for two days before embarking on a cruise. Nice, clean, fancy hotel. Little pricey, paid $5 for a smaller then small iced tea by the poolside. A couple blocks Northeast is Bayside Mall, which was nice to see and visit-highly recommended for something to do while visiting. Nightlife at Bayside Mall was also nice, they have a couple spots that have live bands playing outside. One block West of the hotel was downtown and lots of shops, but very, very run down. Even scarey and would not want wander down that way at night in the dark. Hotel is literally a 5 minute cab ride to Miami port. Don't care much for the section of the city we stayed in but this was a nice hotel.

<Content>Love the hotel We booked this hotel for one night before embarking on our Cruise. I was a little leery of all the negative comment I've read regarding the friendliness of the hotel staff; I'm happy to report that there were no unpleasant incidents at all. The lady at the front desk did not try to sell us anything additional. We were given a room facing the bay where we enjoyed the view of our cruise ship and saw dolphins playing in the water. The Bayside Marketplace and CVS were both a short walk away from the hotel to pick up any last minute items that you might have forgotten.The room itself was manificient, well-kept and quite large. We almost hated to leave to go onto the ship. I would definately stay here again should the opportuniry arrives.

<Content>Good hotel, poor maintenance  Good location and stylish hotel. Check-in not very efficient. Having pre-booked and confirmed, we arrived at 5:30pm but had to wait until 6:45pm for a room to become available. Good room (20th floor) and bathroom, but only luke-warm water (bill was subsequently discounted). Excellent buffet breakfast.

<Content>Wouldn't stay there again I stayed at the ICC Miami for about a month because of some work in Miami. I upgraded to the VIP level (at a cost of $150) because it made sense for the month. Had a nice view of the water, but didn't realize that Friday and Saturday nights at the nearby shopping area are very, very noisy - loud music playing until 2:00 in the morning that we could hear a block away. For some good sleep, I would have traded the view.My first night there, around 4:30 am, I heard someone trying to come into my room. My security lock hadn't worked, but fortunately the bolt was on. The person didn't respond when I challenged them so I called security. The maintenance man tried to tell me the security lock did work because he got it to work once. The minute he (and the security person and the manager) walked away, the lock didn't work, so I made them come back. Apparently the bellmen all have universal keys, and the bellman had come to the wrong room. Nevertheless, with no security bolt, I felt uncomfortable, so they moved me (and a month's worth of luggage that had been unpacked just hours earlier and had to be repacked for moving) to another room with the same view.A couple of days later, it turns out that President Bush's advance team camped out -- with all their electronic equipment -- on the floor I was on, so we were tripping over cables for about 3-4 days.There were other incidents over the course of the month as well, but the one that burned me most is a charge for a no-show that I have been trying to get removed now for 2 months. Each person I speak with tells me it's been removed and credited back to my card, but then it isn't.There were some good moments with some personnel who went above and beyond the call, but frankly, overall, this is not a hotel that I could recommend.

<Content>Beautiful, Comfortable Hotel Spent three nights on the club floor at the Intercontinental for a conference. My room was quite big with a sitting area, large desk  a fantastic bathroom. The bed was very comfortable. The TV had many more channels than most hotels offer. The club room had a variety of offerings including smoked salmon every morning  top shelf liquor  some pretty good wines at happy hour. They only had a couple computers for use though -- no wireless in the club room. The bar  restaurant were above average as well -- the restaurant has a fabulous wine list. Although my check in experience was initially awful -- stay away from Ana, customer service is not her strong point (I saw others suffering a similar fate later in my stay) -- Ruth cleared things up  made me feel welcome. Double-check your reservation -- ours were mixed up  I know of at least 3 others who had issues as well. The conference facilities were nice, although everyone was disappointed with the overcooked Chilean sea bass. The gym is tiny (they're turning the former gym into a spa opening January 2008); I later learned guests could access the facility across the street. I would definitely go back... and ask for Ruth when I got there.

<Content>nice view Stayed at Intercontinental Miami 2 weeks ago for few days. Overall, the stay was fine. We stayed at this hotel about 4 yrs ago when it was brand new. The rooms are showing its age. Since I am an ambassador member, got upgraded to a bay view executive room with a great view just like 4 years ago. The service I received at the club lounge was impeccable, but again, the club and its facility is showing its age. Need to be updated. The spa and gym was under renovation and the temporary work out facility was a disgrace. Last complaint. The front desk girl let a guy cut in front of the line while other people were waiting for 10 minutes. Need better training from the upper management. Other than this unpleasant incident, the stay was fine.

<Content>Great hotel I stayed here one night before traveling out of the country. So, my stay was short.Service: The woman at the front desk was very helpful. She didn't try to sell me an upgrade as many other tripadvisor members have experienced. Actually she GAVE me an upgrade to a room with a waterview because I was on crutches with a broken foot. She said she felt bad for me. The conceaige was helpful in recommending a restaurant that served stone crab, and called them to see how long the wait for a table was.Rooms: The rooms were average size, and nicely decorated. The view was great. The bathroom was large and beautiful, nice shower, and separate tub. Comfortable beds.Pool: I didn't use the pool but walked down to look at it. It was not crowded, and looked very nice. There was a small restaurant at the pool.Restaurant: We only ate breakfast at this location, but the service was good as was the food. Average in pricing. There is a 20% service charge regardless if you have room service or eat in the restaurant.Location: This hotel is about 20-25 minutes from Miami International airport. There is a maximum taxi fee to the airport which is $26.Overall, no complaints....I stay at Intercontinental Hotels when ever I can.

<Content>Great place to Stay in Miami I was a little anxious about staying at this hotel after reading some of the reviews but i needn't have worried, my husband and I had a very pleasant overnight stay prior to our cruise.It was our first visit to Miami and our first cruise and after a long flight from the UK we were tired and wanted a pleasant environment to chill out in, we got it. The hotel seemed busy as there was a charity running event taking place outside the following day but the room was very quiet and comfortable. The bathroom was large with lots of very nice bathroom products. The hotel is well located with a park and bayside out the front, a leisurely five minute walk took us to the bayside shopping area where we had a nice breakfast overlooking the water. We had no hard sell for upgraded rooms and there were no probelms with the bill on check out.

<Content>Great Stay! I was on govt. travel with a colleague to a convention at this hotel, but after reading some of the other reviews we originally booked in Sept. at the H.I. port downtown @ $107. I realized the day before departure that a per diem change occurred 10/1 to $146 and changed to this hotel. Boy was I glad I did! My colleague stayed there and believe me the difference is night and day. The H.I. is obviously an older hotel and it shows, from the small lobby, worn furnishings, rather small spartan room  bath, and back office building view he had. In addition, he had forgotten his contractors govt. id and after presenting mine as his supervisor the second day, they assured us they would change his $165 rate, which he found out they did not when he checked out.In comparison, I've stayed in fine hotels worldwide and this one has one of the nicest art deco lobby's. I checked in at 3:45 PM on Sunday and there was no line and a friendly staff. When inquiring about my room view they did sell the Ambassador Package which I declined and proceeded to my art deco back-side room on the 19th floor. I had a direct view of the pool below, faced condos about 100 yards away, and a side-view of the bay. The large bathroom was all in stone tile, as well as the separate room with door for the toilet and shower, including the fixtures. The two queens beds were plush and comfortable with 6 pillows each. I especially enjoyed the soft glow from the orange lamp on the TV/Armoire, which was a very pleasant in the evenings. I signed up and utilized the HS internet service with no problems. The housekeeping was excellent and upon occasion when my scheduled varied, I called to request service upon departing, which was promptly performed with a voice mail left for me each time to follow-up. The fridge has micro-sensors recording each item moved, and there is no room for additional storage. Opening the door numerous times did not result in any charge. Public parking is available in front of the bldg. with about 30-40 spaces for a rate of $1.25/hr, however not permitted from 2-7 AM.The only problem I did encounter was when I couldn't get into my room on the third day. I obtained a new key from the desk and still couldn't get in, at which point they sent a clerk up with me. Neither my nor his house key worked, so he radioed for assistance after which the hotel detective arrived, verified my ID and sent up a locksmith, who reset the lock with his computer and let me in. This all took about 15 minutes. Somewhat annoying, but I felt reasonably dealt with. Check-out was fast and smooth with no erroneous charges and a taxi to the airport quickly obtained.

<Content>Wonderful service, great location Had the good fortune to stay at the Intercontinental as it was the host hotel for the ING Miami Marathon and Half Marathon. The hotel was packed but everything ran so smoothly it sometimes seemed like we were the only people there.The room was large and comfortable with a great view of the bay. Pillows and beds made me want to sleep all day! The service staff kept it clean with fresh sheets and towels. For a hotel this size, crowded as it was, the elevators were fast, efficient and roomy. Just about every staff member I interacted with was friendly and professional (with one minor front desk exception) and made me feel welcome.The location was great...close to the Miami Airlines arena, Bayfront Park and the downtown people mover. It was just a short drive to Miami Beach. I like Miami Beach, but appreciated the quiet of my 16th floor room when sleeping the night before the race. Would definitely stay here again. One note, the line at the Starbucks in the lobby can get very long, but there are plenty of great coffee places within a five minute walk if you don't mind a pleasant stroll.

<Content>Excellent Pre and Post Cruise Experience We chose this hotel for a 2-day pre and 1-day post cruise stay. The hotel was excellent ... supurb service, excellent room and bedding and amenities, great tour desk reception. Location was excellent, 10 mins/$10 cab ride to pier, and 20 mins/$20 taxi ride airport to hotel or pier. A short walk from hotel to Bayside Marketplace was great for entertainment, food, music, shopping. We booked a bus and boat tour of Miami from the hotel tour desk and were given preferential treatment getting on the bus and boat. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Miami either overnight or a longer period of time. There is a Starbucks in the lobby and a pub and dining area on site. Hotel was clean and had a beautiful lobby. PR BC/Canada

<Content>A MUST! My experience at the InterContinental Miami has been so far one of the best ones I have had.I have visited over 140 cities around the world, from pleasure to business purposes. The quality of service, staff and overall experience I had in this hotel was just great.The doormen were very courteous and helpful from start and the receptionist ensured she was giving me exactly what I wanted when selecting a room.As soon as I arrived in my room, the bellman (with an unbelievable positive attitude) arrived with the luggage and shortly after I was receiving a call from the reception asking me if everything was satisfactory in the room.Food  Beverage staff was extremely helpful in ensuring the food was in my taste and in-room dining was precise in delivering my breakfast at the exact time I requested the night before. I even ordered my wake-up call for the next morning with the in-room dining attendant I spoke to, regretting the information would not be passed on properly and I would not receive the call. Guess what, at 6AM I was receiving my personal wake up call!Long story short...yes, yes, yes, definitely a hotel I will go back to, with friends and family. The place looks gorgeous, the staff is wonderful, the service is great. Its value for money from beginning to end (even more considering the rates are more than worth it) !

<Content>Haven't even checked in yet, and I don't like it! I am spending 5 nights for a conference at the Miami InterContinental Hotel, and wanted to see if I could request, in advance, a room with a view of the bay. I called and was told that a room with a view of the bay is an extra $30.00 per night! Unbelievable!

<Content>Don't stay here if you hope to sleep! What is the Number 1 reason people book a hotel room? TO HAVE A PLACE TO SLEEP.My flight was delayed, so I didn't arrive at the InterContinental until 1:30 a.m. Then at 7 am, they began CONSTRUCTION directly above my room--hammering, sanding, and scraping-- and woke me.I called the front desk. They promised to send somebody up. I should have know that they were lying; they never sent anyone.Then at 10 am, I had to give a talk in front of 800 people in your ballroom. Exhausted, trashed, and furious.I slogged through the day bleary-eyed--and I'll never get that day back.

<Content>Very good downtown Miami Conveniently located on the waterfront downtown. Short walk to the Bayside shopping and restaurant area. Big and bright lobby with comforable seating area. My room was a well maintained double with 2 very good queen beds. View was limited to the next building with a glimpse of Biscayne Bay. Bathroom was nice and spacious but the water pressure in the shower could have been better. Excellent and very well organized breakfast buffet in a relaxed atmosphere. A good place to stay if you want to be downtown Miami.

<Content>VERY disappointing We were hesitant to book a room at this hotel due to the numerous negative reviews on TripAdvisor. What's posted on this website is usually pretty accurate and this was no exception. The hotel tries to sell itself as an upscale, five-star establishment....I could better describe it as a high-rise Econolodge with lots of marble and glitz. We decided to take a chance and stayed pre-cruise on July 27th. As we were arriving in Miami late morning, I phoned the Intercontinental the previous day to inquire about early check-in. The desk clerk who took my call informed me that an early check-in would be no problem. Upon our arrival at 11:45, I was promptly told of course that check-in was at 4:00. I mentioned my phone phone call the previous day. The blunt reply was, we have no room available, check back in two hours, NEXT. After several visits to the front desk throughout the afternoon, we were able to check-in at 3:30. The desk clerk made it pretty clear what a big favor he was doing us by letting us check-in early and giving me the wrong keys for the room on the 23rd floor. If you stay here, at least you can sit by the pool in your street clothes and have a drink. Don't forget your wallet though, two beers and a bad margarita will run you about $25. The room was fairly clean......nothing extraordinary. Overall, other than it's close proximity to Bayfront Park and the cruise terminal, the Intercontinental doesn't have much going for it. One good thing to mention, they left me a message on my answering machine in Rhode Island to let me know my room was ready! I guess they figured I went home to wait......

<Content>Tries to be upscale but fails I stayed here one night for business. I got in at 10:30pm, hungry, so I called room service and ordered food. They said it would be delivered in 30 to 35 minutes. At 11:45 I called back to see where the food was. A different person answered the phone and told me they had no record of my order. I didn't want to wait, I was sleepy, so I told them to forget and went to bed. The next morning I enjoyed the water pressure in the shower but didn't enjoy the fact that the shower flooded the floor of the entire bathroom. I noticed this as I got out, and I also noticed a crack in the floor that water was disappearing down into. I wouldn't want to have been in the room below. I would not stay here again.

<Content>Twice in a month I've stayed at the InterContinental Miami two weeks ago, on a stop over before a Royal Caribbean cruise, and immediately afterwards . My two kids and I really loved the hotel. On both stays, we've been given the same high quality treatment, and first class rooms with superb view to the Bayside. From our window, at the 37th floor, we could see our ship docking! The concierge has been really helpful, having spent half an hour before succeeding to get us a fine table at the best stone crab restaurant in town. I accepted the ambassador plan, so we were entitled to early check-ins and extended check-outs. Travelling with teen-agers, it turned out to be very convenient. I strongly recommend it as the best (affordable) luxury hotel in downtown Miami.

<Content>STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!! Attention Convention/Meeting Planners: Please don't trap your attendees in this awful place!!!!! My husband and I are here for a medical meeting, and I've NEVER seen such shameless, high pressure bait and switch upselling anywhere. Is this really an InterContinental?CHECK IN: Be prepared for a long wait as everyone who checks in is given a brochure and lengthy sales pitch for their $150 ambassador plan that allows you to use the exercise facillities without paying and to check out at 4:00 pm at any InterContinental for 13 months. After you've declined at least 3 times, you then get pitched the $30 a night upgrade to a bay view room, which you will also have to repeatedly decline. If you are one of many conference attendees checking in at the same time, you can imagine how long it takes for the line to move -- very irritating after a long day of travelling.BUT IT GOT WORSE:We arrived early last eveing with only our confirmation number in hand -- BIG MISTAKE. We were quoted the conference rate of $198 a night for the duration of our stay (Tues-Sat nights), but when we checked in, they told us the rate for Saturday would be $398 because they are 98% full. We asked to speak to the manager, but she was unavailable. Because we don't have the printed confirmation, they won't honor the rate. So....we endured the pitches for the ambasador plan and upgrades and finally got to our room. We reserved a King room and were given a room with 2 double beds. We called downstairs from the phone on the desk (the one between the beds didn't work). We said we would even take a smoking room with a King bed, but we had to listen to their pitches AGAIN before they would even check to see if one was available! Finally, one hour and 15 minutes after we drove up to the hotel, we were shown to the room we reserved...but it was smoking. That is absolutely unacceptable in my book.WATCH FOR EXTRA CHARGES:We went to dinner in the hotel's Indigo restaurant. The two of us had their buffet which was $25 per person. I ordered a glass of wine and my husband had iced tea. The salad bar was good...tossed green salad with all the typical toppings, chilled grilled vegetables, hummus, stone crab claws, assorted cheeses, roasted asparagus, caprese salad, ratatouille, etc. The entrees however, were awful. If you like those dry, salty boulliony cheap Vegas buffets, this will be right up your alley. We didn't have dessert, so I can't comment. Our bill should have been about $65 or so, but it was $80. For our convenience, they added a 15% gratuity to our check ON A BUFFET FOR TWO PEOPLE!!!I have stayed at InterContinental hotels in New York, Chicago, Vegas and San Francisco, and I have never had an experience like this. I don't know if this is a new trend for the hotel chain, but I will never stay in another one.

<Content>nice location bad staff I have never been to a hotel that was so money hungry. they wanted extra money for everything, parking, luggage, internet, etc. You better go with a lot of small bills for tips.I am a diabetic and when I asked about refridgeration for my medicine I was told that they charge $20/day to use thier fridge, ice was not available on every floor. When I tried to check in they had given my room away and I had to pay an upgrade charge to get a room similar to the one I booked weeks ago.The staff at the front desk in snooty, much of the rest of the staff are not nice.I was forced to stay here because my business meeting was here, I will consider commuting from another hotel if I have to return.

<Content>Overrated Hotel One Tripadvisor summed it all up: this is the Nickel and Dime Hotel, \and I truly agree with him/her. Don't get me wrong, I like to stay in 5-star hotels, only want the best, and I would gladly pay for it as long as I get what I want. As a paying guest, they still want you to pay for using their sorry fitness center. They charge for late check out. They do not provide a Hotel Shuttle. Concierge are slow in getting back to you or not call you back. Front Desk folks are rude. The only thing I am impressed is the closet space being bigger than any other hotels I know. I am however not impressed with the service and rooms. I booked a bayview front hotel which was one of the best available on their website...however, beware because they do not list all the choices of rooms on their site because once you check in, they will ask if you want to upgrade and/or wait until you complain about your room. They will ask you to then switch or upgrade and make you pay more for a room that you should have received in the first place. Overall, as my friend always says, this place sucked. Don't be fooled with the opulent lobby and facade...trust me, their rooms are not all that! You will see once you see the size of their room doors. Lastly, here's one culture shock... Where I come from, it is rude to speak a language other than English to a colleague in front of English speaking guests as if the guests do not exist. I thought I was still in the US...but I guess this is Miami culture for you.

<Content>Nice rooms, poor management/staff Rooms were ok - fairly roomy and clean with comfortable bed. No problems with the room except for the fact that the wifi (not free) in my room worked only intermittently, making it very difficult to send email as the connection kept dropping. When I first checked in, I had a nice bathrobe waiting in the closet, but after the first day it disappeared.Crtique/Watch Out For:Food in hotel is overpriced and mediocre - better off to walk down to Bayside a few blocks and eat at one of the chain places - better food at a lower price.Hotel tried to charge me twice for wifi access than proceeded to argue with me about it. I got the problem resolved, but it should be obvious to anyone with an IQ over 90 that if someone is charged for wifi twice for the same day, it's an error. Funny thing is that at least three other people I talked to had the same thing happen to them. Incompetent IT and billing staff or a scam by the hotel trying to pad the top line? You decide.Banquet staff was the WORST I've ever seen at a conference - rude and hostile to conference attendees - based upon what I saw I would think very hard if you are a conference planner considering this place. Whoever runs banquets and/or catering there should be fired for inability to manage their staff properly.At any rate, the Intercontinental would be a nice hotel if the management was competent. And p.s. - this is for the Intercontinental Group execs - stop trying to rip off business travelers with your b.s. fees ($1.95 per calling card calls!). It just makes us book our business at places like Embassy, etc. when we have a choice. The Ritz you ain't ...

<Content>Nice! We stayed here pre and post cruise and loved it. We booked through Priceline for $85 each night when the hotels website had the rooms listed at $225. You should never pay full price for a hotel room. Do the research, there is always a better deal out there. In 2003 we stayed at the Hyatt downtown and we liked the InterContinental much more. (although the Hyatt has balconies and the Inter doesn't). At checkin I asked for a port view and was told it would be $20 extra. Well worth it to see the ships pull into port in the morning. The rooms and bathrooms are both oversized. Bedding was terrific. We didn't eat at the hotel but did have pre-dinner and post-dinner drinks in the hotel bar. Very good service, decent priced drinks(for a hotel bar), and I even talked to basketball player Gary Peyton at the bar. Nice guy. Bellman and Front desk were both great. Didn't use the pool, but did sit in the hot tubs the last night. Talk about a view! Starbucks is nice to have in the lobby for a morning treat. There isn't much downtown except bayside marketplace and there are a couple good local restaurants there that should be tried. Would we stay here for a vacation, NO! But for a 1 night stay before a cruise there isn't a better deal in Miami.

<Content>Decent property My wife and I stayed at the Intercontinental Miami at an ABA conference. We had a nice stay, but if we hadn't been at a conference there I would definitely stay somewhere else. LOCATION: The hotel was right downtown, which is good and bad. There are no decent restaurants nearby and the downtown area is pretty empty after work hours. There is a mall within walking distance, but the food there is mostly touristy stuff (Bubba Gump, Hard Rock, etc.) nothing decent. I was very happy we had a car, because there is great food to be had in that town -- especially in South Beach. SERVICE: we thought the room service, concierge and other services were terrific. We stayed in an concierge floor (for more money) so we were able to get a light breakfast and an evening social hour with food and drinks every day. Checkout was eassy, and we did not find any unwarranted charges on our bill as some have complained about. I opened the mini-bar but didnt take anything out, and there was no charge on the bill.ROOM: I thought the rooms were average, the bathrooms were pretty dated, but the beds were terrific. It looks like they tried to update the hotel, but didnt make it to the bathrooms. Overall I thought the hotel was fine, but I would rather be in South Beach.

<Content>Good Location in Miami The hotel is well-located in downtown Miami amidst a building blitz, near the port and Bayside Mall. I was there for a conference and the conference accomodations were fine. Food was average. The room was comfortable but definitely in need of updating, especially the closet area. No real intereaction with staff, didn't use room service. Nice, small restaurant poolside. Bayside Mall is definitely miss-able, a real tourist type with cheap merchandise.

<Content>A pleasant stay @ the Interconti I'm always very satified when I visit the Intercontinental. The bed is comfortable and the room is well appointed. Now that they've added a Starbucks in the lobby I'm even happier! (I'm addicted to the lemon pound cakes.)Our most recent stay was for 4 nights prior to leaving for a cruise. Staying downtown provided easy access to all points of interest (we love Coconut Grove  South Beach) and it's minutes from the Port of Miami. My only complaint is for the valet service as one of the drivers broke something on my gear shift during a previous visit and that claim has been ignored since the day I completed the forms. At $29 per day for parking you should get your car back just as it is given. But not even that small incident will keep me away for the Interconti.

<Content>A Good Experience We stayed here for three nights pre- cruise at the end of November. We got a GREAT deal at about 拢70 per night on [--]- in fact I have checked prices since, and this really was a very good rate! I have read some of the negative reviews of this hotel, but must say that we had a very good experience. The reception staff were polite, the bell men were great and the concierge could not have been more helpful. The location is good, close to Bayside and with the metro mover very close by.We got a very comfortble room on the 26th floor over looking the bay, which meant we could see the cruise ships in the morning. Big bathroom with separate dressing area and plenty of towels and toiletries.We never ate in the hotel although we had a few drinks in the bar. For breakfast we simply strolled across to Bayside which has plenty of shops and restaurants to choose from. If you can get a good rate, I would definitely recommend staying here pre or post cruise.

<Content>Indigo Restuarant S---- Well the purpose of my letter and the reason I am writing to you is to let you know that two of my friends who flew in from Los Angeles, CA and were staying at your hotel and I had quite horrible service at your Indigo restaurant.I picked up my friends at Miami International Airport on Saturday, January 27th approximately at 5 PM. I drove them to your hotel to check in and then we decided we would like to eat and the concierge told us that Indigo was convenient and located on the premises. My friends and I were seated promptly. The restaurant was not busy. There weren鈥檛 many people seating in the dining area. In fact, most of the tables were free. Granted the hotel was crowded with guests arriving for the Atlantis cruise, but most of them were in the bar area and not inside Indigo.We waited about 20 minutes to be greeted by a waiter. At which time we told him we were ready to order. He told us that he would take the drink order and come back for the rest of the order. We reminded him that we were ready to order and he interrupted us to only say, 鈥淚 will only take your drink order for now!鈥?About 15 minutes later our drinks arrived. The waiter then took our order. About 20 minutes passed and our drinks were empty. The waiter was no where in sight. We asked another waiter who was passing by if we could get refills, and he simply glared at us and told us that we needed to tell our server. Alas, our waiter did not return or was even visible for quite some time. Another 20 minutes passed at which time my friend got up and went to the hostess stand to request to see a manager. About 15 minutes later a dark haired man in a blue suit approached our table. We told him that we still did not receive our food or even refills. He said he would take care of things. Another 20 minutes passed at which time a lemonade was delivered to our table but no other drinks. Mind you, I was having lemonade, my friend was drinking Diet Coke, and his friend was having water with lemon. These are not alcoholic drinks from the bar. This is not something that requires this long of a time frame to prepare and deliver to the table.Another 20 minutes passed. By now we decided we would leave the hotel and go dine elsewhere. As we were leaving I informed a brunette named 鈥淢onica鈥?that the service was horrible and that we were left waiting for such a long time. Meanwhile, the table next to us got seated AFTER us and they received their meal AND already had dessert and paid their check and were leaving before us!Monica merely said she knows and that there was nothing she could do. She didn鈥檛 apologize or even sympathize with the situation. Obviously this must be a regular occurrence at Indigo!To make matters worse, my friend Jeff found out the hotel charged his credit card 4 times for his one night stay. Granted, they offered to upgrade him to a larger room. But this was such a horrible and unacceptable experience I wanted to make sure I informed you of what is going on in your hotel.

<Content>Great for business, beware of extra charges I note that the reviews for this hotel are very varied indeed.. After staying there twice my familly, I really don't find it as bad as many reviewers before me. The service we recieved was in general very good and the staff was helpful to us. Especially the spanish speaking staff where great (we speak spanish) and very friendly.1. There are only two restaurants, the main one offers very nice buffets for breakfast and lunch, with limited selection but excellent quality. The pool restaurant offers a simple menu with well tasting food. There is a starbucks in the lobby (!) so if you want to save a few bucks, you can get your coffee and snacks there!Room service is expensive, sometimes quite slow and the food quite greasy and average tasting, your better off running down to the starbucks.2. The pool area is small and only has sun a few hours, so if your looking to spend your time in miami sunbathing, go elsewhere.3. Valet parking is expensive, but there is a public parking in front of the hotel that is inexpensive (and you don't have to wait for your car).In general the rooms are very large and nice and the hotel is clean, luxurious and very well maintainedThe location is excellent smack in the middle of down town with easy access to everything.If you get a good deal on the room, or are going to Miami on business i would definately recommend it...

Bayside market is a very short walk away as well as American Airlines arena. Since we are Priority Club members of high status we had private check -in and the Club room was good. We had a king room with a separate walk-in shower and soaking tub, which was nice. Also an in-room safe was provided. Maid service was unobtrusive and clean. They provide you with both a shampoo and conditioner....separate!!! Pool area is nice but the adjoining building makes the sun hard to see. Bell staff very prompt and hotel is generally quiet. (Note our stay was Jan 2-4, 2007)

<Content>room was fine. Overall I liked the hotel. Excellent interior, clean bed. but I did not like several things.1. parking is terrible. If you use valet parking, it costs $29 for overnight, also hourly costs is $9. They do not have self parking. There is no choice for parking.2. this hotel is located in down town miami. There is many one-way road. It was complicated to get there.3.drain was bad. bath tub water did not drain, toilet water did not flash well.I booked this hotel through priceline. It was $105 but total cost came up to $170 (including tax and service fee and parking). I could have found other hotel in this price.

<Content>Its All True (unfortunately) Sorry to report that the negative reviews that preceded this one are true. Other than the rooms being spacious and comfortable, there is nothing positive to report about this hotel. The negatives (again): unfriendly reception desk, requested room not available, a fee to use the fitness center, repeatedly having to ask for the room to be made up and amenities to be replenished, overpriced room service (high cost to start plus the ubiquitous, mandatory delivery charge of $3.50 plus 20% tip) and, last but not least, $10.95 plus tax for internet access.

<Content>They nickel and dime you to death I stayed at this hotel for a conference a couple of weeks ago. About the only good thing I can say about the hotel is the location, which is excellent.However the staff was very rude. I signed up for the wi-fi and was charged $10.95 a day which I felt was expensive. Many hotels I have stayed at for business don't charge anything at all. I signed up for 2 days, but they billed me for 3. I had to fight to get the extra false charge removed. They have a daily $15 charge to use the health club which I think is absurb. For the cost of the room you shouldn't have to pay a fee especially if you are a Priority Club member which I am.I went into the Business Center to try to print my boarding pass. Even though I had signed up for the wi-fi in my room, they wanted an extra $10.95 for every 15 minutes in the Business Center. The staff member was very rude.On my room bill was also a $3 per night charge for maid service. I couldn't believe they just lump that charge into the room rate.I didn't even get new bars of soap each day.All and all I wouldn't stay there again. Yes the location is beautiful, but they try to nickel and dime you to death with unreasonable charges.

<Content>ideal for the day before the cruise Upon arrival we learned that we had been upgraded to the Club Intercontinental. This includes access to a lounge where there are two computers with free internet access, hors d'oeurves in the early evening with a fine selection of pour-your-own drinks (including wine and liquors--I sampled the Johnny Walker Black and Chivas Regal the evening we were there). There is also a more than continental breakfast that included hard boiled eggs, smoked salmon, and a good variety of breads and cereals. We were allowed to check out late--a real convenience since our ship didn't board until 3 PM. All day there are bottled water, tonic water, and various other soft drinks in a refrigerator (making me wonder why anyone would take these items out of the in-room bar and have to pay extra for them). I don't know if the Club level rooms are any better than in other parts of the hotel, but ours was certainly comfortable and had a view of the bay. It was a rainy night, and we had dinner in the hotel restaurant located in the lobby, otherwise we would have walked over the Bayside shopping center where there are a number of restaurants, including a Nicaraguan steak house that looked interesting. We did have lunch at a Cuban restaurant right on the water there and then walked back to the hotel for a 5 minute cab ride to the Port of Miami, which can be seen out in the bay. The Club Intercontinental rooms appear to be about $100 more expensive than the regular rooms on the hotel's website, but considering what you get, it's not a bad deal.

<Content>Nice - but could have been better Just returned home from a 7-day cruise onboard Royal Caribbean's Newest and Largest ship, the Freedom of the Seas. We stayed one night pre-cruise at the Hotel Intercontinental - Miami on October 7, 2006. The BAD stuff:First, I will start off by saying that the hotel is beautiful and very spacious. Upon arrival, we were checked in by the front desk clerk, Stephen, who wasn't too friendly at all. My travel agent booked this hotel room for us 1 year and 3 months ago and requested a Bay View, King Room - Non Smoking. There wasn't any Bay View rooms according to him when we arrived at noon. My travel agent recevied confirmation the day prior upon arrival stating that we had those amentities and there were not granted. If we wanted a Bay View room that is was going to cost us an additional $35 for the high floors and $25 for the lower floors, although he didn't have ANY to even give us at that time. So, I just took what we could get and settled for City View which was on the 22nd floor, first off. I did check back again hours later twice for Bay View rooms and nothing was still available.The rooms were beautiful with classy, colorful decor and the bed linens are luxurious and very comfortable! The towels were big and fluffy and the bathrooms were big, marble and nice! Although I had a few problems that needed to be mentioned and addressed to the management staff. There was one wall close to the bed that had a plate size mold-mildew stain on it and my husband is allergic to it and I also killed a massive bug in the shower. So, we told management, although they wouldn't even come up to look themselves, they sent a bellman up to retrieve our things and move us to the 27th floor, to which I still didn't receive a Bay View. I wasn't going to let this start my vacation off bad, so we moved to a different room at 1:00 in the morning. We receive a complimentary continential breakfast, which was $19 and consisted of ONLY fruits, juices and a muffin. THATS IT! We didn't get in the pool because we didn't have enough time. Although it was in a great location, the sun didn't shine down on it much because of all of the tall buildings around. But the view was AWESOME and some great pictures can be taken from it. The were so many boats to watch go by that I could sit there for days!The GOOD stuff:The restaraunt that was right next to the pool, I think it was called the Sea Blue cafe' was EXCELLENT. We had the best food there and great service and would go back in a heartbeat. The view is soooo nice! Bayside Market is very close and a short walk nearby with great shopping and restaraunts. I don't know how much taxi fare was because we didn't take one and only walked and we had a shuttle service from the Miami Airport to the hotel. But I would suggest to stay in a group at night because there were a lot of people out late in the evenings.All in all, it was a great trip, but I don't know if I would stay there again, since all the stuff we had to go through. But would definitely eat at the Sea Blue Cafe again!

<Content>Pre-Cruise Hotel Husband and I stayed at the Intercontinental Miami for 2 days prior to a cruise. Absolutely georgeous lobby, italian marble everywhere. We were given a large room 2 doubles, fantastic view of the cruise ships and the harbor. All within walking distance of Bayside Center where's there's plenty to do and see. They had the absolute plushiest towels I've ever experienced -- even my husband noticed. Restaurant is expensive particularly for breakfast ($20 buffet). Pool was clean and warm. Didn't try the hottubs or the spa. Skyauction bid cost us $125/nite. Would stay again in a heartbeat.

<Content>Loved the Intercontinental We stayed at the Intercontinental Miami for one evening prior to a cruise. In the past we have stayed at the Holiday Inn Port of Miami which was fine. However, I actually paid less for the Intercontinental through Easy-Click travel than I would have paid for the Holiday Inn. Trust me, there is no comparison. Every aspect of this hotel impressed us!The service at the front desk was courteous and prompt. Although we arrived at 12:30 pm, they had a room ready for us within 10 minutes, even though check-in time wasn't until 4 pm.The hotel itself is beautiful and very upscale. According to the porter, they cater more to the business traveller which may explain why we saw very few children around. However, I considered this a bonus! The lobby design is stunning - all marble and glass and decorated with some funky, modern furniture. Our room was huge and gorgeous. The bed was heavenly, with a feather duvet and mattress pad and the most dreamy pillows. The room also had a granite-topped desk with two high-back chairs, two comfy armchairs, a cabinet with tv. There was a nice minibar area (very expensive), two closets, and a great bathroom with separate vanity area, bathtub, and shower stall. The towels and face cloths were plush and thick as blankets.The location of the hotel is perfect...about a five minute walk along the waterfront to Bayside Marketplace, which has lots of restaurants and shopping. You can also take a tour of Millionaire's Row from Bayside - a fun activity that I would definitely recommend.In my opinion, this hotel is ideal for a night or two before or after a cruise. Any longer than that, I would personally head to the beach. But the Intercontinental Miami is perfect for a brief pre or post cruise stay.

<Content>Beware of Incidental Charges! I stayed at the hotel for a conference. It was a great location right on the water and near shops and businesses. There was even an outdoor festival while I was there. The only thing I did not like is the incidental charges. I opened the box that contains bar and personal essentials (wine opener, condoms, Swiss Army knife), but did not use any of the items. By simply opening the box to inspect the items, I was charged based on what I touched and lifted from the box. Fortunately, they removed the charge when I explained that I did not use any of the items. Just be aware that there's a sensor on the box and do not remove unless you intend to use!

<Content>It's Ok The rooms are very nice and clean. Great, big, comfortable beds. The service is really bad. I checked in and my boyfriend checked in later - they charged us twice for the hotel room!! If I hadnt noticed, I dont know if they would have corrected the double charge. Also, there was a party going on next door, and I called to be moved. I waited on hold for 10 minutes to speak to the front desk. I was moved though and then it was fine.

<Content>Overall Decent experience Stayed at the Intercontinenal for a long memorial day weekend getaway. First requested a room with 2 double beds and when we checked in got a room with one king sized bed. Call the front desk and they immediately corrected the problem and gave us a new room. Got an excellent rate on hotwire of $101 a night which was excellent considering it was a holiday weekend. We ordered room service one night it took forever to come over an hour but food was great. The gift shop downstairs is very overpriced so go to the Walgreens like a block and a half up the street if you want snacks, toiletries etc.Valet Parking is $25 a day which is quite expensive but comparable to the other hotels in the downtown area. Overall I would definately stay here again.....especially if I get such a good deal next time :-)

<Content>It's actually a good hotel for a conference! I provided an earlier review of this hotel in February as a business traveler. I just stayed there this month while running a conference, and I now have a different perspective. It's still expensive, yes. However, the group block rates are reasonable for conferences, and the conference planning staff is incredible. The staff members were attentive, friendly, and poised to make the conference a success. I plan a lot of meetings, and I left very impressed.I also had a better room on this visit.

<Content>Nice Hotel but... Evrything was ok. Pretty average... nothing really outstanding. The guys from the valet parking very slow, once I waited for my car 30 minutes. And if you dont give them tips they get mad... poor attitude!I wouldnt come back there just for them. And I used to love the hotel!

<Content>Nice Stay at the Intercontinental This hotel is everything I expected it would be.The room was clean, exceptionally quiet and comfortable. Beds were a bit small (I think they were doubles instead of queens) so it was a bit tight for us and our 16-year old son. The bathroom was enormous! I really liked that the toilet and shower were separate from the sink and the dressing area, making it possible for more than one person to get ready at a time.The view of the Port of Miami was incredible from our 23rd floor room. It was the highlight of the room.The gym was good but you have to pay $10 a person to use it. The pool area was shaded by a new condominum tower so it made it a bit cool.Whatever you do, don't open the minibar fridge unless you intend to purchase something! We opened the door three times and without touching anything were charged three times. The hotel reversed the charges without question but I was still surprised by that. After all, how the heck are you supposed to know if you want something from the fridge or not if you can't have a look??The location was great. Very close to the Bayside marketplace and quieter than the hubub of South Beach. One bus takes you to South Beach for $1.50. The cab ride to the Port of Miami took 5 minutes. It is about a 25 minute ride from Miami Airport.

<Content>A lovely hotel. Stayed at Intercontinental Hotel Miami for a conference for three nights in early March. Check-in took about three minutes. All staff very friendly and helpful. The bedroom and bathroom were quite spacious. The view of Biscayne Bay was spectacular. Housekeeping was unobtrusive. I was happy to have a coffee maker in the room, but the pot made two to three cups yet there was only one cream and one sugar, so only enough for one cup. The only other complaint I have is really about many hotels: Why don't they put air conditioning in the bathrooms? Especially in Miami where it's really hot and humid and even more so in the bathroom after you take a hot shower. I would definitely stay here again though. You can walk to a nice park on the water and the Bayside Marketplace with lots of shops and take a cruise around the harbor and see celebrity homes ($17 but there is a $3 off coupon in the Miami magazine in the hotel room).

<Content>Great for Business I have stayed here twice in the past 8 months (both times on business trips) and was very pleased with this hotel. The meeting spaces and services were great. I had a great room both times on the upper floors. Great views and the room decor was very modern and clean. Room service was great and the breakfast was excellent.The location isn't close to South Beach but for business it was ideal. Only a 15 min drive to the airport.

<Content>GOT HOTEL FROM HOTWIRE - UGLY JUNK Received hotel from Hotwire, I expected a four star hotel that Hotwire had indicated.. This hotel is a 2.5 star at most. Ugly old room, the front desk staff was very rude, especially night manager (a spanish woman), Parking was a rip off at $25 a night. Pool was in the shade of another building by 10:30 AM, which left it unuseable. The area had nothing to do. Go to beach if you can.

<Content>My Best Room Ever I love the Intercontinental in Miami. The room was GREAT, the view of the ocean was overwhelming. The service was great. I loved the bathroom, all marble. Very comfortable bed. Again, the view was beautiful. The price was GREAT, well below 100/night for Memorial Day weekend, that was unheard of (priceline).Overall, I would stay here again and again. I love it.

<Content>Just okay My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Intercontinental for 2 nights pre-cruise. First of all, I thought I was getting a great deal through Hotwire for $98.00 a night. What they do not tell you is you have no choice but to use their valet parking service and it is $25.00 a night. I do not agree with $50.00 for a parking spot for two nights. The going rate for the room on the two nights we stayed there was $299.00 a night. If I had paid that I would have been furious. Our room was okay - the bed was hard as a rock and the pillows were about 1 inch thick. The decor was cute and trendy but that is ALL the hotel has going for it, I would not recommend this hotel unless you get an extremely good deal - even then you need to add $25.00 a night just to park your car.

<Content>Service not worthy of the price The Intercontinental is beautiful, rooms are nice, location is great (right near port if you are going for a cruise, and bayside shopping canter is 3 minutes away).However, there were a couple of disappointments with respect to the staff. For example, when we asked the concierge for a recommendation to a decent (non-chain) restaurant, he directed us to Bayside. When we asked him again for something that wasn't a chain--he told us in his flippant, French accent that ...everything was a chain.We hadn't been supplied with enough toilet, so the next morning after breakfast, we went to the front desk to ask for another roll. The young lady behind the counter acted smart --- and childish about our request (as if we were some bums off the street looking for a free roll of toilet paper). She said she would have someone send it to our room--but that never happened.The two incidents that happened basically demonstrates unprofessionalism--which one would expect in a low-end hotel costing $40 a night--however, we're talking about a hotel that is +$300 a night!! I still recommend the hotel, but if you are expecting a Ritz-Carlton or JW Marriott--you will be disappointed!!

<Content>OK for one night... not a holiday We stayed here for one night prior to a cruise. The room is very nice, quiet cool and well appointed. The door staff were abrupt and no one opened doors for us like in the other hotels we stayed in on Miami beach and the Hilton at the airport. They failed to give us the welcome letter from the cruise company when we checked in we had to go down and ask, they also failed to tell us we had to have our luggage out at 10 30 for transfer to the ship . We only found out when we went for a walk and saw the cases in the lobby.The pool area was not very clean there was a lot of plastic cups , bottle and cigartette end blowing about and the pool was like ice.Bayside Market place was 5 minutes walk away and was fun in the evening . On the whole it was OK for less than 24 hours prior to a cruise but I would not choose to stay there if I was paying and certianly not for a holiday.

<Content>Awesome stay! Recently stayed at the Intercontinental on business 6/12-15. It was very convenient to the building where we were working (directly across the street). The minute we stepped out of the taxi, we were greeted by friendly hotel employees offering assistance with our luggage. We had club level rooms so check in was done on the 29th floor. The desk attendant was friendly, efficient and took less than 5 minutes to get us our rooms. My room was more than I expected; it was larger than any standard hotel room I've seen. There were two chairs along with a kingsize bed, a brand new TV, and an enormous bathroom with a large closet. Everything was immaculate. Turndown service included a card saying what the weather would be the next day. Hotel soaps and shampoos were really nice quality.As I was working all day, I am not sure what time the maid service came, but each time I returned to my room, it had been cleaned. Our rooms included a free breakfast and happy hour on the 29th floor, so we definitely took advantage of that benefit. Breakfast provided everything like fruit, pastries and cereals, and happy hour offered standard hors d'ourves and top shelf liquor. It was a nice bonus to have this available during our stay.We checked out around 5:45am to catch a flight out, and even at that time there were bellmen out front to get us a taxi right away.This hotel was awesome, I have no complaints about my stay. Employees were friendly and helpful. I didn't hear any kind of noise while in my room (like other reviews have stated) from either outside or inside the hotel. It is located right on the water which provides beautiful views, and there are many shops/resturants nearby that are within walking distance. If you want easy access to South Beach, I wouldn't stay there b/c its a 15 min taxi ride, but if you are there for business or to just enjoy Miami, its definitely a great place to stay.

<Content>Beware! As mentioned on earlier reviews this hotel overlooks Bayfront Park. When we stayed at the last weekend in May there was a reggae / hip-hop concert in the park. The music was so loud that you had no chance of sleeping. Hotel management were very dismissive of our concerns and advised us that it would finish at 11. It went on until the early hours. When we checked out we made a formal complaint and requested some form of recompense. Even a reduction on the valet parking would have been acceptable to recognise our disruption. Again the management were totally dismissive and said that the noise was not their fault. They also stated that they could not reduce the cost of the room as this had been booked through an internet agent and valet parking was a seperate company - even though it appeared on their bill. The duty manger was rude and had a sneering attitude although his smirk soon disappeared when I said I would put my thoughts on Trip Advisor! Otherwise nice hotel with great rooms and beds but make sure no concerts are planned during your stay!

<Content>Ok, Stay better last year I have stayed here in May for the past 3 years, due to its ideal location to Bayside. This year we decided to arrive early to do the Sunday Brunch as it looked great the year before, but I had already eaten (bummer). Upon checking in I asked if they still did the Sunday Brunch, and was told by reception that she did not know (????) so I moved on and tried again this time I asked the nicely dressed man standing by the elevators he suggested I asked the restaurant manager (???). Went to my room hell bent on Sunday Brunch I went back to the lobby made a left and low and behold Sunday Brunch. Then disappointment, the Mimosa was made with the cheapest harshest champagne (it's complimentary so maybe I shouldn鈥檛 complain) so I just drank water. The omelets were excellent the fruit/salad/cheese bar was superb, the deserts looked excellent but I was so stuffed and could only look. On the other hand the rooms were great we had an excellent view of the Bay, the bathroom/dressing area was better than most. Well see you next year.

<Content>Great Location, Great Service I stayed at the Intercontinental in May of 2005 for a business conference and had an enjoyable stay at the hotel. From the moment I checked in, to the time I left, I experienced no problems. Well.. only one thing and it was my fault, at checkout I noticed more things on my bill from the minibar. The reason is that they are using RFID technology on the items. If you take something out of the minibar to look at it and walk x amount of feet away from it, it charges it to your room. I used the bottle opener and it rang it up. However, at checkout time there were no issues at all getting the un-used items deleted from my bill. If you are looking to be closer to South Beach, this is not the hotel for you. There is also a nightly cruise around coconut grove that departs right outside the hotel grounds for 10-12$. The only thing that could have been better was the elevator service. When attending a conference with a large group and a session ends and you want to run up to your room, it would take 5-15minutes for me to get on the elevator and make it up to the 29th floor. Overall, if you are paying 140/night or less, it is a good deal.

<Content>No problems at the Intercontinental I stayed here for 5 nights to attend a conference and was a little worried after reading other reviews on this page. I did not come across any of the problems previously mentioned. My room was large, beautifully decorated and clean. All the employees at the hotel from the parking valets, food servers and housekeepers to the front desk managers were very friendly and polite and professional. The food at the conference I attended was hands down the best hotel food I have ever eaten. Also, I had the buffet lunch in the restaurant one day and was very satisfied with the quality. Yes, its ashame that the pool area on the 5th floor is surrounded by High rise buildings but for the time I was there, there was sunshine until about 4:30pm and it's a nicely landscaped area with a dramatic view looking over Biscayne Bay. There is nothing negative I can say about this hotel. Maybe other reviewers were expecting a Miami Beach hotel? This hotel is in the city of Miami, no ocean here.

<Content>Wonderful hotel and location We stayed at this hotel in February 2005 and loved it. We were here before getting on a cruise. We stayed in a conceirge room on the 23rd floor and loved it. There was a very comfortable king bed and HUGE bathroom! We had private check in, great ocean view, cocktail hour and great breakfast that was all included in the rate. We were also able to see our ship across the bay. You are only a 5 minute drive from the port of Miami. Also nearby are great restaurants and shopping at Bayside plaza. Enjoy!

<Content>The business of this hotel is business I was at this hotel for a meeting, and it was excellent for this purpose: well-appointed room complete with Microsun lamp (excellent for desk work); a range of business services including broadband internet. Excellent view if you're lucky (as I was) to get a room facing the harbor rather than the adjacent highrise building under construction. Nothing tourist-endearing in this hotel, from the harsh, intimidating lighting of the lobby to the banquet-standard food, to the absence of any tourist amenities other than a pool, to the surcharges for everything. A good place to come for business on an expense account, which it seems to be designed for.

<Content>Nice hotel, but far from perfect The InterContinental Miami is a nice, big hotel in downtown Miami. The nice Bayside mall is very close. But for tourists, this is may not be the best location. I was impressed with the modern, upscale room and lobby. My rating might be higher, but as I read other reviews I was reminded of some issues. Everything seems to be an additional charge. Valet parking is expensive with few options. Internet was $10.95/day (a dollar more than usual), and an ocean view was an extra $25. On top of that, upon checkout I was told Priceline had not paid the hotel and my card was going to be charged until it was resolved. Take it up with Priceline was a response that infuriated me, since their problem suddenly became my problem.Overall, a nice hotel, but management seems to work more against the guests than to try and help them.

<Content>Not be going back We paid $240 for a deluxe harbour view and ended up with an upgrade on my Plat Ambassador card to a Parlour Suite that had a partial view of the harbour and a full view of the high rise being constructed opposite. The TV in the lounge of the suite was only able to show one channel, the crib that was delivered for my daughter was falling to pieces, there was no hot water in the bathroom next morning and the I received a call from reception asking why we hadn't checked out at 12 despite arranging a 4pm late departure when checking in.Asked to speak to the GM but was fobbed off with a supervisor from the front desk. Complained to Priority Club central website but received nothing more than a very sorry. My $400 will be spent elsewhere next time.John

<Content>not going back We stayed at the intercontinental last year...pre-cruise. it was our first time in miami. We LOVED the hotel then....this year we cruised out of ft. lauderdale so pre-cruise we stayed at the Marriott harbor beach (which we really loved) and went to the intercontinental post-cruise. what was the difference from one year to the next? Due to new construction of an extremely high rise building, there is literally no sun by the pool. If you are traveling with kids or would like a place to sit by the pool to soak up some sun....at the intercontinental you'd be out of luck. the restaurant which used to have amazing food, only had an unadvertised dinner buffet with a very poor selection of food. Obviously, the nice part of this hotel is it's proximity to the piers and a new development called bayside which is quite nice.

<Content>Careful, be very cautious I booked a New Years Eve package at the hotel. First off, it was almost impossible to do as they kept wanting me to fax them forms and then fax me back stuff to sign. I gave them a CC# over the phone but this wasn't good enough for them.The hotel was nice and the lighting and mirrors in the bathroom were great. But the shower pressure was very low and the tub was small.The New Years event was a fiasco. The advertised premium bar was very limited, and they were using leftover swizzle sticks from a wedding a few months ago (with the couples name and date on them)The buffet was not set up for the number of people there and getting a cup of coffee was a mission.Another gripe:The whole thing was in Spanish. All the band played was Latin music, the Spanish TV station was on, the band made announcements ONLY in Spanish, etc. I speak Spanish but wasn't expecting this. Fireworks at midnight? Nobody knew where to go and the staff kept herding us around to closed terraces, gated off areas, etc. Finally I just walked out of the hotel and stood on the street with the paradegoers and the homeless.They had advertised free parking but there was a $17 charge which I tried to argue, to no avail.

<Content>less than impressed We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights on Saturday and Sunday 18/19 September. While the rooms are spacious and clean there was a distinct lack of atmosphere in the hotel. This is not the type of hotel you would go to if you are on vacation - it is geared 100% towards the business client. The number of hidden charges were considerable. This is an expensive hotel but we were further charged for using the gym and sauna. We used a PC in the lobby to check email and were promptly charged $7.50 for a few minutes - even though there was no notice relating to charges posted anywhere. When we tried to hire a car through the concierge we asked for prices from two companies. We were told that we would be contacted with the prices. When the concierge phoned us he said that the first company we had asked for did not have the type of car available and that the second company were delivering the car in 10 minutes (even though we only asked for prices). We stated that we did not want the car from the second company as the prices quoted were almost double those we found online from the first company. When we contacted the first company directly they said they had availability and they reserved the car for us. Not the type of service you expect from a concierge!

<Content>Inconsistent Used to stay here frequently because of it's great location and very spacious, comfortable rooms. But hotel must be under new management as its service standards have decreased substantially.Example: Recently booked a club level room but was assigned a standard room. When I complained at check out the manager actually told me all the rooms are the same so what's the big deal?! Had to fight to get my bill adjusted! Also limited and poor F  B. That combined with heavy construction taking place next door has caused me to transfer my business over to the one of the nearby Hiltons.
