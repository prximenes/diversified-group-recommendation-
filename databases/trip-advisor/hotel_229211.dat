<Content>in two minds about gresham memphis!!!!!!! Myself and my partner have just returned from a 3 night stay at the gresham memphis. We went on boxing day as a xmas present to each other, which was lush to get away after the stress of xmas. However when we got to Gresham after a 20 euro taxi ride from central station we felt it left a lot to be desired! We had booked the xmas special package which included entry into diamond factory, casino, a welcome drink and a bottle of champagnoise in the room - this was provided. However the manager who was on reception was quite blunt and rude with us because we wanted to pay cash for our stay up front. we had paid a small deposit by credit card wwhen booking on line and owed approx 200 euro, he then wanted another deposit and city tax totalling 290 euro!! I was not pleased - as a young couple on a budget money can be tight and we wernt willing to pay this deposit as we had not known in advance of it! The room was nice, clean and fresh.However the chambermaids came in once during our stay and only replaced items from the mini bar!! didnt replace tea, coffee, toilet roll etc! only things that we had to pay extortianate prices for where replaced!The hotel itself is in a bad location too far away from everything i was very dissapointed with this! 2 phonecalls home cost us 20 euro from the room! ridiculouswe were also booked in for a smoking room but we when we arrived found all the rooms to be non smoking! Personally i think this this hotel is not the best the location is poor, staff unfriendly and demanding, service poor, and most definatley everything in it is way over priced. would never return to this establishment again.

<Content>Nicely presented, more for an older clientele My boyfriend and I booked this hotel after reading reviews on Trip Advisor and have to say was a little disappointed, mainly due to the staff. We found the staff pretty unfriendly and felt we was judged because of our youth/appearance (29-31 old enough!). That being said the hotel was nicely presented and clean. The location is ok, a bit out of the centre but easy to travel from/to (tram 16). I would say this hotel is suitable for an older clientele but not for anyone under the age of 30.

<Content>Loved it! Stayed for 2 nights in Sept 08 while exploring what Amsterdam has to offer by day and night, hotel was really nice, clean and the staff exceptionally friendly....room was clean spacious with a kingsize bed and modern clean bathroom. Location is excellent for the museums and Vondel Park, there is a Tram (number 16) every 5 minutes from outside the hotel if u want to venture into the Dam square, Station area!! Warning though after sampling some of the local delicacies in the Dam area we lost track of time and missed the last Tram and a good 30 mins walk/stumble followed not what u need after trudging round museums all day!!

<Content>No complaints Booked on Hotwire and got a great rate of 105.00 CAD for 1 night. The hotel is not ideally situated if you want the party life in Amsterdam, but it is very close to both the Van Gough museum, Rijkavik, and Vondel Park. Plus, when you're in Europe and you're young you basically walk every where anyway, or just hop on the tram and you'll be anywhere you wanna be within minutes. Check in was sub par. Staff weren't very friendly but whatever. Room was nice, nothing to write home about. But it was clean and had a comfortable bed. So we were satisfied. All in all a very decent hotel, and for the price we paid we were pleased.

<Content>Gresham is grrrreat! My husband and I stayed here for two nights while checking out Amsterdam (before returning home). This hotel is in a fabulous neighborhood!! I booked directly online and got a rate of 77 Euro per night (non smoking room). I won't lie - the basic double room was SMALL. It's a double bed and it takes up pretty much the entire room. But we found it cozy. The bathroom was roomy/modern/and very clean. Besides small, I found everything about the room and hotel to be great. It was so nice to come back here after a day of sight seeing and riding bikes. Another perk is Vondel park is just 5 min. away not to mention quaint shops, markets and restaurants - again, just up the street. (We had a lovely dinner at a place around the corner, Brasserie Senz). All in all - if it's in your budget, stay here! you won't regret it. Especially if you're like us - people who have an appreciation for everything Amsterdam has to offer and all the eclectic people who live and visit there - but would prefer not to be staying in the middle of it 24/7.

<Content>A good place to stay Although the hotel is away from the centre we found this to be a plus. It meant we could have relative peace and quiet on returning from a busy day sightseeing and also meant we could escape the horrors of the many stag dos we encountered that weekend! The trams are excellent (No 16 goes regularly from outside the hotel into the city centre). In fact, the public transport system in general was superb. Don't waste money on a taxi from the airport - get the train instead. It was very cheap and incredibly efficient.Our hotel room was a reasonable size, had plenty of storage space and a good TV (with access to BBC). The bed was very comfortable and queen sized(?). The bathroom was fine - the shower was over the bath and pretty powerful. The tiles could do with regrouting but otherwise it was perfectly adequate. Breakfast was included in our deal and was a buffet with a good choice of hot and cold food.The staff were most helpful and friendly.The only negative aspect for us was that, like most places in Amsterdam, smoking is still allowed in public areas and in some of the rooms. Hence, the smell of smoke or worse, sickly air freshner, pervaded the corridors.In general, it was prefect for our needs. We liked the location; there were some lovely shops and cafes nearby en route to Vondelpark.

<Content>GOOD HOTEL GREAT LOCATION I My friends and i have just returned from a long weekend in amsterdam the Hotel wasnt in the centre of everything but it was very easy to pop on a tram and to get to all places you wanted to go. (The number 16 tram takes you all the way to Dam square 1.60 euros and the tram stop is just outside the hotel) The staff at the hotel are all very helpful and know all the information on how to get around. The room was nice and clean, no tea/coffee facilities and breakfast around 20 euros so we had breakfast out most of the time. I had taken a great big towel with me and the maids must of taken it along with all the linen to laundry and when i asked at reception they had a look and couldnt find it and didnt seem to care. ( i wont take a towel next time) apart from that it was a very nice hotel and would stay again

<Content>Great!!! We stayed here for 5 weeks in June/July 07. My husband was on a business trip working at the WTC and it was an easy and enjoyable walk to his work every morning. Right on the tram line but windows sound proof so did not hear the tram.Close to Vondel Park and restaurants... Italian place down the road was to die for...The staff were lovely and the bar man in particular was very nice. One morning my huband had a massive nosebleed and nearly had to go to hospital. The hotel staff were extremely attentive, providing napkins and unlimited ice to aid his recovery.Our stay here was very enjoyable. Housekeeping were sensitive to the longevity of our stay and were not intrusive and very friendly.Breakfast every morning was wonderful... providing tasty, healthy options for long-term guests such as ourselves.Room service very good and we loved the bar's Baikley's cocktails and curly fries!!!We would stay here again without a moments hesitation.

<Content>I liked it I liked this hotel - yes it doesn't live up to it's star rating but then again a lot of hotels in Europe have the same problem. I loved the location - in a very nice part of Amsterdam away from the hustle and bustle and yet only a short tram ride away. The breakfast was good and buffet style, the waiter on duty was very friendly.This hotel is perfect if you want a bit of peace and quiet.

<Content>3 star lobby on a 2 star hotel We stayed here at the start and end of a Europe vacation. On the positive, it's in a great location for walking to museums/restaurants. And the lobby, bar and breakfast were what you would expect from a good hotel. But the rooms and service are what you wouldexpect from a budget hotel-- minimal lighting, worn bedspread/sheets, loose shower head. On our return the A/C wasn't working in any of the rooms and no one was on staff to fix it. (We saw three rooms andstayed two weekends in a row). I don't mind staying in a budget hotel to save some bucks, but for us the Memphis was not priced as a budget hotel. If you can get a internet deal that allows you to pay 2 star prices to stay here, this is your hotel.

<Content>Not so sure Typical European business hotel whose clientele I guess are normally on company accounts or cards so expect to be charged for everything including internet access.Staff except manager were great and accomodating but we had a very unpleasant experience with the manager who accused us of lying because a member of his staff had not passed on some important price info agreed with her just after we checked in. Booked 3 non smoking rooms but they bumped us to 1 non smoking and 2 smoking. I am a non smoker and my room smelt so much I had to get them to sanitise it before I could stay in it. There was no notice nor apology for the change or the state of the room. The rooms were otherwise very clean.If you are there on a break hope you do not have any noisy people on your corridor because the walls are thin and the doors bang.The breakfasts are expensive but good. See if you can get a discounted BB deal - they are worth it.Its location is good if you want somewhere quiet but very easily accessible to the city and especially the museums.

<Content>Great Hotel, wonderful location! The hotels is very good and the breakfast was excellent! The rooms were a bit old fashioned but everything was of good quality and very clean. In the first day we got a smoking room because the hotel was booked out and there were no more non-smoking rooms available but on the day after they organized to move us to another room. The rooms have also air-conditioner, which is very good during hot summer days! In the streets nearby you find parking space but during weekdays they cost around 12 鈥?18 euros per day (depending where you park).The best of the hotel was the location. In a five-minute walk you reach the museum square. In the city center you can either move around with a bike or by foot and if are tired to walk back to the hotel at night, you can get a tram and drop off near the hotel.Amsterdam is wonderful and given the fact that it is pretty hard to find decent and good hotels there, the Gresham Memphis is definitely a good choice!

<Content>not a 4* a large group of us stayed in this hotel, so gained a good overview of the rooms. They were all clean, and service was generally good. However, though all rooms were booked as non-smoking, several were given smoking rooms. One person had to be moved as the room smelt overpoweringly of sewage. The hotel was full, so the guest had to put up with it the 1st night, (No alternative was offered), but was moved first thing the next day. Two of the rooms were so small that one could sit on the bed and touch both walls with outstretched arms.The good rooms in this hotel are those talked about in the shining reviews, and if you do get one, I'm sure it's a great place to stay. If not, it's pretty miserable.

<Content>Cost-effective and enjoyable choice in a peaceful residential area My wife and I enjoyed a six-night stay in May at the Gresham-Memphis Hotel. Even though all of our pre-arrival dealings with the hotel were positive, several negative Tripadvisor reviews had caused us some concern. They needn鈥檛 have. Though weary from our transatlantic flight when we arrived early morning at the front desk, we were pleased to be welcomed by Linda Denekamp, the reservations manager with whom we had corresponded. She was in person as she had been in her email messages 鈥?capable, efficient, upbeat and very helpful. In fact, when weighing the various factors that go into the selection of a hotel (cost-effective comfort, appearance, location, amenities, reputation, et al.), Linda鈥檚 professional graciousness and helpfulness tipped the scale in the Gresham鈥檚 favor for us. During our stay, each staff member we encountered was also accommodating and helpful. Our room was not yet ready and Linda suggested that we sit in the pleasant bar just off the lobby, where we enjoyed tea and coffee. She brought over to us some of the paperwork and tourist information we had requested, and in a short while we were handed our key. Our quiet, air-conditioned room with a queen bed was on a high floor and had a nice view of Amsterdam rooftops. The bathroom had been renovated and - yes indeed, as others have reported, the shower water pressure was superb. The room was well-maintained during our stay as were the public areas.The breakfast room had a very fine buffet of hot and cold items ,juices, various breads and pastries, etc. It provided a nice start to each day of busy touring. The staff was pleasant and friendly.Although the tram #16 stop is just up the street from the hotel entrance, we quickly discovered that tram #2 was a better choice for us on most days. Its stop was a short walk away, in the direction of Vondel Park (the 鈥淐entral Park鈥?of Amsterdam), through a residential area that had nice shops and several small restaurants.We were very glad we had chosen the Gresham-Memphis and most definitely will return. We are happy to recommend this property.

<Content>Not 4* Standard! We stayed 4 nights at this hotel. It was booked as a birthday surprise for my boyfriend. I came across a hot deal on the internet and after trawling through so many hotels in amsterdam I thought that I would pay a little bit extra for this hot deal, (hoping it might be a room upgrade or something but as it happens it was just a cheaper internet rate which once booked could not be cancelled at any stage). Anyhow the bottom line was that I was willing to pay a little more than initially anticipated to guarantee a nice standard of room in this 4* hotel. When I saw our room I was disgusted - definitely not what was advertised via internet - it was small, old fashioned  dull although the rooms were clean and cleaned on a daily basis. There was the usual overpriced mini-bar which we emptied and re-stocked with our own shop bought necessities for the duration of our stay. The staff were absolutely lovely - the barman was great craic!..although the bar itself lacked atmosphere. Breakfast was not included in our deal and with those prices we certainly had no interest. However, we did eat from the bar menu 3 times in the hotel - 1 - Spag Bol..ordered after the 11pm cut-off so we were very grateful for them to accomodate us and didn't really expect anything to be prepared from scratch. 2 - Coq au vin..we are both convinced every item on the plate was microwaved - it killed me to pay 鈧?7.50 each - awful!! 3 - room service again of burgers  curly frys - again burger appeared microwaved. We were 99% convinced that there was actually no chef on duty with regard to food available on the bar menu. Thankfully, we did locate a gorgeous italian restaurant about 5 mins walk around the corner - and the bonus was that it was great value for money. I would personally be very slow to stay in the Memphis Gresham again. Overall the standard of room and quality of food by no means represented that of a 4* hotel. Way overpriced - and at that I'm even talking the cheaper hot deal that we availed of. Anyhow I hope this is of benefit to people.

<Content>Not as good as i thought!!! Me and my partner stayed at this Hotel 28th June 07. We came over from Hull on the Ferries and when we got to the centre of Amsterdam we got a Taxi to the hotel as we didnt know when it was!!! The taxt cost us 15 euros as the hotel is far away from the centre. When we got to the hotel the women on the front was very polite and helpful, we got our keys and went to the room and it stunk!!! it smelt like rotten eggs!! obviously we went to see the reception and she said it's always like that and blamed the air con and the streets!!! which one??? anyway it took some convincing for her to change out room but when we did it was a much smaller room then before! If you are going to this hotel make sure you dont get a taxi and get the tram a number 16 as it drops u right outside! you'll save a foutune! it's about 25min on tram and 15 in taxi We also has breakfast in bed and that was gorgeous and charged us an extra 5 euros for bringing it to our room nice hotel but wouldnt go back as miles away from centre

<Content>Good little hotel We stayed at this hotel during the weekend of 10/11 March 2007 and found it to be very good for the price. The hotel is well located - it is an easy walk into the city and the tram stops right outside. The neighbourhood is nice and quiet. While the hotel is a bit dated (decor is a little old and there are parts that are starting to look a little shabby), you cannot really ask for more given the price. The only problems we encountered was that our shower had poor pressure - but this is not enough to ruin your stay. We found the staff to be very helpful and efficient. The breakfast was pretty good too. On the whole, for the price, I would definitely stay again and recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Great little hotel! My partner and I have just got back from a weekend break in Amsterdam and absolutely loved the Gresham Memphis both in terms of location of hotel and also for comfort. We felt slightly put off by a few of the reviews before we booked but could honestly say that our experience of both the staff and rooms were nothing but excellent. Nothing was a problem, yes you do have to ask for the tea making facilities and also travel adaptors (which was not a problem) and both were easily forthcoming. The room we had was of a good standard, very clean and peaceful at night - what more could you ask for for such an affordable price. To get into town you can either take the no. 16 tram (just outside the hotel) or take a lovely walk (not too far), if you take a left outside the hotel and carry on walking until you get to the right side of Vondel Park there is the exclusive shopping area of Amsterdam (close to the museums). Absolutely fabulous!! and its also close to the museum and casino (great fun). We've stayed in varying hotels in 'dam - the Radisson, Pulitzer and Jolly Carlton and will certainly be staying in The Gresham Memphis Hotel again. Enjoy your stay!

<Content>Mixed thoughts, nice room, extremely rude staff We booked this hotel through easytobook.com who were rubbish. We booked to stay from last wednesday through to this tues, the rate for each day varied from 80Euros to 150Euros, however on the last night (monday) they were going to charge us 210Euros for Monday night, so we left sunday and found a hotel on the dam for 80Euros - there was no way i was going to pay that.When we arrived it was very late and the check in was all smooth. we took the lift to our room and found it said no smoking in there but had an ashtray - we smoked in there anyway.There is also a mini bar - we just took the water out and stored our own drinks in there.There are tea  coffee making facilities available for free - you just have to ask for it everyday - all the sachets come in a little box. And just keep the kettle in the room.The same goes for an iron - just ask.The towells are really worn so take your own, i have to say this hotel has the best shower i have ever used! mega power shower.The food in the hotel is overpriced and disgusting- my partner had a childs portion of spag bol for 12.50 and i had a burger and curly fries- i didnt eat it and complained and the waiter (a young indian guy with glasses) said i shouldnt complain and nobody ever had before, he said it must be me  that id still have to pay for it. My partner went mental, the waiter was so rude we were gobsmacked! The receptionist (with long blonde hair) overheard us complaining and instead of helping lit up a cigarette with her back to us.When we were checking out they said we'd drank stuff out of the minibar, but we asked them to check it and they apologised for the mistake.One day we wanted a lie in so put the do not disturb sign on the door and the maid still knocked the door, we said we'd be 20 mins and they knocked again another 2 times.Our room was fine - the equivilent to a novotel, travel lodge or an ibis in england. It was just the manner of the staff which i found was a real let down, you just get the vibe that they dont want to help you.They could do with a few lessons in customer service!The location was fine though, there are so many trams in amsterdam! To get to/from there to the central station/dam it's number 16 or 2 tram AND 1.60 Per person. But it only took us 30 mins to walk.

<Content>Mixed Bag If you had asked me my opinion of this hotel during my first 36 hours there it would have been overwhelmingly negative. I arrived about 6:30 pm and was given a beautiful room, though it was non-smoking and I had requested smoking. The reception was polite if not apologetic. The next morning I attempted to resolve it and this member of staff treated me with restrained contempt. During the course of my stay her attitude improved, but as we all know first impressions are important. Anyway, five hours later they got me moved. The second room was nice and roomy enough, though not as nice as the first room. If you are a non-smoker, definitely request room 504, very nice, just like the pictures on the website. As I had to cancel the last night of my stay, was told I would have to do it through Easytobook.com where I made my res. This appears to be their official booking agent. Although I resolved the issue, it took me far more time than it should have, 3 days from my first attempt. Cancellation policy is 24 hours, but read the fine print and plan on 48+ hours to be safe if you need to cancel. Book directly with the hotel if you can get a good rate. My stay varied from 84 euro per night to 136 euro per night. I would not pay more than 100 euro per night on a repeat visit. Breakfast is VERY expensive for this class of hotel, 20 euro, as well as the DSL and wireless internet; 24 euro per day if I recall. Beds moderately comfortable, and pillows are great. Towels are sub-standard and well worn. Bring hair conditioner and face cloth if you use them. Both hair dryers were inadequate, again, bring your own. TV selection very good. Housekeeping very good though the first room I was not impressed with the hair in the bathroom; it happens. Coffee from the bar is fantastic , 2 euro each; there are no coffee making facilities in room. No ironing facilities in room. If you like being outside the hustle and bustle of the city center, but just 10 minutes away by tram, this location is great. Near museums for tourists and not far from Rai center for business travelers. Tram is 3 minute walk. On my next visit to Amsterdam I will look for a hotel in this area, maybe even stay at this one again if I cant find another. Most hotel staff need hospitality courses would be my main observation. I spend at least 75-100 nights per year in hotels, so I have a good idea of what good service is.

<Content>Good Base Stayed at the Gresham Memphis for 4 nights over new year and thoroughly enjoyed it. The hotel is a wee bit out of the centre which I thought was a positive advantage. We were close to the museums which meant we arrived before the crowds and were close enough to some nice restaurants and all that is available at Leidesplein. The hotel has a pleasant bar where we relaxed after a hard day pounding the streets. Also, would recommend Amsterdam at new year - great atmosphere.

<Content>so sad!!! and could be so good. Well, I was certainly mislead by the reviews on TripAdvisor this time........ please do NOT stay here unless you get an amazingly cheap rate (say under 50 Euros for a single).Ok, the staff was wonderful, but the hotel is a disaster in many ways that are almost impossible to fix. My room (which cost 120 Euros without breakfast) was smaller than the closet I had in an nearby hotel last month for less. I could quite literally understand the conversations in the rooms on either side of me. Because of that, I was unable to conduct some business I wanted in the room on the phone since they clearly could understand me too. Also the price of a single phone call was over 1 Euro. I was also a bit surprized by the clients; as I checked in, there were two British 20 somethings trying to check out, but they didn't have enough money to pay the bill! The clerk was the picture of politeness but was firm and showed them on their reservation sheets where the taxes and other fees have NOT been included in the price. Indeed when I checked out I was a bit surprised to find the price was about 20$ a night more than I had expected and I read all the fine print in those things (the difference was blamed on the exchange rate.... right....)So my advice... go in a chat with the nice staff, but don't stay there. Sorry

<Content>Excellent Really exceeding our expectations. Warm and friendly staff who are pleased to help. The hustle and bustle of the nightlife is only a short tram/taxi ride away. So its in an ideal location if you don't want to be in the centre of it all. Would highly recommend and will be going back for sure.

<Content>OK but a bit far from the center The hotel is medium high and was ok for the price we paid (90 euros, breakfast included). Main problem was that we left the car in a parking for the stay (crazy prices to park in the street) and had to take public transport. Only one bus and the stop was 5 minutes from the hotel. In other respects it was ok.

<Content>Great hotel First time that I have booked a hotel via the internet, so I was hoping that the hotel was as nice as it looked and read on the site. Wasn't disapointed at all, lovely hotel for the how much I paid for 3 nights - although cost displayed at the hotel per night seems a bit costly. Nice room, good air conditioning system installed and attentive and helpful staff.Hotel is located 5 mins walk from the Museumplein and very easy to get a tram into the centre. Buy a 48 hour tram ticket - costs 10 Euros well worth the money as 1 way on the tram costs 1.60E, therefore you can just hop and off the trams all day long and explore this wonderful city.Had a great time, would definitely go again and would also stay at the Memphis again.

<Content>Enjoyable stay Had a very good internet deal, booked in at 2300hr, no problem with this. The room was large, clean and comfortable, the staff were all very polite and helpful, bag storage on the last day available as we had an evening flight home. A little way from the centre but easily accessed by 1 tram ride or a walk through the park. Would stay again if the price was right.

<Content>Nice hotel The tourist information board booked a room for us in this hotel as we were very unhappy with the hotel we were supposed to be staying in. The area is really nice. Lovely cake shop around the corner. The hotel was happy to hold our bags as our room wasn't ready. (we were too early) There was a fully stocked mini bar, separate toilet to en suite bathroom. The hotel was clean and bright. Getting to and from the hotel really easy using tram 2. Would try to get a deal on the price as it is a little pricy.

<Content>Unfortunate pricing problems.... but otherwise ok The Hotel is in a nice quiet location, close to some of the more exclusive streets in amsterdam. It is not so near the main centre and so I would advise against staying here unless you are vaguely familiar with Amsterdam and the transport system. It's around 20 minutes on a tram from the train station. It is certainly NOT wallking distance.I found the rooms to be well appointed and comfortable and the hotel itself to be perfectly acceptable.Unfortunately I booked via a website which appeared to be the hotels official website but in fact wasn't.As a result we were told that certain things were included which weren't. This wasn't helped by the fact that the staff then subsequently told us misleading information about what was and was not included. Ultimately we ended up having no clue about what the final bill would or should be. We had also been told by reception that our breakfast wasn't included when in fact it was, which was frustrating as we'd been out every morning as a result.Basicly, this hotel does not appear to have ironed out numerous problems with online sales and based upon my experience I would be wary about booking this hotel online again.

<Content>An Honest stay!! From knowing the quality of The Gresham in Dublin I was curious when I discovered there was one in Amsterdam. Got a great deal on expedia, unusual as teachers, my wife and I usually pay big prices in holiday time. I'll keep this short. Good stop but certainly no Gresham in Dublin. But this should'nt put you off. Its a great location don't understand other reviews about too far out, or doesn't suit those who want to parade the coffee shops. Its a great location...yes about 7-10 mins out from the Dam....but whats wrong with that? Quiet, upmarket area. Always use tram 2 which is a 5mins walk outside the hotel. This tram takes you past the main spots so you can get out at what ever time you want. Tram costs 1E 60 however at night and sometimes during the day we did'nt pay.(Naughty!!) Oh! Last tram leaves the Dam at 11.15pm otherwise a taxi is available at 拢7. The Hotel is grand as we say in the north of Ireland which means not too bad. The room which is not the superior room is small, comfortable but has a small bathroom and tiny seperate toilet. But as my wife says,as long as the sheets are clean and cleaned each day. In conclusion...walking distance to Van Gough and other gallery's, clean room, friendly staff.....good choice if you get a good deal. Hope this helps.

<Content>Misery - You can't judge a book by its cover. The lobby is beautiful. The staff is friendly. The rooms appear old. The room decor and comfort does not match the recently renovated feel of the lobby.We spent the first night without A/C. The A/C was broken on our floor. We were also relocated to a single-bed room (for 2 people) because the initial flush of the toilet caused water to cover the bathroom floor. We were told that a rollaway bed was not an option. We later were asked to move rooms 2 more times for a total of 4 rooms across 3 nights. One of the rooms we were moved into had not been cleaned. Room 1: No A/C and Flooded Room 2: Single Bed Room 3: Not Yet Cleaned from the Last Guest Room 4: Finally to a Double-bed Room.They offered us a room at the Hilton for an additional $200 euro per night. The hotel is, in our opinion, nothing close to a 4-star. It has a nice website and a nice lobby and a kind staff, but you just can't judge a book by its cover. (There were no signs of continued renovation into the lodging floors.)

<Content>friendly staff, lovely area, shame about the plumbing The hotel is comfortable and quite stylish, with friendly and efficient staff. It's a little out of the city centre, close to the Vondelpark, the main museums and the Concertgebouw. Great for visitors who want art, culture and music; not for those interested in coffee-shop culture and the 'red-light'. Easy to reach from the central station by public transport (tram 16 is direct, tram 2 to a parallel street about 500m away, many other trams and buses as far as the nearby Museumplein). Central station to hotel is about 20 minutes by tram. Rooms are large and well kept; facilities are ok, although they could do with extractor fans for the bathrooms. The area is quiet at night, but we did get quite a bit of traffic noise in our room at the front of the hotel. It's rather a select neighbourhood. Walk towards the Vondelpark along Cornelis Schuytstraat for a small selection of up-market shops, including organic food and a nice patisserie (and two nice cafes, Van Dam and de Joffers, that serve 5 Euro breakfasts if you don't want the 13-euro hotel option - although non-smokers beware!). The most fashionable shopping street in the city, P C Hoofstraat, is a five-minute walk. Our only real problem was a noisy radiator in the room, which kept us awake most of one night. Staff were sympathetic and maintenance came to fix it next day. Overall, we had a great stay.
