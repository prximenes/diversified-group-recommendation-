<Content>Worth the stay Was on a business/working trip to Singapore again and for once, had a change of hotel. Economy is doing bad and i guess putting up in a cheaper range hotel should be the choice now. Chose Robertson Quay Hotel. Initially had a bad thought of the hotel because of the low price on offer but well, i need just a bed and bathing facilities only so nothing to worry. Upon checking in, reception staffs are friendly and efficient, a part worth mentioning for their effort. Before going into my room assigned, i am already mentally prepared for the worst having seen some poor reviews. But wait, room is pretty tidy and definitely not so bad after all. Safe, fridge, clean and tidy bed made up eveyday, bathing facitilies.... the basic requirements are all there. I had a room with river view and the night view is excellent! Location is pretty good as well. Public transport, restaurants, departmental stores, coffee shops.... All are within the vicinity.Off for work every morning at 8am and breakfast starts at 7.30am, just nice for me to have a quick bite before heading to work. Breakfast pretty basic though.I will say a stay in Robertson Quay Hotel is worthed it. I will strongly recommend and introduce this hotel to businessmen and those attached/assigned to Singapore for short term job! Remember, economy is not doing well at the moment... You got to save here and there. No more extravagent hotel stay!Next working attachment will be to Indonesia. Awaits my next review!!!

<Content>Disappointing After spending 2 weeks staying in budget to midrange hotels in Vietnam, this was the worst hotel of the trip. The rooms were dirty - major mold and broken tiles in the bathroom - we were told we were lucky to have a shower curtain - but it was so disgusting we couldnt shower with it. The mattress covers were disgusting, industrial carpet soiled and burnt.We had early departure, so didnt have the opportunity to try the free breakfast.At least the sheets and towels appeared clean.Yes its in a great location - yes its cheap for the area - so expected small rooms - but some attempt at maintenance is expected.

<Content>Great location, pretty basic. It's in a great location, right on Clarke Quay, which is a pretty up-market area. It was pretty pricey for what you got (which isn't much). It was generally clean. Bit of a musky smell to the hotel. All of Singapore is pricey compared to the rest of Asia so your not really going to get any bargains. It was all you need for a place to sleep  shower.

<Content>A Reasonable Basic Hotel This is a hotel with the basic amenities that one needs for the night. Don't expect fancy looking building structures and services. It is conveniently located next to Boat Quay, Clarke Quay and a train station. Dining and night spot options are aplenty. We were on the road 14 hours of day while in Singapore. So a basic hotel like Robertson Quay was sufficient for us.

<Content>Ok if you just need a place to crash Had to stay over night in singapore for transit and didn't want to spend too much on accomandation as we will only be in the hotel for less than 6hrs.Robertson quay hotel's rate fitted in our budget (Singapore's hotel r expensive!)The room was very small and the bathroom was even smaller (it's more like the size of a public disabled toilet with shower head - there's no shower curtains or anything like that).There's no decor in the room and it looks relatively old. The only advantage of the hotel is its location - it's very close to Clark quay and all the bar/ pub/ club area, so if you r a bit of a party goer and just need somewhere to crash, then this will be the place for you!

<Content>Stay Away From the outside the hotel looks fine but it slowly goes down hill fast as you enter. The reception area is very basic that could be so more welcoming. I鈥檝e stayed in a number of low priced hotels around the world but the rooms in this hotel are awful shabby and filthy with no evidence of any attempt to clean them the shower/toilet is a tiny wet room type so when you have a shower the toilet and toilet paper gets wet and you also need to have shoes on if you use the bathroom for the rest or the day because the floor is still wet. The main room walls have stains on them the curtains are filthy and I made the mistake of looking at the pillow under it鈥檚 cover and felt a little ill at the condition of it I thought it best not to look at the mattress. Do yourself a favour and spend the extra and avoid this hotel.

<Content>Your average mid-range hotel For the price the Robertson Quay Hotel was fine, think travelodge rather than the Ritz. The rooms are basic and on the small side but what more are you going to need them for other than sleeping and washing, Singapore is a wonderful city that should be explored.We had the breakfast there most mornings which wasn't too great.The location is excellent although in the more up market area on the city so eating out locally was expensive.Overall good value.

<Content>absolute ****hole! avoid at all costs This would have to be one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in and the price is a complete joke.Rooms are so small and dank. Smelt very bed, bathroom was even smaller with cracked tiles, dodgy repair work and mould and mildew everywhere.Thank god I was only there 12 hours.Breakfast is not worth the price of the hotel. Staff in the service areas are very friendly and forthcoming as I'm sure they've had to deal with many complaints. LIke another comment I seriously wouldn't even board my dog here, like the kennel I put her in to go on holiday was five star compared to this.

<Content>Not impressed for the price I am throwing my lonely planet in the bin, as it is obvious they just trot out the same old trite from the year before, have they visited this place recently! The staff certainly didn't graduate from the disney school of hospitality as it was difficult to raise even a smile from them, the room was small and very tired, I think they had last painted them just before the representative from the Lonely planet visited back in the late 80's. They only provided a top sheet so even in the high of the Singapore summer I managed to freeze my cod's off. They got two things right, the description of the shape of the building and that the location is excellent, but here's hoping that if you planning on staying there that 'you're addicted to base', because it reverbertes through the floor from the bar downstairs on the quay until 1am in the morning. For the money I'd go somewhere else.

<Content>Will never go back again I booked 2 adjoining rooms for S$260 a night. Seemed like a bargain at that time. But when I got to the room, I felt like I made the biggest mistake in my life! The rooms were the smallest I've ever stayed in any hotel in my life. And the shower was ridiculously small. I stayed on the 8th floor. The carpet inside and outside of the rooms smelled as if somebody left some food to rot there and it was never cleaned properly. The breakfast was the same food everyday. Very little choice. The only saving grace was the pool which had a slide, and my kids had a lot of fun with it. Other than that there really is nothing to this hotel that would make me come back again, even for free.

<Content>I wouldn't let my dog stay here......... Where do you start with such a disgusting excuse for a hotel?? After a flight from the UK with 3 kids, we were hoping to get an early check in and to the staff's credit, they allowed us to use the pool while our rooms were being made up. The pool was dated, but the kids appreciated the slide.It went quickly downhill from there. After checking into the rooms, we new we were in trouble when the electricity wasn't working, and the air con was on the fritz (not ideal in 35 degrees and 95% humidity!!!) We had 2 towels between 5 of us, and that was the extent of the added extras. The mould in the bathroom was thick, and everywhere. The beds were the equivalent of what you may find in the Changi prison, excpet you wouldn't expect the same stains and rips at the jail.We booked in for 2 adults and 3 kids but were presented with 4 beds, when I queried this the reception rushed up a straw mat in a sheet for my youngest - we didn't expect to be away in a manger in Singapore.............Originally booked in for 3 nights, we took the cost of the first night on the chin and were staying at the Novotel within 2 hours of checking in.Avoid this hotel at all costs, it's not worth your relationship!!!!

<Content>Complete Rip Off Booked this on recommendation from the Lonely Planet (we usually use Rough Guide but for some reason we had the LP instead for Singapore). After a 3 week trip through Indonesia we were looking forward to a really nice room for our final night in Singapore and for $180 we thought the place would be fine - WRONG.Either the LP has never stayed at this hotel or Stevie Wonder wrote the review. Room was small, cramped, bathroom not big enough to swing a mouse never mind the cat, no room for storing bags etc.... Breakfast very average and staff not exactly helpful either.As others have stated location is OK for the Quays but better you spend your money away from this place and get the MRT. Extremely Disappointed.

<Content>WORST Hotel in Singapore I had been to many hotels in singapore and this is by far the worst hotel i had seen. Writing a review is difficult as it is so terrible that I just don't know where to begin.First I would not call this a hotel, it is not even a motel it is just a rented room. I made a mistake of booking it for 7 days and pre paid it. If I had not pre paid the room charges I would have move after first day.Ok back to the room. It got nothing. There are just 2 towels and a soap dispenser. NOTHING else not even toothbrush. You would have expect such are basic for any hotel. There are not even any slippers in the room and when I ask the front desk, they answer me in a manner that they do not even bother to look at you when answering you.The room is so small that I would not even call it a room and they only have a 14 TV set which was so out dated. And no bottle water provided too. Honestly this is a first time that I had seen a hotel not providing all this. I had been to 2 stars hotel which is even much better than themRoom is dirty and overall it is simply terrible. Even Hotel 81 is much better than them.If you ever want to visit singapore, please do yourself a favor and never go to Robertson Quay Hotel.

<Content>Nice Hotel, small but friendly and clean This is a very unusually shaped hotel which made space a premium. Our room was clean but a little dated, however, the staff were very helpful, in the main. It is ideal for a stopover but I would find it difficult to manage a full holiday there. Nice to be able to sit by the river in an evening and close to amenities.

<Content>excellent location, excellent price! booked with Asia rooms.com this hotel was booked for 1 night for an overnight stay before flying out of singapore. I chose the hotel as it was central for what we wanted and it was close to restaurants and bars. The hotel itself is nice and clean. Our room was very small. It felt like a caravan, but to be fair we had travelled for 2 days on a coach from Thailand before arriving there so it felt very luxurious!! The bathroom was tiny and had a small shower cubical. We were on the 8th floor with a good view of the river - we had double glazed dirty windows so we couldn't see much!! The hotel has a lovely bar at the side of it which is in a beach theme and we had afew cocktails outside on the river and it got pretty busy around 9pm with people walking home from work. You will be amazed by how many western people live in Singapore!!! I would recommend this hotel to people on a budget who are looking for basic accomodation in an easy location. I would also recommend a visit to Sentosa - where the gorgeous luxury hotels are!!!

<Content>Terrible quality against price Understood very hot market of Singapore hotel in this moment , but the price of the hotel stay is too high against their quality. Room cleaness, room size, staff hospitality,,, you should consider this as just trasnsit place in Singapore meaning. You can definitely find same level place with less than this accomodation budget (S$168 / night).

<Content>WONDERFULL LOCATION 1) The hotel manager give a speed respond - Good job. 2) We arrived Singapore early and hotel allow us to take bath in the gym and place our luggage in the hotel so that we can have fun later - very good job. 3) The location is wonderful. 5 minute walk to Clark Quay. 10 minute walk along riverside to Clark Quay MRT. 4) Although the room is small, our room has a beautiful city night view. 5) I agreed with others that the toilet design is really small. 6) Basic breakfast. 7) I will choose to stay here again.

<Content>Very Very Ordinary This hotel is truly terrible. Bad start as they made us wait until 1 pm before we could book into our rooms (arrived at 6 am from our o/n flight). The rooms are the smallest I have ever seen and the bathroom was so small I had to go out into the entrance way to dry myself so I did not bruise my elbows! Breafast lacks any semblance of variety or quality! Only redeeming feature is its location which is fabulous right on the river. Not recommended though!

<Content>Disappointing stay Stayed for one night over the weekend with my girlfriend. It was really disappointing, as both of us has always wanted to check out this hotel. Considering the price of $160 SGD per night, it is considered affordable and the location of the hotel is great. However, once the check in the disappointments start. The room is really small with no much walking space. Next, if you think the room is small wait till you see the toilet! Toilets look really old, and are very small as well. Television is small as well. If you read my other reviews, I am quite a TV junkie. Therefore small television does not score points with me. Breakfast is not impressive, very basic toast, spreads, hard boiled eggs, sausages, baked beans. Very disappointing overall, especially for the price that I am paying for I know that there are better hotels in Singapore at cheaper rates or similar prices.Despite all these negative points, why I gave a 2/5 rating then? The only spark is the location. The hotel is located just opposite Clark Quay and walking distances to many fanciful restaurants in the vicinity. The hotel is perfect for couples who wish to go away for a romantic weekend, but do not have the budget to pay for the other nearby hotels in the same location.

<Content>Yikes! My family and I stayed here, and I really disliked the hotel. First thing, the room was really small and squeezy. The breakfast shouldn't even be called breakfast, the food looks gross!! Like they've open a can of bake beans and poured the whole thing there. I'm gonna make sure my parents don't make us stay there again...

<Content>Good for short stay The hotel is clean perfect central location. Rooms are a bit small, breakfast so so but at this price I think this is amongst the best place in Singapore. It does not compare with a Pan Pacific or similar but that's a different league. For a 2-3 days stop over it's perfect. For longer I'd choose a different hotel.

<Content>Avoid getting ripped off I stayed there in late October and early November. My plans changed and I canceled one day of my reservation 4 days in advance. They charged my credit card anyway. They do not answer email, and they keep saying we'll look into it and call you back when talking on the phone. Terrible customer service. Questionable ethics. I'd avoid this place. I'm still out $120.

<Content>The Hotel has the friendliest Front Desk! Oh man, i enjoyed my stay there! Front desk guys just gave me a nice smile upon arriving. It was 2nd stay there. I was kinda disappointed that my room is not ready even after 3 pm. But the front desk personnel sorta told me that they are going to be ready in 10 minutes or so.Connection for internet in the room is not so well good... You need to be a rocket scientist to finger out how to solve the configurations. Well i know i am not!. Overall stay was good. I was lost for directions and Front desk seems to know about the way really well!.. Experience huh!I was there recently for the Buddhist convention. I was pleased happy to know one of the front desk personal who has a smiley face. He is a cool chap.. friendly and courteous.. He helped me out when i had trouble with the internet, a chatty guy i must add!. I think he is the only one that understood my accent!. Sadly i forgotten his name which i ask him twice. Bad memory! Anyway Keep up with a good job! A good asset to the management!I would love to visit singapore again.. a nice and warm country..Hopefully to stay and Robertson Quay hotel again!.

<Content>Good Basic Hotel I have stayed in this Hotel a few times. Its location is on the river and within walking distance of all major places in downtown Singapore. The MRT Clarke Quay is also about 10 mins walk away. It is a basic clean hotel with small ish but adequate rooms. A small pool and sundeck and bar below the hotel on the river. Breakfast is not fancy but again adequate buffet style. I have chosen to stay here because this hotel generally gives better value for money than others in the area. I will stay here again next time I pass through. If you want a fancy Hotel go for something more up market . If you want a good basic hotel at economical price and good location then this should suit most.

<Content>No bathtub, only small shower room Our room was very small with the basics: a queen-size bed and a TV. The unscreened shower room (no bathrub) has a small sink with a pre-filled liquid soap dispenser, and a toilet. It is still a decent hotel, but I wouldn't give it a 3 star, and I think it might be more suited for backpackers, or anyone who isn't picky.One interesting thing to note is that you need to leave your room cardkey in a slot by the door in your room to turn on the lights. Of course, when you leave the room, you need to take your cardkey with you and it turns the lights in the room off automatically.

<Content>Had to leave after first night stay! Terrible experience at the Robertson Quay Hotel. I made the booking online, it seemed like good value but boy was I wrong! On arrival the staff were rude, they failed to inform me on booking that there was planned works in the building and as it worked it was on the same floor that I was assigned a room. The room was dirty, the wallpaper was peeled off the wall and the bathroom (if you can call it that) was very dated. I had to leave after the first night stay with the noise from building works and everything else, I found it was not worth staying any longer.

<Content>Good value for Singapore  The best thing about this hotel is the location and the fact that you can pre-book connecting rooms without waiting until you get there to see if they have allocated you one (I have very rarely come across any other hotels that do this!). The rate is currently $117 for double room or $234 for set of connecting rooms on their website. This is great value for Singapore. The rooms are fairly small (similar size to Traders) as are the bathrooms, but clean enough for a 3 star hotel, it doesnt pretend to be 5 star. We had 3 adults and 2 kids in 2 rooms.Ours also had a fridge, safe, tv hairdryer, internet etc. Its a 5 minute walk to Clarke Quay, with lots of pubs, clubs and restaurants, great for a daytime or evening stroll. They have even developed Robertson Quay itself into a mini Clarke Quay with bars and restaurants on your doorstep. The hotel also has its own bar with deck chairs next to the river and a daily happy hour. Breakfast was basic compared to big hotels, but had coffee, tea, juice, cereals, sausages, beans and eggs, plenty for us and tasted good. Has a small pool with slide going in it, adequate for kids and adults to cool off in.Good value for Singapore and much cheaper than getting 2 rooms in a bigger 4 or 5 star hotel.

<Content>dont go! I stayed at this budget hotel in 2004 and at less than 拢30 per night it was adequate and reasonably clean, but as it was beginning to be done up i thought it would be a safe bet again this year- wrong! On arrival we were allocated a room on the 7th floor and you could almost see the smoke still lingering, despite requesting a non smoking room. We were then given a room on the top floor (the non smoking floor), it was awful, the walls were cracking, wallpaper peeling,the safe door had been ripped off and the hairdryer was missing off the wall, again i complained and was given a room 3 doors along the corridor, this room was slightly better ,but still had cracks round the window, the net curtain was black with the damp. we tolerrated it for our first 3 nights then moved out to another hotel- the Swissotel Stamford, if you want a touch of class, pricy but worth it.i wont be going back to the Robertson Quay and i wouldnt recomend it to anyone as i did after my last visit!

<Content>Good value for price We stayed for 3 days at Robertson Quay Hotel and was satisfied. A little renovation to the rooms should be done, the rooms are clean, the staff is friendly, the interenet connection on room is good and the location is really central (10 min. to China-Town, 15 min. to Orchard Road). The breakfast is a little expensive for what's it, but not 200 meters away is a Delifrance with good coffee and cheap breakfast. All in all the value for price is very good, a real budget hotel.

<Content>just the ticket I stayed here in 2004 for two separate stints of three nights each. Both times I was really appreciative to have a clean, safe, cool and relaxing place to stay. Overall I found the hotel simple but perfect for my needs. The pool is an added bonus for taking a moonlight dip under the lights of the surrounding skyscrapers - surreal! Don't stay here if you're fussy about cracked tiles and things like that because i'm not......

<Content>Very disappointed with this hotel based on cost. For approx 拢30 a night for a double room with en suite we expected something a lot nice than this place. All very average. Unfriendly and unhelpful staff. The room smelt very damp, it was kind of clean but had a very 'tired' feel to it, not at all nice, very basic. The only good thing about the hotel was the location, you can walk to a lot of places from it but we would never return to the hotel to stay.

<Content>dissapointed 2 nights in what I thought was a 3 star hotel. I suggest you do not go by pictures in website or brochures, rather shabby and worn out hotel in desperate need of a clean, modernisation and general revamp. Great rates offered considering it has ok size outside pool but no excuse for general dirty state. Bed was small but compfy but we were not completely relaxed due to linen having worn out discoloured old look/feel plus the headboard was really obviously dirty. Bathroom was disgusting and tiny, they could at least attempt to get rid of the black mould from tiles and shower curtain. Breakfast below average, would rather they quote room only rates and charge for breakfast, they'd soon have to improve it ! Location was good, in front of quiet, prity river location, short walk to some nice bars, cafe's and restaurants. Would not recommend, would suggest pay bit extra.

<Content>Dirty hotel  I had the misfortune to stay 3 nights at this hotel. We arrived after an overnight flight and the last thing we wanted was to check into a damp  dirty room with bloodstained sheets. Having requested to move to a better room we eventually were, but the second room was equally as bad. Pointing this out to the reception staff we were informed all rooms were of the same standard!! Eventually, after 3 hours of constant discussion with the reception staff, we were moved again. Admitedly the cleaner seemed to have managed to at least find some sheets without blood stains this time but the room was still not cleaned to a moderate standard. This is a very poor hotel relying on people booking via a website who have never stayed there before. Don't fall into the same trap! And I'm not some fussy traveller accustomed to 5 star luxury. Having backpacked through China, Central Asia  Iran for a year I know how many places out there appreciate your custom and make an effort to provide a good level of service. Don't give your money to the few who think there's a cheap $ to be made out of visitors !!

<Content>Small room but good deal The Robertson Quay Hotel is a gem in the rough. Unless your idea of a hotel room is somewhere you can sit in an easy chair or sofa while you put your feet up on the coffee table, This place is the place to stay. You couldn't pick a better location in Singapore. It is right on the esplanade along the Singapore River and only a 5 minute walk from the MTR station. It is half the price of other hotels in the same area, and with good reason ... the rooms are very small and basic.Think stateroom, not hotel room. The guy I was traveling with was a fellow retired naval officer. Both of us remarked how much the room reminded us of our staterooms on Navy ships. They had everything you needed and nothing extra. The room was small, the beds were comfortable and the bathroom was compact but held all the necessities. (don't think free shower caps and hand lotion ... I mean toilet, sink, and shower) There was a TV, a telephone, and internet access. What else do you need?The room comes with included breakfast and only costs $90, a bargain in this area of Singapore. Throw in an extremely helpful staff, and I don't think you could do much better.

<Content>Fantastic Weekend Fantastic weekend in a cute hotel...the size is small, the shape of the room quite irregular  unique. The location is Fantastic since we had a good view of the Singapore river and part of the Singapore skyline. Our room was clean, however, i believe they need to repair the toilet. The breakfast was A okay - more than continental really...quite good and filling...however I ate the same breakfast menu for two mornings. They should learn to change their breakfast menu daily. As for the reception desk, they are all okay and helpful and accommodating. Although it would be good if they add a smile on their faces whenever they greet their hotel guests!! Fantastic Location though very very near the Party Crowd at Clarke Quay.

<Content>Budget Hotel:- It does exactly what it says on the tin If you are on a budget and a dwarf, this is the place for you!The rooms are very very small. Whether it's a Singaporan thing, I didn't like the bathroom/toilet combo. One positive is that it is near Boat  Clarke's Quay.

<Content>Not that bad! Basic hotel at a basic price I read the reviews posted before booking my 2 night stay in this hotel, so expected the worst. To be honest, I was pleasantly surprised. The room was clean (I've paid more for a dirtier room in the UK) and basic with free tea and coffee. There were no ants or other creepy crawlies, the towels were clean and there was no mould in the shower, even if it was a little cramped.The location is excellent - we were less than a 5 minute walk away from Clarke Quay with all its bars and restaurants and about 5 minutes from the MRT stop.The hotel staff were friendly and courteous and after reading the reviews, expected to be asked to pay more for taxes etc. Was pleasantly surprised when they didn't ask for any more money and they let us check in at 7am without having to pay more - a sign at reception clearly states that anyone checking in before 12 will be charged.There was renovation work going on whilst we were there though we heard nothing,we had a look at the swimming pool, and it looked lovely.We didn't get breakfast included in the price and decided to eat out for breakfast anyway, as we had so much to see in so little time. However, on wallking out we did see people sitting down for breakfast and it looked ok - your usual cereals, toast, rolls and jam etcAll in all, I would reccommend this hotel - we were in a double room and found it fine for the two of us - a perfect city base.

<Content>Very disappointed We were rather disppointed with our stay at Hotel Robertson and Singapore overall. I was under the assumption that Singapore Hotels were of a 'higher' star rating than those in Europe! Boy, was I wrong. Nothing like the website. The price paid is not worth it, even for a budget hotel and the location is not very convenient. Our room was tiny, the bathroom even tinier, dirty and the decor horrible. We decided to stop in Singapore via Perth from our trip around Europe to relax, hence why we booked a hotel with a pool. This pool looked huge on the website, but when we got up there, boy was it a big let down. It was so small, nothing like the website. The only positive was the breakfast, which was decent enough for the price we paid (for the room).Very disappointing, I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Disappointing Budget Hotel Had orginally booked three days at this hotel (Feb 2006) however checked out after the first day. Had booked two rooms as was travelling with family of 3 children(11,8, and 4). The rooms were small (similar in size to on site University or college accomadation) fairly tidy but were in need of re-decoration. There were black marks by the air conditioning vents. The bathroom was basicaly a shower and a toilet, mismatching colours. Also has cigarette smoke blowing through the air condioning vents at night.Windows looked dirty and needed cleaning. There was a kettle in each room. One of the rooms had ants crawling over the kettle. This is a room on the 5th floor.There is a pool suitable for infants on the 3rd floor.Would not recommend this hotel. Which is unfortunate as with a bit of paint work and maintenance it could be a nice hotel even though the rooms are small. Ideal for couples and back packers.

<Content>Cheap, but bearable Two nights staying in this hotel was enough. It was a decent base for our short stay although having stayed here before new what to expect. We stayed here mainly for the location which is very good on the river.The rooms were clean, but the bathroom belongs in a prison with the sink over hanging the toilet, although the shower is ok and washes the floor at the same time due to there being no shower curtain!Also included in our room price was a buffet breakfast which was ok.They are doing renovation on the outside of the hotel at the moment but we did not notice this. The rooms are very cheap and ours included a buffet breakfast. We got what we paid for, a budget hotel for a budget price.

<Content>Not that bad! It was my second time in Singapore, and I chose the Robertson again although my first impression in 2004 wasn't that good. The price and the location were the convincing factors again. You won't probably get a room in Central Singapore with the amenities of the Robertson. I admit that the rooms are really small, the bathrooms are even worse. But they have a nice terrace with a pool, where you can enjoy a breathtaking view of Singapore Downtown. Rooms are simple but efficient with a good aircondition. This time I travelled alone, therefore the room size did not bother me at all.
