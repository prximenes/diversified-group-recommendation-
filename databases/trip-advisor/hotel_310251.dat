<Content>Great Hotel Hotel Le Coin is in a great location for checking out lots of Amsterdam's tourist spots. The hotel is clean and very nice. The kitchenette is very handy but doesn't have enough to do any real cooking. We had a teapot, but no other sorts of pots or pans. Our first room had four beds with two floors and was very cold, we were moved to a new set of double rooms upon request. You probably won't find any american-style double beds here, they're all twin beds pushed together: very common in europe. The staff weren't super friendly, but helpful enough. Again, very common for Holland. I also must comment that for how tall the dutch people are, the beds in hotels still aren't very long, and their showers aren't any taller. Regardless, the Hotel Le Coin was very pleasant and clean, I would happily stay here again.

<Content>Perfect Four of us stayed at the Hotel Le Coin and we had the BEST time! The hotel was very centrally located near the Univ of Amsterdam and just far enough from the overcrowded area around Centraal Station. The staff were amazing - the front desk could not have been more helpful. The rooms were spacious; big high windows; beds REALLY comfy; and clean, clean, clean. We were surrounded by lots of coffee shops (oh dear GOD do I miss the coffee) and lots of fun little restaurants and shops. We often ate at La Place (steps away) which was HUGE and kind of like a Dean  DeLucca. The food was amazing, fresh and flavorful - the soups, the brie sandwiches (ok, must stop now! am drooling on the computer). We could walk to several areas including Rembrandt square which also had lots of restaurants; the tram was right outside our door and we took that everywhere (Rijksmuseum; Cuyp Market). Wonderful, fabulous time!

<Content>Basic hotel w a great location This is a basic hotel with a great location. Close to Kalverstraat, blumenmarkt and we took the canal tour that was just around the corner. 5 min walk to the Nas street were we ate at two great restaurants Mappe and H something... :). Also just 5 min walk to chocolate store Puccini which is a chocolate lovers dream.The staff was very friendly and helpful both on site and before arrival when we wanted to change our reservation.Very lived comfortably 3 people in one room, a large double room with an extra bed. There was even room for a small sofa and chair and a desk and there was still plenty of floor space free.Extra points for the possibility to change the room temperature easily! The themostat was on the wall and easy to use. Much appriciated by someone who tends to freeze.

<Content>Great clean cheap place to stay! I just came back from a week stay in Amsterdam at hotel le coin, and I can only recommend this hotel very very much. Great location, clean, good beds, helpful staff, and they even did our dishes! You have your own little kitchen, so it saved us the breakfast each morning. And the room and bathroom is pretty big. We had a corner twin room with a balcony, just amazing.

<Content>Clean, spacious, no-frills, affordable The main thing I regret about this stay is that we booked in February and were told there were no rooms available for one night smack in the middle of our 7 night stay. So we booked another hotel for the one night (Sofitel Grand up the street, to try something fancy), planning to come back. The week before we showed up I was informed by email that my room was available for the missing night - but it was too late, I had a nonrefundable room at the Grand. And boy was it a pain to switch hotels for a night.Anyhoo, the hotel is directly opposite the Hotel de L'Europe, on a narrow street, so with a cab hop out fast and yank your bags in quick or you'll get run over by a bike or block potential traffic. Centrally located indeed, but if you're not a big city person you will find that walking distance involves serious dedicated trekking time (20+ min to get to places like Anne Frank House or the Pancake House). Wear proper walking shoes with good support and only carry what you need to. Or, rent bikes.There was a breakfast but it was for a fee so we opted for dining in the city. You can get wifi in-room, and it's VERY cheap - buy a week for 10 EU. However, the room will only recognize ONE computer per access code you are given; they were nice enough to give us two for the price of one, since there were two of us with laptops, but I don't know if they were supposed to or not.Large double bed room - everything's bigger in the US, meaning, a double bed is really a twin bed to us. Bedside tables were on wheels, so we could easily maneuver them around. Mini kitchen with stove kettle, big stainless steel sink, dishware, silverware, dining table and two chairs. Kitchen cabinet has built in fridge, and the cabinet handle to open it was missing. If you dirty your dishes, housekeeper won't wash them.Big armoire, little tv with actually a good number of random european channels. A sort of warm modern look to the room, not too cold and austere, high ceilings. I asked for a quiet room off the main street so our room was large, faced the rear street, where things were peaceful. We were so far away from the majority of the rooms that we never heard much street or guest noise. No in room safe, didn't bother to use desk safe. Nearly floor to ceiling double windows with some curtains that have seen better days, but the feeling is very european and bright. Beds not too firm, actually starting to feel a bit saggy and they're twins so if you sleep wildly, careful not to fall out. Two big armchairs in front of the tv, good for reading or dozing.Front desk is very small and doesn't look particularly secure; several times in our trekking around it was unattended. The staff person often ends up doing more than one job at a time, leaving the desk to attend to things, or will take a break in the breakfast area, which has a separate dining area and a sitting area with a television, a nice big table in a streetside window, and some couches/chairs. The breakfast area looked very snazzy, not upscale just very stylish and nice.So, when we first checked in and had to leave our luggage for a bit, it didn't go anywhere - it sat in the front room, no tags, and we saw this happen to other people's luggage. Anyone from another room or off the street can just grab your bag and go. There IS a sort of security system - two doors, the inner door requiring a key, but it is often left open for convenience. Which is fine, just don't leave unprotected luggage right inside!If you have bikes, there's a ramp down into the basement where you can store them. There IS free laundry - one washer, one dryer. You'll have to be vigilant to get in there when someone else isn't using them, to get your clothes done. They're also eco-friendly, meaning a wash will take an hour or more and a dry will take at least a few hours. You buy soap tablets from the front desk. The machines are labelled in images and Dutch so you may need to ask for help. :)The stairs made me think of an unprotected, rickety jungle gym. The suspension poles literally bend and wiggle away if you bump them. Made of wood, the stairs themselves are sturdy but narrow and short - and curving. The stair system is a narrow spiral, so if you're disabled, elderly, or carrying things, be careful or take the elevator.Bathroom narrow, but clean and bigger than expected. No real counter space, so get creative. They do provide the installed free shower soap/shampoo dispenser. Shower curtain rod didn't wrap all the way around so you need to be very careful where you aim your water or it will spray the bathroom/toilet.Since it's a small hotel with a small staff you aren't going to get a lot of amenities but they do have a cute little service book in the rooms and if you demand help, you get it. We therefore asked for help to carry our bags to our rooms, because if you are not near the elevator and have any suitcase over small you'll have to lug it up several bursts of steps to get to your room (we were all the way at the end of a hall and had three short sets of steps). Sometimes for such help you'll have to wait a bit.In leaving to switch hotels at one point we needed didn't want to carry our laptops but didn't want them left with our other luggage, so they placed them in the manager's office. This office is not closed, however. We weren't there during a terribly busy time and staff was around front, but again, if you're vigilant this might worry you. So, definitely great for the price, we were hunting thoroughly for a place that would give us a clean, spacious room with value for our money, and this provided it. Comes with a couple idiosyncrasies, but compare that to a dirty/older/cramped/more expensive hotel and this will of course come out on top.

<Content>Pretty little place Stayed there for a week. The place is right in the middle of Amsterdam, everything is within walking distance (restaurants, public transportation, tourist attractions). The room was quiet (double windows - make sure to close them all the way), floor-heated, very clean.They have free Internet access, both cable and wi-fi; the self-service breakfast was very fresh and tasty; washing machines are available in the basement, friendly staff as far as Dutch friendliness goes.No pool, no dinners; the stairway is very narrow, you really have to squeeze in and out. Also they don't change bedsheets every day unless you ask them to.

<Content>Excellent Place To Stay but a Little Noisy I really enjoyed my visit at Le Coin. The hotel desk was very helpful and very attentative to my needs. The room was a little small but fine for me...the location is spectacular...right in the heart of everything. Sometimes at night you could here the occasional drunk crowd but other then that I loved it.

<Content>Great location, great price! We stayed at Le Coin April 2007 for 4 days in a Large Double room. The price was great for the price and we had a great corner room with a view of Muntplein and a balcony. Service was excellent and rooms were impeccable. Will stay again for our next trip!

<Content>New Year's Eve in Amsterdam Our second time at Le Coin. Our second new year's eve in Amsterdam. The firework this time was bigger and better an it was less cold. For the rest. * I LOVE AMSTERDAM *About the hotel: Le Coin is a very friendly hotel. Basic, spacious rooms (we had the quiet room 248 on the inside), very clean, free to use dryer/washer/iron (it rained, so the dryer was heaven ) in the basement, and CENTRALLY LOCATED. Almost impossible, . . . è´¸n the Coin Square. So, Red Light District, all Museums, main shopping street, canals, tramstop, city hall, theatre, cinema, coffeeshop, and bike renting (we did that one day ; amsterdam is really the bikeaholic centre of the world) èŒ…verything on walking distance.What can I say. I'll be there again next new year. Count me in!!

<Content>Nice.... This hotel was nice, not great. It is really cute on the outside. A good location...right next to the Bloemenmarkt. The room is big, but you have to climb up a ladder to get to the beds. I was fine with it, but some people might not like that!

<Content>Great location, great price, would highly recommend This hotel isn't particularly fancy, but it's in a good spot, very affordable, clean and with very friendly staff. It's only 5 min from Rembrandt plein, and only 3 tram stops from the central station. We stayed in room 143 (which was pretty big, and had its own kitchen area), which had a little balcony overlooking one of the canals. We paid 100euros/night (w/o breakfast) and the place was more than worth that. 1 week of wireless internet access is only 10 euros which is another nice perk. Would definitely come back!

<Content>Great Location, Lovely Staff Travelled to Amsterdam at the end of June with our two children aged 9 and 13. Despite assurances that there would be lots for the kids to enjoy we were a little apprehensive about the city. However we had a brilliant time. Hotel Residence Le Coin was a great base with lovely clean but basic apartments. We had a family apartment which consisted of two rooms (one with two single beds and the other larger had 3 single beds) which were separated by a modern bathroom (with lots of towels, soap and shower cream) and adjoining toilet. Both rooms had TV, fridge and seating area so everyone was happy. The whole apartment was self contained behind a 'front door'. Maid service changed towels, cleaned bathroom and made beds each day. The reception was open 24 hours and the staff were very friendly - giving directions, information on which tram to take, which stop to get off at etc - very useful in a strange city. Check in / check out was very quick and efficient and safety deposit boxes were available at no extra cost. On arrival we walked from Central Station to the hotel - which took about 20 minutes - along the Damrak and then along the Rokin - a very picturesque stroll even with luggage. It took us another 10 minutes to locate the hotel. We were given directions that it was opposite the Hotel L'Europe which is a very large hotel. The Le Coin is actually opposite the front entrance of the Hotel L'Europe which is just down a little side street off the Rokin. The kids really enjoyed the Anne Frank House, the Van Gogh Museum, Rembrant's House and especially Madame Tussauds. A canal trip is also a must to experience some of the hightlights not accessible by foot and to see the extent of the canals running through the city. The flower market and main shopping street were just across the street from the hotel and also proved popular with the children. There are various restaurants in the vicinity along with croissanteries and little grocery shops selliing pastries, sandwiches and filled rolls - if this doesn't appeal to the kids - there's a McDonalds just over the canal opposite the hotel and a Burger King around the corner! Just one word of warning - the bicycles - they are everywhere - just make sure you keep out of the bike lanes and beware when stepping onto them when crossing the road. The trams also creep up on you really quickly and you hardly hear them until they are right behind you! I would recommend the Le Coin for its location, self-catering facilities and brilliant staff.

<Content>Decent hotel in very good location I just got back from staying at the Le Coin for five nights. I think this is a good, budget hotel. It was clean and basically comfortable. I would not call it charming or romantic. We stayed in a Large Twin room which was quite spacious, but I don't think the rooms have any real character in style or decoration. We paid 145 Euro's a night for the room, just so you can get a comparison to other hotels. There were few amenities in the room. Soap and shower caps were given, but no shampoo, lotion or other toiletries that you usually find in hotels. No hairdryers either.No safes in the room, but there is one in the common area that you can arrange to use. My major complaint is that they use some sort of plastic on their mattresses that made sleeping quite hot at night for us. That being said, it is in a very good location and the staff is quite nice and helpful. There are free laundry facilities for guests in the basement which come in handy. I did not have breakfast at the hotel as I took advice from another review and went to the cafe on the corner each morning for very good coffee. An italian restaurant called Vasso was recommended to us and we really enjoyed our dinner there and it was very close by. Did I love this hotel? No. Did I hate it? No. Would I return? Probably not, mainly because I don't think it was good enough to warrant not looking around town for something with a little more character.

<Content>perfect location, cozy hotel Le Coin is a well situated hotel. It is close to Damrak and Leidesplein where all the action goes on. It is only 5-10 minutes walk to get whereever (I mean touristic attractions of course) you want to. It is also very close to Kalversraat (I could be spelling these names wrong, fyi), which is full of shops. There is a superb cafe called De Jardeen on the same street with the hotel. Hotel itself is cozy, clean and comfortable. Staff is very kind and friendly. I stayed there for three nights and have not encountered any problems at all. Just beware that there are no hair dryers in the rooms, bring your own or request it from the reception in turn of a 20eur deposit (you take it back when you return the hair dryer), you may also take advantage of the safe by paying a deposit. In case I go to Amsterdam again, I would stay in Le Coin for sure.

<Content>Great pad Hurrah - I loved Le Coin, and I'm relieved to have finally found a chic/cheap place to stay on my visits to the Dam, having ended up in some dodgy 3 stars and overpriced 4 stars in the past.This time around I was looking for a hotel in Amsterdam that suited 14 girls (28-34 yrs) on a hen weekend - without the tacky group shenannigans. I booked the Le Coin based on a recommendation from some guys who stayed at New Year - all boys, so it could feasibly have been shabbier than they described...knowing how boys compromise on comfort in favour of beer, value and whatever else they get up to.Saw the pics and bit the bullet - and was absolutely delighted. The Le Coin is very central, a ten minute walk from Amsterdam Centraal train station (down the Damrak and Rokin)and 5 mins from the Rembrandtsplein where you'll find tons of bars and restaurants. Our rooms varied from a corner room with fab views of the canal and clock tower, to split level loft-style apts with a ladder up to the beds (careful when tipsy - not for the clumsy). The amenities are geared to a short-term stay, the wee kitchenette was a bonus and the place felt like a self-contained studio rather than a hotel room.Great things include: staff (cheery and helpful), underfloor heating (wooden floorboards, cosy), views and comfy, comfy beds (if a little narrow).Only real drawback for some was the ladders (no good for wide hips). Can't comment on the breakfast because we never made it down in time....We had a great weekend (try Boom Chicago if you're into live comedy - show changes all the time and never fails to amuse, topical and improvisation stuff) and most of the group have discussed returning in May for another stay, probably for five days now we know we could do so in comfort and style. A wee gem. Can't wait to go back.

<Content>Rooftop terras, to look for the stars If you're looking for a romantic spot in Amsterdam to kiss with your girlfriend or boyfriend under the stars and you want to do that on the rooftop of your hotel, you have to go to this hotel. For the rest it's the same story as the other positive comments. Although, I want to add that there is no airco in the rooms. So, when I was there, one of the days when we forgot to open the windows it was a bit warm in the room.So if you're looking for 17 Celcius in mid summer you better leave the window open and put on the fan (of course there was a fan in the room).I won't be there until next summer.But if you're there then, I'll see you around!Gr, Elisabeth WaltersEdinburgh, Ireland

<Content>Le Coin is my second home I'm not surprised reading all these positive comments about Le Coin. I'm staying there frequently. First I thought the enthusiasm of the staff would fade away after staying there a couple of times, but it's indeed like coming home again.For the rest all stories on this board are worth reading and correct. Didn't know the hotel was on this site. Okay, see you there! Gr, Coola ManzanaBrasila, Brasil

<Content>Honest, Pure, Central, Feeling home, No nonsense Stayed there a few months ago. I remember it very well, because it was a fine hotel with warm people. Seemed like they work their magic on the guests, because everybody seemed sè´¸ relaxed in this hotel.When we were looking for it, we nearly couldn't find it. It's a small entrance . . but when your go up to your room you find out that it stretches out over all properties you past on your way down the street.We stayed in a large twin room with a little balcony, on the street corner. I think we were very lucky; I remember the nice guy from behind the desk mentioning that that room was kind of special. But there are more rooms like that he added.And special it was; there was even a little kitchen with refrigerator, brand new bathroom and the canalview . . . . all packed into this from the outside tiny looing hotel.Later they told me it was kind'a University property, so there were staying Professors and Dr's and famous researchers from around the world all over the place. Now I understand why everything felt like home and nothing was overdone.Location; every hotspot is on walking distance. Dam Square, Leidse Square, Rembrandt Square, New Market. Coin Square in front of the hotel, where trams are leaving to every spot in Amsterdam and a metro station also on walking distance. And there are also a few trams leaving for Museum Square and the Vondel Park area if I'm right.Just ask the curly guy or the nice brunette behind the desk for directions. Every question I had was well raken care of. I must say that.Whenever I go back to Amsterdam, I will ofcourse pay them a visit.ps, I think the price mentioned on this site is too high. I payed like 95 EURO for the large twin, I had a big discount although.Gr, Steven de PevenLondon, United Kingdom

<Content>lean , mean  Very much oke,. . for what I experienced, 'cause after all, I enjoyed Amsterdaméº“s nightlife (a lot). ;-) The guests in the hotel varied from bussinessmen to families. We had a room on the street side, bit noisy, but for the rest spacious (the large twin) and a beautiful bathroom. Fell asleep in a large hot bath twice; hihi.The best was the kitchen we had , we made our breakfast in our room, with a little help from the supermarket one block away.There is a 5-star hotel accross the street, so we enjoyed looking at the sportscars driving by all day.Next time weéº“ll try to reserve a room on the canal side. Seems that those rooms are even better. We didnéº“t find a hotel more centrally located than this. Iéº“m not a pro although.Maybe weéº“ll meet in spring when I go there again with my two girlsfriends.Hade a great time there!Gr, Julie BlossumSydney Australia
