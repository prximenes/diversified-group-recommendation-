<Content>Poor customer services We booked this hotel via a secret hotel on last minute.com.We booked it because it was central. The standard room was ok but the bed was uncomfortable.The facilities were not those that you would expect at a 4 star hotel. e.g. when we asked about tea and coffee in the room we were told this was only for superior room 'people'. There was no restaurant, the breakfast was expensive and not to the standard expected in Germany. The staff were unfriendly and generally unhelpful. On check-out the clerk on reception tried to charge us for the water in the room (there was no mention of this in the room-4euros 50!!) and also questioned the fact that we only had breakfasted once in the hotel. When trying to get a drink from the bar at reception (no mini-bar) one had to stand around until the staff could be bothered to serve you-the telephone appeared to be far more important than a staying guest. The coffee was eventually nice but cold.So all in all we would not recommend this hotel unless you are ok with unfriendly service.

<Content>Fine business hotel The hotel, located near Checkpoint Charly (does someone remember the door in the wall?), is fine for business stays at Berlin. Big rooms, well suited, fine breakfast. 4 stars worth.

<Content>Good hotel My self and hubby and 2 friends stayed at this hotel for 3 nights.It's in a very good location, just around the corner from check point Charlie.We did not have breakfast in the hotel as, it was not included in the rate, but saying that the breakfast room looked lovely.The bar was a different matter , just a bar (which is way over priced)in the lobby.If you come out of the hotel and turn left ,then left again you will come to a small residential area with a few eating places, and will take you into the gendermenmarket area.If you come out of the hotel and turn right then left you will come across a bar/hotel called the Anglietere.Avoid unless you want to spend 20euros on 4 half of lagers!!My self and hubby chose to upgradeto room 322 for the tea making facilities..I would not recommend as it cost 60euros and as our friends said that's a lot to spend to look at a kettleTo add insult to injury we had to ask for the milk and sugar each morning.On the whole the hotel was spotless ,and the young man who run the reception desk in the evenings was most helpful as opposed to the young girl in the day.If I visit Berlin again I would stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Great Hotel This hotel was great, the rooms were very clean and modern, the staff were very friendly and only to happy to help, I would say that this is one of the best hotels, I have stayed in for a while, I stayed for three night, It cost close to 120 Euros, the hotel is great if you just want a base in the city to sight see or for business, next time I am back in Berlin, I will be staying here again, the only downside would be they only have a breakfast service, but they are only to happy to recommend a Nearby restaurant.

<Content>Functional hotel in a good Location The hotel is in an excellent location and if you like walking, you can easily get to all the key sites such as Brandenburg Gate, Museum Island, Sony Center. It is modern and functional though unexceptional - don't book here if you want something special from your stay as it is little more than a comfortable place to sleep.

<Content>Loved it, loved it, loved it Perfection. Super-friendly and welcoming staff, spotlessly clean room, stylish design all around, comfortable bedding, great central location, Gilchrist  Soames Spa Therapy bath products, fantastic attention to detail (eg. built-in plug converters in bathroom) that you don't find very often these days----and all for 鈧?8 a night.... absolutely unbelievable. It really might be the best deal in all of Europe.

<Content>Deserves its current 7th best in Berlin tag! Recently refurbished and in an extremely quiet part of Berlin but just round the corner from the U Bahn at Kockstrasse (Check Point Charlie) or 2 blocks from the S Bahn at Anhalter. There is virtually no traffic and if you arrived by car then I don't think you'd have a problem parking in the street. Nice room, nice bathroom, superb shower, no bath, room temp fine, double bed with single quilts a superb idea, brilliant for couples who like different temperatures!! Free safe is very easy to use. Flat TV on wall with usual free Euro and base channels inc Sky News, plus movies and porn as in pretty much any Euro hotel. Gave us 2 completely blank door cards which you just wave over the sensor on the room door and alse the door that separates the rooms from the public areas, a nice touch we thought. Delicious round the corner (towards CPC) does indeed do a good alternative Euro brecky for E8 rather than E12 in hotel. If you prefer cooked and are up late then after 10am you can get a superb omelette in the Italian 2 blocks left out of the hotel towards Anhalter - forget name but has a SommerGarten. Looks a little run down but food excellent.For the evening we recommend Caf茅 Orange on Oranienburger Strasse 32. Go to Anhalter and then take S Bahn up to next stop after Friedrichstrasse - the public transport really is the best way around in Berlin, you never have to wait and it all goes fast. The duck in blasamic sauce or the lamb in olive sauce are just superb and packed with taste - incredible value for just 11 Euros! Back to the hotel, the bar is completely devoid of any atmosphere, best bet is probably the bar round the corner to the left. We tried the bar of the Angleterre to the right and it was nice enough but ridiculously expensive. Better doing your drinking in town really - the public transport is still perfectly OK even late at night. Berlin seems to have a big problem with grafitti, some of which is actually very good, which does make it look more run down than it really is in some areas - but we were told crime is very low and didn't see anything to make us feel otherwise. Motorcycles are left on the street and still there the next day anyway! If we ever go back to Berlin and the Winters is still as cheap as it is now then we'll certainly be staying there! Tip, sign out front is just blue 'HOTEL'. The rest is there but very small, and the word 'Winter's' is almost invisible! Make sure you know where it is before you go - a policeman from the station just round the corner had no idea where the 'Winters Hotel' was, nor a selection of other locals!

<Content>Exceptional value This is a very stylish hotel located right near checkpoint charlie- not perhaps my favourite part of berlin but certainly very central and also close to an underground station. We paid 55 euros for a twin room which was fantastic value. As seems customary in this part of the world there was no fridge in the room but this was only a minor inconvenience- staff also friendly and helpful. Room was minimal but very clean and comfortable- not a place to spend a day but a nice spot to recuperate for a few hours between activities. Street reasonably quiet and windows double-glazed so noise was not a problem.

<Content>Best value for money in Europe! Compared with what you get, staying at the Winter's hotel in Berlin Mitte (By Checkpoint Charlie) is a very good deal. The room is big, everything looks new, it's clean and has plenty of storage space. The staff is very friendly and helpful also with suggestions for walks in the city. While the area the hotel is located in is not the most exciting in Berlin, the location is an excellent starting point for visits to the surrounding parts of Berlin. Here I can especially recommend the eastern areas of Prinzlauerberg, East Kreutzberg and Friedrichshain - or if you want to go shopping for the bigger brands on Kurf没rstendamm in Charlottenburg. A couple of minutes walk to the west of the hotel is the spa Liquidrom, which definitely is a good way to spend a couple of hours.

<Content>Ideal hotel for visiting central Berlin We visited Berlin for a long weekend and stayed at the Winter's Hotel. The location is ideal (around the corner from Checkpoint Charlie, near train  underground stations). The hotel appears to have been recently refurbished - both the public areas and our bedroom were very modern  fresh. Staff very pleasant. Breakfast fine. Good value as well. No fridge, iron / ironing board or air-conditioning in our room, but we didn't mind too much, given that the standards were otherwise high.

<Content>very nice hotel - the location is not too nice, but the hotel is easily accessible between two metro stations. Rooms do not have their own air conditioning; temperature is adjusted by receptionist so it was too hot for us at night. Also, cleaning lady has a very strange way of checking if guests have left the room - she just enters the room without knocking, a bit surprizing. + the overall experience was v. good - the building is newly renovated, rooms are clean and nicely furnished. Bed sheets and towel are fresh and new. Good value for money.

<Content>Great Value - Not the Best Location Stayed for a couple of nights at the end of june 2008. Took two rooms one for my wife + i, one for our kids. Rooms were clean, bright + well decorated. Staff were friendly and helpful, as helpful as they needed to be (we didn't challenge them with anything). A little surprised that the hotel was 4* rated, more 3* we felt - facilities were quite limited, it's really just a good quality / good value room to lay your head at the end of the day, Berlin's too interesting to spend much time in your bedroom anyway.Location:This end of Friedrichstrase, around checkpoint Charlie is pretty quiet. Good for the Jewish Museum + some posh shopping, but otherwise quite dull. Having wandered around Berlin for a few days we were all left thinking that we would rather have stayed on the other side and to the east end of the Unter Den Linden.Didn't take breakfast in the hotel so can't say anything about the food.

<Content>excellent value hotel Excellent hotel in a good location in Berlin. U bah station within 5 minutes walk allows easy access to the whole city. Hotel bar open through the night which helps as well. Rooms are not massive but very clean and modern and are big enough. Breakfast is about 12E and there is lots of it if you want to fill up before you go out. Staff are extremely helpful as well. Price is pretty decent so you cant go wrong really. Also while you are there go to a Hertha Berlin game at the Olympic Stadium - the atmosphere is fantastic.

<Content>Clean, newish hotel Located very close to Checkpoint Charlie and only 15 min walk to Potsdamer Platz. The Checkpoint Charlie metro stop is 5 mins walk away if you don't feel like walking! Transport is excellent.Reception of hotel welcoming and helpful. The rooms are light, a fair size and clean. The bathrooms really nice. One point though, there is no mini bar - which is kind of strange when it wasn't built that long ago, also no air conditioning. That wasn't a problem for us - the bar in reception will let you take drinks to your room and will give you a bucket of ice if needed. We didn't have breakfast - it was around 12 euros each, but there are good cafes and take away shops nearby, for only a few euros. Overall I would recommend this hotel, it was value vs location and amenities.

<Content>What a wonderful deal! And right in the center of Berlin! Hotels.com was fantastic in helping me find this hotel. It is fairly new and all of the furnishings were so clean. It was right near the U-Bahn and all of the on-off tour buses went right by it because it was close to Checkpoint Charlie. From there, we had a very easy subway ride to the Pergamon Museum and it was also close to the Reichstag and Brandenburger Tor. We loved our stay there. In the mornings, they offer a fairly expensive breakfast (12 euros, which is a lot given the current $1.50 per euro exchange rate) but there was a Starbucks about one block away. We only had to tell the front desk that we needed a taxi, for example to go to dinner or a nightclub, and one would show up within just a few minutes. I highly recommend this hotel for the price, cleanliness, location, and professionalism of the hotel staff.

<Content>Good combination of value, functionality and style This hotel offers good value in Berlin. Location is near some key historic sites like Checkpoint Charlie and the Anhalter Bahnhof. It's a good base for exploring the former East Berlin quarter called Mitte.Offers internet access at reasonable price and in my room on the second floor the wifi worked as well. Service is attentive and the rooms clean and modern. Those facing the road are of large size, especially for Europe. Only advice to the hotel: place a washcloth in the room for improved showering....

<Content>Nice hotel near a freeway A pleasant hotel not far from the train station although right next to a freeway. It was well run. The rooms were basic but clean with a small but comfortable bed. The breakfast was not included but was very nice. It had a nice view of the park across the road. It is not far from the centre of Berlin. Check-out the local ice-cream shop just across from the station. 70cents a scoop...very nice.

<Content>Great hotel, nice location Great location near Checkpoint Charlie and the Kochstrasse U-bahn stop. The reception area is neat, clean and contemporary. The front desk/all staff are very courteous and helpful. Breakfast is 12Euro/person but we found several places to eat along Kochstrasse as well as traveling quickly to Potsdamer Platz. The rooms are well appointed with wall mounted flat screen tv's with 2-English channels. The bathroom is very nice with a great shower and clean amenities. My husband (police officer) felt very safe with the security measures (card key entry before elevators and electronic door room lock) which is great for both of us.

<Content>Great stay I found this hotel through TA itself, just scrolled down the ratings ranking until I found this affordable hotel. And I only can agree with the high rating. Rooms are spacious, comfortable and very clean. Location is easy acessible, something like 400 meters from underground and very quite. No problem if you sleep in a street-front room. We were in the 323. High ceilings and modern instalations. Very good shower and hair-dryer.Don't hesitate, go for it !

<Content>Excellent value for money Excellent modern hotel, very clean and very close to Checkpoint Charlie. Just off Friederichstrasse and all the very nice shops, as well as U Bahn stations. Staff friendly and most with some English and some with very good English indeed. We stayed 3 nights. Breakfast buffet 12 Euro per person, which you might think pricey, but includes hot and cold selection, fresh fruit salad, yoghurt, rolls, toast, cereal and plenty of coffee, as well as a good selections of teas. Perhaps if it has been warm weather we might have walked out for breakfast, but we investigated around and most breakfasts for 4 or 5 Euro were a roll and cheese or ham, perhaps yoghurt, and sometimes you had to pay separately for coffee, so we considered it worth paying the 12 Euro. We will definitely be going back and plan to use this hotel again.

<Content>A really enjoyable stay. My boyfriend and I booked the Winter's hotel for two nights when we went on our first trip to Berlin. As neither of us had been to Berlin before, we didn't know the best area in which to stay, so choosing this was just pot luck, really. We got a taxi from the airport so there were no problems finding the hotel, and the cab wasn't too expensive. The staff are really very helpful, polite, welcoming and friendly. Every person we talked to spoke perfect English. They are attentive and discreet.The room was very pleasant. Everything was spotlessly clean, and the bathroom was just as good. The double bed was two twins pushed together but it was impossible to tell once we were in! The bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in.The location of the hotel is also pretty good, within walking distance of various places of interest. We had a pretty dreadful meal in a nearby restaurant, but the English translation on the menu was so funny, it made up for the poor food. There is a metro stop within just a couple of minutes walk so you've got easy access to all parts of the city.So all in all, I really would recommend this hotel, and I'd certainly stay here again. The only drawback to our stay was that breakfast was not included so I can't comment on the quality of the food. But there are plenty of coffee shops fairly near by so you can always grab a bite to eat there if necessary. We had a great time at this hotel, and I really can't think of anything to moan about!

<Content>Excellent hotel and excellent location Excellent hotel location, only 100m from the underground station which is great for getting around berlin. The hotel was exceptionally clean and very comfortable, with probably the most comfortable hotel beds of any hotel i've stayed in. Modern facilities and restaurant, although we did not include breakfast with our rate to save more money...which was a good idea as there were coffee shops and bakery's 30 seconds away. Would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone. Value-for-money-wise i dont feel we could have stayed anywhere better in the whole city.Worth looking around for prices as we got double room for 185E for 3 nights, and although it wasnt the busiest time in berlin itself, still a great city with loads to do**Dont miss the 9th floor bar / restaurant round the corner 5mins away called solar bar. Unbelievable views of the city and excellent cocktails. At the top of an apartment block two streets west of fredrichstrasse (parallel) and near the accor hotels (ibis, etap)**

<Content>excellent hotel in the centre of Berlin I stayed 4 nights at Hotel Winters and I can confirm what most of the other people are telling in the reviews: this hotel is really value for money. Very nice room (single room with enough space, double bed) with design furniture. Walking distance to a lot of attractions like Checkpoint Charlie, Jewish Museum etc.I booked a room without breakfast (12 Euro) but there are several coffeeshops and bakeries around the corner in Friedrichstrasse, so it is easy and cheaper to eat breakfast here.Very clean hotel and friendly staff. The only minus that I can mention is that they were sometimes very late finished with cleaning the room...sometimes 16.00, so I came back in a room that wasn't done yet.But I can absolutely recommend this room. A tip: take the 2 or 3 days tickets for the public transport, much cheaper than the hop on-hop off offers. The city of Potsdam is absolutely worth a visit as well.

<Content>Not bad Stayed here for three nights on our first stop of a 10 day Germany tour. Berlin was more of a tourist attraction for native Germans, sort of like what Washington, DC would be for Americans. Could see most of what you would want to see in about 2 days. Nice, clean and recently renovated hotel. Rooms were very spacious and modern. We got a separate room for our two boys age 19 and 11 but they could have easily stayed in our room with an extra cot. Location was fair. A little bit of a hike to the center of attractions near the government buildings and museums. Public transportation system, however, is outstanding and very easy to use. Couple of nice coffee shops in area so don't waste your euros on hotel breakfast, way to expensive. Staff helpful except for one person who I think had difficulty with the English language.

<Content>Superb  Absolutely fantastic hotel which deserves much more than its three star rating. Ultra modern and extremely clean. Very quiet as it is located on a residential street, although close enough to walk to allthe main sights. Staff were very helpful and organised a taxi for us to return to the airport. If you are going to Berlin, you could not find better!

<Content>Great for a city break We arrived in this hotel and firstly found the receptionist very helpful. The hotel is bright and modern and the rooms were spacious enough with good bathrooms. Although there was no AC, it was not necessary as the weather was only about 18c celius. The location is very central, the hotel bar would have zero atmosphere though (but who drinks in their hotel when they're in berlin!?!?) and overall we were very happy with our stay. We paid about 鈧?80 for 3 nights (wed, thurs  fri) and overall I would recommend this hotel. However, that price did not include breakfast which we were advised was 鈧?2 per head. there's a nice cafe on the corner though so there was no way we were paying 鈧?4 for brekkie in the hotel! However, it did look good. (Also, there is free parking right outside the door which was very handy as we were driving across europe)

<Content>Clean  Hotel was clean and quite. The rooms did not have AC and it was a warm week while I was there so this was a negative (no fan in the room). At night with the windows open the room would cool down but the room would get mosquitoes and we would awake to several new bites each morning. The hotel has two internet connected computers available for use, for a fee. The charge for internet access was a disappointment for the price of the rooms but this seems to be the trend in hotels trying to cater to higher spending travelers. The Breakfast was nice but not worth the 12 euros per person they charge. There are much better breakfast choices just up the street near Check Point Charlie. Would recommend a taxi to the hotel (10-15 min drive) from the main train station rather then trying to carry your luggage while using the underground.

<Content>Excellent under-rated hotel! This hotel is just a short distance from the metro, near Check Point Charlie, on a quiet residential street. The staff is helpful and all spoke excellent English. The rooms are small were very clean, and modern, and offered king size beds. We stayed two nights mid-week, and reccomend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Nice and centrally located We stayed at this hotel for eight days as tourists. Not particularly cheap with the exchange rate where it is but otherwise we were very happy with the hotel. Lovely decor'; clean, modern, pleasant, quiet, central location, helpful staff. We'd definitely recommend it to friends.

<Content>Central location Central location within walking distance of checkpoint charlie and the tube system. Really clean and quiet hotel with very friendly staff who all spoke English. Rooms are smallish but very nicely furnished and very very clean. Very sleek bathroom fittings! Breakfast was an all you can eat affair and more than filled up before we went off sightseeing.It snowed whilst we were there and was really really cold outside but the hotel and rooms were always warm and relief to get back to!This trip was a present from my boyfriend as he proposed to me in Berlin so was rather glad all was ok!Great city and a hotel that was great value for money.
