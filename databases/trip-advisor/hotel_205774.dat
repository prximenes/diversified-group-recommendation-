<Content>Friendly service Great location. It's very near the station (5 minute walk) and the centre. The room was simple but nice and clean. Continental breakfast was included. The staff spoke good English and were very friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>hotel is ok This hotel is fairly well located, not far from the train station. You can walk to main sight-seeing places. The entrance is small and dark, you take a tiny lift (reception is on 3rd floor) but the room was pretty comfortable. The staff was friendly and helpful. There were not enough choices in the breakfast: mostly jam, bread and croissant. It would be great to have more variety: different pastries, eggs, ham, more fruits, etc... in the overall, it was an enjoyable stay.

<Content>Florence, full of art, do not go when on strike Florence is a nice place to visit, and the hotel Kursaalausonia is a nice hotel in the center of the city. Hotel staff are very helpful and will give you any information that you need. The hotel is clean, the rooms are of good size, with private bathroom. The breakfast is composed of a good selection of cold items. We recommend this hotel to couples going for a short break. Florence is nice and you have to try to find the way to avoid queues on museums, a good trick is to go just after lunch time.

<Content>DARK AND SMALL ROOMS I booked a room for 3 nights on expedia. The room was very simple, small and dark. The room was not well lit which made the room look even worse. The bathroom is small but looks new and clean. The walls are really thin. We could hear the maid in the hall every morning. The location is not that great. The park next to the hotel seem to attract a lot of immigrant works at night. I would not stay here again. The hotel Eden across the street looked a lot better.

<Content>Excellent stay We really enjoyed our stay at the kursaal. We upgraded our room to a superior double for 20 euros a night, this was a lot quieter as it was at the rear of the hotel with a nice balcony it also had a view of the duomo. The hotel was excellently located not to far from the railway station,and easily within walking distance of local restaurants markets shops and all the tourist attractions.The only slight disappointment was the breakfast nothing hot no fruit and very limited Ok if you just want toast or the odd croissant. However this did not spoil our stay and would definately stay there again.

<Content>Fourth Try a Charm After 3 disappointing hotel experiences in Florence I took a chance on the Hotel Kursaal Ausonia's Internet special wherein you can get a Superior Room for the price of a Standard Room if it is booked more than 30 days in advance. I'm glad I did. The booking process was seamless and confirmation, together with explicit directions on how to reach the hotel from various points, was provided immediately. (It is a 15 minute walk from the SM Novella train station.)Paola Angelini and Giovanpaolo Innocenti run a very pleasant, clean and green hotel that is within easy walking distance of all the sights in the center of Florence. Even though located on a very busy street with heavy traffic, the hotel rooms were quiet! Noise has been a problem for me in Florence in the past. Any problem we had with the room or bathroom was attended to with alacrity and the front desk folks were especially accommodating and well informed. Paola is also a Florence tour guide and shared a wealth of information. A bountiful breakfast is provided in the dining room. I should mention that we stayed there twice during the month and the second time we were remembered and welcomed like long lost friends. I will definitely stay at the Hotel Kursaal Ausonia when visiting Florence in the future.

<Content>Great Choice Florence is a great city to walk around, and the key priority is to find somewhere central that you can duck back to if your legs are sore or you just need a moment away from tour groups.Kursaal  Ausonia has typically intimate rooms for Italy, but they are very clean and comfortable, and the staff was helpful. Breakfast is fine and most significantly, the location is absolutely tremendous.Enjoy.

<Content>Great hotel Several friends and I stayed at the Hotel Kursaal Ausonia for five days in July. It was the second year in a row that our group had stayed here. Several aspects of the hotel operations are impressively geared toward sustainability. The rooms were clean and the staff was helpful and kind. The location works well as it is midway between the train station and the Duomo. For us, a nice feature of the hotel was the 'living room' area. It gave us a comfortable place to relax and talk without being in someone's room or feeling like we were sitting in a hotel lobby. The hotel has been recently decorated and the Owner has a great sense of color and Italian style. If you are a single, ask for the room at the top of the stairs. It's small, but features a view of the top of Brunelleschi's dome; a true Florentian experience.

<Content>Helpful folks This was my second stay at this hotel (the first time was in 2001), and I was pleased to see that it had been remodeled. I was equally pleased to discover that the helpful attitude of the staff at the hotel was intact. This is a comfortable, few-frills hotel, well-designed for the traveler who spends the bulk of her time out and about. Good breakfasts, a little noisy, clean.

<Content>Very Comfortable Hotel in a great Location! This hotel was a hidden gem! Located just a few blocks (about 10 min walk with luggage) from the train station (Santa Maria Novelli), the street didn't look like it would be the best place but we were all very pleasantly surprised. They allowed us to store our luggage in a den-type room before checking in, so that we could explore the city baggage-free for a few hours before check-in time. Breakfast had a good variety of selection to provide a hearty enough meal to fuel our morning exploring and help us save money on day snacks and/or meals. The staff was very hospitable and the room was VERY comfortable. The bathroom was spacious and well-equipped. The entire property was very well kept and clean. Recommend this hotel to all.

<Content>Very Confused I must say i am very confused with peoples reviews of this hotel. Perhaps i was given one of the dirtiest, ugliest and loudest rooms in the entire building????My partner and i booked this hotel based on all the wonderful reviews and when we arrived we were quite disappointed to say the least. Our room looked nothing like the photo when we arrived. We were so tired from lugging our things around that we just dumped out stuff in our room and was looking forward to freshining up. As we got through the doors and in the bathroom it appeared as soon as we flushed the toilet the ceiling and floor was leaking. Needless to say we collected our luggage and within 5 minutes we were out of there. There was no assistance from the reception staff or undestanding for that matter and they refused to give us another room or refund our money. We lost our money but found a much more beautiful and clean place to stay for the remainder of our trip.Yes it is right near the train station, but who cares this is not necessarily a good thing at night time for noise and sole travellers. Less than 5 minutes on foot around the corner you can locate and stay at such a more beautiful and peacfull spot.

<Content>very good! Stayed 5 nights at Hotel Kursaal. Centrally located: very close to Duomo, train station, restaurants, shopping, transport.Room was excellent as well as the bathroom . Breakfast was excellent, staff extremely helpful and attentive.Hotel Staff organised a wine tour (with private driver) and Siena tour as well as tickets to Academia and Uffizi Gallery so there was no waiting.

<Content>the nicest hotel of our trip We have just returned from a wonderful 4 night stay at Hotel Kursaal  Ausonia, the hotel has been recently renovated and was very nice. Our room was large and very comfortable, the bathroom bigger than the ones in the other hotels we stayed in (great water pressure in the shower!!!). Everyone at the front desk was extremely helpful and gave us great tips on where to eat and what to visit. The location was just fantastic so close to everything we wanted to see.This was by far the nicest hotel we stayed in on our trip and we have already recommended it to our friends. We will definitely be going back

<Content>An okay small hotel The hotel location is very good, not too far from the train station and the main attractions. Our room was clean and sufficient size but a little worn out. The staff was friendly enough and spoke excellent English. Our room was on the 3rd floor, pretty close to the storage room where they keep the breakfast dishes, and this caused some noise early in the morning (causing problems for the light sleeper). The breakst itself was a slight dissapointment, rather simple and nothing fresh (vegetables, fruit) was available. Coffee from the machine was horrendous, be warned (you麓re better off getting your morning cappuccino from one of the caf茅s nearby).To sum it up, if you麓re looking for a nice, not too fancy hotel, we would recommend this. Oh, and if you麓re in a hurry, take the stairs instead of the funny little elevator.

<Content>Great Experience! Our family (2 adults, a 15 year old and 12 year old) had a terrific 2-night stay in Florence. The staff were friendly and communication was no problem due to their superb English skills. They helped us book our reservations at both the Uffizi and the Academia. This allowed for us to walk directly in and purchase our tickets versus waiting in an extremely long line. The hotel was close enough that we easily walked with our luggage from the train station. The sites were only a 10 minute walk away.The room was adequate, air conditioned, clean linens and clean washroom - just what we wanted as we were only there to sleep.The kids thought this was one of the best breakfasts on our tour - typical European - croissants, cereal, yoghurt and juice. Coffee is not what we have in North America but by the time we'd arrived here we were more than aclimatized to that!Value was great. Also check out the Pizzaria at the cross street immediately to the left, cross the street on the right. The best pizza we had and because it was far enough from the major attractions it did not cost us a fortune.Enjoy! We did!

<Content>Good stay! Myself and three friends had a two night stay in a room for four at the start of May. We were over for the Rangers V Fiorentina UEFA Cup Semi-Final and this hotel was ideal for us. We got a good room rate plus breakfast to go along with it. The hotel was in a good location which was just a 5 minute walk along from the train station. The rooms were in a decent condition and the staff were very friendly. Overall, we were happy with our stay!

<Content>Very nice and central The hotel was what I had expected from the reviews on this site. We booked a double superior direct with the hotel and this was a very good rate. We had a decent size room overlooking the roofs of Florence which was nice and quiet. The rooms were very clean with a fridge you can use and excellent air conditioning. The shower was a bit piddly but fine for our needs. Breakfast was standard fare and the location perfect for getting about. I highly recommend Za Za's for dinner in the Mercato Centraal (sic) - about a 5 min walk away.

<Content>Bad luck of mine? First of all , after looking at other reviews I had no doubt about going to this hotel. The price is very good, the recepcionists are very friendly and Helpful (Alessandra  Monika at least), but the sounds came from everywhere! we got the room number 1, very smal , witha new bathroom and facing the busy street with lotta noises lie the garbage bus coming just underneath the window 3 times per night! But really the worst thing of the number 1 room is that it is locates about 3 meters from the breakfast table. That means as you guessed that we woke up every morning at 7 a.m. with the forks and spons and laughs of the other tourists!I truly think that if I had stayed in another room it couls have reached 4 stars. SO STAY AWAY OF ROOM #1

<Content>Helped make Florence a great experience The Kursaal is in a great location within walking distance of the Santa Maria Novella train station and sites like the Duomo. (But be prepared for a laborious walk if you are coming from the train station with a lot of heavy luggage because the sidewalks on Via Nazionale are crowded and narrow.) The staff was very friendly and helpful with any questions and requests. I have seen 3 rooms there and all 3 had everything I would want from a hotel in Florence, including clean bathrooms with soap and shampoo for the shower. I was also impressed with the energy consciousness of the hotel. The key needs to be in a wall socket to be able to turn on the lights--this was a nice touch that I have not seen anywhere else.

<Content>Exceeded my expectations The hotel exceeded my expectations in terms of quality, cleanliness and customer service. The room was larger than I anticipated, and there was a full tub in the bathroom. Our room faced one of the streets, so there was some traffic noise that may be an issue to some people. It didn't bother me because I was exhausted at the end of each day from sight-seeing. I appreciated the friendliness of the hotel staff. I felt that the staff really cared that I enjoyed my stay. Every person that I talked to at the front desk spoke English well enough to answer all of my questions. They booked advanced tickets to the Accadamia for me, which helped cut down on the amount of time that I had to wait in line. I regret that I didn't take advantage of this for the Uffizi because I ended up waiting in line for 3 hours.Breakfast was included in the rate. They had juice, coffee, cereal, and some pastries. It was sufficient. Internet access was available in the lobby for a small fee.The hotel is about a 5 minute walk from the Accadamia, 10 minutes from the Duomo, and 15 minutes from the Uffizi/Ponte Vecchio. We were able to walk from the train station to the hotel in about 15 minutes. It was a little bit difficult navigating the small and crowded sidewalks with our luggage. I would stay here again if I visit Florence in the future.

<Content>Not quite what we expected, but decent. The rooms at Hotel Kursaal Ausonia were not quite what we expected, but they weren't horrible. The quad room is really one bedroom with a smaller separate sitting room. The second bed is actually a couch with a twin mattress pushed up next to it in the sitting room. I don't think it would be comfortable for 4 adults, unless you are on a really really tight budget and a couple of you don't mind being squashed together. Our relatives had a superior double room which they liked. The decor in the rooms I saw was really outdated, so don't necessarily expect a lot. The hotel is on a busy street with tiny sidewalks. It was somewhat of a challenge to maneuver around the street with luggage, but doable. To get to the hotel, just follow the directions on their website. We took the train to the Santa Maria Novella station and went out the entrance where platform 16 is located. You'll want to walk straight out from this exit. Keep going straight until you can't go straight any longer (You should come to a stoplight with buildings on the other side of the street). Cross the street at the stoplight and go right. You should walk past a McDonald's. Keep going up until you reach the first stoplight. This should be Via Nazionale. Take a left. The hotel is down a good ways, on the right-hand side. You should see the sign for the hotel. Overall, we enjoyed staying for a couple of nights at Hotel Kursaal Ausonia. The hotel is really convenient (within walking distance) to all of the attractions and the train station, and we were able to get a free upgrade by booking directly with the hotel. Make sure you check the specials on their website.

<Content>don't judge a book by it's cover Excellent hotel close to station, 10 minutes from Duomo and most galleries. Friendly staff who booked museums for us before we went. Appreciated luggage storage until room ready.We had room 10 on the 3rd floor, through doors from reception. It was a superior room (good internet deal meant same price as standard). It had a seperate sitting room which was good to collapse in after a tiring day. No view, overlooked street, but can't have everything, bathroom roomy and lovely, bed large and comfy. Breakfast good, standard Italian.Locality was fine, not posh or seedy, seemed safe enough.internet access fine, Hotel has a sitting room and bar not that we saw anyone use them.Clientel mixed - families, business people and general travellers.

<Content>Okay location and room We stayed at the Hotel Kursaal Ausonia for two days in April. We stayed in a superior double room. The hotel staff was very nice and accomodating. The hotel room was not as great though. The bed in the hotel was very hard, the toilet was leaking, the shower door was broken and the tv would not work often. The hotel also requires that you leave your keys at the front desk when you leave, which wouldn't be that bad, except that they key also accesses the only safe in the room. If you purchase breakfast with your stay, the meal is pretty decent. You get some breads with spreads, cereal, coffee, and juices. Overall, I would say that the hotel is in an okay location, but I wouldn't expect much in terms of comfort or amenities.

<Content>Great owners, service, location Just got back from our vacation in Italy in which we stayed three nights at this hotel. We paid 118 Euro a night for a double room in this hotel and were pleased. It's right down the block from the train station, which is very helpful for lugging your luggage. The room was fine. Nothing special, but it was clean, big enough for two and decent private bathroom. The breakfast was good - cake, bread, cereal, OJ and coffees. The owners and receptionists spoke English and were very, very nice and accommodating - helped us with directions and book reservations at museums, etc. Internet was one euro every 15 minutes. Location is not bustling - but it is close to everything. 10 minute walk to museum where the david is, 10 minute walk to duomo, 20 minute walk to uffizi and most other nice parts. we were very pleased.

<Content>deceptive from web pics We booked this on the internet and shopped around to get the lowest price.when we arrived it wasnt to far to walk from station, our room had a tiny bathroom and a shower head hung right above the loo,for 拢100 a night i felt sick, we complained immediatly and were told this was only a STANDARD room... we were offered a famiy room (just me and my husband) we looked at it first and the bathroom was better, i,e shower in a cubicle, it was more spacious but certainly not a family room and we had to pay an extra 拢15 a night.. i was worried that people could just walk from the street as the reception was on the 3rd floor. our room below that, on the 1st night we got back after a night out and went to the reception for our key, the man who hadnt seen us before just handed over the key.. we could of been anyone so we never gave it in after that, rooms were cleaned daily. breakfast was in a tiny room with hardly any room to move, that was a bit stressful so we went to a local cafe 8euros for 2 coffees and 2 croissants . the rooms are not as nice as the pictures, i was worried about security, and i think hotel over priced, but if your lucky not to get a little room it is ok as the location is perfect.

<Content>Ausonia - Perfect the hotel was a real surprise.the rooms are beautiful and quite big. the bathroom was wonderfull with also the bath tub.all was clean and perfect and they clean up the room all days.the staff is extremely friendly and the breckfast fantastic. the prices are low considering the hotel, especially if you go during the low season.is near the station (less than 5min) and near the centre of the city (less than 10min) and if you are lucky from your windows you can see the Duomo's cupola.Ausonia is an hidden gem in the beauty of florence.

<Content>Decent 3 star hotel This is a pretty basic 3 star hotel, it is well located near the main train station in central Florence and is on a busy road, so you鈥檇 be best to ask for a room that doesn鈥檛 face the street.I was a little disappointed at the room鈥檚 furnishings they look so much nicer on the website than in reality but those pictures must be the superior rooms as our double was a somewhat faded, tired version of this and the bathroom nowhere near as nice. However, the room was a good size, very clean and everything worked as it should so not much to complain about! The bed was 2 singles pushed together but it was comfortable, the only thing that was irritating was the door which was a little difficult to open and shut requiring some jiggling and pulling and it can鈥檛 have been only ours as the only thing that disrupted our sleep was the sound of other doors being pulled shut in the early hours.I鈥檓 sure I read somewhere that the internet is free in the hotel but it isn鈥檛, I think it was 鈧?.50 for 30 minutes on the lone computer they have in a little lounge, certainly we saw cheaper internet cafes dotted around the area.We thought the breakfast was pretty good as far as continental breakfasts go: a selection of cereals, breads (and a toaster 鈥?hurrah!), croissants as well as yoghurt, cake etc. Coffee is from a vending type machine but one that grinds the coffee fresh so it wasn't bad at all.

<Content>Great little place Good quality and value hotel. Rooms are clean and attractive for the price, and the bathrooms are very good. Breakfast buffet is value for money and good too! As it's near to the train station the area is just 'average' but it's a close walk to all the things you want to see so it's really not a problem. Overall, very good and would stay there again.

<Content>Not great, but good enough We had trouble finding the hotel at first due to Italy's crazy numbering system for addresses. In spite of what you see on on-line maps, the hotel is about half a mile from the train station (they could have said in their ad the name of the park that is a block up, that would have made life easier).The road the hotel was on was extremely busy, so we were lucky (I guess) to be on the back side of the building (which meant we got to hear locals being loud until all hours of the night. One thing that was really annoying was right when we got in we were informed that due to laws, they couldn't turn on the A/C until May 1, which meant leaving the window open (hence being annoyed by the locals). The pillows provided by the hotel were like sleeping on a folded-up cardboard box. The 2 extra pillows they provided didn't help. Thank goodness we brought some small (but fluffy) travel pillows. The room wasn't great, but it was enough. I wasn't in Italy to hang out in my room, but I felt every hotel I stayed in took advantage of that fact. The hotel was close enough to the historic city center that we were able to walk to everything we wanted to see.

<Content>Zero Stress! In January me and my girlfriend decided to take a 3 day (2 nights) trip to Florence, to which we had been only once before. From the moment we walked into the hotel I felt perfectly at home and welcome. The ambiance was very nice as the hotel was very decorated with carpets, paintings, and the colors were soothing. The people at the check in desk were very friendly and treated us with courtesy. Our room was simple but clean, and again not hotel like but more home like. The photos on their site were a little miss leading as they only showed their best rooms, so that was a little bit of a disappointment, but for the price (60 Euro a night for a double) it was well worth it. The windows offered no spectacular view, which we were not looking for, but did look on to a nice set of classic Florentine apartments. The breakfast was as in any other 3 star hotel, pretty regular but good. If I go back to Florence again I will definitely check back into Kursaal Ausonia.

<Content>Very nice place with very polite and helpful staff We stayed in the hotel for 2 nights. Our room was beautiful and spacious. Our bathroom was very large too. They had wireless internet which was very useful too. They had a large breakfast spread which saved us at least $10 per person per day! The hotel was very close to the station and the Accademia gallery. It also felt very safe walking back at night (we went on a trip to Pisa and came back to the hotel at midnight). The best part of the hotel stay was the excellent staff. They were very polite and very helpful. I would recommend this place to anyone!

<Author>kt123kt
<Content>very good value! booked a superior room. the room was a bit smaller than expected (but only because i had booked a superior room vs. standard room). we had views of local florence homes, but not of the duomo. in the end though, the room was more than sufficient for our needs. when we got to the room we were missing towels but a quick visit to the front desk fixed that. the front desk is mostly staffed by students, especially in the off-hours (evenings and early morning). but we found them to be very nice, accommodating, and very good with their english. breakfast was served from 7:30-10am. nothing hot was served - just your basic breakfast of breads  rolls, croissants, lots of spread (jams, butter, patte, nutella, etc), yogurt, cheese, and a couple of types of pastries. there's also two kinds of juice, a coffee /cappuccino/hot chocolate machine, and water. definitely not gourmet, but certainly more than enough to get you started in the morning. there's also wireless internet. the rate we paid for includes this option, but otherwise it's 15 euros for unlimited access during your entire stay (or 2 euros for 1 hour, and 3 euros for 2 hours - clearly the unlimited option is the better deal). unfortunately, there are times when the internet is not working properly. it seems like it's mostly during the late evening hours, but otherwise, for the occasional email checking, it was fine. if you need a dedicated and reliable internet access all the time, then this might be something to consider.one thing to note is that the front desk is on the third room with the rooms on either the second or third floor. the elevator is extremely small, just large enough for me and my rolling suitcase, and certainly not big enough for 2 people with lots of luggage. the location of the hotel is by far the best part - it's probably a 10-min walk to the train station, and it is close to a lot of nearby attractions. you can walk everywhere, and it felt safe walking around. given the price we paid (we used the prepay option), we would definitely stay here again.

<Content>A wonderful experience We only stayed for 2 nights (during the week before Easter), but we were treated with friendliness and courtesy from the time we first contacted the hotel to the time that we checked out. The kind and caring staff are definitely one of the hotel's main attractions. It was our first visit to Italy and so we opted for the 'walking tour' of Florence. Paola gave us an amazing tour, not just of the sights, but of the political and art history and how they shaped Florence. (Her English is excellent.) It was a lot to digest, but we found ourselves understanding the city much more throughly. And wishing that we had been able to stay longer. She also arranged for us to have a reserved time at the Uffizi Gallery, which saved us a lot of time in a line-up.The hotel is a very easy walk from the train station, and close to restaurants, markets, galleries, laundromats, and all of the sights. It is a funky hotel, with interesting hallways and alcoves and it is decorated with a colourful decor. The staff are all very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was very adequate and the room was a nice size. It was nice and clean, especially the bathroom. The bed was comfy enough and while the walls were a little thin, we only had one neighbour close by and we always fell asleep the minute our heads hit the pillow anyway. I liked how our room overlooked the homes of people who lived in Florence. It felt very natural. We have already recommended the Hotel Kursaal to a friend and will definitely stay there whenever we can get back to Italy again!

<Content>Value for money! For a budget traveler, this hotel offers a fantastic value for money.We stayed in a doubleroom (incl breakfast) and paid approx 68 euros for the room pr night.The hotel is a 3-4 min walk from the Santa Maria Novella train station, and 6-7 by foot from the Duomo. As Florence has a small and compact city centre I would say the location is very good.The hotel is rated as 3 star, hence you don't expect any luxury. The room is basic and clean, but the bathroom was very nice and with a bathtub - and could easily been placed in a 4star hotel. The bed was very firm, and walls also somewhat thin - but in my experience this is the case for most hotels, even 4 and 5 stars, so as always I used earplugs and had no problems.Breakfast was basic and served in a small common area - gives you the charming feeling of staying in something between a hotel and a bed and breakfast. The staff was nice and helpful whenever we needed help or advice.I will surely stay at this hotel the next time I visit this beautiful city.

<Content>OK hotel, with nice location This is a hotel were you get what you pay for: a good location, friendly staff, ok rooms, but terrible facilities and breakfast. All in all an OK hotel.I really need to start the day with a good breakfast, but the breakfast at this hotel was really, really bad. That is the main reason why I'm giving it 3/5, and the only international channel in the rooms was Eurosport, I think.But if you don't mind that, I would really recommend this hotel - nice and welcoming staff, and an almost perfect location.

<Content>perfect choice We are a couple from Budapest, Hungary.We loved to stay in this friendly, familiar and elegant hotel. It was renovated in 2007, so everything looked brand new.The staff (Paola and her husband the owners, and Monica the receptionist) were very nice and helpful.Our room was a superiour which means the Doumo view. It was very clean and we had enough space. When we arrived we could choose between 2 rooms and we chose what is on theire website (it's look like the same). Monica helped us to find the cheapest garage and she always was very nice and smily.Hotel's position is perfect to explore the city. Near the Duomo, the station and the old market. 10 minutes walk from Ponte Vecchio and Uffizi.Breakfast was good and a lot. They also have a very good coffee machine.We had lost our car's security key that's why we had to stay there one more night. They gave us reduced price for that night and they looked our problem as theire own! It was really good to see it! We have to say thank you again! :)To sum up, as a 3 star hotel this was the best choice for us!

<Content>cozy room great location good price This was our first trip to Florence so we wanted to be centrally located for our 2 day visit.Our room was about 2and 1/2 blocks from the train station. We wheeled our bags down the street with no problems. Early December is a low season for Florence so our room cost us around 100 dollars with tax. We were contacted by e-mail regarding any preferences or special requests and we asked to be booked for visiting the Uffizi Gallery and the Accademia gallery, this was convenient. The room was comfortable and quiet even though the street below was busy. The bathroom was impeccable, the bed good and the morning breakfast buffet was ample.There was a computer available at a small fee. the staircase and elevator were under repair during our stay and we had to lug our bags up to their 3rd floor entrance, but that should be completed by now. you may want to ask if stairs are challenging for you.  We loved our stay in Florence and would happily return to this hotel.

<Content>Great Price Stayed here from Dec 27-30 in a family room for EUR120 per night. Elevator and stairs were still undergoing repairs/maintenance while we were there which was annoying. Had to wait in the stairwell for 10 minutes before we could get to our room. Other than that, the stay was fine. Breakfast was typical Italian fair. Rooms were modestly decorated, the bathroom was very nice however. It was obviously newly renovated and had pretty mosaic tiles, a towel warmer and toiletries. Location is good if you want to be near the outside market and vendors. Rooms were a bit noisy because we were facing the street but surely you can request a room that isn't facing the street. One slight bother was that our room was not located on the same floor as the main office. You needed the room key to get through a security door that led to the hallway of rooms but you also needed the key in the room to turn the lights on. This is obviously a problem if you have a family with you as we did. People were often locked out and couldn't get to the room. Problem can be avoided if you aren't with a family.

<Content>Clean, cozy, centrally located, and extremely friendly staff We booked three rooms at this hotel for four nights, December 17 to 21, and enjoyed our stay immensely. The fact that the elevator and the stairs were undergoing an overhaul was only a minor inconvenience. In fact everything was finished on the day we left. The rooms were spacious, although simply furnished, and the beds were new and comfortable. The bathrooms were spotless. The hotel is well located for travelers arriving at the train station and is about a five minute brisk walk along a very crowded street with narrow sidewalks. Despite the proximity of the heavily traveled street, Via Nazionale, the double glazed windows keep all the sound out. Rooms in the front have a rather uninspiring view of the neon light of a sex shop but rooms in the back look out onto the beautiful Duomo and the Campanile, a ten minute walk away.The area around the hotel is multi-ethnic with several Chinese, Indian, Pakistani, even Kurdish shops and restaurants. There are many small restaurants, both Italian and Oriental, offering reasonable prices in what is a very expensive city. A meal for less than ten euros is not the exception.The neighborhood might look rather gray but is very safe for walking at night.The self-service breakfast is included and is perfectly adequate with unlimited coffee, croissants, bread, jams, and assorted cereals, even Muesly, which is not common in small hotels. There is a small lounge with beverages in a fridge sold at cost. Internet use is available and was free, perhaps because it was the low season. The best part of the hotel is the staff. Everyone speaks English and Paula, the feminine half of the couple owning and running the hotel, has native speaker fluency, having been trained as a tour guide. In fact the two owners, Paula and Jean Paulo, spend most of the day at the hotel attending to the guests. Both are knowledgeable of local culture and can help any tourist choose the best sites to visit. With the owners always eager to talk and help out, even sitting down to an afternoon snack with us, we felt like we were staying with a family and not in a hotel.

<Content>Highly recommended My friend and I booked the hotel over the internet and, after having a bad experience in a hotel in London a few months before, were very scared of having a similar experience. However, our experience was very positive. From the outset, on making the booking, a staff member emailed me to advise me that the lift was being refurbished and that we could cancel if this was a problem. I appreciated the honesty shown and the refurbishment was not a nuisance at all - no noise and was no problem to walk up the stairs.The location of the hotel is excellent, right in the heart of the city and just a few minutes walk from the major sights. The staff were all very courteous and friendly, and very willing to provide us with information and assistance when asked. The hotel room was very comfortable and clean. The hotel itself has a very homely feel to it. The breakfast was great as there was a lot of choice - croissants, yoghurt, cereal, cake etc....the Italians don't have cooked breakfasts.All in all, i would highy recommend the hotel. The prices are very reasonable, especially if you book directly with the hotel, and I'm sure you won't be disappointed, with the city or with the hotel. Enjoy!

<Content>Value for Money Hotel This is a nice clean 2star hotel in the middle of the city, nothing fancy. Stayed there for 6 nights. Positive aspects are very friendly staff, wireless internet and 10 minutes to most destination of interest. Minor comments are the lift is broken and the air conditionning unit is noisy. I am happy to have stayed there.

When you arrive at the hotel the first impression is not that good as there are work in progress to change the lift but than all my expectation were satisfied. You find the reception on the 3rd floor and the first thing that makes you feel home is the hearty welcome of the staff. They are also always ready to help with anything you might need, city information, museums reservations, suggestions on restaurants and so on...Not to talk about my beautiful room, it had balcony with a beautiful view on Firenze and absolutely clean and comfortable. Breakfast was the best I've ever had and I kind of felt it was like a really sweet moment as you can share a large table with other guest and make new friends. Hotel Kursaal Ausonia is the best choice!!!

<Content>What a dump! Having read some of the recent reviews on here offering glowing reports, I really wondered if I had come to the right hotel when we turned up at Hotel Kursaal Ausonia.On arrival the entrance was dirty and full of building materials, bags of cement and rubbish. We were warned that the lift would be renovated during our stay (not that we actually saw any work being done - just the debris of it all around the entrance hall), however nothing really prepared us for the dark dingy dirty climb up three flights of stairs to find the reception. We were placed on the second floor with a credit card style key to let us onto the second floor and into our room. We were not the only guests who constantly could not access the floor because the key system didn't appear to work properly. Our room safe also worked using this key system and we had to get someone from reception to get that working for us too.The room was spacious and clean, but that is where my praise ends and the only reason I've given two stars rather than one. The beds were solid, the bathroom was in fact a tiny room with a shower and we only had cold water - great when bringing a four year old with you. When I mentioned this I was told not to worry!!! We had hardly any water pressure and the bathroom constantly smelt of bad drains. I'm not quite sure what I got as extra for booking a Superior room - I really can't see how the room could have been any further stripped back to make it a standard room.As for the breakfast, it consisted of stale cakes or bread and the most revolting coffee I have ever tasted - what a crime to serve poor coffee in Italy!!Would I return to Florence? Yes - its a lovely place. Would I return to Hotel Kursaal Ausoinia? Not if you paid me!

<Content>Excellent Staff assistance We used a Travel Booth in Venice to book accommodation in Florence at the last moment. What a suprise. The location was very easy to find walking distance from the Train station. The rooms very clean, breakfast room appealing. The help given by the staff re tours etc and just general enquiries was excellent. We would highly recommend this hotel. the general feeling was very comfortable, with good security. Walking distance to most attractions.

<Content>Friendly Hotel in Florence This was my first trip to Florence. My niece stayed at Hotel Kursaal and recommended it to me. After researching a lot of hotels, I decided to stay there also. I checked in on October 1 and left on Oct. 6. My room was very clean, spacious, and cozy. Had planned to leave earlier but was so comfortable that I stayed longer. Location is near the train depot, and I could walk to museums and the other interesting sights in Florence...didn't need a taxi. The breakfast was delicious and there was a variety of items for anyone's taste. The breakfast room was most charming and enjoyed starting my day there. Everyone at Kursaal was friendly and helpful, and believe me I asked a lot of questions! Monika answered many questions via Email before I even arrived, which was very helpful for me during the planning stages of my trip! The staff also helped me find restaurants and my way around the city. I want to especially thank Monika, Paola, Giovanpaolo, and Alessandra for all their assistance and friendly smiles. Everyone works very hard to run the hotel and keep it neat and functioning smoothly. Also, the night staff was sweet as can be although I don't know all their names. Kursaal made me feel at home in a foreign city. It was a perfect introduction to Florence and Italy which helped to make my stay there most memorable. Thanks Hotel Kursaal Ausonia for Everything!

<Content>Great Boutique Hotel! Our room was quite spacious, though the bathroom was a bit small it was fine for our needs. The only thing I didn't like was the hair drier was a hose-like contraption, sort of like a reverse vacuum cleaner! Otherwise, the staff was extremely friendly and helped us quite a bit with reservations and such. It was located on a busy street, but our room was very quiet once the double-paned windows were closed. The air conditioning was a plus, too. And, they even had complimentary toiletries in the bathroom, which is quite rare in Europe. Their breakfast was the best I had in the ten days and three countries I visited during this trip.

<Content>Great staff, convenient location We have just returned from three days at the Hotel Kursaal  Ausonia. It is very convenient to the train station and to Mercato San Lorenzo. The breakfast in the morning is good and started our days off well. The staff at the hotel made our stay that much better, answering questions, giving directions, etc. We did have trouble gaining an outside telephone line, but the staff allowed us to use the desk cordless phone in our room, solving the problem.

<Content>Nice Hotel This is a nice little hotel. The staff were friendly and helpful. They spoke fluent English which was very helpful. The room we stayed in was clean and cozy. The noise level was controlled by having multiple windows which kept the street noise to a minimum (I was impressed by that). I would go back to this hotel.

<Content>Not impressed We paid 鈧?15 per night for one of the superior room. I have to say we are quite disappointed. The location is the best thing about this hotel. The room is quite big for stadndard Italian hotel. But, the hotel looks stain, all the furnitures and decoration (in the room) are old and out of date. There are quite some stains on the wall, looked like people killed some insects. The bathroom has strong smell of bleach. I think the maid never bother to clean the side table (I can see the dust) and the mat in the bathroom (I cannot recognize the color). The bedding look and feel fine. The worst thing is that both of us are bit by some insects with few big lumps. The wall is very thin; we can hear everything from the room beside. The smell of the room is not pleasant, just like you walk in an old, old building. We have no problem with the staff, they are very friendly.I am not a complainer becuase I believe you got what you paid for. But, for 鈧?15 a night, the hotel is over-charged. We have been travelled around Italy for few weeks, unfortunately this is the best hotel we ever stayed.

<Content>Great location and helpful staff We stayed at the hotel twice in a week. First time the room was a little run down but with a great view of the duomo. Second time our room was much better with new modern bathroom etc. The hotels location is superb, very central and right next to the market. Staff was friendly and helpful, and breakfast standard italian (a little boring but great coffee). Cheap WIFI (鈧? for 24h). Great value for money - would definately stay there again.

I loved how they welcomed us in the hotel and how nice they were. Breakfast is fresh and well served.There is free internet access for guests. I suggest kursaal to everyone, it's cheap and very comfortable.

<Content>charming bedrooms The reception is located on the fifth floor and the hotel does not have a huge visibility from the street. Nevertheless, its location is good to visit Florence; the hotel is clean, the staff is welcoming and helpful for reservations and advice. The rustic bedrooms and corridors are absolutely charming. A great choice for a reasonable price.

<Content>Hotel is Just OK, but Staff Very Helpful This was a clean, basic hotel but I do have to give kudos to the staff. They were very helpful and friendly. I see many other reviewers gave the hotel five stars and although I don't have any complaints about the room, I would rate the facilities as so-so. We really appreciated the patience and helpfulness of the staff though. They were nice enough to give us detailed directions on how to get to the sites nearby. Also the staff was helpful in giving us directions on getting to Pisa without using the toll road the next morning. We continually agonized in Italy over whether to take the toll roads - which were generally good roads but frequently we were stuck in lengthy traffic jams trying to pay our toll to get off - or whether to take the free roads. We were afraid the free roads may be in bad shape and require very slow going. So we appreciated the front desk clerk's advice to take the free FiPiLi road. As for the room, I would rate it as slightly above average for the rate. Not memorable but nothing wrong with it. The breakfast attendant was pleasant and polite and the breakfast itself was OK but again nothing special.

<Content>A real boutique hotel The hotel was very close to the main train station with duomo very close. The area was safe and hotel quite clean and fancy. The wall paintings, fixtures and everything was very retro and at the same time took you back in florence history. The room/bathroom was not only clean but very charming and colorful. We just loved this place. breakfast was included, desk staff was very helpful, i think couple of owners are always there. This was a 2 star hotel in price and 4 star otherwise. A great find !!

It was quiet, clean, the AC worked very well  it was convenient walking distance from all the important sights as well as restaurants. The staff went the extra length to see that all our needs were met. Would definitely stay there again.

<Content>one of the best choice in Florence (I'm sorry about my broken English.)The hotel is very clean and beautiful. The hotel staff are very kind.Because we have to go out earlier,they prepared the breakfast earlier than usual time.We stayed in double bedroom.We were glad to be able to see the Domo from the room.We think girls are favor for this hotel.The price is cheaper than others.But the location is far from the center (like the Domo etc).We had to walk the almost empty street to come back to the hotel.It is better to hear the recommended street to come back safely,or to come back earlier time before the sun sets.

<Content>Best deal in Florence Kursaal Ausonia had terrific rates, so I was surprised by how new, clean, and centrally-located it was. The building was built after the area was bombed in WWII, and was totally redone a year or two ago by the owner. She is a tour guide, and she and her kind staff shared helpful advice with us (for instance, go to see the beautiful Fra Angelico frescos at San Marco, a peaceful monastery which is refreshingly undercrowded in high season). The breakfast was good and our room had an excellent air conditioner and a fridge. ALL of the sights of downtown Florence are in walking distance.

<Content>Great service, great price! Hotel Kursaal, simply put, exceeded my expectations. I stayed there with two friends for a month-long trek through Europe, so cost was at the forefront of our minds. I believe we got the room for around $50 per person per night for a triple.The location is excellent - it's within a five minute walk from the train station, and within 15 minute walking distance (or less) to the majority of places like the Duomo, Uffizi, David, etc. - though, of course, Florence is such a small city and cabs reasonably cheap that you don't need to worry that much about where your hotel is, but still, it was convenient.They offer a continental breakfast and, unlike other places I have stayed at, actually live up to the name. Their comfortable dining room offers all you can eat, and they have all manner of food, coffee, tea, and juice that you want.But far and away the best part was the staff. The ladies at the reception were *extremely* helpful [and, may I say, extremely attractive? =c)]. We wanted to book a wine tour, and they took care of the entire ordeal; even when the first few leads they found were unavailable, they made extra effort. Then, when a hitchup occurred after one of the tours, they were able to contact the company and translate for us in resolving the dispute. They went above and beyond, and I would gladly stay here again if I return to Florence. Great job, guys!

And our room had a little balcony with a view of the Duomo (and various back gardens), and the bath had a casement window with inner and outer shutters. Walking distance to everything you come to see (very close to Mercato Centrale and Santa Maria Novella station).

<Content>Avoid until the place ceases to be a building site. Clearly a danger to be putting anyone in this place until they finish their modernisation programme:1. dark and dingy entrance full of cement bags, litter and general dirt.2. dodgy, tiny lift which wasn't working half the time., meant you had to walk up 3 flights of stairs.3. painters, joiners, workmen everywhere.4. bare electrical wires hanging out of walls.5. floors being cemented meant you were walking on a permanently wet floor, trailling dirt into your room.6. no actual reception area, merely a desk and chair.7. breakfast area - a bench covered in thick dust. breakfast was no better - no butter, no tea (only herbal), no milk.8. only 3 other residents in the hotel as the others had been moved to another hotel on the grounds of safety.The staff were very apologetic and did move us to another hotel, but the first night of our trip was ruined. They also said that work was behind schedule hence the mess.I'm sure it will be fine when work is finished but to have people staying here when this is going on is highly irresponsible and quite frankly dangerous.

<Content>There are better hotels for arround the same rate in the area I stayed at this hotel 5 years ago in a simple single room. My room was great clean and the service was wonderful.This year I went with my mother. I wanted a twin room and I thought since I was going with my mom and for a few euros more I would go for what they call the superior room. The reservations were made online.The next day or a few days after ( I cant recall) I got a confirmation of my reservation from the hotel and it also said that they will be charging my credit card for one night a week before my arrival due to the new italian bank laws. I DID NOT LIKE THAT! (and this was the only hotel that did it in Italy on my trip)When my mom and I finally got to the hotel (to my surprise) things have changed since I was last there. The hotel stunk!!! i mean really smelled. The bed was squeeky. The bathroom was redone ( but that was no help). My mom cryed the whole night.In the morning I was able to find a hotel arround the corner for a few euros more and it was much better, and hotel ausonia was nice enough not to charge us the second night.Our

<Content>Wonderful place to stay We stayed at the Hotel Kursaal Ausonia in May and really enjoyed our stay. The hotel is an easy walk from the train station, but beware, the small sidewalks make towing your luggage a bit of a pain. Also, the sign for the hotel is fairly small and the lobby is on the second floor, so you have to keep an eye open for it. The people who run the hotel are extremely nice and speak excellent English. While in the lobby we overheard a guest trying to extend their stay. Unfortunately there were no rooms available, but the hotel staff seemed more than happy to call around and find them another hotel. Our room was actually really big by American standards much less European standards. My only complaint would be that the bed was a little too soft and squeaky. Walking to all the major tourist destinations are a breeze from this hotel. We would definitely stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Good Budget Weekend Getaway Fairly basic but no problems. We had a double room with a bathroom which was clean and comfortable with ac and fine for the weekend. The location is excellent, with loads of restaurants, the train station and all the sites within walking distance. Staff are helpful if you ask them although they did tell us the door would be open twenty four hours but we ended up having to climb the doors to get in. Breakfast was a couple of rolls with some spreads and a croissant in a packet. If you're looking for somewhere reasonably priced to use as a base to see Florence we'd recommend it.

<Content>Great Bathroom We stayed here for 4 nights in July as part of an extended holiday in Italy. The location was excellent - a short 5 min walk from the central train station. There was a lift at the door to get up to reception  our room which was a godsend with our bags. Reception took us and showed us our room prior to checking in to ensure we were OK with what they were providing (not all operators do this we found). The room we were in had recently been refurbished and we had no complaints whatsoever, the bathroom was marble with a full size bath, the furnishings were tasteful and we even had a small balcony that provided limited views of the Duomo. The hotel is also a short walk to the markets of Florence. There was also an internet terminal available for use of guests at a relatively cheap price.

<Content>Cosy place with a good location I was backpacking in August 2006 and just could not find a place to stay in Florence. I booked this hotel through a hotel reservation agency at the train station when I got there. I paid 60EUR for the single bed room that included a small TV, a phone, and remote control AC. The hotel is about 5-10 min walk from the train station and 5-10 min walk from Duomo. The room was very clean. The breakfast was quite nice. The staff was very friendly and helpful. One thing I did not like about the room is that there was no shower curtain so the bathroom got wet easily. I would definately stay here again.

<Content>Excellent! I originally booked for a shared bathroom room lacking a/c but as we arrived in Florence to severe heat we upgraded to a private ensuite room with a/c for very little extra cost! Infact the rate quoted at the hotel was cheaper than that quoted on the net a few months previous. Maybe we got lucky. Anyway this review is for what the hotel calls a 'superior double room'. - Amazing - huge bed, great bathroom, private remote controlled a/c which we had the ability to control (rare in lower star hotels), good reception staff, always helpful and spoke good english, good breakfast, good facilities (internet, ability to buy drinks, maps, info, leaflets, timetables etc) and a convenient position. Situated on the second floor of a building this hotel does have a liftHotel did lack hot water however, but this in itself isnt so badoverall a thoroughly great hotel.

<Content>Clean, Friendly Atmosphere Date: June 24, 2006Reviewer: Trip Advisor Reader, Toledo, Ohio, USAMy daughter and I made our first trip to Florence. Our stay at the Hotel Kursaal proved to be a good choice, which we made by reading the Trip Advisor. Alexandria was most helpful to us with restaurant recommendations and clear maps and directions. The rooms were very basic, but clean and satisfactory. The only thing to complain about was the AC unit; was not very effective and and the heat in the city was immense - 98F the day we left. The hotel is very near the Duomo, Uffizzi Gallery and train station; walking distance to all. The price is definitely right, with savings by booking on the internet. I would stay again in this hotel and look forward to my next trip to Firenze.

<Content>Friendly and helpful staff Ausonia is satisfactory for the budget traveller. The location is good, close to the main train and bus stations, restaurants, shopping and sightseeing. The rooms are basic and clean. The shared bathroom was clean although the open shower could do with a cubicle as the floor tends to get wet. Breakfast is plentiful and enjoyed on nicely laid tables. The coffee and juices are exceptionally good. The staff are very courteous, friendly, helpful, knowledgeable and will assist with information and advice. They freely arrange to book tickets for guests to the Academia and Ufizzi galleries. We would recommend staying at Kursaal/Ausonia as the staff are absolutely wonderful people and most obliging!!

<Content>Cosy, Clean and Friendly in the Center of Florence I just got back from Florence where I had a great holiday and spent a lot of money, not on the hotel, though. I stayed for one week at this hotel, and I loved it. I had a single room with a small but cosy bathroom, very clean everywhere and very relaxed atmosphere. The breakfast was fine, God I miss that coffee! But the best of all are its people, very friendly and attentive to the needs of their guests. I felt like home.If I were going to Florence again, I would definitely try to book the same hotel. The hotel is also cheap, so I would rather use the extra money on some fashionable clothes, shoes, olive oil, wine or gold.

<Content>Kursaal - Alright... Kursaal was OK. The staff were good and the rooms clean. You did have to leave your room key when you left the Hotel though, not something im fond of. Breakfast was a set amount of items. The one down side were the bathrooms. One without a door curtain, so you could see straight in. NOT COOL! Sometimes the Hotel guests would also leave the toilet in a terrible state, which didnt get cleaned unless you did it yourself! NOT COOL! Some ventilation was also necessary for those rooms. Close to the station on Via Nazionale, only a 10 minute walk from the station.

<Content>Loved the Hotel Kursaal/Ausonia My husband is a professor who has assisted and directed 4 trips to Europe of a month's duration. We take about 5 faculty and 45 university students each time. (Our students live by a high code of standards that bars smoking, drinking and any 'party' behavior, with a curfew of 11pm.) We spend the first 10 days of each trip in Italy and have now tried four different places in Florence and the Hotel Kursal was by far the best experience for us. It is run by a family who were very thoughtful and attentive as we checked our large numbers into and out of the hotel. At breakfast each morning they would offer to bring hot chocolate or other items to us as we sat. The breakfast bar was plentiful and excellent in consideration of the affordability of the room rate and what we were used to elsewhere. Our room even had a charming courtyard view below with the Duomo itself in the background. We were an easy 6 block walk from the Duomo, with laundry, grocery, internet, good food take out places, and a park only steps from the hotel.I can't say enough good about the family who runs the establishment, with the added bonus being a complimentary 3 hour guided walking tour of the old city by Paola, the co-owner. This was our fourth trip to Florence and everything she shared was interesting and insightful. Arragements are also made on behalf of guests for tickets to the Academia (The David) and The Uffizi. Paola conducts tours to the Uffizi, if desired, and not knowing that beforehand, we regretfully missed that chance. Based on her knowledge and love of art, history, and architecture I would plan her accompaniment to the Uffizi on another visit.

<Content>Not bad.. We stayed here for 2 nights at the end of May, we paid 鈧?0 per night for a double room with a shared bathroom, breakfast included. It felt more like a hostel than a hotel, the breakfast is served in a common room in front of the reception, and the rooms are very basic, and with a tiled floor, and sink and bidet in the room, it gave the room a kind of a hospital feel to it. The shared bathrooms were relatively clean, but a little bit run down looking. We had to ask for towels, which were paper thin, as were most towels in other places we stayed in Italy. The breakfast was cereal, juice, croissant, coffee, biscuits. The staff were pleasant and helpful, and spoke good english. The hotel is about 10 mins walk from the duomo but not in the nicest area of the city. There are much nicer areas to stay in the city but are no doubt more expensive too. The street where the hotel is isn't actually bad but there are side streets near the hotel that didn't look very safe at night. During the day, though, there is a huge market very close to the hotel which was brilliant. Also, everywhere we wanted to see in Florence was within walking distance of the hotel. There are probably a lot nicer places to stay in Florence, but for the price of the room, this wasn't bad value. It'd suit anyone on a budget just looking for somewhere with bed and breakfast.

<Content>Very good, and cheap, hotel in Florence, Italy - Kursaal Ausonia Hotel The Kursaal Ausonia Hotel in Florence, Italy is an excellent choice for the cost.For $70 euros per night, we obtained a comfortably sized, clean double room that was situated in a quiet neighborhood yet within easy walking distance of tourist sites. The room included a nicely outfitted bathroom and a large balcony. The balcony looked out on an attractive courtyard, had a handy clothes-line, and included a partial view of the historic Duomo. A good breakfast (croissants, yogurts, toast, butter, jams, juice and cafes) was included in the room cost. The staff and owner were very friendly, fluent in english, and quite helpful in assisting us navigate Florence and in recommending places to see and dine. One drawback - the lift is small and it is challenging to fit in more than one person and luggage. Overall, however, an attractive and great value hotel!

<Content>Satisfying European style The Kursaal is a nice European hotel. Located very close to the train station made it quick to find after an overnight train ride to the city. However, it is in a major tourist hub of town (not a negative mark to the hotel - just a fact), so it's surrounded by other hotels and tourist class restaurants. But, it was in a safe area (we came home late several nights and never felt unsafe) and Florence is so small that it wasn't inconvenient to get to the areas of town where we spent most of our time. We had one of the lovely superior rooms (with private bath) overlooking the courtyard. Very quiet in the evening (the community center out back closes around 10 pm so noise wasn't an issue at night). Room was simple, but very clean and well kept.Hotel noise is a problem as the walls are very thin. However any good traveller always carries ear plugs not knowing where you may have to sleep or what unexpected noise you might incur. So, once my earplugs were in, I didn't hear any noise from down the hall.Continental breakfast was just fair. I recommend getting your food on the outside. Italians don't do breakfast, but you are in Italy and hitting a cafe in the morning is a must.Staff was very helpful and friendly. I think we saw them all during the course of our stay. Everyone always had a smile and were helpful when we had questions.Great hotel if you are on a budget and want a solid, safe place to stay.
