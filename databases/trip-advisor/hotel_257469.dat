<Content>It's OK but not great The building makes it different to other hotels but in places it's a bit shabby. The blinds on the windows were falling apart, the mini bar door handle fell off, a door didn't fit quite right, the shower tiles were a bit stained.Meanwhile the location isn't great, Woollomolloo is better than it was a few years ago but it is out of the CBD and not the first choice place to be.But the staff are friendly - it's just not really in the same league as the other 5 stars like the four seasons or the marriott.

<Content>Good Hotel But Check Your Bill Stayed two nights in a loft apartment. About average for Sydney prices but well located on a wharf into the harbour and walking distance to the city.Warning. Check your bill; we were charged for breakfast and the use of the bar. After contacting the hotel they did refund the breakfast, but failed to credit the bar which we had not used.As a traveller with a daughter in the area we ate opposite for half the price at Charlies and purchased water there for $3. Be warned, check your account.

<Content>No Blues at the Blue Have just spent 3 wonderful nights at the Blue. My daughter and husband surprised me with a quick trip to Sydney and 3 nights at the Blue Hotel. From the moment we left the taxi to check out we were amazed at the service. Very friendly and ever so quick checkin and a guided tour of our loft room and we were settled in. We didn't want to leave our room for the obligatory sightseeing. We were way too cosy and yes we were on the wrong side of the hotel. Not an issue, loved watching the crowds eating at Harry's Cafe and just generally people watching. Loved the opening windows and subsequent breeze through the room. Bed one of the comfiest I have slept in and the pillows the best I have ever encountered. As mentioned by previous reviewers the Water Bar is fabulous and the cocktails brilliant. Loved the candles throughout and the most amazing view one gets when coming down in the glass walled lifts in the evening. Breakfast each morning was great and once again the staff shone out. If I had to complain about anything it would perhaps be housekeeping which is a little spasmodic. Coffee Plungers left dirty, facewashers not replaced, sugars and teas not replaced. I know they are minor issues but really shouldn;t occur in a 5 star hotel. That aside we had a brilliant weekend at the Blue and would definitely be returning when next in Sydney

<Content>Neat Hotel off the beaten path I finally got a chance to stay at this hotel. I have so many friends from the Sydney area and they always talk about it. It has a lot of history.I liked the way the developer have tried to keep the some or the historic items of the wharf when they converted it to a hotel. We had the old exposed beams running across our room and the old conveyor belt was outside our door. Added to these items were all the modern amenities that are needed in a five star hotel.We did have some issues with trying to get meals and coffee throughout the day. I could never understand when the restaurants was going to be open our closed. There are a number of other pubs, cafes and restaurants in the area.We used Blue as our base to visit the tourist areas of Sydney. It was a nice walk to get to the CBD, Opera house and the Bridge. I was a little worried on the first night when the staff didn't recommend that we walk in the area of the hotel at night. It had me a little apprehensive, but everything is also a close taxi ride.The staff are good, but there are not many of them around. I travel a lot in Asia so I am a bit spoiled for five star hotel staff attention.

<Content>I keep coming back I've stayed at BLUE four times now - three for business and once on a weekend away with my wife and daughter. Every time I've been treated well and looked after by attentive staff. The trip with my family saw us in one of their best rooms which suited us very well.On two of my business trips, the hotel has upgraded me to a better room, which has been very nice.The only minor issues I've had is that the blinds tend to be a little worn and uneven when you raise and lower them and on one visit, the room wasn't as thoroughly cleaned as I'd like - still clean, but not to the standard I've seen before.As a business hotel, it's a little out of the city, but worth it for the better facilities at what is usually a really good price - looking on Wotif or HotelClub will usually get you a great rate. The concierge advised me last visit to call the hotel and quote the Wotif price in order to get an even better deal.

<Content>Different Experience After reading mixed reviews I still thought I would give this hotel a go as they had an excellent price on wotif. I enjoyed the brief walk from the city to the hotel. I found the hotel design very unique. Check in staff were excellent and unusually helpful. The reception and entrance were dark but not sterile. My room (501) was excellent - clean, a good size and in good condition. The 'mini bar' was an amazing offering - but very expensive. The main bar looked fantastic and the servive was excellent. However this was almost deserted - in fact during my visit it almost felt like I was one of a dozen staying at the hotel. If I got a great rate again I would definately stay here again. Much better than your normal boring executive room box you get in the central city area. Oh - and did I mention the down bedding!

<Content>Amazing!!! My boyfriend and I just returned from a little trip to Sydney and what a fabulous experience it was! From beginning to end the staff and the hotel itself impressed us greatly.Stepping out of the taxi we were warmly greeted by the bellboys who took our luggage and waited at the the bottom of the lobby stairs for us to check-in. They took us up to our room and the young man was delightful! The girl at the reception was warm and friendly and answered all our questions about nearby retaurants. The concierge then organised our tickets for a ballet at the Opera House. And had them delivered to our door within a few hours of asking them to make the booking. Extremely keen to help even with all our questions, they were fantastic and patient!The array of restaurants, may I add, is fantastic! And, I strongly recommend visiting the Water Bar for some brilliant cocktails!!We stayed in one of the Pier King rooms, which faces the naval base area. Although I was a bit hesitant with the view when booking, I was very impressed! The bed and pillows were amazingly comfortable, I don't think I've had a better night's sleep!Overall, the staff and the hotel were perfect and I would highly recommend staying there to any of my family and friends.

<Content>Kinda souless 5 star hotels, in my opinion, are meant not only to provide you with evertything you need for comfort and convienience but to involke a sense of luxury and indulgence.Blue seemes to have everything but maybe its the vast space of the building, the decoration or the fact that thing are a bit worn on close inspection but this didnt really cut it for me. There was dust on the pictures, bath tiles were scruffy, tap was wobbly, hot water took ages to heat up, mini bar very over priced.Staff were friendly, room service ladies actually made it for me they wre so jolly and wonderful. The food was pretty average though. Location ok if you want the walk.Out of 10 against other 5 stars Ive stayed in Id give it a 7 and no I wouldnt stay there again.

<Content>5 Star hotel???? I dont think so! Firstly let me start by saying how terribly disappointed I was the Blue Hotel. I have just returned to Melbourne after spending two nights at Blue. How on earth they have managed to classify themselves as a 5 star hotel is completely beyond me - perhaps back in the day when the hotel first opened - but in this day and age 5 star they certaintly are not.The official website even boasts about the award they won in 2005!! Its not 2005 anymore its now 2008 move on!!I made my booking 3 weeks prior to our stay and because May is classified as low season I really didnt expect to have any problems.The day prior to arriving I called the hotel to double check my booking - they had no record on the computer of my reservation - the girl I spoke to went out the back to look through the paperwork and sure enough there was my reservation which had been forgotten about (in her words). The next day when I arrived with my partner we were greeted at the front desk by a girl who was not only dressed very badly but had no idea what she was doing. We were given a key to the third floor and on arrival found out that it defiantly was not the room I had booked. We went back downstairs to tell the girl at front reception who was very confused. She then attempted to find the room I had booked and got it wrong again!! After the third try we finally got our room.How disappointing - the room was anything but 5 star luxury as is described by many websites. There were scuffs all over the walls, paint chipping off corners, scuffs on the down stairs mirror and the furniture was looking a little worse for wear. There were blue faux fur cushions on the couch that were old and matted while on our bed lay an old, pilled electric blue arcylic blanket. The paint job in the main room and the bathroom looked very cheap. But perhaps the worst thing about the hotel is on the 5th floor where the ceiling is very low as you walk up (or down) two steps into the alcove before your rooms front door. My partner who is 6ft tall was walking out the front door - the alcove has no lighting (this only comes on later at night) - he began to walk down the steps and did not see the low bearing ceiling - he hit this so hard he landed on his back on the steps with a big gash to his head. The next day he also had a very sore neck. We went downstair to tell the girl at the front desk and all she could say was oh!!!! oops!!!! There are no signs anywhere to warn tall people to look out for the low ceilings and low beams. If this had been an older person then they may have done some serious damage to themselves.I would not recommend anyone I know to stay at the Blue Hotel

<Content>Great Experience After a very long over night flight we arrived at the hotel utterly exhausted at 8 in the morning. To our great relief the room was ready for us and the reception clerk was very nice  helpful with ideas of where to eat and what to do in the area. The bellman was there to help with the bags and made sure we had a taxi when needed.Our room was modern with enough room to move around. The beds were very comfortable -- the best we encountered on our trip. Also a good-sized TV and club chair + table with a view of the wharf and street. It was clean and well maintained. The windows kept the street noise out even though we were facing the wharf/street. We did occasionally hear some of the other guest鈥檚 doors closing in the hallway. The bathroom had a nice aesthetic, but the sink was definitely more form than function. The shower was good and the tub was large and comfortable. Excellent counter space and storage.The area had a solid choice of restaurants close by. We liked Charlie's across the street for breakfast; for dinner, take a 10 minute walk up the steps to the Potts Point area, we found several good restaurants there -- much more reasonably priced than those right next to the hotel on the wharf.Very positive experience, would highly recommend.

<Content>great hotel Stayed in this hotel for 2 nights at the start of a holiday visiting friends living in Sydney, and loved every minute. After battling through the rain from the airport, we had a warm welcome from all the reception staff, and fantastic service in the bar where the mixologist recommended cocktails...just the thing to help us get over to sleep after a long flight!The rooms are very comfortable and the view made the long flight from London fade into distant memory! The location was great too...didn't feel like being in the city but only a short walk through the botanic gardens to the opera house! Much nicer than the CBD.Would recommend the restaurants on the wharf for a treat...where the service is friendly, and you can get there without getting your hair wet! The only negatives...the weather - wettest for over 10 years!!

<Content>Brilliant Blue!! My partner and I spent the last 2 nights (22 and 23 January 2008) of our month in Oz at Blue - and it was a brilliant stay! Check in was easy and attentive - indeed all of the hotel staff, from housekeeping to reception to concierge to bar staff - were all very friendly, attentive and professional.The hotel is built into the largest timber building in the world and our room - with a view of the city skyline - was excellent; one of the best beds that we have slept in in a long time. Modern decor, clean bathroom with both separate bath and large shower; good amenities. We thought that the condoms and lubricant were a neat touch!The hotel has no formal restaurant, which is a surprise at first, but when you see the immense selection of excellent restaurants (and bars) that line the west side of the hotel it is clear that any restaurant inside would be entirely superfluous! And inside, the space has more usefully been used to accommodate one of Sydney's best bars, the Water Bar. It makes excellent Tanquery 10 Dry Martinis and has a decent selection of champagnes.Breakfast is served until 11 am (which we never had time to sample) but the menu looked great.The location of the hotel was a great pleasure - after spending a previous week in the intensity of the CBD, Blue's location in Woolamooloo was absolutely perfect; not an emergency siren was heard during our complete stay! Taxis are always available outside the door of the hotel and it is a very short trip to the CBD, Kings Cross, or Oxford Street area.We will be back at Blue next time we are in Sydney, for sure!

<Content>Great hotel, excellent service Stayed in a King Duplex room for 4 nights and couldn't have wished for a better start to our holiday in Australia. Check in was efficient with staff very helpful. The room was great: large living area with a spectacular view towards the city, and a mezzanine bedroom with a very comfortable bed. Both the bedroom and the living areas had flat panel TV screens. The bathroom was next to the bedroom with an extra WC on the lower floor.Walking off the jetlag was easy given the BLUE's location in Wolloomooloo: it's a short walk to the botanical gardens and the Opera House and very quick to trot up to the Art Gallery of New South Wales (well worth a visit). The wharf location of the hotel is replete with Sydney's best (if rather expensive) restaurants (Aki's Indian was some of the best Indian food we've ever had) and there are plenty of other choices in the immediate area.The bar in the BLUE opens from 4pm and is more focused on cocktails and wine than beer, which suited us fine. Clientele were a mix of those staying at the hotel and business types, and prices were high but the cocktails (I recommend the Emburey Martini) great. The bar also has a tapas-style menu -- again, prices are not cheap but the quality and quantity is worth it. Room service was also worth trying: this was the best in-room dining we'd ever had.Other elements of the service were fine: valet parking was efficient and the front desk dealt with my queries quickly. A missing bathrobe was replaced in a couple of minutes, for example. Check out was fast and efficient.Overall, the BLUE is probably one of the best hotels we've stayed at, combining high quality service with a great location if you don't mind stretching your legs for the walk into the CBD.

<Content>Blue Hotel - Something missing Having read one bad review of this hotel I was hoping to be prooved wrong - unfortunately I was not!The room was tired - the handle of the fridge broken.Dirty tape stuck to the floor of the shower.Went to the bar for a drink and bar staff were rude, unhelpful and then charged a standard 10% for tip.During my 4 week trip to Australia this was the only disappointment.

<Content>A tired and expensive hostel. This is no luxury option. Sure the rooms were a great size, but they were tired and tatty on the edges. The service was insanely non-existent (could reception staff move any slower and look any LESS interested?). During my stay i never really felt that i was in any way getting service, that the hotel was doing me a favour allowing me to stay in their bland 'art' space with their indifferent and casual attitude. This is not a hotel, it's an expensive place to crash. I felt like a teenager.

<Content>OK -- Not as great as everyone says I just checked into the Blue hotel after spending two nights at the Establishment. First impressions, not so great.1. Location. Despite what others have been saying, I find the location a bit inconvenient. Sure, it's away from the hustle/bustle of Circular Quay, the CBD, and the Rocks, but when a lot of the action is in those areas from a tourism perspective, it's a pain to have to walk such a far distance or cab it everywhere. I stayed in the CBD, and while it was somewhat annoying to have the suits around, it was very central to everything I wanted to see in Sydney. 5 minute walk to Circular Quay, maybe 10 minutes to shopping at the QVB and the Strand, 10 minutes to the Rocks for the BridgeClimb at Harbour Bridge, and 10 minutes to the Opera House. 2. Rooms. First room they put me in after checking in was noisy. Not sure where people get their info re: rooms that are protected from the lobby noise, but I heard noise from the lobby and noise from the pier/wharf. I called down and they put me in a room further down, which eliminated some of the pier/wharf noise, but I can still hear the folks in the lobby. Granted, the noise factor at the Establishment was pretty bad too -- I could hear the people next door to me make phone calls. Also, the first room I was given had a shower curtain that was moldy, which made the bathroom smell. The rooms are relatively clean, modern in that W Hotels kind of way, but far from spectacular. The carpet, which is a beige colour, looks old and worn. Bathrooms are decent though. Not sure why people keep talking about the security of using keys to get into the elevator. While it's a great feature, it doesn't seem full proof, and doesn't make me feel any more safe that a system without keys (I'm traveling as a single woman in her early 30s).3. Price. Comparatively, the Blue hotel is not worth the money. I'd much rather stay at the Establishment hotel, which is truely boutique-y in my opinion. The room rate between the two hotels is virtually the same, if not a bit cheaper at the Establishment. List price-wise, the Establishment was $30 AUS more per night, but that rate include free wired internet in my room (Blue charges $25 per 24 hour -- and the wireless is very spotty) and free breakfast -- anything from their menu (breakfast at Blue I'm assuming costs more than $5). Overall, the Blue is just okay in my opinion. It's definitely not one of your mainstream hotels, but it's far from a true unique or boutique experience. I would prefer the Establishment any day, despite how crazy their bar gets and the issues with the noise between rooms. I would say that the service, so far, has been accommodating and friendly, which is nice given the hotel's size. Every inquiry made or questions asked have been received graciously and have been accommodated as much as possible. I do like that about the hotel!

<Content>Style and substance Stayed here for a week after travelling to Melbourne, Adelaide and Alice Springs. The building is an amazing warehouse conversion but lacks a heart. The room was great with a huge bed and a good sized marble bathroom. The view was magnificent with the Sydney skyline perched above the art gallery, and the top of the harbour bridge just visible through the trees of the botanic garden. The wharfside restaurants were good and we got into Otto the same day as we booked.The bar was an interesting space, it's just a shame that none of the cheaper beers were available and the opening hours were so short. The reception is up a flight of steps - not good for disabled travellers. Reception staff were helpful and the free internet terminal in reception was very useful.Breakfast was a sorry affair, so cross the road to the very friendly Charlies cafe for fresh coffee and food at a fraction of the cost of the hotel.An interesting hotel which thrives on its style but felt a bit empty.

<Content>Chic hotel fashion Blue used to be called the W, this chain is part of the larger American chain of hotels called Starwood. During the later part of 2006 the hotel changed hands the standard of service has not changed and you can still expect the best. The hotel has a very good location on the otherside of the Botanical Gardens and is a mere 15mins walk to the Opera House. The main reason to stay at this hotel is to boast to your friends that you are indeed posh and like to live it up! The hotel is situated just on the waterfront but further away from Circular Quay, please dont let this put you off! Inside the hotel is a club/bar and is probably one of the most amazing places to be on a Saturday night... the noise from this will not affect your nights sleep as the rooms are completely sound proofed. The access to the rooms is by the exclusive keycard system (both for the rooms and the lifts). To sum up stay here if you want somewhere different that is going to really impress.

<Content>for new year..... ..we arrived here on new years eve which is just a wow in sydney. loved the location of here next to botanic gardens and gentle walk to opera house etc. accomodation is good and we had a loft apartment with separate sitting area which was great. all would've been fine if this was 3 or poss 4 max star. restaurants underneath blue are v. good - china doll, indian etc.we'd booked when it was still W brand. Did feel that in general place could so with bit of upgrading. Conceigre service was really poor and we had to chase them to make sure bookings were made.Would v. recommend le kiosk at manly beach and aria at circular quay and getting water taxi there.loved sydney and would go back but would stay elsewhere as this doesn't live up to star rating!

<Content>amazing in everyway and the odd celeb thrown in!! bein gin Sydney for the new year we struggled a year in advance to get accommodation through our tour agent but they managed to pull this one out of the bag and wow did they do well. This is a truely stunning hotel, amazing restaurants and fab location. we had 10 nights here and never a dull moment including Paris Hilton creating mayhem at the Otto restaurant rated one of sydneys top 5 conveniently located downstairs. The restaurants are full of the beautiful crowd but the wharf setting is just delightful and those of you who run the jog from the hotel around the bay to circular quay and the botanical gardens just washes all you stresses away. could not fault this hotel at all.Agree with previous comments tho some fab little eateries accross the road from the hotel which do great brekfasts. A real must hotel

<Content>Stylish Warehouse I guess Blue would be described as a boutique hotel. It is part of the former dock warehouse complex at Woolloomooloo near the botanical gardens in Sydney. The architects have certainly made the most of the building's industrial heritage, the overall effect being one of intriguing spaciousness with more than a hint of living museum. The public areas are well integrated within the main hall of the warehouse (which extends well beyond the end of the hotel area into private apartment territory further up the length of the - extremely long - building). The rooms are gracious and well equipped 'standard' 5 star hotel rooms and betray nothing of the history of the building, but are modern, well maintained and stylish - with some fantastic harbour views. Staff could not have been more helpful and friendly. The hotel is well placed for the new cross town tunnel system and the airport, and for the beach locations on the South side of town. I would recommend a water taxi trip from the hotel's dock to a harbourside dining venue. Doyles at Watsons Bay is probably the classic (About 80 Aus $ water taxi).The walk from the hotel to Circular Quay is fantastic - across the dock, through the Botanical Gardens, along the harbour front, past the Opera House with its views across to The Harbour Bridge and there you are. Exhilerating!I did not eat in the hotel but know that there are a wide range of dining possibilities along the dock frontage - Indian, Italian, French, Chinese etc etc.The swimming pool is indoors (but has an outdoor patio, albeit somewhat space-constrained). The poolside gym is well equipped.Internet access is via PCs placed at the end of every corridor and is free - at least I was not charged for it.If returning to Sydney, and I hope that I do, I will certainly stay at Blue again. I am intrigued to see what new owners The Taj Group make of the hotel as it seems to be a departure from the style of their other opulent properties.

<Content>2 thumbs up I recently stayed for 5 nights for business at the Blue Sydney. As one of the previous posters already mentioned, the architecture (old wharf building, beautifully restored) mixed with the sleek and modern design and clever lighting is very unique and gives this 鈥渋ndustrial feel鈥? My room was modern too, with clean lines, huge writing desk (perfect for working). I had booked a loft room with a living area downstairs and upstairs a bedroom  bathroom. Everywhere you will find beautiful old black and white pictures showing scenes from gone by eras in Sydney. Check out the bar (I was told one of the top voted bars in Sydney) 鈥?plenty of good restaurants just around the corner too. Nice pool  gym, generally very good service. My 2 thumbs up for a pretty unique hotel experience!

<Content>Great stay at the Blue...Twice I stayed here twice in July 06 both times for 5 days while working at the Sydney Opera House. Great hotel, really good and well trained staff. Watch out for the loudness of the bar and the early closing of the bar, which ever is your priority. Check out the little breakfast place accross the street, Charlie's the best. Great restaurants outside and on the side of this unique property. Oh and Harry's De wheels is right there, not to leave out the Botanical gardens at your doorstep

<Content>Astonishing Architecture and Ambience This is a most unusual hotel and experience. The rooms are the slickest contemporary rooms I have experienced full of textures and with fine view over the harbour. The hotel is situation inside a VAST structure that is more than cathedral like. The consequence is that the communal inner space has a marvelous industrial feel but is so vast it is mostly unusable. There is a bar and cafe - breakfast in the cafe was a poor affair characterised by poor service and mediocre food - once experienced not to be repeated. There is a swimming pool\ but few people manage to find it in the building and there is no guidance in the rooms (perhaps due to the new ownership?). Overall the experience is positive. The location is convenient being right next to the Botanical Gardens and there are a variety of local eating places either on the dockside within the building or vicinity. The hotel seemed out of style for a Taj Hotel and one wonders if such an unusual space can be made to work effectively as a business. But try it and enjoy..its certainly a wow.

<Content>An unbelievable experience! I have just returned from Sydney where I stayed for 7 nights in the Blue Woolloomooloo. I have to concur in every way with the previous review, namely that the hotel is amazing and that some of the critics are too harsh. I travel very regularly on business and hence have experienced good hotels. This one is reall great. The staff if young, friendly and professional. The rooms - I had a duplex with marina view - is well organised and equipped. The gym and swimming pool are equally good. The bar has a very nice atmosphere. And equally importantly the business district is a 10min walk away through the park i.e. close enough to work but far away enough to leave the business atmosphere behind in the evenning and relax. I strongly recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a stylish/boutique hotel close to the business district.

<Content>A truly amazing experience Returned this week after staying at the Blue for 9 nights - a business trip. Just before I left I was advised of some adverse comments about the hotel on the Trip Adviser site - so I arrived at 7 am on a (cold) Sunday morning with a little apprehension.As soon as I arrived at the hotel any apprehension quickly went. From the moment I arrived to when I left my stay was perfect. The staff do have a different attitude to most 5* hotels - they are not sycophantic, they are young, always happy, take great pride in the hotel and are very professional. I was upgraded to a Marina room which was large, well furnished and decorated, very clean and had a lovely view of the bay and the city skyline. The bathroom was large, a huge bath and shower and lots of good quality shampoo etc. The room was cleaned early every day by staff who made a great effort to make sure that I was happy and well looked after. I was a solo guest, a woman of 50+ and therefore it is important that I felt safe and secure. The hotel is very safe because of its design - rooms are only accessible by a secure lift system and the staff quietly observe that you are OK.The atmosphere in the bar in the evening (especially Friday and Saturday was terrific, noisy, great music and full of people happy and having fun. My colleagues who were staying at the Intercontinental came over every evening because their bar was like a morgue.The pool is lovely and the gym although small is well equipped. Breakfast is service and not the usual buffet stampede, which gave a calm start to hectic business days and there is lots to choose from. Dinner was not so good but there are several very good restaurants in the hotel complex - recommend Manta (who also do a 2 course lunch for $39 including a glass of wine).The hotel is in an old wharf building which has a lot of history and congratulations to all the people who fought to save it from being demolished and turned into a boring luxury resort marina complex. The location is excellent long boardwalk outside the hotel and within 5 minutes you are in the Botanic Gardens which runs down to the harbour and along to the Opera House, Bridge, Circular Quay and the Rocks, however beware of the lunch time runners and joggers.An exceptional hotel suitable for everyone who wants to experience something different, is open- minded and likes style.

<Content>So it's NOT a W? A couple of years ago,while I was staying there I got into a discussion with a staff member of W chicago about why W hotels were becoming such a hip, cool and trendy thing. And that is the culture of collecting experiences, perhaps in a Hard Rock Cafe kind of way but less cheesy. Thing is, you expect the same high quality from all Ws but with each one being a unique experience. Each hotel is furnished and decorated in a style which suits the buildings or the city.I had stayed at W Sydney perhaps twice before during conferences and whatnot and it did differ from W in the US. It didnt feel as warm, but the Blue Whisky bars (at all W hotels) was really an experience. When I stayed at Blue, I guess I was expecting more.Gone is the 'Whatever, Whenever' motto, something I had developed a tendancy to make use of. The interior has changed a bit from what I remember and somehow it feels more icy. The service doesnt seem to emphasise all the things they used to. I waited something like an hour and a half for room service. The bartenders didn't know many of their cocktails. The people don't seem to be as friendly. In fact, it feels like they're no longer proud to work there. In my experience people working at W are very proud of its hipness and trendiness, and even though it might be a facade, to the customer thats all we want: attentive service. I know many of you might think I'm obsessed with the hotel brand, but isn't it piece of mind that you DONT worry how bad your hotel will be if you've never been there. Staying at a hotel is a gamble, even the brand name ones. At this price, you should think you've got that piece of mind, but guess what? I dont think i'll be going back.The rooms are fine, albeit getting a little rundown, but for what you pay at that price you aren't paying for the room, the view or anything like that. You are paying for the comfort,luxury and convenience, which means service. By W standards ( and I'm aware it's not W, but it is W PRICES), this does not measure up in anyway. I would have given it 5 according to my past experiences, but as Blue, I give it 3. Please consider the price and what you could get at other boutique hotels. I recommend Establishment Hotel.

<Content>Good base to explore Sydney I booked this hotel in Jan 06, prior to the change of ownership to Taj Hotels. I was not notified by Starwood until the day prior to my arrival that it was no longer a W Hotel. The Blue Hotel is a great base to explore Sydney, you can walk to the CBD, Harbour, etc and the nearest train station is ten minutes walk at the most. The rooms are starting to look a bit tired, but the standard of house keeping was very high. My room was on the top floor so there was a reasonable view of the area. The Hotel's famous bar, was the biggest let down. The in crowd appear to have moved on, leaving a few customers behind wondering why it's not busy. Supping expensive drinks and listening to weird music. It also closes by 1 am , which is a bit weird when you come from Europe and most decent places only get going by this time .All in all the Blue is a good base, clean rooms but it's nothing special.

<Content>Fantastic Absolutely LOVED the Blue hotel. Perfect for the late 20s-40s age groups, couples, honeymooners, and friends. Great location and about a 10 minute walk to the Opera house. The wharf building that the hotel is located in has an excellent range of restaurants and the Sydney explorer buses stop right in front of the hotel so easy for sightseeing and catching taxis. The bar in the hotel lobby is the best one we went to...all sorts of great drinks such as the blueberry mojito (my favorite). The rooms are very roomy with wonderful views of the wharf and the Botanic gardens. Great staff and hospitality. Will always stay there when I visit next...other top-rated hotels might be closer to the Opera house or the Darling Harbour but this one is the best overall experience and is in a better location in my opinion. What a great trip...sydney is my favorite place of all!!

<Content>Not quite there.... Stayed at the W for 3 nights. Nice hip hotel, desk staff good, and average. A little bit inverted in it's own self for my liking - e.g. no porters, just embassadors!Anyway- had a great time!
