<Content>It was fine - I'd stay again Stayed for 3 nights at a rate of GBP95 per night (incl breakfast) in early Dec. The conference was at the Hilton (about 5 mins walk away) and the conference rate at the Hilton was a lot higher.Its in a good location (if you want to be in that part of town) and a perfectly good hotel - despite the reviews :~) Some points to note:The hotel provides a discount for the car parking facility next to the hotel. But it still cost me 22+ euros for the night (only had a car 1 night).The room was great but too hot and adjusting the temp didn't appear to make much difference. The water pressure was extremely high. Turn on the shower and the head promptly flies up (under the water pressure) and shoots water all over the towels at the end of the bath. 1st night I dried myself with a hand towel. It would be a minor thing to prevent this with a better quality shower head fitting and I can't understand why they don't. There were several wifi networks around. I found one which let me on free - no idea whether it was legit or not.The 2nd night I got back after a hard day at 8:00pm and found the room hadn't been made up. The soaking towels where where I'd left them in a pile under the sink. A call to reception sorted it.Breakfast buffet was adequate. A reasonable selection of cold meats and cheeses. The hot stuff look 'tired'. If it wasn't in the rate I'd have gone out as it costs 10 euros.Smoking: there were ash trays in the room but there was absolutely no trace of smoke and I have a very sensitive nose for smoke. The only time I notice anything was the last morning when there was a vague smell of smoke in the corridor.No iron or coffee making facilities in the room.A perfectly fine stay and I'd be happy to stay there again. It would have had four stars except for the shower and room make up issues.

<Content>If you love Cockroaches this is your place!!! This hotel is so far the worst in my life, I check in on 22/07/08 in the afternoon so they gave me room 713.The carpet should be removed immediately is dirty you have no idea if you walk around the room for no more than 5 min well your feet will be as dark as night, there is a kitchen with dishes so dirty that you can tell what the last tenant had for lunch YUK, so I just used the refrigerator.But the real thing happen the second night when I returned to the hotel about 1.00am I thought I was alone, nobody told me that I had to share my apartment with lots cockroaches I kill 12 the first 10 min, of course I asked for a new room but nobody did anything so I sleep with all the lights on, nice ah? the room was hotter than a firecracker then I looked at the bathroom floor and I found hair YUK for the second time so the only thing for me was to go put alcohol on the bathtub and take a bath with my soxs on!!! the towels had blood stains so I dry my self inside my hot room, needless to say I was gone the first hour in the morning.Avoid at all costs this aparthotel Atenea

<Content>ideal for the football stadium We chose this hotel based on its proximity to the Nou Camp, as we were taking our son to a match for his 18th birthday - with that in mind I would say it was a good choice. It was just a short walk to the stadium and it definately saved the hassle of trying to journey back into the city centre on public transport after the match - the queues for the metro after the match were huge.Although it is not in the city centre, it is only a couple of minutes walk to Les Corts metro - and most of the main attractions and the city centre itself were therefore only a short trip away - we certainly didn't feel out on a limb. The hotel was also about a minute away from a large El Corte Ingles store and the upmarket shops on the Diaganol. There was a good choice of restaurants on the Diaganol - we had lunch in one and it was packed out with Spanish people - always a good sign.The rooms in the hotel were large and spotlessly clean - slightly outdated, and more 3 star than 4 star, but perfectly ok. The bed was also huge and comfortable and there was a sofa and coffee table in the 'living area'. There was a huge breakfast buffet, although this did not seem to be topped up during service, so it ran out of things later on. We found the reception staff to be helpful and friendly.I would recommend this hotel for the more budget conscious traveller or for any footbball goers!

<Content>Not bad at all - if you don't want the beach too often A bit late in writing my review, but was compelled to complete it ...This was a weird hotel, set in the finance district within walking distance form the Nou Camp, it provided us with a great base for our holiday - though not too clever if you like beach holidays.After the initial shock of discovering where we were, we found it a superb place to stay;- hotel was clean and usable with all mod cons we required- local shops gave us more insight into Barcelona than staying further in townThe only downside were the reception staff - they were about as useful as a chocolate teapot - but this was fully compensated by the restaurant staff.Finally, I'd recommend that you buy tube passes for the week ...much cheaper than a cab and much more cost effective than a daily pass.Enjoy!

<Content>4 *- I don't think so! We decided to book Atenea for a three night stay in December as it had received fairly good reviews, was convenient to the metro and provided breakfast. Unfortunately, we were very disappointed with what we found, yes the hotel is very convenient to the metro, but that was about its only positive feature. The hotel is very dated and the curtains and carpets in the rooms could do with a bit of a scrub. Although the rooms had kitchens, unless you bring your own kitchen utensils with you this is not a major advantage. On the plus side the sheets were clean and we were provided with clean towels every day. The walls in the hotel are extremely thin, as well as becoming familiar with our neighbours' (above, below and beside) nocturnal habits, we could also smell smoke from other rooms.Breakfast was a bizarre affair, granted during our stay breakfast was served in a different location from the norm, but this did not excuse the complete lack of organisation. The room consisted of mainly large tables, seated for about 8 people, so we had to share with other groups. On the first morning we had to wait until bowls were washed to have cereal, on the third morning our cereal was soggy by the time we got spoons. The toaster did not work and the hot food was luke warm.Barcelona is a great city, with plenty to offer everyone but if I was to visit it again I would certainly not stay in hotel Atenea.

<Content>Great staff, great hotel First off, this review is written bearing in mind the fact I paid 拢308 (should have been about 拢340 on hotelopia.co.uk but I found a discount code) for 5 nights in a double room with my girlfriend at the Atenea. I think people should state how much they pay on here, not to brag, but because what you pay dictates what you expect and therefore how you review. The room was clean and a decent size, but don鈥檛 expect an apartment, ours was more like a bed-sit, but this is not a criticism. Small kitchen, adequate bathroom, sofa, very large double bed, TV, everything you need. The other reviewers who criticize the lack of cutlery, crockery and pans etc just needed to ask at reception for whatever they needed as they were more then happy to have plates and cutlery sent up to our room.The food in the restaurant was ok. The gastronomic menu was fairly good value at around 23 euros each, nice tapas and then main and postres. The staff were very friendly with good english and the bar waitress makes great sangria.The location is 15 mins walk from Nou camp, which was good for us as we went to a match. It's also only a couple of minutes walk from Les Corts metro station. We were a little worried about safety on the metro but found it to be very good. ATMs near by too.The Mussols restaurant near by was nice enough, but other than that you probably need to get a taxi to eat out. All in all we really enjoyed our stay at the Atenea. The hotel was fantastic considering the amount I paid and would have been good even if it had cost more.Just a note on pick pockets in Barcelona: I carried a bag across both shoulders and kept it on my hip in front of me, and we had no problem. Stick to the main streets, dont wear a bag on one shoulder, be aware of who is around you (particularly on La Rambla) and you will be fine

<Content>Not bad - but why a 4-star? We stayed at the Atenea for four nights and found it a decent enough hotel, although I'm not sure why it's a 4-star when it doesn't seem to have any advantages over a 3-star hotel I've stayed in on previous visits to Barcelona - in fact there are certain aspects of the 3-star which I preferred to this one. Breakfast (which is included in the price) was not bad, although I've had better choice in other Barcelona hotels. You're shown to a breakfast table by a waiter or waitress rather than choosing a table for yourself, and although the breakfast buffet is self-service, you have to wait for coffee to be brought to your table rather than helping yourself - and service was sometimes quite slow, even when the breakfast room wasn't particularly busy. The room was a good size and was clean and comfortable, with its own kitchen area (although kitchenware isn't provided - so if you're planning to cook, bring your own pots, pans, plates and cutlery!). There's a fridge in which you can store your own food and drink, and small bottles of water are left for you every day. The bathroom was also a good size and very clean - although for some reason on the second day the cleaners took away the soap and didn't replace it. The hotel is in a fairly smart area of the city, close to the north-western end of the Diagonal and within easy reach of central Barcelona on Line 3 (the green line) of the Metro. It's also walking distance to the Palau Reial, which is well worth a visit.In all I'd say the Atenea was a pretty good hotel and good value for money, but if I'd been expecting more luxury than a 3-star I'd have been disappointed.

<Content>Great place Stayed one night at hotel prior to boarding cruise ship. Great location near train station from airport and to ship. (Cheap transportation $) Very helpful bilingual staff, clean and away from hustle and bustle of La Rambla but easy to hop on train or HOHO buses . Wonderful place to feel the city and the awesome people. Good resturant near by. Breakfast buffet included in room charge was excellent. Will return for sure.Found through TripAdvisor and booked with Venere.com. Look for discount code.

<Content>fantastic hotel Fantastic Hotel at a great rate,stopped for 3 nights 1/4th May.Slightly outside centre of Barcelona Las Ramblas etc, but as previous reviews a T10 ticket for the metro was 6.90euro, stop 3 mins down road, and hadnt to wait more than 3 mins for a Metro, even coming back at midnight, did walk into centre on one occasion takes approx 30 mins.Room was very clean, slightly dated but spotless, Safe in room, key from reception with 20 Euro deposit. Breakfast was included in our price which again was excellent buffet style, served from 6:30 to 10:30am coffee topped up by friendly waiter. Overall great choice recommend for anybody from familys to couples to footbal fans ideal for Nou Camp (BarcelonaFC) as only 15 min walk to ground, Why pay more for a Hotel only because in centre of Barcelona! when there is a bargain in the Atenea only a few mins away!!!.

<Content>A good find Stayed here for three nights during the marathon weekend. Not the most modern internally but very clean and rooms large. My double room also had a fold out sofa bed. The kitchens in the rooms look rarely used, very clean and shiny stainless steel, but there are no pots, crockery or cutlery provided. My kitchen was in its own little room, some were not. Some family rooms also had room dividers.Basic bathrooms (not marbled etc) but large, clean and tidy, bath with shower over and bidet and decent bag of freebies. Breakfast buffet good, a decent selection and room.Location good too, ATM across street, two metro stops close by, free parking next door for hotel guests. Not far from centre on the metro which is pretty cheap. A few decent restaurants close by too.All in all if you can get a decent rate and don't want/need a flashy hotel with gym etc this is a safe bet.

<Content>enjoyed our stay we stayed at the atenea aparthotel for 4 nights after christmas for a short holiday. it was a lovely place to stay. the apartment was a reasonable size with a small kitchen which i found convenient. it had a fridge and a small hob on which i could make a simple meal. there was a very large supermarket in the basement of the department store one block up from the apartments which sold everything you could possibly need.the aparthotel itself was very clean and comfortable,very quiet and the staff willing to help and assist with anything that was needed. the breakfast included in the price was substantial with lots of choice for every one. cereals fresh fruit, cold meats, cheese, toast, pastries and cakes, a cooked breakfast, coffee and juices.the aparthotel is very near to a metro station for travelling into barcelona and is an excellent way of travelling around. we bought a 10 ticket card for 6.50 euros. although the apartment was out of the city centre we found that it was very easy to travel around and were able to get anywhere we wanted on the excellent metro system.we enjoyed our stay in barcelona and would definitely stay at the atenea aparthotel again.

<Content>Nice stay We just returned from a five days get away with my friends. We are 5 housewives who once a year pick a destination for a little vacation. Atenea aparthotel in Barcelona was a really nice surprise, very clean hotel, a very appreciated breakfast buff茅. The waiting personel however did seem to care less too many times, apart from a very young man who looked like a student and really tried his best.The reception staff were very helpfull much of the time. The location is in a safe quiet residential area and the hotel is just a couple of blocks away from the nearest metro station, no changes are needed to go to the center of town.The only misshap we had was that we ordered 2 taxis via the reception to take us to Tibidabo, the taxi drivers were very rude and once we were on the way they drove us to the new harbour instead of the place we asked for, they drove round the city so the taximeter would rise as much as possible and when we arrived at the harbour they dropped us of and asked the restaurant owner for a comission!!!The owner refused and a dispute broke out, it was really terrible, we felt like idiots!! I reported that to the hotel, the receptionist said he was going to write a report to the manager.Please beware of taxidrivers otherwhise Barcelona is very nice and i would more than happily return to Atenea aparthotel.

<Content>Great value hotel in a very good location Stayed here along with five friends and can throughly recommend to small groups or couples looking for a budget priced, but perfectly adequate hotel in Barcelona. We booked the hotel using Last Minute (very reasonable) and were allocated rooms on the 6th and 7th floors. Both rooms were very clean and well presented, each complete with a small kitchen area, bathroom amenities, decent floorspace (complete with a moveable divider to create a separate sleeping area) and a cracking power shower! Breakfast was a mixed affair due to the large number of people stopping during the Easter period, but plenty of hot and cold food was available and the staff were friendly and accomodating.The hotel is located close to the Barcelona football ground and the nearest Metro stop (Maria Cristina - Green Line 3) is situated just 300m away, so it's ideal as a base for exploring the city.A couple of restaurants and bars can be found within 2mins walk should you wish to remain close by, but with the superb Metro links, its better to simply hop on the train and head into the more central parts of the city. Be sure to buy a T10 Metro ticket, only 6.65 euro, which provides 10 journeys and can be passed from person to person. With each individual journey costing around 2 euro, this represents great value for money.All in all, Barcelona is a great place to go whether you are travelling alone, with friends/partner or even on business and this hotel provides a great value, comfortable and ideally situated base for enjoying the delights of this cultural, yet modern, and tourist friendly city...enjoy!

<Content>Great hotel!! We've just returned from a 3 day stay at the Aparthotel Atenea- and would thorughly recommend it!!The room was really clean, helpful staff-and the breakfast was excellent.The location is great-a tram service and a number of buses run through this area, and two metro stations (Les Corts  Maria Christina)are only a few minutes walk.There is also a shopping mall/supermarket opposite the hotel which is very convenient.Would definately stay here again.

<Content>Very Enjoyable Stay We booked this self-catering apartment last September, and visited the last week of that month. In short, the apartments were lovely. The complex is situated in the fishing village of Vilanova i la Geltru, about a 45-minute drive from BCN airport. We got a taxi to the rooms from the airport because it was late in the day, but the train is probably the best way to get there. We found the staff very pleasant; they spoke very little English though, so have your phrase book handy! The rooms are spacious and well arranged, and were thoroughly cleaned each day for us. When we arrived though, we did notice that our room had 2 single beds rather than a double, so that's worth double checking. The kitchen facilities are simple but adequate, with a sink and fridge, and we couldn't find an iron or ironing board in the building, although I'm sure its there somewhere!The complex has a small restaurant/bar which serves good food and drink at a reasonable price. The staff there are very polite and friendly. There is also a pool surrounded by palm trees, which was not too busy and nice to relax in.The complex is also a 5-minute walk from the sandy beach, and many cafes and restaurants. we spent 5 nights at the complex, and would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a relaxing holiday away from the city, but not too far from it!Any questions, feel free to post a message to us.

<Content>Excellent! We stayed at the atenea aparthotel for 4 nights in March and got a great price from lastminute I can thoroughly recommend this hotel, it is near to the centre - we took the tourism buses which you can hop on and off of, and there is a stop within walking distance of the hotel. The hotel is lovely and clean, with friendly helpful staff. Breakfast was great, with a fantastic selection - cooked breakfast, fruit, cakes, cheeses, ham, crossiants etc etc. Our triple room was large and also had a sliding door to seperate one of the beds. It was also very clean and well maintained. Looking at the prices for other hotels in Barcelona this is an absolute bargain for such a great hotel!
