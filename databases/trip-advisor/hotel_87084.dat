<Content>Fulfills its purpose very well Have to agree with the last review. As a hotel, this is an average hotel, but you really can't beat the location. As merely a hotel room, I would maybe give this a 3.5, but the perfect location for my purposes raises this to a 4. We arrived at MIA after traveling 16 hours, and all that I wanted at that point was quickly a nice quiet room with a good bed. This hotel offered that, so I was happy. It was really a huge relief that the hotel was located inside the airport, surely at least after a long trip. We arrived late at night, and carried on first thing in the morning, for which purpose this hotel was very very good. Slept like a baby, so no noise and the bed was good. The room was clean and nice, I have no complaints. The corridor outside the rooms was outdated and dirty, however. Would book again if need be. With a shorter flight that arrives earlier, could try also other hotels located near the airport. But for late in flights, this is really the only sensible option.

<Content>Major convenience but not much else Staff was not very welcoming. As mentioned by others, this isone of the smallest rooms I have ever booked. The bathroom door literally hit the toilet anytime we entered the bathroom.HOWEVER -- the hotel looks great when you have 5AM check in for an international flight and just have towalk down the concourse to get there.

<Content>Tiny Room but Can't Beat Location My husband and I stayed 1 night in a standard queen whilst in transit between Bolivia and Canada.This hotel was chosen purely on location - which is unbeatable for an in transit airport hotel. The room was adequate - very, very small - not as clean as it should have been - but quiet, with a comfortable bed. One bath towel was ripped - but clean. It is expensive - but worth it for the convenience. There are plenty of dining choices at the airport - more reasonably priced than the hotel. We would stay there again.

<Content>Perfect for a Layover We had a 12 hour, overnight layover on our way back from Costa Rica...and this was perfect for us after traveling all day with a 5 year old. We got through customs, checked in, took showers, grabbed some pizza and beers in the terminal, took them back to the room and relaxed. In the morning, we simply took the elevator back down and were right at the security check-point.If you have a layover in Miami鈥ou can't beat this hotel. Rooms were small, but clean...no complaints!

<Content>Pleasant Environment for our one night stay We stayed at this hotel on the night of November 8th on our way back from our Mexican vacation. We flew in on American Airlines direct from Cancun to Miami, FL late in the afternoon. My original intent was to go to the most convenient hotel for arriving and departing passengers as my family was looking forward to a quick nights' sleep as we needed to get up early to catch our early morning flight back home. We were not disappointed. As we exited the secure zone from the arrival gates, I asked directions to the hotel and the reality was that all we had to do was go up to the 2nd level, that's where check-ins take place and the hotel was within 100 ft of the American Airlines gate exit. The hotel check-in was quick and I did ask for a renovated room as I knew this hotel was undergoing renovations. By the way, the hotel website directly states that the hotel facilities and major activity areas are under construction. The pool was unavailable as well as the tennis courts and other areas as indicated on their website. So any traveler doing their own research should have discovered this before arriving and if not, they did not do due diligence. After checkout out the United gates were quite far away. I believe the hotel is centrally located so any airline with gates near the ends of the airport will entail long walks. The room was adequately roomy. We had two queen beds, which were perfect for my wife,my son and I. The beds were quite comfortable as they use pillow top mattresses, at least in their renovated rooms. The decor was nice and modern and in great shape. The water worked fine. They use a single wide rain type shower head in the tub. The rooms were quite sound proof an we did not hear any airplane sounds at all. There was plenty of lights, often for me a minor irritant, but it was not a problem here. The hotel has ice machines on every guest floor and a vending machine as well. The hotel also provides a copy of the local Miami Herald in the morning. The local restaurants open at 7:00 am so if you have a flight too early in the morning you will be out of luck for breakfast.All in all, I was quite happy with my admittedly short stay. Checkout was a breeze as we pre-paid and incurred no additional charges.

<Content>: "Miserable Manager and dirty rooms !!!" Arrived at 11pm, for an overnight stay before cruising the next day. Front desk staff NOT friendly at all. Went to our non-smoking room, but it stunk of cigarettes. The dust on the dressers was thick..but hey, it was just for a night. Too tired to complain. When we went to check out I was overbilled as I had booked with an agency (Hotelkingdom.com) and my e-mail showed my balance owing. Front desk staff were totally vacant, not a clue. They called for the Manager, who basically said too bad - take it up with the agency. I then told her about the smoking and dust in the room..and she just said you seem like someone who likes to complain. I will never stay here again....and I travel quite alot. I will be sure to let everyone know who is going to Miami !!Oh and the Manager also stated in the last 4 years, not one person has ever complained to her! Interesting, she needs to come on here and read the reviews!

<Content>Anywhere But Here! - Unless You Are Desperate Had a connection at MIA, late arrival, early departure. Figured I'd save the trouble of going to a real hotel off airport. Bad idea.Booked a Superior room at $231 for one night. About double the cost of any other nearby off-airport hotel, and about half the room size. Opened the door to the room and found the temperature at 107 degrees, with the bathroom at over 115 degrees (my digital thermometer doesn't read higher!). This temp was with the A/C on at full cooling! All of the room lights were on as well, which contributed to the sauna-like conditions in the room. Almost no airflow from the A/C vents. Opened up the return vent and found the air filter had about 1/4 inch of filth over the entire surface. Removed it and brought it down to the front desk. Their response? Nothing! Not even a shrug! Amazing non-interest. Apparently this hotel has enough stay one time only traffic to not care about anything. It took three hours to bring the room temp down to under 80 degrees. For my return connection, stayed off airport at the Embassy Suites for half the price. AVOID THIS HOTEL AT ALL COSTS!

<Content>A Very Filthy Hotel, Not Worth the Money! I stayed in the hotel for 3 nights and it was a complete disaster the room had outdated furniture, the bathroom had remnants of previous guest hair and bodily stains as did the blankets and sheets on the bed, the cable sucked and only provided the basic news stations, and the room was infested with ants. The decor in the elevator and rooms was either peeling, cracked, stained, or contained some foul stench and I could say that I literally became sick because of lack of housekeeping that occurred during my stay. The room came without a mini fridge or microwave and when they provided the mini fridge it was rusted out and dirty. For the amount of money charged to stay in the hotel the service, decor, and cleanliness should be at a much higher standard. I hope that with this review I could save some other traveler heartache from wasting their money staying in this horrendous hotel.

<Content>Great Location We stayed here after our a problem with a flight home to the UK. It's right in the airport terminal and therefore is very convenient. The restaurant serves good quality meals but is fairly expensive as are the rooms. The rooms are not large but are very clean and comfortable.

<Content>decent place to stay Nice place to stay. Hotel was in the middle of renovations so some areas were closed. Not easy to find in a huge airport and more signs needed to be posted. Small rooms with a huge building support pole in the room near the window and you had to crawl across the bed to get to the window if you are bigger than a size 4. Slow elevators but a great view. Clean rooms. The staff at the desk was not very helpful. My spouse accidentally left a duffle bag with several items in it in the elevator and we were lucky that the attendant for luggage on duty located it and it was returned. We are traveling to Miami again for a cruise in Sept 2009 and will probably stay here again.

<Content>What an improvement I have stayed at this hotel several times and can honestly say the only incovenience I saw before was that you could hear doors being slammed all accross the hallways. I was surprised when I visited a couple of days ago how they fixed the doors and now there is ABSOLUTE silence. It was a great improvement from my last stay in Oct. 2007. The rooms have been refurbished and the room service is great after a long trip. Nothing beats staying inside the hotel and not having to drag your bags in and out of cars. I will continue to stay at this hotel, the staff is great and took our luggage all the way to our airline. Loved it!I recommend the breakfast on the top floor. It has a great view and is a good value compared to anything else you might find at the terminals.

<Content>Very nice espeically for the convenience We stayed on a layover back from Provo and were pleasantly surprised. Clean room, great windows for the kids to look out of from waist to ceiling. The upstairs restaurant had excellent quality food and the service was great. Excellent check-in and check-out. Bell man brought our luggage to our room greatfully.The rooms could use some upgrading, especially the bathtub. Otherwise, wonderful.

<Content>Nice place to stay before an early flight! I stayed here earlier this week with my family since we had an early flight the next day. I was feeling kind of apprenhensive of the place in the lobby/elevator/hallway, but relaxed as soon as I saw our room. It was nicely appointed, very quiet, with a decent bathroom, and comfy beds. Very nice to roll right out of bed and head to the gate for our flight. Nice showerhead too!

<Content>The hotel "lost" my reservation I stay here several times a year, mostly business. It is the only hotel in the terminal and very convenient. Rooms are smallish but comfortable, and overall it is an acceptable hotel for a short transit-type visit..I recently guaranteed a one night stay with a CC, but when arriving after a long business and travel day, the hotel was full and my reservation was nowhere to be found. At 2330 at night, this is not good news. Obviously, the front desk staff ( with minimal apology ), thought that I was not coming, and gave my room to another guest.I found another close-by hotel, but was 90 minutes later than planned in getting some rest. I will not stay here again. Minor consolation : no charge to my CC :-)

<Content>Wonderful Convenience, terrible front desk staff!!! We fly into Miami a day before our cruise and stayed at this hotel because of the convenience. The hotel itself was very nice, actually nicer then expected. The only problem - and it was enough for me to only give this hotel 2 stars - was the front desk staff. Three families checked in, we were all charged a higher rate then indicated on our confirmation. We were then told not to worry - it would be changed when we check out. The next morning when we checked out (thank goodness we didn't use the express automatic check out) we were incorrectly charged - everyone's credit card was place with different rooms - it was a real mess. I wouldn't be upset about this normally, but the attitude of the management behind the desk was horrible... she didn't want to explain the problem , just keep sighing at us, telling us they made the corrections, she didn't want to give us any back up that the charges were removed. She was a real B if you ask me! I was never spoken to in such a matter, and when I tried to explain to her that once we left we had no proof that this was actually done, she told me I explained this to you to many times...SHe would not give me last name...she was just totally out of line.Because of staff like this - I would never stay at this hotel again

<Content>Happy for the convenience I was leery to stay here after reading some of the reviews, but I was glad my husband and I stayed here. We were happy to find a clean room after arriving around midnight and had a morning flight. The room had been updated and the bed was comfortable. It was quiet, too. We could tell the hotel is older, but the rooms were nicely done. It was great not to have to catch a shuttle to get to our room.

<Content>If you need to sleep at the airport, you cannot beat it This hotel is right in the terminal (closest to American Airlines) of the Miami International Airport. You take the elevator to your airline check in gate. No wasting time with airport shuttle buses, etc. Rooms are simple with wireless internet (at a fee), television and there is the hotel restaurant plus airport dining options. You would never stay there for any reason other than you are catching a flight in a few hours. It is not for more than one night. It is for a 5 to 15 hour stay between flights when it is not worthwhile to go someplace nicer. You check in, go to your room and leave for your flight.Hotel is not pretty but efficient and bed is not bad.

<Content>UGH! We stayed one night at the Miami International Airport Hotel. Our experience taught us that LOCATION IS NOT EVERYTHING. The room and amenities made us feel like we were bait-and-switch victims. We complained to the staff and shift supervisor. We were not offered an apology or discount.They could not give a (bleep). We have since learned there are some great hotels very close with caring staff, 24//7 airport shuttle service, and many more amenities. In the future we will avoid the Miami International Airport Hotel.

<Content>Very comfortable beds and pillows We arrived at the airport at 2 am and wearily dragged our bags a concourse or 2 but it was nice not having to wait outside for a taxi. The convenience of this hotel is great! We were on the 7th floor and the restaurant is just down the hallway. Not even an elevator ride. The rooms were standard in spaciousness but the beds were dreamy for a late arrival. The bathroom was pretty good, all enclosed instead of having the sink separate from the toilet and shower. One weird thing was that the bathroom door was on a hinge that made it shut automatically. Wasn't sure what this was about. Also our room didn't have a closet but I noticed that other rooms did. The desk clerks were efficient and helpful but not effusively so. I would stay here again. Some noise in the hall from running children but I didn't find the jet noise bad at all.

<Content>Clean, Comfy...just what we needed We stayed for one night on 2/2/08. I was quite apprehensive, as we have had bad Miami airport hotel experiences in the past, and the reviews were mixed. We were in for a pleasant surprise.First, the location was perfect for our flight departing at 11:30am. Check in was quick and easy, and we received one of the newly renovated rooms which was tastefully decorated, had a great, cushy king size bed, and the room was very clean. Even looking out the window at the runway, we could not hear the planes land or depart. The location allowed us to check in to our flights early, securing us exit row seating. Then we had a leisurely breakfast at the hotel restaurant, where we had great service. The only negative I could come up with would be that the cabinet holding the tv is extremely wide, making the passage between the cabinet and bed narrow. A flat screen might solve that problem! The shower pressure was great, with a rain type shower head. Overall, we felt the price justified the convenience.

<Content>Motel 5 Years back, almost every French town had a Hotel Terminus -- a modest establishment within walking distance of the train station. Few if any of these earned a spot in Michelin, but they were popular with long-distance travelers because of their location.Thus it is with the Miami International Airport Hotel. It is hugely convenient with a worthy restaurant, but little else.We've had two rooms-for-two there: One tiny, and another, smaller yet, not much larger than a Folsom Prison cell. There nominally are a few larger rooms, but as of several months earlier these were already booked.What little room space there is becomes further limited by a huge and ill-placed armoire housing a deep tube-type TV and three drawers. Atop both rooms' armoires lies a rich carpet of vintage dust and assorted trash worthy of the Bates Motel. To ensure the worst possible experience, the armoire, which you have to shinny by to get to one side of the bed, has a crown moulding with sharp corners that are perfectly located to hit most folks smack on the forehead.An LCD TV on a shelf and placing drawers under the clothes-hanging area in the alcove would have helped enormously.Also, the bathroom door closes automatically and vigorously. Not only is this unhandy and keeps the bathroom mouldy and hot, the resulting banging of bathroom doors throughout the night helps ensure you are awakened at least a few times as neighbors arise to perform biological acts.There was no maid service -- zero -- of any kind in two days, one elevator's doors got stuck (apparently a regular occurance) and the room windows were filthy.But there is good news. The common areas are well-maintained, the restaurant is surprisingly good (service, too) and the porters and desk folks are, for the most part, commendably helpful. Indeed, other than the rooms themselves the place is quite decent.But in the end itcomes down to location, location, location.

<Content>The Worst Experience Ever !!!!! We stayed one night at the Miami International Airport Hotel and I would recommend that you consider very hard before you book. We booked through BA as part of a package.The hotel is in an excellent position right in the terminal so great for when you are looking to catch a transfer flight, but in my mind location is not everything, especially as there are some great hotels very close.We had one of their recently refurbished rooms, which would have not looked out of place in East Germany before the wall came down.Anyway, we were catching a connecting flight so stayed there for one night. Our room overlooked the runway and we went to bed in preparation for an early start.We were woken at 12.30am by workmen stripping a flat roof outside our room, they were using lage drills and the noise was unbearable especially as it lasted all night and we left at 6am without any sleep!To cap it all the fire alarm went off ordering an evacuation at 1am and we all left the hotel and stood outside. Only then did we realise that the night porter (who could not speak much english) did not even realise that an alarm had been going off!!He sent us back up to our rooms without checking if it was indeed a false alarm!!We complained during the night and again in the morning and were not offered any appology, alternative room or discount! They could not give a damn! Your choice!

<Content>Very Convenient Can't beat the convenience of this hotel since it is right in the airport. It's perfect if you are leaving Miami the next morning on a cruise or with a rental car (as we were). The room was somewhat renovated with a very comfortable King bed. The hotel seems worn in other respects - strong smell of bleach, dirty carpets, shabby dining room. However, the food and service in the dining room are excellent. We had no regrets - it suited our purposes.

<Content>Convenience, Convenience, Convenience I CANNOT sleep on planes so this hotel is absolutely perfect for Miami layovers. For anyone who values their sleep you can't get any more convenient than a hotel located in the middle of the airport. You can wake up, check out of the hotel and be checking in to your early morning flight within minutes.We also enjoyed the friendly bartender at the lounge the night before. My only knock is that it's a bit pricey but if you budget it into the cost of your flight you'll find that it's worth it. Plus you'll be well rested on your early flight while the guy that slept in the lobby downstairs is passing out beside you on the plane.I will definitely be staying here again on our next Miami layover.

<Content>Hotel of last resort only Avoid this hotel. Review...GOOD:--Located within the confines of the Miami Int'l airport, so its convenientBAD:--Rooms are small, dirty, poorly appointed - honestly they look and feel like hospital rooms, including a shower that shares the floor with the rest of the bathroom--Rates are high, despite being a lousy placeJust don't stay here unless you are truly stuck at the airport.

<Content>Very convenient. Some concern based on prev. reviews but everything fine. Slept here for 6 hrs. between our red-eye arrival and late afternoon departure. Reservation for the prior evening and they allowed us a late check-out @ 1 p.m. Very clean, very comfortable beds. Very quiet. Slept great! Would only ask the hotel consider a day rate beginning early a.m.

<Content>just fine We spent one very short night at the MIA hotel with no problems. Our flight was quite late and American Airlines lost our luggage, then had a line of people at the lost-luggage department with only 2 totally disinterested employees (but that is a different story, isn't it?). So we checked in around 1:00 a.m. Check-in was fast and friendly. I had called ahead and asked for an upgraded room with a king bed and, even at that hour, that's what we got. Yes the room was quite small but very clean. We were only there for about 6 hours as we had an early flight, but we never heard another soul, or any airplanes! We asked for a wake-up call and we got it. It's pretty expensive but worth every extra penny for the convenience.

<Content>HOTEL MIA This is the hotel in concourse E inside MIA. The rooms had been updated and were just fine. Very good place to stay for an early AM departure, takes the stress out of getting to the Airport. The only issue I had was that I arrived before check in time and they wouldn't let me store my suitcases with the bellman. I had to check them in the temporary bag check at a cost of $50.00 (four travelers adds up). I suppose that may be an airport regulation but I was not told that. Bear that in mind if you are thinking about dropping your stuff and touring the town prior to the 4:00 PM Check-in.

<Content>Quick Check-in  Our 5th floor room was spacious and beautifully redecorated! Check-in was quick and painless - even at 11:30 at night! The price was high and there were no real amenities, but the convenience was great....especially with a Starbucks just outside the lobby! =)

<Content>very comfy bed small room We stayed here for one night in June. I was worried given some of the reviews. THe hotel is deffinatly dated and you can see where some of the upgrading is being carried out. We had a room on the 5th floor. The room was very small. The door to the bathroon did not open properly when the toilet seat was down. The bed was very very comfortable. You can check if you flight is delayed on the TV in the room. It was expensive for the size of the room. It was a bit noisy but for the convience of not having to get a taxi to an out side hotel and the comfor bed I would stay again. Just make sure you insist on an upgraded room

<Content>New Rooms are Great There is no more convenient hotel for exhausted passengers arriving at Miami International Airport..... it is directly outside the arrivals area, one short elevator ride to check-in. Newly renovated hotel rooms are really very comfortable.... were were not at all disappointed.... but you must ask for a renovated room when you reserve because the hotel is still being overhauled. We had no access to pools or lounges as they are closed for renovation... but we were just there to sleep and the new beds and decor were just great. Picked up food for the kids at the airport restaurants downstairs.... rental car bus was just down the elevator the next morning, and we were off. Can't tell you how welcome it is not to have to schlep 10 bags and 2 kids from airport arrivals to hotel shuttle bus and back again to the rental car bus. Kids were in pjs 10 minutes after we cleared customs.Reception by the way was really pleasant.... no problems at all.

<Content>Miami Int'l Airport hotel Our flight into Miami was very late on 3/17, we had reservations at the Miami Int'l Airport Hotel. Check in was very quick (it was 2:00 am). The room was nicely decorated, but was very small. With two large suitcases and one carry on, we basically had to climb over them to get to the bathroom. There was also a running water noise all night long. When we opened the wooden shutters, the view was of the top of the buildings air conditioners. Check out was very quick, and easy to catch a cab. It was about a $24.00 taxi ride to the Port of Miami.This hotel is OK for a short layover, but for $157.00 I really expected a little more room. And the fact that some of the rooms had padlocks on the outside of the doors made it kind of creepy. I was wondering what I had gotten us into! They did have a security guard sitting in the hallway which also made me wonder...

<Content>pleasant experience after bad Trip Advisor reviews I had already made reservations for three nights (not consecutive) during a 2 1/2 week period in March, when I almost cancelled out of fear having read some very bad reviews on Trip Advisor. I had two very short layovers between flights, and the convenience of not having to get a shuttle and waste time was very important. I had read a couple of comments that said to ask for a renovated room, so I contacted the hotel and they promised me renovated rooms on all three stays. And Guess What?!! They lived up to their word, and all the rooms I stayed in on the three separate occasions were great. Very comfortable beds,lovely decor and some extra amenities like a magnifying mirror and a phone in the bathroom. The room service was excellent also. They are not done renovating yet, so you really need to emphasize that you want a renovated room. You won't be sorry.The only negatives were slow check in and check out.

<Content>Don't stay here I would not recommend this hotel to anyone flying in to Miami on an early flight. We arrived at 11:00am and were told we couldn't even register until check-in time of 3:00pm (turns out they rent out day rooms for travelers with long waits) . When I asked if they could hold our luggage, I was told it was against the rules, but we could use the airport luggage storage service, which charged $5-7 per bag. However, once I signed up for a tour of Miami through the hotel at a price of $50 per person, all of a sudden they could hold my luggage for me. The tour was not worth even half of what I paid for it. The staff at this hotel was among the most unaccomodating and unfriendly I have ever run into. The room was very worn and the hair dryer didn't work. My suggestion would be to stay at another near-by hotel.

<Content>Great option for late arrival My husband and I stayed at this hotel recently prior to a cruise. Our plane was late so we did not get into Miami until 1:45 a.m. It was nice to not have to deal with getting trasportation to an offsite hotel. We just gathered our luggage, took an elevator up one floor and we were there! The staff members were friendly and helpful. The room was clean, quiet, comfortable, and updated. I highly recommend this hotel to travelers with late night or early morning flights.

<Content>A bad option even in an updated room I stayed here with a friend in mid-February because, like most people who'd choose this, we had an early flight. Neither of us could believe what this hotel provides (virtually nothing) for what it charges (a lot). We had an updated room, so we didn't have the grossness problems. However, this hotel's idea of classy is to cover one entire wall of a very small room with floor to ceiling mirrors. Oh, please! To whom are these people catering? We were surprised there weren't mirrors on the ceiling.Believe it or not, this place doesn't even provide its guests with a cup of coffee in the morning. I mean, you'd be hard put to find a seedy motel that didn't realize THAT was de rigeur!We had booked a room for the end of our trip as well but cancelled it when we realized what this hotel thinks is adequate service. We stayed, instead, in Coral Springs--about 15 minutes away and an inexpensive cab ride--at a darling place for much less money (even considering the cab fares back and forth). That's what I'd recommend!

<Content>A very bad option I read all the reviews before booking here, but like most reviewers, we stayed here due to traveling circumstances, not because of preference. Since we were traveling with our 2 young kids in a group and had a very early flight, it was convenient to spend one night here.I agree with the negative reviews - we asked for an updated room (thanks for the tip!) but they were all taken. We got an outdated room that smelled horrible. Our friends got a room down the hall just as bad. I mean, smelled so bad you could taste it and wanted to gag. The bathroom was pretty updated, oddly, and was fine.I'm really not that picky (see my other reviews!), but I was really not happy with having my kids stay here. The carpet was matted and disgusting. There were exposed wires sticking out of holes in the wall where sockets used to be. I don't know how the room passed code/inspection?? The bedspreads had holes in them and were grimy to the touch. I wasn't comfortable walking barefoot in the room and I was really grossed out having my kids sitting on the bedspreads to watch TV.I saw another couple (strangers to me) leave the room directly across the hall from us moments after checking in. They told me their room was very dirty and hadn't been cleaned - beds were not made, dirty towels on the floor. Another room down the hall (also strangers to me) had a housekeeping staff member come to their room to spray some air freshener so they could stand the room. I couldn't believe I saw all this just on my hall during one walk to the elevator! It's really that bad.We honestly would have left and checked into another nearby hotel if it wasn't after 8 PM and we didn't have 2 exhausted kids with us.As other reviewers have stated - this is an option only if you are desperate to get to your gate very early. I thought they were exagerrating a bit, but they are right - only stay here if you absolutely must.

<Content>Renovated rooms are great! I checked in at midnight on New Year's Eve as part of a layover and desk staff was great. After reading bad reviews here, I asked for a renovated room which was very impressive! No problems and I would definitely stay here again for the convenience of walking out the elevator to my next flight.

<Content>Fine for a Night Definitely ask for a renovated room. Our room was fine...small but comfortable and clean. You could see some of the repairs and renovations, though, and the view was of a rooftop with pipes and air ducts everywhere. I think it was pretty expensive, but the convenience of being right in the airport was worth it. Especially an airport like MIA!

<Content>Not So Bad We stayed at this hotel 23 December {family of three} and found that it was not as bad as the reviews on the internet. Maybe we got a remodeled room. Our room was clean and quiet and not out dated, our bathroom was very nice and it was all marble. We had no issues with the heating or air conditioner which could be controlled in the room. We was very pleased with the service at the front desk and at the lounge. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Horrible! Convenience Not Worth It! My wife and I booked this place because of its convienience; we had a layover in Miami and this airport is actually inside the airport. One of the greatest travel regrets of our life. This Airport, which is run by the Miami Airport, is a textbook example of why government is inherently inefficient. The front desk people were very flip and rude, the outdated rooms reminded me of an 1960's Eastern European hotel I once stayed in. The alarm clock was broken. The phone in the room was broken (we had to call the front desk with our cell). We had an early flight so we asked that someone come knock on the door since they could neither provide a wakeup call (broken phone) or a working alarm clock. The security guard arrived 20 minutes after the time we had requested. Luckily we had a travel alarm. THIS PLACE IS THE WORST! AVOID, AVOID, AVOID!!!!!

<Content>Convenience This is about the fifth or sixth time we have stayed here. I doubt anyone stays here for more than one night, after all, it is IN the airport. But you don't hear any airplane noise and the convenience outweights any negatives. We flew in from LA and were on our way to a scuba trip in the Caribean so we had lots of heavy luggage. You don't have to schlep your stuff on and off shuttles, just take it upstairs. That is the major reason for staying here. We were there the night of Dec. 15.When we checked in they gave us a room where the airconditioner hummed rather loudly. We called downstairs and they sent up the bellman with a key for another room. That one was also bad. So this time we went downstairs to complain. They gave us one of the newly renovated rooms. WHAT A DIFFERENCE! Shades of beige, new beds and nice bathroom. Two double beds. Yes the rooms are small but there were 3 of us and its fine for sleeping. We took a cab to South Beach for dinner. Well worth the price. Such a convenience the next morning to just go downstairs and check in early without having to drag bags on and off shuttles.On our way home we missed our connection and the airline put us up at the Comfort Inn the night of Dec. 23. Back into the airport on the morning of Dec. 24. What a mess. I wish we had paid and stayed back in the MIA Hotel again. It's well worth it. By the way, their restaurant on the top floor is very good if you want a full breakfast away from the airport hustle and bustle.

<Content>Worse Place on Earth!!!! This was the most disgusting hotel we've ever stayed at! It was way over priced and filthy! We stayed here out of convienince since we had an over night layover for our international flight - we didn't want to have to ride a shuttle bus so thought this was a good option - biggest mistake of all time!

<Content>Overnight Stay at a Dated Hotel Stayed one night at this hotel after flying into Miami to catch an early morning flight out. The hotel is old and very worn, with very tiny rooms. The room didn't look dirty...but then again not all that clean to. They do appear to be attempting to fix up some of the rooms on certain floors, and this is very much needed. On a positive side, it is nice to be able to walk off your plane and right into the hotel without having to catch a cab or shuttle to an outside hotel. It is even nicer when you have an early mornign flight and can get to your gate with a small stroll from the hotel. The rooms were very well soundproofed - didn't hear a plane take off or land the whole evening and night.If you are looking for the convenience of a quick overnight stay and aren't too hung up on what your room looks like, how small it is, then this place is OK for you.

<Content>This is where airlines dump you if you miss your flight After missing our flight back to Tampa because our Cancun flight was delayed we were given a coupon by the airline to stay at this Motel. The airconditioning hardly worked as I had to set it to 45 degrees to get 74, the room smelled and the carpet was in a deplorable state. Only one of the three elevators worked. I was on the third floor and there was a big sign saying that they were under construction. Hopefully they'll work on more than just the hallways. I certainly would not pay to stay here. Wish I had pictures to send but I was tired and my lugagge was on its way to Tampa without me.

<Content>Avoid it We booked the airport hotel for the convenience of catching an early morning flight after a late arrival the night before. I had read the bad reviews, but knew we were only going to be there 6 hours total, so there werent a lot of options for us. Shuttling to off-site hotels would take too much of our precious sleep time.When I made the reservation I was assured that we would have a coffeemaker in our room. At check-in I asked about the coffee maker and was told that housekeeping would deliver it to the room shortly. An hour later and a call to the front desk with the rude reply that they dont have coffee makers and never did! They lied from the get-go. The room was dirty - ceiling paint peeling and water stained. Everything in the room was old and worn.A BAD experience overall. I would not put myself in that situation again!
