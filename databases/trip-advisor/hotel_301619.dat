<Content>Love The Okura I love the Okura, first stayed there as a kid and more recently on business trips. The decor is 70's but I think it's kind of cool. Have also stayed at the Westin and have been to the Park Hyatt. While these other hotels have excellent staff and very chic furnishings they just don't have the ambiance of the Okura.

<Content>Strongly recommend the Okura We stayed in the Okura for six nights during a fortnight's holiday in Japan last month. We chose the Okura after having popped into its lobby on a previous visit to Tokyo, and were wowed by the discreet Japanese 70's styling and ambience.Our arrival lived upto the Okura's reputation- our cases were whisked away from us before we had even stepped foot in the hotel and check in was personal and deferential. We stayed in the South Wing as the main building was fully booked. As previous reviewers have noted, the South Wing is a bit of a walk from the main building and involves a walk along a plushly carpeted subway and through an arcade of little shops, but we didn't find this an inconvenience during our stay. Our standard twin room was exceptionally spacious and clean. Whilst the decor had been subject to a recent upgrade, many of the fixtures and fittings were decidedly old school, but everything functioned perfectly. The bathroom, finished in marble, had a powerful shower over the tub and there was plenty of space around the sink and every kind of lotion and toiletery you could wish for. The opaque shower panel could have done with replacing as it looked very dated but otherwise it was a great bathroom. The bedroom, as previously mentioned was huge, with a sofa, coffee table, arm chair, big desk, endless draws, bedside cabinets etc which we appreciated as we don't travel lightly! The beds were reasonably comfortable, but not brilliant- the Okura haven't adopted matress pads and white duvets like some chains.Breakfast at the Camellia cafe was expensive but very good- excellent range of fruit, pastries, cereals and some unusual and very delicious hot options. Conceierge were exceptionally helpful and the public spaces a delight to spend time in- the Japanese 70's styling is incredibly contemporary and airy, and worth a trip even if you aren't staying in the hotel.After a week's touring the alps and a few days in Kyoto we returned for a further three nights stay at the Okura. This time we stayed in the main building, but on seeing our room decided to switch back to the South Wing. Maybe it was just the room we had been allocated, but it wasn't nearly as spacious as our first room, and the styling was all over the place- an odd mix of different furniture. Also the corrdiors were rather dingy compared to the South Wing. So our luggage was transferred to a room in the South Wing which was pretty much as good as our first room with one exception- the bathroom wasn't as clean as it could be with some strange marks on the wall and ceiling. A call to house keeping quickly rectified this. Such are the standards in the hotel that we were somewhat surprised that this had gone un-noticed but at least it was dealt with promptly and with sensitivity- they offered to give us another room and were highly apologetic.Overall, I would strongly recommend the Okura- its a great quiet and upmarket location next to the American Embassy and very close to the Kamiyacho Metro stop (the quickest way to get there is to exit the main lobby at the rear and walk through the delightful bamboo grove at the back of the hotel)We piad 24,000 yen plus taxes for a room (much less than the crazy rack rate) which we concluded represented reasonable value. If you value space and old fashioned ambience and service over the latest styling and facilities the Okura is definetely worth checking out. .

<Content>Nice quiet rooms I stayed here for a night and appreciated the large, quiet rooms. This is a giant hotel (we stayed in the south wing) yet the service was polite and personal. The room staff left meticulously folded origami animals on the pillows. The breakfast in the restaurant was workmanlike, little more, with a heavy emphasis on food for the western customers rather than locals.

<Content>late 60s design masterpiece with great service On my first trip to Japan, I wanted to stay somewhere with traditional character and style. Since I was on a business trip, I also needed the place to be organized and efficient. I was incredibly pleased to find that the Okura succeeded on both counts. The style of this hotel goes beyond anything I've ever seen, anywhere. Every single room and bar is an example of the best of mid-century modernism-- beautiful clean lines without being cold and sterile like newer luxury hotels. The Japanese element of the design is very strong, adding a traditional peacefulness to the modern lines. I ended up having a ball at this hotel just visiting all the different bars and feeling like a chic 1960s James Bond covert agent. If you are a fan of classic modern design, enjoy the company of unpretentious but distinguished older people (not too many hipsters at this hotel, though they'd love it if they knew about it), and have an appreciation for vintage, you'll love this hotel. As everyone else has said in the reviews, the service is excellent, the dining is good but expensive (probably not more so than other hotels in this range), and the location is convenient to metros and central Tokyo. The only thing I didn't like about the Okura was the gym/spa-- I found the steam room/sauna space awkward and unrelaxing and the temperatures all wrong. I visited a few other hotels while in Tokyo and they all seemed to be soulless and tacky compared to the Okura. The Grand Hyatt, for example, seemed so pretentious and new and boring that I couldn't wait to leave it to get back to the Okura's authentic charm.

<Content>Good, solid hotel The hotel is a bit outdated decor-wise, but the service, staff and attentiveness is superb. Some of the restaurants are a bit pricey, but by all means normal by Tokyo standards. The main sell is that you will not get stressed out at any aspect staying here. The rooms are clean, your complaints well taken care of, and the restaurants with good food and unpretentious service. If you are going to stay in Tokyo for a few days, this is one hotel I can recommend. The main problem is that it is quite far from public transportation (subways, railways) so you'll have to use taxis if you are in a rush, however, the service at the hotel is worth the inconvenience.

<Content>so peaceful This hotel, eventhough modern (70's style) shows Japanese character in it's serenity.The service is great, the rooms are clean.After my thrid stay in this hotel, I discovered their beautiful garden that leads to the back of the hotel, towards the metro station.I used to go through the parking before. (The parking is full with the nicest cars by the way!)This is a very nice hotel to come to after a day in busy Tokyo.

<Content>Can't fault it... I am lucky enough to travel to Tokyo quite a lot and I always stay at the Okura (South Wing). Colleagues ask me why when I can stay at one of the massive chain hotels, also on the approved list. The answer is pretty simple - you just cannot fault the Okura for price, location and for comfort.A previous reviewer commented on the decor seeming old fashioned. It's like stepping into my nan's living room with brown and orange geometric patterned carpets and 70s furniture. It's not true to say that it hasn't been renovated, though. Part of the beauty of the Okura is that they *do* renovate it every few years - they just keep it the same way and I kind of like that.Over the past few years, major chains such as the Grand Hyatt, Conrad (and most recently) the Ritz Carlton have opened up in Tokyo, but I am a big fan of the Japanese-style service at the Okura - honestly nothing is too much trouble, and the response time is ludicrously fast when you call for help - laundry, iron etc. The big chains and their attempt to instill some americana into Japan result in a dilution of the excellent Japanese service ethic, which as visitors will know, is out of this world, but very rule-bound.Top tip for frequent visitors is the Okura Club International which you can join for nothing and entitles bearers to free usage of the pool, showers and o-furo (bath) which you would normally have to pay for. In addition, you get two laundry vouchers for complimentary shirt wash and press (really handy) and a drinks voucher, which is perfect for a quick glass of wine before you hit the sack.I have spent many a night in the Highlander Bar which is possibly the tackiest Scottish theme bar in the world, but apparently a favourite of John Lennon and Yoko Ono (The Okura's Presidential Suite was home for the lovely couple during their time in Tokyo, I am told). Even if this is an urban myth, I don't care. I really can't imagine John and Yoko sitting amongst the crap Scottish memorabilia, but I hope it's true.I have only ever eaten at the Chinese restaurant in the Okura - To Ka Lin - and it is exquisite. Expensive though, but it is supposedly the best Chinese restaurant in Japan. Not sure about that - take a trip to Yokohama's Chinatown - but it is very good if you're feeling lazy and can't be bothered to venture out of the hotel.If you're heading to Tokyo, whether it's business or pleasure, I definitely recommend the Okura. 70s kitsch, crap Scottish bar - it's all good.

<Content>Awesome stay at the Okura Just had an awesome stay at the Okura this September, '07. Wished I could have stayed longer. I have stayed here on numerous occasions but this was the first time to stay in the annex wing. Request rooms here. I was on the tenth floor and had a MASSIVE sized room, great king sized bed and pristine clean bathroom. I found out that they have a membership program and I wished I had known about it some time ago. Impeccable service, always smiling and professional and a great book store on the B1 level offering a wonderful selection of books both in Japanese in English. I would have liked to try their spa services, but the pricing was a bit over-the-top for my budget unfortunately.Located in a great spot of Tokyo and next to Izumi Gardens which has a nice variety of restaurants and stores and walking distance to Roppongi if you really want to get involved in that nightlife.

<Content>friendly and refined The Okura has earned its reputation as the best hotel in Tokyo. They take excellent care of their guests, going out of their way to make you feel welcome and help you navigate the oft-confusing streets of Tokyo. The desk staff and the American guest liaison can recommend a restaurant or other destination, and then write out instructions for one of the many taxis waiting right outside the door. The rooms are extraordinary, very comfortable and roomy. I loved the classic lobby decor -- mid-century modern meets traditional Japan. The location is in a quieter, residential section of the city but within walking distance of the metro and other amenities. For business or vacation travelers, the Okura is a perfect choice.

<Content>Solid Business Hotel Near the US Embassy I have stayed at several Hotel Okuras, including Kyoto, Kobe  this one. All are great places for the traveling business man, they really know how to cater to your needs and anticipate. The Tokyo hotel is especially great for going on government business given it nearness to the US Embassy. Also good for the entertainment biz as some of the main players are nearby as well.The rooms are well appointed and have everything you need to conduct business on the road. They also have special plans to help eliminate jet lag!They also have some of the best dining of any hotel in Tokyo with a wide variety of choices.

<Content>Clean and spacious hotel If you are looking for spacious rooms in Tokyo, look not further. This hotel is massive with Main and South Wing. However, it is not worth what you pay. They sometimes have discounted rates on their site if you stay more than 3 nights so worth checking their website first. Also for 2 people, you will need to pay extra fee.Room is large, clean and bright. Quite hard to locate the safe but it's in the bedside table drawer. Hotel is very pleasant. Service is great but this is what you would expect in all top class hotels in Tokyo.Facilities are all there from Shiseido facial products to 4 pairs of slippers in room (2 leather and 2 material). You also get a bathrobe as well as a kumono style dressing gown. Good place to visit - Midtown Roppongi. New area with nice classy bars unlike the rest of Roppongi

<Content>Completely overrated, ludicrously expensive Ok - so there is 70's retro and then there is The Okura. They seriously haven't done anything since the 70's to this hotel and people thing that is fabulous and call it retro. This is by no way a 5 star hotel. Stayed in the South Wing, apparently the main wing has been renovated and is much better. It is so incredibly expensive and the staff are absolutely useless. I travel to Tokyo approximately 3 - 4 times a year for work and unfortunately have to stay in this hotel for its location and the fact that it is corporate preferred. Believe me......if I had a choice I wouldn't. Don't get me wrong - the rooms are ok and everything works....but you pay for anything extra (including your partner if they stay in the room with you!!... that's right.... if you don't mention there is two of you staying in the room when you book they flip out at reception and then add a premium to the room).An average hotel at a 5 star price. Unless you get a very good deal - I would seriously suggest against the Okura.Also, don't bother completing a comments / feedback card.... because they don't respond. I'm still waiting for feedback.Absolutely useless !!!!

<Content>Stayed 6 night, no complaints In February, I stayed 6 nights in the Main Building of Hotel Okura during a business trip, and everything was perfect.The room amenities were average to above average for this hotel class. The room size and bathroom size were pretty good for a Japanese hotel. The bed was comfortable, although not as nice as the new beds/pillows that the international chains have been rolling out over the last few years. Also, the ironing board was tiny, but the Okura provided free cleaning/pressing of one shirt for each night I stayed.Although the lobby and exterior had a decidedly 1960s-1970s look, the hotel was meticulously clean. In addition, the guest rooms (at least in the Main Building) look like they have been remodeled/renovated.Service was top notch. The staff was quick and friendly when I had questions but otherwise unobtrusive. No wonder the Prime Minister dined there during my stay.

<Content>Immaculate, but old fashioned I have recently come back from a 5 night stay in the Okura.This is a real old school hotel: immaculate rooms and service, spotless, efficient etc. If you want a modern boutique type set up, this is not for you. But if you want to be transported back in time, where service was the most important aspect of a stay, then go for it. I thought it was very expensive to be honest, especially all the extra ammenities (like internet access, breakfast etc.), and if you were in the main tower, a bit of a trek to the pool/gym, but hardly a major hassle. Full of Japanese businessmen and wealthy Americans. In terms of location, hard to really give a view. It is a long walk from Roppomgi, but a 10 min walk to the nearest tube, so not hard to get anywhere. But it is not close to a nice street with good restaurants etc. All in all however, it was a really positive experience staying here. A peaceful haven in the centre of Tokyo. Dick Cheney was visiting the US embassy next door when I was there - the place was crawling with secret service agents and police.

<Content>70's Heaven There is nothing not to like of this perfectly preserved and wonderfully retro Euro-style hotel that epitomizes exceptional Japanese service. It all works flawlessly and the location is wonderful - a short walk to the royal family's Palace, though perhaps a bit too close to the US Embassy. This is a hotel for when you don't care about the price and want to revel in understated 70's kitsch with perfect Japanese service. All the modern conveniences are there too in spades, so it really caters to both the leisure and business traveler equally well but be prepared to walk around to find all the attractions of this deservedly famous hotel.

<Content>nice, nice, nice! Hotel Okura is very nice. Staff is polite and we are entertained their clothe, for example yukata. I go to Hotel Okura every summer vacation because we can see and enjoy variety of drawings and pictures. The limited art gallery is interesting. I saw ukiyo-e when I was a high school student. This is one of good point about Hotel Okura.

<Content>One of my favorites I stayed 10 nights in the Main Building at the Okura this past November, and this was the 7th time I've stayed at the Okura during my dozen or so trips over the past 25 years. I always look forward to returning to the Okura, and it feels a bit like coming home after a long absence. I just love the place, but I realize it may not be everyone's cup of tea. It feels dated, kind of stuck in the 1960's, but it is not the least bit run-down. It does not have the glitz of a brand-new hotel, but that is what I love about it. It feels a bit like staying at the UN, with a very Japanese twist. I love the architecture of the place, especially the lobby of the Main Building. One of my favorite public spaces in the world. The rooms are quite comfortable, but the beds are too firm for my taste. I usually get an extra comforter and sleep on top of it for extra padding. Prices in the hotel are high, but fair considering it is Tokyo, and the high quality of the food and service. Although there is not much in the direct neighborhood, it is an easy walk to Roppongi and Akasaka with lots of great (and less expensive) restaurants. I do like the Main Building slightly better than the South Wing, and it is a shorter walk to the Ginza subway line. Despite the Okura's shortcomings, it is still one of my favorite hotels in the world.

<Content>As expected but with two experiences with sour taste.... This is my hotel of choice when I go to Tokyo on business because it is relatively inexpensive, is very conveniently located and very well known. I usually come away reasonably satisfied despite the age of the hotel and size of the room. I stayed for 4 nights this time round and overall, it was fine but there were 2 issues worth mentioning:1. The shower partition which is supposed to deflect the water in the bathroom just does not work. Everytime one uses the shower, the water goes everywhere. The bathroom has the appearance of being redone but not enough thought was given to try to make sure the splash is contained. For Japanese who tends to think of everything, this is off the mark.2. A more serious concern was the attitude of the girl who arranges the airport limosine. She appears to be Eurasian and her English is therefore good. But she was impolite and unhelpful when I asked her if I could get a ticket from TCAT to Narita (instead of from the hotel to Narita). Her attitude changed for the better when I expressed my displeasure. Her service was below par and compared poorly with hotels in the Asian region, let alone the high standards of service in Japan.That said, this will not deter my return to Okura which is a good value for money hotel, but will definitely avoid dealing with her. Big hotels like Okura are living off its old reputation and sooner of later, if they do not catch up, they will be left behind.

<Content>Very average I am surprised to see so many positive comments about this hotel. It really is nothing special and the service is actually quite bad. I have spent the last week in the South Wing (the newer - opened 1974). I'm sure that the hotel was worthy of its 5* rating in 1974, but it seems that not a thing has been done since.On three occasions this week, my room has not been serviced correctly and staff have been surprisingly unresponsive.The hotel is rather expensive (as is usual with 5* hotels in Tokyo), but really the service and facilities don't match the price.

<Content>A serene feeling for traditional Japan We stayed in the Main Building for 3 nights (4 days) in mid-April. My husband's business connection made the reservation at a corporate rate. The room was ample, with a good bath and amenities. The queen size bed was firm but comfortable. The hotel is huge, but as others noted, well-marked with signage and there are always staff to help. Breakfasts in the Terrace and Camellia are excellent. The sushi is fantastic. The teppan-yaki restaurant is also very fine. They have incredible wine lists and assortments of champagnes that are hard to find in most US cities. Nothing is moderately priced, but that's to be expected...it's a top Tokyo hotel. One annoying thing is that if you want to pay for a bar bill in cash (as opposed to sign for it) they routinely have not added the taxes, so a waiter will come running after you to get you to pay more (after you thought you'd paid and left a nice tip...). I finally gave up and just signed the bills...and got rid of my excess yen at checkout. The decor and ambiance are very 1960-1970 modern. One keeps expecting Sean Connery to come across the lobby on his way to meet Tiger Tanaka... Be sure to visit the museum across the driveway. There are free tickets in your room...it's a very nice art collection.

<Content>Service Is Superb My wife and I stayed for 6 nights during Golden Week. Due to difficulties in booking a room in Tokyo and Kyoto during this period, I had my co-worker in Shanghai go through her former PA in Tokyo to make the arrangements. We stayed in the original building The room had everything I look for, good light during the day, quiet at all times, comfortable beds, decent lighting, mini-bar and good internet connection.Service in the rooms, you know it's been done, you just don't know when or how. Concierge was very helpful in travel and cultural needs, English is not a problem. Business center rents out mobile phones for reasonable charges which can take your GSM SIM card and allow it to be used for calls within the Japan mobile system.Location is very good and is quiet and discreet. I found that it was an easy walk to Roppongi for night life and dining as well as to a number of Toei stops for access to the rest of Tokyo. Given how good the underground system is in Tokyo, we only used a cab when leaving the hotel for Kyoto.Hotel decor, bar and restaurants. The bar on ground floor is old school, dark and quiet, which I enjoy. Lot's of Japanese malt whiskey available. We ate at both the Tempura bar and the Sushi bar. Food, preparation and presentation were superb and decent value. Breakfast is served on the lower floor by the garden. It's primarily Western style with some Japanese available. It was quite crowded around 8:30AM when we were there but that may have been due to Golden Week.Not as flashy or new as some of the competition but a hotel I really enjoyed. It's on my preferred list for Tokyo above the Westin Ebisu which is a fine place and nice location, and the Dai-Ichi which is great value. Not on my list of places I have stayed, Park Hyatt which is expensive, in the middle of nowhere and unattractive Shinjuku (forget about Lost In The Translation, go for a drink and a snack-this location is for biz travelers only) and the Grand Hyatt which another grand Asian Hyatt, glossy and expensive.

<Content>Best service ever, anywhere My husband and I stayed at the Okura eight nights...We have so many words of praise for the hotel and staff that it is hard to convey here in brief.We highly recommend becoming members of the Okura Club International, which you can do for free via their website, because it really includes quite a bit of great free perks as one of the other reviewers on this website says. We also got fresh flowers put in our room the day after arriving. However, I would assume from our stay that everyone gets the same 5-star level of service which was just mind-blowing for us.We had quite a busy schedule so we didn't get to use the hotel spa/gym facilities, but we did eat breakfast in the Camelia Coffee shop and have drinks in the Highlander and Orchid bars. As an American, it is slightly unsettling to have a team of employees be at your whim and serve you as if you were their only customer. For example, when we were having breakfast, when our coffee cups became even just a bit below full, someone was ready to top them off! They also came and picked off the sugar packet wrappers from your saucer to make sure they weren't in the way! We had breakfast the last morning at the buffet in the Terrace restaurant, which is great in terms of choice. All the restaurants and bars are EXTREMELY pricey, but the level of service really does soften the blow.We stayed in the South Wing and yes, the hotel is huge. However, the elevators and hallways are all clearly marked and it really is not hard to get your way around. Again, the staff is always ready to help. One afternoon, my husband and I were going back to the South Wing from the Main lobby and it was as a staff member magically appeared to help us bustle our way through several hundred (literally here, folks!) Japanese business men coming from a conference room. The staff member prodded everyone aside and got us through the huge crowd.Our room was beautiful and spotlessly clean. The hotel provides you with slippers, yukata, luxurious toiletries, a hot tea pot with your pick of teas and fine china from which to drink it in. We also had a private fax machine with our own number that allowed us to send some faxes at only 50 yen per use-- unbelievable! Be forewarned, however, unless you have your own computer, Internet access is not friendly here....the webmail on TV is terrible and the business center is difficult to use. The beds are just heavenly, too, which is rare for any hotel in our opinion.The hotel decor is charming in its own right: it is a bit dated but it well upkept and it makes you feel as if you're in a bit of traditional Japan.The staff really go above and beyond at any time and with any question that you may have. They greet you at all times, and if you have any requests, someone appears at your door within two minutes apologizing profusely for the delay.All in all, the hotel really does deserve its listing in the Leading Hotels of the World....and we've stayed at a few in other places that didn't merit their listing. This hotel is sure not to disappoint in any single way at all. The service really makes you feel as if you have nothing to worry about and the staffs' English skills are truly above most of any other in Japan (as we experienced later in our trip).Five stars!

<Content>Love the Okura My mother and I stayed this hotel only for one night but our experience was wonderful. The room was not really big but nicely appointed. The entire hotel had very calm and relaxing feeling. The service was great. From the momemt you enter the hotel till you leave, you don't need to carry anything at all and the hotel people just lead your way.
