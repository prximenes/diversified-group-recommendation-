<Content>Delightful and friendly hotel Fantastic hotel. It may not be 5 star, but it certainly has 5 star staff at front desk. Extremely friendly and helpful. Hotel room looked a littel tired but had full kitchen facilites and close to Empire State Building as well as down the road from Macy's. Just far enough from the noise and lights of Times Square. Convenient corner store and surrounded by great eateries. Just ask the hotel staff for suggestions on where to eat. They did not steer us wrong. Excellent Thai next door Lemongrass, great Italian around corner. Barking Dog (next door) had great breakfasts. Laundry just across Lexington on 34th (same day at reasonable rate).Next time would ask for higher floor. On 13th but still heard the car horns.Could not ask for a better 11 day stay.

<Content>Great but not quite perfect Large comfortable rooms with great business desk and chair at a reasonable price (for NYC). The kitchen was very handy for snacks, breakfast.Loved the location (a) a calmer part of NYC but still near the subway, empire state building, grand central station, etc. If you like those hop on/hop off tourist buses, the empire state building is the closest place to catch them. (b) a number of good restaurants within 2 blocks (especially on 3rd ave. and 33rd street), (c) an easy $30 taxi ride from Laguardia. (d) the Murray Hill Market, a small market/deli just down the block was fabulous, and shockingly reasonable prices for NYC. Housekeeping did an excellent job, including all the kitchen cleaning, and they respected the do not distrub and please clean now signs.We had a couple of glitches:(a) the business office is just one PC in the very small lobby that you can rent for $6/20 minutes. The PC is locked down from a security standpoint, so anything beyond the most straightforward functionality will not work. (In other words I should have brought my own laptop and used the in room internet functionality). This PC can also be used for free to print your boarding passes which is a nice touch. The printer was acting up when we tried to use it but I appreciated the idea.(b) Our first night the heater did not work. The room started out relatively pleasant but got very cold while we were sleeping. We talked to the management who said that it was due to NYC regulations that if the outside temp was above a certain level (it was in the 50s while we were there) the heat could not be turned on. This sounded odd, but the hotel did get us a portable heater for the remaining nights for our stay, which we appreciated.

<Content>Great Hotel and good location We stayed at the hotel for nine nights in a studio suite. The room was spacious and clean the bathroom a good size and the shower excellent, the kitchenette is fit for purpose with a microwave, cooker, coffee machine and toaster along with basic cooking utensils nothing fancy but good enough to cook a meal in. The location of the hotel was excellent in a residential area with 24 hour markets, good restaurants and coffee shops around it. It is also close to the subway so is it is easy as a base to get around from. The staff on the whole were good particularly the housekeeper we had on the weekdays. Overall I would recommend the hotel and happily stay at the hotel again.

<Content>Huge room, quiet location We stayed here based on the reviews on Trip Advisor - it's a great place, but I feel like it's a bit over-hyped.The rooms are massive - loads of empty floor space - and they have proper kitchens and large bathrooms. There's about 20 light switches, all with dimmers, which I found fascinating because I have the brain of a 4 year old. There's a spacious fridge and an actual gas oven in the room, though ours was busted (couldnt get the pilot light to come on - we didnt need it so we assumed it was off for a reason and left it).The hotel lobby and corridors are cramped, which makes the size of the rooms a nice surprise. The 2nd floor seems to be dedicated to the spa and gym - we didnt use those, but we did nose around it a bit... I queued for the lobby ATM surrounded by the Milwaukee Bucks basketball team, which was great (the hotel is big on its fitness - they even have a menu of pillows that do stuff to you in your sleep).Internet is through the TV - shockingly, the only non-HD TV I saw out of 4 American hotels on this trip (not even widescreen, I was aghast...) - and cost $10 a day, so I stayed away from it. Also, the keyboard was broken, and we had to get an engineer to fix it.Food comes from the next door Barking Dog restaurant, it's not proper room service food, but it's cheap-ish and very large portions. Nice place for breakfast.Careful with the bathroom taps - my girlfriend turned one too far left and it broke, nearly flooding our room... the engineer who fixed it was cool though, seems it happens often...Location-wise, the hotel is strange. It's on the same street as the Empire State and Macys, yet somehow feels out of the way. The subway is 2 blocks away, which isn't too bad, and there's a lot of places to eat nearby. I felt like it was oddly quiet, being so near the touristy stuff...Overall, the hotel was a joy to stay in - hugely comfortable, well located, quiet and with average staff (they were a bit dismissive, but not offensively so...) - it's not perfect, but it is a good luxury place to get away with your boy/girlfriend...

<Content>Superb Hotel We booked the Affinia Dumont based on the positive reviews we had read. If anything, they were understated!When you arrive at the hotel, the reception and lobby area can be a bit underwhelming!But the rooms were huge with two massive beds, a fully equipped kitchen, good bathroom with aveida products and TV with as many channels as you want!Brilliant location, about ten minutes walk from Macy's and 20/25 minutes walk from Times Square! Great bars and restuarants around the corner, and watch out for the Murray Hill Diner for breakfast! You come out of the hotel, look left and there is the Empire State Buildind staring at you!But it's tha staff that really makes this hotel; you are the most important person on the premises! For example, on New Years Eve, I bought a bottle of champagne and asked at reception for some champagne flutes to be sent to the room. They arrived before I did! The reception desk, concierge, and the doorman could not have been more helpful.Local telephone calls are free so you can book restuarants from the comfort of your room.Overall, a wonderful experience, a nice quiet location within walking distance of most attractions!I can't wait to return to the Affinia!

<Content>Very nice hotel Afer reading the reviews, I decided to book Affinia Dumont. I am glad that my decision was right. Loved the room. the decoration is modern and clean. Beds are very comforatable. Quiet, luxury and personal. You feel just like at home. the Kitchem helps too.One thing surprised me most the the shear size of it. Hugh for New York.Location of the hotel is good. I basically walked to Time Square, Empire building, UN, Broadway. There is one super market just two blocks away. Subway is also only two blocks away.Now I wish my room had view.The staff could be a little more personal. I just thought they were professional, literally and precisely. too little business like.

<Content>Very good Hotel, but not luxury We two adults and child stayed Dec 25-26th for first trip to NYC. As many reviewers mentioned, hotel staffs were very friendly and helpful. That's great. I have never seen any hotel staffs like that so far. We had a room, studio two bed. At a glance, the room is a little bit old and not luxurious. But room is large enough for us, cleaned and well maintained. Kitchenette with large refrigerator was very useful. Bed with selectable pillow was comfy. Desk was large enough for work, chair was good for me. There were many lighting in the room, brighter than any other hotel I have ever stayed in the U.S. Negative thing was the internet fee. Overall, I was satisfied with Affinia Dumont.

<Content>Very good hotel I spent 3 nights over there with my wife just before Christmas. We had a very good time in NYC. The Affinia Dumont is a very good hotel in every aspects: good service, clean room, good amenities, great location, etc.But this just isn't luxurious (why is it rated top of the world Luxury?!?). It's very good, not great.

<Content>A1 accommodations, great value I stayed at the Affinia with my wife for one night to celebrate her 40th birthday. We go to New York frequently from PA, but had never stayed over. For about $250, we got an ample room, kitchenette, modern furniture and fixtures, lights on dimmers throughout and a choice of pillows off their pillow menu. The Affinia also offers workout kits for runners and yoga -- I believe at no charge. Everything was clean and operable. Subway is only two blocks away. And for runners, you can catch the path along the East River, which is only two avenues to the east. I'd come here for business, too. Outstanding value and location in midtown.

<Content>Adequate but no more Just come back from a stay at the Affinia and it was ok but not great so disappointing as we were there for Christmas day.The good..... The room was clean and a good size for a city hotel, and the bed sheets were clean although the duvets do not have a cover just a sheet under and a sheet over. The fridge was helpful and whilst there was an oven we would have had to request cooking utensils and so did not bother.Ok location easy to get to other parts of the city as not far away from Grand Central.Donut shop next door, grocery shop on corner and starbuck only a block away.The not so good.Emailed the hotel three times prior to arrival and recieved no reply so not off to the best start.Everything was probably available in the hotel however we would have had to continually request and so became too much hassle and as it was Christmas we did not want to have our stay tainted by the hassle. We changed the temperature in the hotel each day and each day it was changed back so each time we returned the hotel room was cold, really annoying when travelling with young children.The windows internally were filthy and were long overdue a clean. There was only coffee in the room or overpriced hot chocolate. I choose to buy tea however it smelt of coffee when made in the hotel so I choose to use Starbucks at the end of the road.There were not enough towels for the number of guests and they were hard and grey and definately could do with replacing.There was no Christmas atmosphere and only a small tree in the lobby, we fortunately took our own tree for the room otherwise we would not have known that Christmas was happening in the lobby or halls of this hotel at all.To sum up our stay was ok not great, would I go back... probably not until the hotel has had a refurb as it definately needs one as it is starting to look very tired.If your booked then go it will be fine as this hotel obviously has nicer rooms than ours from the other write ups however if you are considering this against another hotel then I would opt for the other. We booked through priceline and so the rate was ok. In fact that would be my overall word everything was ok, but who wants ok in such a fab city?

<Content>Lived up to it reputation Checked the reviews for this hotel before booking a last minute long weekend in New York and wasn't disappointed.Great location - within walking distance of the sights but in a quiet area. Bar frequented by locals and there are delis, pharmacies etc. on the doorstep.Studio room for three of us was spacious, clean, quiet and functional. Online Concierge service useful to book transport, pillows etc before arriving. Don't book a car back as it is much cheaper - $50 cheaper to get a taxi from outside the hotel.Will definitely book again.

<Content>Great place to stay in the city!!! We stayed at the Affinia as part 1 of our honeymoon. When they were informed of this, they made sure we had a corner suite on a high floor, and even comp'ed us a bottle of champagne! - much appreciated! I read some of the other reviews about this hotel that included complaints. Those must have been aberrations outside of the norm for this place. We had great robes provided in the room; the staff was friendly, attentive, and very quick to respond to requests.The hotel has a somewhat small footprint, making it feel less than luxurious, but the amenities and service are all there. Stay here.

<Content>What a great find! We were a family of 4 -2 adults  2 kids. We booked directly with the hotel and got a better rate with them than lastminute.com! It also meant we could get all our questions answered by a human being. It makes all the difference. They were great.We had a room on 21st floor but with the King bed it wasn't really suitable. Reception staff were most helpful and agreed to move us to a higher room which had a fantastic view of the Chrysler Building. The facilities are great - great Queen beds and a large sofabed in the sittingroom with a TV directly facing it. My son thought he was in heaven and we sometimes had to chase him out of bed and away from the TV! We used the kitchen for breakfast nearly every morning. All the staff were helpful and cheerful. When you first arrive the outside appearance of the hotel is initially disappointing as it is low key. However once you meet the staff and enter the lobby that disappears and it is great from start to finish.We thought it was great value and the location is superb. A word of advice- Don't do what we did for the first few days. We always turned left on exiting the hotel...heading for Empire State and Macys direction. Make sure you also turn right..there are great restaurants on Third Avenue. We would definitely stay here on future trips to New York. Thank you to the staff in Affinia Dumont.

<Content>Brilliant stay! Just got back from four nights at the Affinia Dumont. Can't praise it enough. It was a special occasion (which the hotel knew about) - they left a bottle of champers in the room, which was v sweet of them. The room was lovely - quality decor, nice chair, two large beds (two of the three of us slept in one). Bathroom nice and modern. Aveda toiletries. Full kitchen! (Stove, oven, microwave, big fridge). The only tiny niggles I can think of are that a) there was no kettle (just a coffeemaker - so we couldn't make tea) and b) there was no Xmas tree in the foyer! (Other hotels had completely gone to town on theirs, but then again they were much pricier!)The location is great - bars and restaurants nearby (Patsy's pizzeria is good for a buzzy atmosphere, cold beer and pizzas!). It's within walking distance of the Empire State Building, downtown, and, if you like walking, uptown. Would definitely stay here again. Found our rates on Lastminute.com - they were still high, but that's the case everywhere in NY in the run-up to Xmas, and you get what you pay for!

<Content>Loved the Affinia Dumont! Fantastic hotel, brilliant location, helpful and friendly staff. We stayed here for four nights in early Dec. Room was spacious with a lovely view over the East River with comfortable beds and pillows. Location was brilliant - Murray Hill is a lovely safe neighbourhood and round the corner was the Murray Hill Diner which was great for the big American breakfast!! Less than a 10 minute walk to Empire State and Maceys. Would highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay here again!! Just one tip though - As with all hotels in NY, ask for a room on one of the upper floors to minimise traffic noise....Enjoy your stay!

<Content>WOW! What a hotel! WOW! What a hotel! When we checked in we were told we'd be getting a different room to the one we were allocated and we were so glad because we had an amazing view of the Chrysler Building. Candice the receptionist was more than helpful from the moment we checked in, to the moment we left and actually seemed sorry to see us leave. Even the maintenance staff were friendly and helpful when our room safe locked us out - only 10 minutes from phone call to fixing! The hotel itself is only 10 minutes from Macy's, Empire State Building and Times Square. If you're looking for somewhere to stay in New York, look no further!

<Content>Carol  We stayed at the Affinia Dumont for 4 nights starting 24th November 2008, it was out first trip to NY. We were upgraded from a Studio Bedroom to a Junior Suite on the 31st floor because we were celebrating my birthday. The staff on reception were amazing and always very helpful. The room had great views overlooking the Crysler Building and was very quiet. The room was spacious, warm and very clean. The bed was really comfortable and the linen crisp and fresh. The hotel was situated in a very convenient position. It was a short walk to subways, The Empire State Building, Times Square, Macey's, Bryant Park (The Pond), within walking distance was also Central Station and St. Patricks. We will definately be staying at the Affinia on our next visit to New York, we could not fault the Hotel, Staff or service we received.

<Content>Great Location Great location - 5 mins to the subway that takes you either way to Blommingdales or Soho.... perfect! 10mins walk to Macy's - easy to walk to Times Square too.We had breakfast at the Gemini Diner (as per a previous recommendation on 2nd Ave and 35th)... was really good for someone looking for a typical american diner experience. Guy and Gallard good for breakfast too.Staff very helpful and really nice too. We had a problem with the heating and it was fixed no problem. Room quiet apart from the toilet (?) cistern, but I'm a light sleeper and it didn't bother me at all so I didn't complain.Of the 3 times I've stayed in NY, this was by far the best location and the room was huge (and we only had a studio!)

The thing that was amazing tho is the staff - i have never met hotel staff who were so friendly efficient and fun! They could come to Ireland and teach us a few things. Highly recommended.

<Content>Highly Recommend the Affinia Dumont as a lovely, mid range hotel. My husband and I decided on the Affinia Dumont having had a recommendation from a colleague who told us that it was middle of the road, fairly central and that it did not cost the earth. We booked the hotel through their website and asked for a room with a view, on a high floor. We mentioned that we would be on honeymoon and said that we would welcome any special treatment they wanted to give us. When we arrived, we were greeted by a very friendly staff member who told us that we had been given a beautiful suite. We were delighted when we arrived at the suite to discover a panoramic view of the Chrysler Buidling on one side and the river on the other. The room was a good size, was clean and in good condition. The room cost us 1,800 us dollars for five days, which was a little more that we had inended to spend but we definitely felt that we were given value for money. We had a wonderful time and could not complain about the Affinia Dumont.

We both loved the hotel, the room was excellent with fridge, mini bar, even a complimentary umbrella which proved useful! The king size bed was HUGE, everything was clean and the room was a good size.We had breakfast at the Barking Dog next door a couple of times, this was perfectly pleasant but there was a great deal of delis and diners around to choose from which I preferred overall. The staff were very helpful, particularly the concierge who gave us advice on good places to eat around Murray Hill. I had read Murray Hill wasn't an exceptional neighbourhood but we found it perfect, close to the subway, easy walking distance of Macy's, Times Square etc if you aren't too lazy, great little supermarket next door that does lovely coffees, cakes, etc - I would avoid the Lemongrass Grill next door though, had a horrible incident with some sticky rice and a rather large cockroach!!Overall, Affinia Dumont will be my hotel of choice for future trips to New York.

<Content>Clean, comfortable, convenient, would recommend Trip was with my two daughters, my 75th birthday gift from them. We stayed 4 nights. Our room was clean, lovely, beds comfy. View wasn't great but certainly interesting. The hotel staff was extremely friendly, efficient, courteous and helpful. When our return to JFK shuttle did not show up for our 4:30AM pickup, the bellman quickly arranged for a cab, the cost of which was actually a little cheaper. Taxi fare to and from JFK is a flat rate. I would not choose the shuttle again. The desk clerks even printed our Jet Blue Boarding passes for us.If you don't mind walking, the hotel is fairly convenient to transportation, Macy's, Empire State Bldg., etc. Even though we had done our homework and were well provided with maps, etc., we weren't prepared for the confusion of making our way on foot. We booked tours on NYSightseeing buses and used these as our transportation as well as subways and an occasional cab. If I had it to do all over again, I would probably just use cabs. More expensive but so much quicker and NO WALKING! We wasted a lot of our time trying to figure out which way to go. Didn't get to see nearly as much as we would have liked to. We enjoyed dinners at the Barking Dog Restaurant next door and Caliente (Mexican) Restaurant around the corner on 33rd. Prices were very reasonble. There is a 24-hr deli/convenience market on the corner with everything you could possibly need should you choose to use the well-equipped little kitchenette in your room. There is also a diner around the corner on Lexington with fairly decent food. Lots of other choices nearby we didn't have time to try.

<Content>dissapointed with the Affinia Dument I was dissapointed with the Affinia Dunont especially as i thoroughly did my research on this hotel. After reading rave reviews and the hotel being highly recommended by trip advisor i thought i was going to a fantastic hotel. Be warned the Affinia Dumont is not that special, if you want a comfortable bed in a quiet area then the Affinia Dumont is great. However, my room smelt like smoke and a little bit musty and there wasn't a room available high up with a good view. The lobby wasn't too well kept either it was a bit shabby and it was tiny and didn't have enough comfortable, clean chairs. Although the staff were friendly enough.For the price that we paid for this hotel i would have expected a bit more luxury. My friend and her family stayed at the Hilton near to Rocker Feller Centre and thoroughly enjoyed it (maybe i should have listened to her!) The moral of the story is don't read too many reviews!!!!!

<Content>Under par: check other options. I had high expectations for this hotel given the reviews on this web site and that it's recommended by some very good travel agents, I'd expected somewhere that's well used and well run; I was disappointed. The Affinia Dumont is not all that good.Generally, the hotel is very well situated for connections around Manhattan. Murray Hill is relatively quiet for New York. The concierge team are really very good but are let down by an inconsistent front desk that left me with the impression that I was an inconvenience to be fobbed off on a number of occasions. The rooms are a decent size and, especially for larger parties, present good value for money. They're 8/10 clean but suffer from dust. Ventilation is not better than OK but the windows will open slightly. You may get a view. The decor is tired. In terms of facilities outside your room, there's a little used, well kept gym of +/-200 square metres, a similar sized lobby area with pay per time internet access and, adjacent, the Barking Dog restaurant which is convenient but worth missing given what the city has to offer. It serves over sized portions of motorway service station food.This is not a luxury hotel despite what you'll read in other reviews.My girlfriend and I chose the Affinia Dumont because I was running the NYC Marathon and wanted a larger room than is typical in the city and access to a kitchen which proved handy once we'd called reception a few times to get some pans. A good friend stayed there at the same time with five family members. We stayed 11 nights.Specifically, I have a number of complaints about the hotel. We'd flown with my friend and one of her party. On arrival, the other four, who travelled on an earlier flight, had not been allowed access to their room. A pensioner, young woman and two teenagers were left to wait over six hours. This is despite the hotel having our credit card details and names on a secured reservation. The concierge team excused the attitude and lip we were offered from the reception as their being temporary staff. The following day, my friend and her family were offered a few bagel breakfasts in the Barking Dog in recompense.It took three times of asking for someone to come and fix the plug in our bath. Our room suffered from 24/7 noise from the lifts which stopped my girlfriend from sleeping. I called the reception to ask if we could change rooms and met half baked excuses without being convinced that anyone had tried to see if we could move. On our departure, we鈥檇 asked for a late checkout because our flight was mid-evening. The first receptionist asked said that this would be no problem. The second receptionist said that the hotel was fully booked for rooms of our type but we could have a late checkout, half the afternoon, for the price of half a day. The third receptionist was emphatic that the hotel was fully booked and there was no possibility of a late checkout. The board in the basement by the housekeeping desk showed that there were more departures than arrivals and under 70% occupancy. If it鈥檚 the hotel鈥檚 policy to charge for late checkouts, this is understandable, it鈥檚 a business. Being lied to for no reason and not even very skilfully at that, ruined the last day of my holiday. I did not feel happy signing over nearly 6000 dollars at the end of our stay.Check out other options to the Affinia Dumont if you鈥檙e staying in New York. The city offers a lot of choice and this hotel is not putting in enough effort to take your holiday money off you. It鈥檚 really under par.

<Content>Great Location, Great Stay We stayed at the Affinia Dumont for six nights in November. After reading the reviews on this website, we were very excited to stay at this hotel considering the price was average with other hotels in NYC.The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful when we checked in. We didn鈥檛 have a room with a stellar view, but they offered to put us in another room on a higher floor the following morning. We didn鈥檛 want to move rooms after our first night, but their willingness to accommodate our request was refreshing.Our suite came with two queen sized beds, a large desk and kitchen. The kitchen is a huge BONUS! There is a small market store just steps away from the hotel and we picked up cereal, milk, yogurt, fruit, etc. and kept all of this in the fridge. We managed to save a bit of money by eating breakfast in the hotel before we ventured out each day. The kitchen comes with a full sized fridge, microwave, dishes, small oven/stove and full sized sink. We even brought back leftovers from dinner one night at the nearby Lemongrass restaurant (great Thai food) and ate it the following evening, again saving a bit of money after a long day of sightseeing.The hotel has a very large gym and spa  even offers 鈥榝itness packages鈥?which are free for guests to use. We also had a 鈥榩illow menu鈥?in our room which gave approx six options of pillows that could be requested through housekeeping. They even had a pillow that had speakers built into it to be plugged in to an ipod. We ordered the Swedish massage pillow and a buckwheat pillow 鈥?great fun  great perk at this hotel.A couple of negative items 鈥?The Barking Dog restaurant is not good at all. We went there because we had read on this site that it was pretty good and affiliated with the hotel (they provide the room service) but after eating there were very disappointed. There are a number of restaurants, pubs, etc. at the end of the block to the east of the hotel. Just take a few more steps down the block past the Barking Dog to other restaurants 鈥?or even head a few steps to the west to the Lemongrass restaurant.Internet at this hotel is also not free 鈥?we paid $42 for five days which is very pricey. Also, bottled water in the room is $7 per bottle. You are best off going to the market next door or even the drug store at the end of the block and getting a few litres of water for a couple of dollars.All in all, our stay was great. The Affinia Dumont is in a wonderful location and is a very comfortable hotel. We would stay there again and recommend this hotel to friends and family.

<Content>What a SWEET stay! I have stayed here before and always liked it. This stay, however, was really superb. I asked for and got a room on the 37th floor with a view of the East River that I shall never forget. The room was slick and stylish. The Spa staff was top notch and the front desk attractive and attentive. This is the neighborhood for real New Yorker Wanna-bees. There are good non-tourist restaurants all arround. Play in Times Square but sleep in Murray Hill. I have stayed often at other Affinia properties in NYC.Each has its own character but all are fine homes away from home. Michael B,/Baltimore 01Nov08

<Content>Absolutely Fantastic Just back from a five day stay at this hotel and I can definately say it is by far one of the best hotels I have stayed in .  The level of service from all members of staff from the reception to house keeping was second to none - nothing was too much trouble . In particular a guy named alex was so helpful in recommending resturants and always really nice and polite. The hotel itself has a nice relaxed and genuine feel to it aided by the excellent staff .A handy pack with maps and information about places to visit was given on checkin . The room we stayed in was on the 18th floor , very spaceous room with excellent views ,a useful kitchen with a fridge and coffee maker , lots of storage space, a safety deposit box and air cond .The room also had an alarm clock which again was useful - especially adjusting to the time change . Beds very comfy and showers excellent . Even though the room was high up , traffic noise wasnt a problem , you couldnt hear a thing . Rooms serviced every day with fresh towels , linen and toiletries . There is a nice bar , the barking dog next to the hotel which we went into a few times for drinks before we headed out , nice cocktails and very friendly staff .  The shop next to the hotel has everything you would want , we got breakfast stuff here one morning and sandwiches another . The Murray hill diner is nice as well for breakfast /lunch although does get very busy and very warm but the food excellent value . There is also a larger supermarket/pharm on the opposite side of the road handy, for water as they do the 4 ltr bottles .We used the sub way which is a few minutes walk from the hotel and got taxis back later at night to the hotel . On check out we where able to store the bags and a gentle man by the name of nelson was very helpful in arranging a taxi to the airport . The computer in the lobby is comp for printing the boarding cards and checking in . When the taxi arrived to the airport I was very surprise to find it was a streached limo which was definately worth the money and a nice way to end the holiday .  All in all this hotel is definately worth every penny and I would recommed it to everyone .

<Content>Couldn't have asked for anything better! The hotel exceeded our expectations. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful.Always happy, not fake. We had beautiful rooms, with even better rooms. It had a excellent location, right in the heart of downtown. Very good for travellers wanting to see it all.Every time we got back to the hotel fresh fruits and iced tea awaited us. We learned to appreciate this as the days got longer and we had been walking for hours!The menu was great, food was great and had so many healthy delicious options.I've never written a review for a hotel before but feel obligated to after such great service!The only negative thing I can think of is the room service screwing up our breakfast order. Silly things, they forgot someone's bread and another persons juice. It was silly, and there was a delivery charge! HUH !Anyway, but trust me totally worth it.Excellent, excellent, excellent trip. It was one big part of the trip we knew we had nothing to worry about!Thanks You!

<Content>Great Hotel We stayed in this hotel for a week, it is a bit pricy, but then all hotels in Manhattan are. The location is excellent, it is central enough to be within walking distance of all the main attractions, Empire State Building, Times Square, 5th Avenue shops, etc but not bang in the middle of them so there it is quite quiet. The room was excellent, huge kingsize bed, kitchen and plenty of space (unlike some of the more cramped hotels that some of my friends have stayed). The staff were all very friendly and helpful. We were there for our wedding and they helped with some of the arrangements such as hiring a limo. It was room only basis, but that is fine as there are plenty of dinners, cafe's and coffee shops nearby and I can recommend Guy and Galliard on the corner of Lexington and 31st for a very good and cheap breakfast (their Eggs Benedict was excellent!!).The only thing that stopped me giving it 5 out of 5 was the price, but as I have said all the hotel rooms in Manhattan are expensive, so that might be a bit unfair on the place.

<Content>Great location and an excellent NY base We stayed here from 25th to 28th October. Picked it based on Trip Advisor comments and were very pleased with the choice. As others have noted the location is great - well sited for most of midtown with the Subway very handy and plenty of local amenities including the deli and some decent restaurants. Barking Dog was ok but we only ate there once given the number of alternatives within walking distance.As for the hotel we stayed on 18th floor - nice double aspect room with good views to both East River and the Chrysler building. The bed was superb - really comfortable, and the pillow menu was a nice touch. Kitchen was nice if basic - we used the fridge for storage and the coffee machine. Only negative was that the windows were rather dirty which made photos difficult as we couldn't open them.The hotel laid on a small reception one evening - just some nibbles and wine which was pleasant, although we didn't really get to meet any of the staff. Reception staff and concierge were pleasant and helpful. Overall we would definitely stay there again and recommend to others.

<Content>Wonderful place to stay My wife and I stayed at the Affinia Dumont from the 5th to 10th Oct 2008 and our family also stayed there in a separate room. We were in New York to be married and the hotel staff were excellent with us. From the moment we met the concierge we knew we'd picked the right place and if first impressions are anything to go by then we were very happy. The one worry i had before travelling was some of the negative reviews about old carpets. I didn't ask, but the room we stayed in the carpet's were good and clean - perhaps they've had a refurb?The hotel room itself was really big and clean with separate lounge and bedroom. Bed was very comfy and we had a newspaper delivered every morning. Shower and bathroom were great and never had any problems with appliances failing etc the whole time we were there.The view of the Chrysler building was amazing and you could almost see river to river.The hotel was ideally located for us - 5mins walk to ESB and Macy's, 15mins to Grand Central and 25mins to Times Sq.Subway just one block away.Something to remember is the internet in the lobby is free if you only need to print your boarding passes for your flight out of NYC.We only ate breakfast at the Barking Dog bar/ diner once as we much preferred the Murray Hill diner around the corner. Go there!The Murray Hill market store on the corner is also a plus.I appreciate that some travellers may feel differently and have their own opinions, but the staff we met all had a smile and could not do enough to help us. Their kindness and consideration really helped make our stay in New York that bit more special. Thank-you so much.To sum it all up - we searched and searched the internet for a good hotel when planning our trip, but next time we go to NYC there won't be any need to because we'll be going back to the Affinia Dumont.

<Content>Brilliant Just returned from six nights here... we loved it. Staff are friendly but discrete, rooms very large (biggest I've stayed in @ NYC for this price) with a great fully stocked kitchen. Location is great - a ten minute walk to Macy's etc.I'd recommend popping next door to the local shop/deli for basic foods (also do great sandwiches). The 'Murray Hill Diner' across the road (turn left out of hotel, cross road  walk to far corner) does a great US breakfast  bottomless coffee for about a 拢5.Overall - we could'nt fault this place, really great, for the best deal contact the hotel direct by phone, if your UK Government or military you'll get a great price (we saved 拢30 per night on the best internet price).Eamonn  Yamini London, UK

<Content>Good Location We have just returned from a 4 night stay at this hotel that I booked for my boyfriends 30th Birthday.The hotel is in a good location for sightseeing, shops and subway - we walked almost everywhere, only catching the subway once to go to the financial district. We tended to take cabs if we didnt want to walk as they were easy enough to get and cheap, if a bit hair raising at times! As this was a birthday present for my boyfriends 30th, I had requested on booking through the hotel website, a high floor room if that was possible, we were to be staying in a Junior Suite. Upon arrival we were given a room on the 8th floor which unsurprisingly had no view, we asked to be moved to a higher floor and were accomodated but had to take a smaller room and were not refunded the difference in price. I had also requested that some toiletries and pillows be in our room on arrival, all of which were confirmed but none of which arrived. I eventually had to phone the front desk and ask for them to be sent up.I had also had tickets to Wicked delivered to the hotel. I asked for them on arrival but was told they had not arrived, I asked again the next day and still no sign, finally after numerous calls to the ticket agent, I eventually found out that the tickets were indeed with the front desk staff. I phoned to ask for them and miraculously they appeared. This is not what I expect from a hotel of this standard.On my boyfriends birthday, I asked for balloons, cake and champagne to be left in the room, and it was there waiting on him after a long day at Woodbury Common. The cake was huge, chocolate and very nice, and the wine helped us along nicely as we got ready for dinner at the River Cafe in Brooklyn.The hotel was comfortable, well located, the staff friendly - but I would not rave about it. It was a good base for what was otherwise a fantastic trip, but I couldnt help feeling a bit disappointed, like there was something missing. I felt that without the view, I simply could have been in a hotel in any city anywhere in the world. Having said that I probably would stay here again - the rooms were big, the view when we got it was amazing and the location was perfect, and at least if I do go again I know exactly what to expect...

<Content>Hmmmm, were we in a backpacker's nightmare? Well, with great anticipation - to some extent, stoked by the raves we had read on 'Trip Advisor we arrived at the Affinia Dumont. The reception was gracious, welcoming and our room was really nice - big, luxurious. Noisy though - facing the street. We were happy, until a few nights into our 6 night stay, when the English(?) 'Trustafarians' (i.e. rich little girls) next door to us decided to 'party' and party and party for several very loud nights. Sleep eluded us because of the drunken, speedy raving and shrieking which kept us awake for most of two nights. Obviously their expensive educations did not include consideration for others and good manners. We complained to the management who were very apologetic, offered to shift US to another room (like, hullo, were we the problem?) which after a night of hell, we eagerly accepted their offer . (We shifted ourselves though - not the best service in a hotel of this calibre).We were offered compensation for our excrutiating experience in the form of a breakfast voucher and later, after we took this matter up with management, were offered a refund for a night's accommodation. We did appreciate these gestures.However, this was a trip of a lifetime for us. We went way over our usual budget to have a 'luxury experience'. This we did not have.We did note that our room 1104 had an adjoining door, which should have rung alarm bells. We also noted a door shaped foam squab under our bed, presumably for use in the door cavity, between the doors, to deaden the sound. It appeared that this had been a problem for former guests.I think the moral of this story is that one cannot 'buy' a good experience. Avoid Room 1104.A real shame, because it is a nice hotel.

<Content>Great Hotel We were celebrating my wife's birthday and I organised a trip to New York, I read Trip Advisor and thought this was a good hotel. Now I can add to the praise of this hotel - I asked for a room with a view and got a great room looking over the Chrysler Building - Fantastic.It is also so near everything you can walk to the Empire state and 5th Avenue. The staff were so helpful and told us where to go and which was the best route etc. It is also very close to Macys which was bad for my wallet but my wife really enjoyed herself. The room was very clean the bed was huge and the bathroom and kitchen were also cleaned to a high standard. I can't much more than book the hotel you will not be disappointed.

<Content>Everybody happy our first trip to nyc with our sons and this hotel provided everything we all wanted. great location, quiet area, very friendly staff, nearby markets to ease the cost of eating out and great views. having two boys in a room for any period of time can be taxing, but the junior suite provided just enough room and the great view eased the boys cabin fever as they spent most of our in room time checking out the view, the helicopter landings, the window washers, etc. the staff greeted us each time we came or went and the boys had us take photos of them with their favorites. we chose this hotel based on trip advisor reviews and were not let down.

<Content>We couldn't have been made more welcome! So, I'm taking my mother-in-law to NYC for a girlie shopping weekend, and it's her first trip to America at the age of 74 - and the first thought I have is where on earth should we stay? Certainly not near Times Square (too noisy), and not Downtown (not enough shops), nor on the Upper East / West side (again, not enough shops!) - so we went for the gorgeous area of Murray Hill where the Affinia Dumont is based - and both the location and the hotel turn out to be PERFECT - a quiet location, but just 15 minutes walk from Macy's!Just to put some perspective on the almost unanimously positive reviews for this hotel - it's fantastic, but not because its a luxury hotel (it's not, it's a solid 4 star, well set up for business or leisure travellers with large rooms including huge desks, a kitchenette, and a lovely views for the higher floors ) - the reason for the reviews are because the Affinia Dumont staff (on the front desk, concierge, spa, door etc) really take customer service seriously. They are definitely the most genuinely helpful hotel staff I have ever come across (and I travel a lot), and they seem to really enjoy their jobs which shows because they make the effort to welcome you to their hotel and city with such enthusiasm.I can honestly say that although NYC was fabulous as always, the Affinia Dumont made this trip a holiday of a lifetime for my mother-in-law. Thank you to everyone we met, and I'll definitely be back.

<Content>Nicest hotel we've stayed at in NYC We've stayed in maybe 10 different hotels in NYC over the last 3 years -- the joys of having a child in college in the city. We usually go as cheap as possible -- given that all the cash goes to pay for college.We picked a one bedroom suite at the Dumont for this trip because with our daughter along we would have had to get two rooms at a regular hotel. So the suite was less expensive than 2 rooms at pretty much any other hotel. The place is very, very nice. We wouldn't think twice about going back when then the economics work out.One thing to consider in the one bedroom suite -- the bathroom is entered through the bedroom. So if somebody is sleeping on the sofa bed and they want to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, they have to go through the bedroom. This was just the slightest bit awkward for my daughter but worked out okay.Again, I wouldn't hesitate in the future.

<Content>In a word....FANTASTIC! Just got back from a 5 day trip to NY with 2 friends and are so glad that we had chosen this hotel.From the minute we checked in to the minute we left, nothing was too much bother for these guys. We had a 2 bed suite on the 32nd floor and the view was simply breathtaking. Location wise we found it perfect as it's in the mainly residential area of Murray Hill. Nice and quiet although still only 10 minutes walk away from the Empire State Building and Macy's. The subway's just 1 block away on 33rd Street and right on the corner of Lexington and 34th is the fantastic deli, The Murray Hill Market. Open 24hrs it's got just about everything you'll need. Only slight niggle about the hotel was the $9.95 per day for Internet access but apart from that we can't fault it. Don't know when I'll get back to NYC but one thing's for sure, I won't be wasting anytime looking for somewhere else to stay. Well done team Affinia Dumont...keep up the good work!

<Content>Brilliant Hotel We spent 3 nights in the Affina Dunmont and absolutely loved it. We were on our honey moon and were upgraded to a suite and there was champagne waiting in the room on our arrival. The check in was quick, the room was beautiful, really clean, comfortable bed, a little kitchen, gorgous bathroom. Always fresh towels. The concierge were great so helpful and the resturant next door, I think its called the Barking Dog was gorgous, really cheap and great food!!The hotel is so central, about a ten minute walk to macy's. There is not one fault I coulld find with the hotel, I would recommend it for anyone young or old and I will definatly be going back!

<Content>Ok stay at the Affinia Just returned from a trip to the US which ended with a 5 night stay at this Hotel. We booked it based on the trip advisor recommendations. It was the most expensive accomodation of our trip which given that it was New York was to be expected.We thought it was well situated and given that the weather was lovely, we enjoyed many walks to and from the Hotel. The subway was not far away either.Our room was on the 33rd floor and had a fantastic view of the Chrysler Building. The room was a good size although the bathroom was quite small and basic and overall for the money I thought it was a bit disappointing. The lobby and corridors were nothing special.The staff on the front desk were very courteous and helpful. On checking out we felt a bit pressurised by the doorman to book a taxi through him back to the airport for a fixed price.Not sure if we would return.

<Content>Perfect location With great reviews and a fabulous deal thru hotels.com, my husband and I opted to stay at the Affinia Dumont during our vacation to New York. I must admit, I expected a bit more. Check-in was a breeze, and all staff was very friendly, but I expected a little above and beyond after reading all the reviews.On the positive: great room size and loved the full-sized frig in the kitchen. Perfect location: a block away from a subway, half-way point between Wall Street and the museums, and close the the UN.Did I mention the super-friendly staff?Bummers: awful in-room coffee (as in any hotel) - with the horribly wasteful one-cup coffee maker, thereby impeding my ability to buy coffee grounds locally and brew my own. Lobby coffee was not available early (0630), either. We resorted to buying coffee from Guy  Galland every morning (so much better than Starbucks). Our neighbors opted for coffee from room service.Another miss: I was hoping for some sort of summary of what was going on in New York that week. I've gotten something like this while in Toronto and Washington DC, and sort of expected it in New York. We did get a magazine telling us what was going on in the Fall, but I think a 1-page summary would have been a nice touch (and a way to generate revenue for the front desk for tickets to shows, etc).We'd stay here again, but not if we had to pay full-price. With some changes, though, they could move from Above Average to Excellent.

<Content>Great choice!! Our (young couple without kids, 6 night stay) stay at this hotel was great. The room was big! Big super comfy bed, desk, sofa and little kitchen included. Staff was overall friendly and willing to help you with all your requests. Rooms were cleaned daily and with great respect for the little details. It was nice to come back to this nice relaxing room after a busy day sight seeing and shopping in NYC. Loved the view of the Chrysler building, especially at night. Only a short walk from the empire state building. We will def. stay here again!

<Content>Best Hotel in NYC! I stayed at Affinia Dumont 29/9/08 - 6/10/08 in room 3504 and i have to say it was the best hotel i have ever stayed in! Prior to arrival i asked for a room with a good view on a high floor. After a very brief check in, i was shown to room 3504 and the view was awesome! It was facing the most beauitful building in the city, the Chrysler Building! Perfect view day and night. The room itself was huge with a big, comfy bed and pillows. The room also had a kitchen which was fully equipped. The room was serviced each day. In the lobby, fresh fruit was available each day as was ice tea/coffee. The hotel is about 5/10 mins walk from ESB and a further 5 mins from my wife's favourite store, Macys. Ideal location, in a safe, residential part of town. Would stay here again, without question! All staff very friendly and helpful. Excellent hotel, cannot say any more!!

<Content>I have lost my faith in Trip Advisors' ratings Why the Affinia Dumont? My wife and I have been going to NYC on business twice a year since 2003 and have noticed a huge increase in prices for hotels across the city. OK, in 2003 NY was still suffering post-911 and prices were relatively cheap but the present economic crisis seems to have by-passed hotel owners in NYC so far.I mention this as I was looking for a hotel in the US300-400 a night range (still expensive enough, in my opinion) and the Affinia Dumont was like a beacon. In my price range, No. 6 in Trip Advisors' classifications, and a Travellers Choice winner in 2008...how could I go wrong?I booked thru Aerlingushotels.com for two nights. Don't get me wrong because the hotel wasn't bad...but No 6 on Trip Advisor and a Travellers Choice winner ? Not so sure...The front desk were courteous when we checked in but did not explain any of the hotels facilities to us. The hotel is known as a Fitness Hotel but I was told nothing about this. It has a Spa but again, I was told nothing.The rooms WERE big by NY standards but a strong air freshener odour made you wonder what smell are they trying to hide? And 34th Street is one of those busy Thru Streets in NYC so traffic was a little noisy but, again, jet lag took care of that.Couldn't fault the bed - big and comfy... Rooms decor was a little dated but not a big issue for me.Overall, we had a pleasant stay but the gold standard for value (by NYC standards), room size, and location remains The Sofitel.

<Content>Wonderful Location-Right by Subway Station My husband and I were visiting NYC for the third time this year and didn't want to do the Priceline.com thing again. This was the cheapest hotel there was available for the long weekend. The staff was incredibly nice, from the front desk staff to the doormen. The room was clean with great views, there are a bunch of bars and restaurants one block away on 3rd Ave, the 6 train stops one block away on Park Ave and being on 34th street you can walk almost anywhere in midtown. The area around the hotel is very safe. If I was staying for work I would have brought my workout gear as the hotel is fitness-centered. They have fitness kits available for use during your stay if you don't want to use the gym. I will be staying here again and recommending Affinia Dumont to friends.

<Content>Top Quality Hotel My wife and I stayed at the Affinia Dumont from 25th Sepember till 29th September 2008. When we confirmed our room booking i asked for a high room with a view of the Chrysler Builbing. This was from recommendations by previous Trip Advisor Travellers. We were told by the hotel that they could not guarantee this as the hotel was fully booked. However on arrival we were taken to Room 2904 and we were not to be disappointed. We had one of the most spectacular views that i have ever seen The Chrysler Building and Midtown New York lit up in all its glory. A magnificent sight to go to bed to at night. The hotel was spotlessly clean, the staff were professional and courteous. They even have a pillow menu 5 different types of pillow from soft to hard never had that in a hotel before. The hotel is only 4 blocks from The Empire State Building about 5 to 10 minute walk. About 15 minute walk to Macys and 20 minutes to Times Square/ Broadway. Contrary to reports before we went we found taxis to be clean quick and reasonably cheap. We used one from JFK to our hotel it was cheaper than the train (4 of us were travelling ) 45 dollars which is the standard rate to anywhere in Manhatten plus a 4 dollars 95 cents payment for a bridge toll. A deli that i can recommend for breakfast is Cafe Metro great value and everything cooked fresh and to order in front of you. It is on the corner of 370 Lexington 41st a great start to the day. And anybody wanting a great steak try Juniors at 1515 Broadway and 45th street a famous New York Steak house we had a 20 oz Sirloin with all the trimmings.

<Content>A bit of a mixed bag! My now wife and I wanted a good hotel to stay in after we disembarked in New York from our transAtlantic voyage on the QM2.This was our honeymoon so we wanted everything to be just right. Extensive reading of the reviews on Tripadvisor gave us a short list and in the end we selected the Affinia Dumont. Having booked and paid through Expedia many months ago I emailed and telephoned the hotel, explaining our circumstances and requesting a room on a high floor with a view towards the Chrysler Building. On arrival there seemed to be no record of that request and we were given a suite on floor 24 overlooking the East River. Our inital impressions of the suite were not too great. The decor and furniture were very dark and drab and we did not have the view for which we had hoped. The bathroom was extremely small.However, the suite was otherwise very spacious and had a full if tiny kitchen, a mini hifi system, a large wardrobe between the two rooms and a huge and very comfortable bed. On inspection, we found the drawers in the fitted bedroom furniture to be very dusty and the cleanliness in general seemed less than ideal. There was thick dust on the skirting boards adjacent to the bed.However, the suite was pretty quiet, being away from the 34th Street side. The only exception was the very loud slamming of doors on our floor.During our stay we found the front desk staff to be very helpful and the bell staff were outstandingly helpful, cheerful and polite. It always felt good to get back to the hotel after a busy day sightseeing or shopping. The room had always been adequately serviced in our absence.The Murray Hill area is very pleasant and we ate in several neighbourhood restaurants and thoroughly enjoyed each of them. The convenience store on the corner stocked all we needed to make our own breakfasts.We didn't use the Spa (we walked miles in the city every day as it was!) or the Barking Dog bar/grill next door so cannot comment on them. We got through three sets of electronic door keys during our six night stay. Apparently they tend to fail if placed near a mobile phone or credit cards, or if subjected to the extensive security screening that we went through going on to the Liberty/Ellis Island ferry, a helicopter ride or up the Rockefeller Center or the Empire State building. This seemed a bit feeble to us.Our other negative comments were about the lighting in the sitting room in our suite. Too dim to read by once the curtains were closed. And very old fashioned CRT TVs which made the (chargable) TV internet almost unusable.A couple of days before departure I booked an SUV to take us and our rather extensive baggage to JFK. Bang on time, a stretch limo showed up! Luckily the driver squeezed most of our bags in the trunk and took one up front with himself!Would we stay there again? Probably. The location and size of the rooms really suited us and we liked the attitude of everyone on the staff we encountered. The subway is a very short walk away and 34th Street is home to both Macy's and the Empire State Building. Could it be better? Absolutely. Our room was definitely tired and in need of some brightening up.

<Content>Another good Affinia experience We were here 2 nights in a studio suite and highly recommend it to families, business people, or people looking to stay far away from the madding crowds, you're close to Park Ave. shopping to the West and the UN to the East.We stayed at the Affinia near Penn Station once and what a difference, this one in Murray Hill is much quieter, a little newer, and fitness themed - too bad we didn't take advantage of their exclusive fitness packages.-Kitchen is dated but serves the purpose (no paper towels so we had to buy some)-work area is fantastic, but didn't like the extra internet fee of $9.95/day; this is standard at the Affinia hotel chain but when will these high-priced hotels catch up with the standard hotels, like Days Inn, where internet is FREE??-bathroom small-king bed ULTRA comfy-fantastic views; be sure to ask for a higher floor-spacious suite for NYC hotel standards-front desk service satisfactory-location is great for restaurants and Barking Dog Cafe next door rocks!

<Content>Fabulous Affinia Dumont stay We stayed at the Affinia Dumont for 6 nights and had a really great stay. On arrival at around 1.30pm, the receptionist said that they had a room on the 4th floor but that if we were willing to wait an hour or so, they would have rooms higher up in the hotel. We weren't sure what the benefit of this was, but she explained that it might be a little quieter away from the street noise. This was great, we went off to lunch and came back to a room on 19th floor. Our studio room was large (particularly for Manhattan - we've stayed at 70 Park Avenue before - a wonderful hotel, but tiny rooms), with an enormous bed, a desk and a fully equipped kitchen. Not that we were intending to do any cooking - but ideal for buying and storing your own beers/wine in the fridge and making hot drinks in the morning (and for bringing back late night pizza after a Broadway show!). The room was impeccably cleaned each day. The staff were friendly and knowledgeable and went out of their way to make sure guests had a good time. There's a full range of gym and spa facilities which we didn't get a chance to make use of as we were out exploring NY and getting our exercise by walking, walking, walking........ The hotel is perfectly place in Midtown, making it easy to get around on foot to most places. We would definitely recommend this hotel and would go back and stay there.

<Content>Crummy resolution to reservation problem Let me just say that the rooms are beautiful with tons of room. They are clean and well appointed. We are a a family of five: parents, 2 boys and a teenage girl. We booked the room a few months in advance and PREPAID THE ENTIRE CHARGE. We specifically requested one arrangement: 2 Queen beds in the bedroom with a sofabed in the living area. We were given confirmation via email that this was to be the deal. Upon walking into our room we immediately noticed that there was the sofabed but only one King bed in the bedroom. We called the front desk and were basically told that there was nothing else available and that they'd give us a rollaway for our daughter. They might be able to move us and all of our stuff the following day. Well who wants to do that??? Especially with 3 kids and all their junk?! I was shocked that they didn't offer us a discount or some other comps. Nothing but a bottle of crummy, no-label red wine. Blech. We have stayed at the Affinia hotels before and loved them. We just felt like they were rude and basically, we had to take what they could give us. Stinky.

<Content>SO WORTH IT! Just returned from a long weekend in Manhattan and the accommodations at the Affinia Dumont far exceeded my expectations. Check-in was a breeze - - the clerk smiled through the entire 5-minute exchange and the bellman took our luggage promptly, telling us a little about the hotel and general area. The neighborhood (Murray Hill) is wonderful with small shops, lots of pub/restaurants and Gristedes, a lovely grocery where you can find anything you're looking for! Our studio suite was just that, sweet, but the toilet wouldn't flush. No problem! After maintenance showed up (fast!) and decided there wasn't a quick fix the front desk gave us another room, upgrading to a junior suite which was even better! Extremely roomy complete with a separate (fully stocked w/pots, plates, glasses, silverware) kitchen, this was our home away from home. We had a fantastic dinner at the Union Square Cafe Friday night, then Saturday night we just picked up some things from Gristedes 2 blocks away and had a picnic in our cozy, beautiful room. We could have saved maybe $12 a night parking at a different lot, but I felt my car was safer with Affinia and a few $$$ wasn't worth the worry. Each and every person we came into contact with at the hotel was friendly and efficient. Our unit was immaculately clean and the furnishings were plush. The bed was incredibly comfortable! We couldn't have been happier with the accommodations and will stay only with them whenever we travel to NYC. I've heard horror stories about other hotels, both from friends and from reviewers, and I feel confident that the Affinia Dumont will take good care of us next time too!

<Content>Good location, desk and lobby service excellent!! We stayed at the Affinia Dumont for 10 days in September. The front desk staff were excellent. Any requests were dealt with immediately. The lobby staff , doorman etc, were very attentive, friendly and helpful. The elevators were readily available, unlike most hotels. The area has some good restaurants and buses and subways are close by. We loved the size of our room, 3701 but found it rather worn. The cleaning service was not always good. We had to ask for a few improvements and a food spot on the fridge was there our whole stay. We also had our door opened early one morning when we forgot to put the sign out. She was rather annoyed with us . The phones in the sitting area and the bathroom were not clean and the windows and mirrors needed a good cleaning. We did not complain at the time because we thought the cleaning staff might have been resentful of us. The rug in the bedroom was always damp from the air conditioner so I think this would create an environment for bacteria to grow. Other than some cleaning issues we loved the hotel. It is, however, quite expensive and it is not a 4 star hotel. Another thing to note. The one bedroom has the bathroom in the bedroom with no entry from the living room. This means anyone sleeping in that room has to pass through the bedroom to use the bathroom. We should have asked before booking.I can't, however, say enough about how well the front end staff treated us.

<Content>Good, relatively quiet location with great staff We stayed at this hotel on the final 2 nights of our US trip (25 - 27th August) as we wanted to try the Murray Hill area; lived up to previous reviews - yes, it is 'quiet' compared to other areas of NY but is still within walking distance of 5th avenue, 42nd St and times square.Despite booking via Priceline we were given an upgrade to a suite on the 30th floor; fantastic panoramic view of the Chrysler Building and the river.This hotel is a spa/sport hotel with an in-house spa/sauna/pampering suite. Fresh fruit is in several areas of the hotel and is complimentary within the apartment. Pleased to find 2 large complimentary bottles of water in the suite. Used Room service once; was excellent and good value. The restaurants either side of the hotel looked good value.Hotel staff were very helpful and genuinuely friendly.All the other hotels we stayed at had free internet access; this was the exception, aside from when we wanted to confirm our return flights. Overall we certainly enjoyed our stay at the Dumont.

<Content>Excellent experience - reviews are correct My boyfriend and I stayed at the Dumont for 5 nights from 3rd September 2008 and we were very pleased with the choice. Emailed the hotel prior to arrival asking for a room on a high floor and were given the 36th of 37 floors - room 3607 has a view of downtown and the river. Stayed in a studio suite with a king bed - the smallest of their rooms I believe - yet this was ample for us. Bed was huge and very comfortable, there was a desk area, an armchair, sufficient wardrobe/closet space and drawers - the rooms were well designed to make use of all areas but by no means small. The bathroom was a decent size with plentiful towels and replenished Aveda toiletries and had both bath and shower. All rooms have a kitchen area, for us this was just a good place for storing drinks and snacks but for people with kids or on a tight budget this could be more useful - kitchen had a microwave, full cooker, large fridge/freezer, coffee maker, pots and pans, crockery, glassware, cutlery and even little things like a corkscrew. Being so high up we did not hear any noise from the streets below but can confirm the old air conditioning units are noisy - in the heat of the city though it proved invaluable and we soon got used to it. The hotel is in Murray Hill - this is more of a neighbourhood so we felt we were experiencing the real city rather than just a tourist area. For breakfast every day we headed to and really enjoyed the Murray Hill Diner, it is around the corner on Lexington and 33rd Street. They offered a vast choice, large portions and it was really cheap - their breakfasts proved to be a great start for the day ahead. Next door to the hotel was a 24hour store/deli where you could stock up on practically anything you needed. We ate at the restaurant linked to the hotel, The Barking Dog twice - this was purely for convenience but the food was decent, portions were large and average priced. On 3rd Avenue and 34th Street, literally within a few steps of the hotel, there were an abundance of restaurants and bars - tried a few and again food was fine, especially liked Cinema. Prospective guests should be aware you can make requests direct to the hotel by using the My Affinia Concierge facility on their website - you can request anything from free toiletries, choose from the pillow menu, ask for free fitness kits for the duration of your stay, book trips and excursions, make special arrangements for birthdays anniversaries etc and arrange transportation to and from the hotel. This was a really good facility and everything we asked for was in the room upon arrival.Staff were friendly and helpful - whenever we asked for anything or just sought advice they were prompt and precise.Overall we enjoyed our stay and cannot think of any real faults - the hotel is worthy of its position and reviews on Trip Advisor and without a doubt we would definitely stray here again.

<Content>a new favourite hotel I really like this hotel. I used to live in NYC and go back 2-3 times a year for a visit. I sometimes stay with friends but when I need some free time, I will stay in hotels (or with friends who come to visit), so I have sampled quite a few. I have been to the Affinia 50 and the Dumont and I like both but, on a push, prefer this one. Partly for the location, partly because it is that bit bigger, has a nice gym and great views. The staff are really great, the rooms a fabulous size for NYC and there is a sense of space about it. It is more modern than say the Casablanca, which TripAdvisor readers tend to really like, and I actually like it better. It does not (at Dumont but at 50 they do have a wine/cheese) have the added food/drink extras for free but it is NYC and half of hte fun is getting out for breakfast or to find those little wine bars....Also the barking dog adjacent to the property is fine and there are cafes all over the place nearby. It is located close to the Empire State building but really handy if you (like me) prefer heading lower eastside for going out. It is just handy for most everything including trips in/out of JFK and LaGuardia (as it is on the East Side). The rooms that are lower and facing 34th are likely to be a bit noiser, but always ask for a higher room and facing one of the side streets and it is fairly quite. The best part, though, are the staff who are really lovely. Oh and if you are a gym person (and I am) it has a really good hotel gym. The costs are medium for NYC, not way over the top, but not cheap. If you book correctly, you can get a better rate than say the Casablanca (which is smaller, tends to book up quicker and rates go up higher and faster). Again, I like the Casablanca (really) but if you like something a bit more modern and spacious, this is your place. If you want a smaller hotel and will take advantage of the eating for free (bfast) and drinks/cheese in the evening then Casablanca might be a better choice.

<Content>A hospitable staff = a fantastic hotel experience I originally stayed at the Dumont in 1999. When my husband and I were planning our NY trip, I recalled how much I'd enjoyed the Dumont almost ten years prior. When I saw an image of the famous Degas statue outside the hotel on Travelocity.com, I knew we should go again. I am so glad we did: its midtown/Murray Hill location is ideal for going EVERYWHERE in Manhattan, for starters. The 33rd and Lex subway stop is just a block away, and walking to the theatre district and Mad Avenue are easily done from here.The suite-style rooms are large and accommodating, and it was very quiet and pleasant both in the hallways and in terms of street noises.What impressed me the most about the now-upgraded Affinia Dumont was the staff. Every single staff member we met took the time to greet us directly and even learn our names, and all treated us with kindness and respect. No anonymity here...(Side note: after coming home, I discovered I'd left my FAVORITE pants behind in our room. Dana from Housekeeping found them for me, and they are now being FedExed as we speak. Very grateful for this!)So if you are planning to stay in Midtown Manhattan anytime soon (and you really should: NY is incredible!!!), I highly recommend the Affinia Dumont. You will be glad you did...

<Content>Loved the Dumont We have just returned from 5 nights at the Affinia Dumont. We stayed in a wonderful 1 bedroom suite, we had decided to treat ourselves and it was well worth the extra money, the rooms are huge. We asked for a room on a high floor and was allocated a room on the 28th floor with a lovely view over the river. I cannot find anything to complain about other than receiving a bill for minibar items which we had not had, however, on booking out this was dealt with and the charge was deducted from our bill. A lovely hotel in a great location and if we visit New York again we would not hesitate to stay here.

<Content>love this hotel!!!!! What a great stay we had at the Affinia Dumont! The people were very friendly and helpful. I requested a top floor and boy, did we get it! We were on the 37th floor in a corner room with an awesome 2-sided view. Sunrise over the East River was lovely...I would recommend this hotel in a heartbeat. Lovely rooms (spacious for Manhattan) and the Murray Hill Market next door was convenient for snacks and breakfast foods. I can't say enough about this place!!! Just Stay There!!!

The location is in a residential area so there are plenty of bars, restaurants and shops nearby. The staff at the hotel are really helpful and friendly.

<Content>FAB stay at the Affinia Dumont! We decided on the Affinia Dumont after seeing the reviews on tripadvisor and I can say that we were not dissapointed. The rooms are large and comfortable with the little kitchenette coming in very handy to store our drinks etc. The beds are really good to sleep on ensuring a brilliant nights sleep. Be sure to ask for a high floor room and you will get a great view. Room 3606 which is where we stayed had a fantastic view across the Hudson river and Queens.The Murray Hill area is great having stayed on 34th and 7th on my last stay in NYC this was a vast improvement. Just come out of the hotel and turn right go down to the crossing and there are an abundance of lovely bars and restaurants which I think is rare to come across in NYC as everything is so spread out.Whilst we were there (myself, sister and friend) we went on a night out to Gordon Ramsey's restaurant at The London. This is highly recommended the food and service is second to none and the barment Mike and Greg were amazing at welcoming you too. I will definitely be staying at the Affinia Dumont on my next return to NYC as it did exceed my expectations and the staff are warm and welcoming which all adds to the enjoyment of the stay.

<Content>Worst attitude and customer service My family travels to NY frequently for business reasons. We stayed at the hotel in January 2008 for two months. The front desk staffs are generally very nice. However, several staffs in the house keeping department and several evening managers have the worst attitude and customer service. Several times, we put up the privacy sign outside of the door, the housekeeping staffs ignored the sign and came in without our permission. In addition, one of the evening managers talked to my family in an extremely disrespectful and demeaning manner. My family's experience is extremely unpleasant due to the manager's arrogance and attitude. Its customer service is not what we have expected from a mid to high-end hotel. We received the worst customer service in this hotel out of all the hotels we have stayed in New York.

<Content>Super hotel I booked the hotel through hotels.com and got a great rate at around $250 a night for the king studio. Overall, the hotel was one of the best I stayed in.The staff was wonderful at the hotel, especially Chris, the night doorman. The staff was very helpful and tried their best to help whenever possible. There was always iced tea and fresh fruit available in the lobby.The rooms were not as big as I expected, but I hear that is so for New York. There was a fridge and kitchen with dishes and pots and pans. The air conditioning was a bit loud, but that would be the only complaint. I'd recommend staying on the side that does not face the street if you want quiet. I stayed on the 11th floor facing the back (not the street). While there was no view, it was very quiet, and I was able to sleep in even though I am a light sleeper. The best thing is the hotel has self-service laundry in the basement, so we were able to do our laundry prior to our next destination. The beds were very comfortable.The location of the hotel was great. It was about a 3 to 5 minute walk to the subway. The Empire State building is a few blocks away as is Macy's. This is a great place to stay at, especially if you are traveling with children. The kitchen ends up to be convenient.

<Content>Excellent choice Excellent stay at the Affinia Dumont. Great location on 34th off Lexington - easy walk to Empire State Building, 5th Avenue and shopping. Staff was extremely helpful and pleasant. Stayed in a junior suite, which had two queen beds, full kitchen and bath. Nice and quiet after a day in a very busy city. Also has a great spa feature. Overall, great value for the money.

<Content>Great Hotel! Can only reiterate the other comments about this hotel: good sized rooms, friendly and helpful staff, great location. We spent 6 days here at the end of August with 2 teenagers. We had booked American football tickets which had been sent to the hotel and they had these kept safe for us, I had requested a room on a high floor and we were given one on the 26th with a good view and all our pillows from the pillow menu were sitting on our beds when we arrived!! The deli on the corner was great for teenage snacks and it was handy having kitchen . Would use this hotel again and recommend it.

<Content>It was just Okay After reading all the great reviews on trip adviser, I decided to book the Affinia Dumont. I must say..I was not overly impressed. It was very clean and spacious. However, nothing special at all. We left at 9am Saturday morning to do some shopping in the city and we came back at almost 2pm and our beds were still unmade. We had to ask twice the night before to have the sofa bed pulled out and made up before they finally did it at around 830pm. Barking Dog Restauraunt was awful. I was hesitant to eat there but figured how bad could breakfast be? Don't waste your money! Burnt pancakes,flavorless hash browns and chunks of cheese not melted in the omelette.

<Content>Fantastic The Affinia was a great hotel; large spacious rooms with plenty of storage. The kitchen was really useful and the full sized fridge was fantastic and really convenient. We requested a room on a high level prior to check-in and were pleased to see that this had been accomodated when we arrived. Our room had amazing views of the Chrysler building and the East River and was really great; the bed was huge and the bedding was very comfortable. Fresh towels were delivered every day as well as the morning newspapers which was a nice touch. The staff were always very polite and always on hand to offer help with directions and travel information. The Barking Dog diner is really convenient and offered great food (breakfast especially) at a great value-for-money price. The hotel is in a great area; approx 5 minute walk to the Empire State building, 2 minutes to the nearest subway station (33rd and Lexington) and a short walk away from some great little bars and restaurants on 3rd avenue. I would definitely stay at the Affinia again and would recommend it for a guaranteed great stay in Manhattan.

<Content>Amazing From the staff in the hotel, to its location and proximity to the subway this hotel was the best! Clean rooms and very pleasant staff this hotel was just amazing. Christopher the doorman was very pleasant all the time and really was helpful about New York information. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking to go to New York. It feels like it is in the heart of the city and easy to access everything. My only concerns were the high cost of the Internet. When rooms are that expensive I would think Internet would be a great bonus! Additionally, a few days the room was not furnished with any face cloths so we were forced to use hand towels to wash.

<Content>Excellent Hotel Just got back from 4 brilliant nights at the Affinia. Looking at all the reviews before we left i was expecting it to be good but it was even better than I'd hoped. The staff are very friendly we were given a room on the 25th floor with great views over the city. It was a Junior Suite and bigger than I'd expected. Location in Murray Hill gives you easy access to Grand Central (10 mins walk), the Empire State, 5th Avenue and the subway (at 33rd St). Its also a nice quiet area which is great after a day of seeing the sights.. We came for the US Open Tennis and are already planning the next trip back using the Affinia as our base.

<Content>Great hotel!! This is a great hotel. The staff- esp Paul and Juber- were extremely friendly and helpful. It is very clean and we felt entirely safe. After a busy, noisy day sightseeing its great to come 'home' to a quiet hotel. It's hard to believe its just blocks away from Times Square etc.. The fully equipped kitchen and market next door saved us tons of money. No question-we would stay there again!!!

<Content>Lovely Hotel with great service I stayed at the Affinia Dumont with a friend on a shopping trip. Stayed there for 7 nights and found the overall service great. The rooms were cleaned daily with fresh towels given each day! The staff were very friendly and happy to help with any questions you have. The location was great for us.... less than a 10 minute walk to Macey's. It's only a 2 minute walk to the Empire State Building. I preferred this hotel to my previous stay in New York, as there was very little noise from the street and the rooms were a bit bigger than the average hotel in New York. We had 2 great double beds with amazing pillows. (pillow menu is provided). The kitchenette was a good add on, but we didn't really use anything apart from the fridge. I'd definitely go back to the Affinia Dumont.

<Content>Great Hotel Just got back from New York City and a five night stay at the Affinia Dumont. I was travelling with two children, ages 12 and 14, and stayed in a one bedroom suite. The hotel was clean and in a great location near restaurants and markets, but close enough to walk to most tourist attractions. The rate was very reasonable, the rooms were large (my friend from NYC came by to visit us and said it was bigger than her Condo), and the kitchennette allowed me to save money on breakfasts and snacks. I have nothing negative to say (other than there is no wireless internet service so you have to pay to hook up by cable), and would most definitely stay here again. I was lucky to find a great New York hotel with reasonably priced suites.

<Content>Perfect!! This was our first trip to New York and we wanted to stay somewhere pleasant with a good location...we got both!!! The location was great. It is in easy walking distance of Macy's, The Empire State building and Fifth Avenue. It wasn't too busy or noisy so we had the best of both worlds.The hotel staff were really friendly and helpful. Our room was very clean and the deco was pleasant. The Barking Dog Bar and Grill next door was great. It has a good menu and the service was always spot on. I would definately return to New York and stay in this hotel.

Friendly staff and things look good at first glance but look at all the dusts on the window sills, furniture, and the housekeeping don't clean floors or do much when you are staying there more than a day. Only after check out they are instructed to do the floors!

<Content>Good Location, nice staff, great room. Located at 150 East 34th Street. It鈥檚 between 2nd and 3rd Avenues. This 30+ floor hotel is very pleasant. We booked a one bedroom suite with King. This was essentially two rooms, one with a king size bed, en suite bathroom, loads of closet space. The separate sitting room had a fold out double couch, and a little kitchenette. The kitchenette had cooker, large fridge/freezer, microwave, dishwasher and sink. There was a large TV in both rooms. There was also a little storage room with enough space for all suitcases and the ironing board was kept here too. There was also hanging closet space in this storage room.The suite had everything required for a comfortable stay. Room Safe, phones, lots of good lighting a desk and chair, internet access was an optional extra. The bathroom had a decent bath and good shower. Toiletries and towels were plentiful and replenished as needed. There was a hair drier in the bathroom. There was also the dreaded mini bar, but more of that later!Hotel reception is bright and modern. Reception and concierge staff are friendly and professional. There is no bar at this hotel. There is free flowing iced tea and fresh fruit available from the reception counter, a nice touch but unnecessary I felt. The one time I did go to try some iced tea there were no little plastic cups available.On the second floor there is a fitness suite but we never had time to look for it never mind try it out. There is also some kind of Spa treatments available but I鈥檓 not sure if these are in-room or whether there is a separate spa treatment room.The hotel seems to organise weekly meet and greet sessions with their guests. We got an invite to this but could not attend. A nice touch I thought.Another nice touch is the complimentary morning newspaper and yet another is the guest survey which they email to you very shortly after you arrive home.Next door is the Barking Dog restaurant where you can sit and eat or order room service from. We did neither as the menu did not entice us enough. On our last day we considered the Barking Dog for breakfast but with only 3 tables occupied at 10am, we decided against it and went around the corner to Gemini Diner which was very good with a varied breakfast menu but unfortunately a sullen staff.I requested a room on a high floor and got floor 11. I would not consider this a high floor in a 37 floor building. However the room we got, while it had no views to speak of was fairly quiet as we were not facing directly onto a street.The main King size bed was amazingly comfortable. I loved it. There was a pillow menu, which is probably a good idea. We did try the Swedish pillow but were unimpressed, however this did not spoil our stay and the fault was probably ours for not being pillow geeks.The 鈥榮itting room鈥?was a much more pleasant cool temp than the bedroom during our stay in August when the temperatures outside were quite high. We could not manage to adjust the temp in the bedroom and yes we could have called reception but to be honest it didn鈥檛 bother us that much, just one night was particularly sticky, after that it was ok.Location of the hotel was good for us but might not suit everyone who wants to shop a lot and drop bags back to the hotel at intervals. It鈥檚 about a 10 minute walk along 34th street to 5th avenue and a further 5 to Macys. It鈥檚 on the same street as the Empire State Building. For the purpose of our trip - sightseeing, the location was fine.In any case getting a cab was very easy and cheap and the concierge was always on hand to hail a cabNearby there is a very good selection of local shops and mini markets selling everything you could possibly need? Just across the road and down a little is a Duane Reade pharmacy.If I had to complain it would be about two things. The first was the mini bar. I really dislike a mini bar especially in a hotel where the items can be purchased much cheaper locally. But I mostly dislike them because I am invariably charged on my final bill for items I have not taken from the bar. This time $16 was added to my bill for mini bar. OK, so it won鈥檛 bankrupt me, but that鈥檚 not the point. When I told the receptionist that I did not take anything from the mini bar she politely told me that she would remove the charge. This did not alleviate my embarrassment however. I would have preferred the incorrect charge not be there in the first place. I believe hotels should give guests the option of having/not having a mini bar. This would be a very simple thing for housekeeping to organise.The second issue I had was with the housekeeping lady who repeatedly told us that we were not displaying our 鈥榙o not disturb鈥?sign correctly. She insisted on day one that we always display the sign outside our door. I thought that this was rude and also unnecessary. I have not come across this previously in other decent hotels. Also, on the last day when we were just getting ready to vacate our room at 11am (checkout is 12pm), she knocked on our door and asked us what time we were leaving at.The reason our sign was not displayed correctly is that the darn thing kept falling off the door handle as it wasn鈥檛 a very well designed sign. If the Affinia Dumont place such emphasis on their 鈥榙o not disturb/make me up鈥?signs then they should have better signs or at least signs that don鈥檛 blow off the handle with every puff of air. I have been in a hotel where there is an electrical switch used for this purpose.It still bugs me that I left her a decent tip, Overall though, I would definitely recommend the Affinia Dumont, we had a great time there and the few little annoyances were outweighed by a very pleasant stay. I do think the majority of staff there goes the extra mile to ensure the guests enjoy their stay.

<Content>Enjoyable stay This wasn't the cheapest hotel we could've picked, but for our first trip ever to New York, we are very pleased we picked the Affinia. We stayed here a week, and flew in to Newark (taxi was circa 70 US each way)What was good:1. Location - very close to Empire State Building  Time Square (a few blocks away) so you can pretty much walk everywhere; 2. good selection of restaurants in the area - best was Greek place (turn right out of hotel  right at end of street - it's across the road). The seafood mix starter with octopus was great.3. Shops and delis in area great to get things for the room.4. Breakfast at the Murray Hill Diner around the corner or at Penelopes (on Lexington I think) are both great. One is a true diner and other is more Friends style so we mixed it up.5. Room size - very spacious with a kitchenette. Very comfortable beds!What was not so good:1. Internet/wi fi should be free for the rate charged; 2. wouldn't say staff were the friendliest but served you well when you asked.We were lucky enough to get the request we made at the time of booking for a room with a view of the Chrysler building, but we stayed for a whole week! That said, that was a real highlight for our first trip ever to New York - so thanks Affinia!

<Content>Wonderful!! We were extremely pleased with this hotel. Stayed for 3 nights in August and had a super room on the 30th floor with a fantastic view. The room was HUGE and we had a studio which is the smallest available. The staff were friendly and accommodating. I will reccommend this hotel to anyone who is planning a trip to NYC.

<Content>Great Hotel We booked into the affinia based on other Trip Advisor reviews and weren't disappointed. The reception staff were friendly and helpful. The room was large, clean and comfortable. We had a small kitchen area, with fridge, microwave, cooker etc, a good sized bathroom with Aveda toiletries and a huge bed. The hotel offers a 'pillow service', so you can request different types of pillows for a good nights sleep! It's well located on East 34th street, so a stones throw away from the Empire State Building, Macey's, 5th Avenue etc. There's The Barking Dog restaurant attached to the side of the hotel, which serves enormous breakfasts. They have tables outside. It seems to be used by locals as well. We flew into La Guardia, which is closer to the hotel but were flying back from Newark. We asked the hotel reception how much a taxi would be and they said about $80. They told us about a shuttle service which only cost us $38. All in all a great hotel.

<Content>Affinia Rules! My wife and two boys, ages 6 and 8 stayed at the Affinia Aug1st thru the 4th. We reserved thru Quickbook for avg $330 per nite.Check-in took about 4-5 mins. The elevator delivered us to the 34th floor in another 4 mins. The room was very large. It included a kitchen and fullsize refrigerator. The bathroom was nice size. The shower pressure was perfect. The mattresses were just right on the firmness. The pillows were the comfortable feather type. The views included midtown towers. Walk out of the hotel, take a left and you are on the way to a mini market, Murray hill diner, subway, and the empire state bldg. Walk out of the hotel to the right and you're on the way to a block full of restaurants. Avoid Blockheads. The doorman recommended the italian place and it was very good. After walking the city all day, it was nice coming back to a comfortable quiet room. We never heard anything next door. This was first hotel experience in NYC for me since the 70's. My wife was impressed. As a former flight attendant, she's experienced a few dumps in NYC. I'm glad we didn't stay near 42nd street. The Affinia location seems to have a more residential feel to it. I recommend the beast, little italy, yankee afternoon game, 30 rock, and look for the Croation sensation around the plaza hotel. This guy from Croatia took us on his bike around Central park. It was clear he was outworking all of his competition. He studied the history of Central park and gave you a very informative tour. I wish I remembered his name. I would like to stay at this hotel again. The service from all the hotel employees was excellent. The only negative which I could think of was the hotel did not have a large lobby, bar area, restaurant.

<Content>Marvelous! Marvelous hotel, great location, will stay here again.Stayed 7th Aug for a few nights. I added a high floor room pls request when booking with expedia but that hadn't reached the hotel - no problem, they changed the room to 28th floor corner room straightaway. The rooms are spacious, traffic noise not a problem, the staff were very helpful  the large fridge was a god-send.The in-room drinks  snacks are overpriced as you'd expect, but there's murray hill market to the left  duane reed (like a large corner shop for UK types, don't be put off by the drug store name) over the road to the right and a slightly larger shop round the corner (north) on 3rd ave.We didn't eat at the Barking Dog. We tried Penelope's (lexington  30th) for breakfast and found it ok if not special. EJs luncheonette on the upper east side was our fave breakfast place, or Celeste's diner at the brooklyn end of the brooklyn bridge.We used the subway a lot  would recommend the $25 weekly metro card if you're here for a few days. The subway stop is close (park  33rd) as is the empire state building.UK types: on your first morning, get up early (you'll be awake anyway)  do the statten island ferry  ellis  liberty island trips (buy tickets the day b4 for the trips). The first ellis trip is at 8am but the queues form around 730.We used taxis to  from the airport (they did try to push their car service a few times but backed off when we declined).

<Content>Loved the Affinia Dumont We booked a 3 night stay at the Affinia Dumont on the return trip of a family vacation to Ireland. We chose the hotel primarily based on the many positive reviews on the web and were very pleasently surprised to find they were right! Our stay for our family of 4 was wonderful. The room was very roomy and comfortable and well equiped. The staff was very friendly and helpful and the hotel location was perfect for our stay. Would definitely stay again!

<Content>Great position in Manhattan Stayed here for two nights in the summer heat. Great position in Manhattan, friendly staff and above average rooms. The room was pretty huge by NY standards, we had 2 queens in our room. The bathroom was fine, and a kitchen too! Very handy having the fridge for all the drinks.My only gripe was that the air conditioning was a little rattly, but it wasnt bad enough to interrupt sleep.We never tried the pillow menu as the ones on the bed were superb, but kinda wish I had now.Theres an all night mini market just out the front which was super handy.All in all, a great position in Manhattan, with solid, dependable rooms and staff.

<Content>We liked this hotel Our family of two adults and two teenagers stayed here for 3 nights. We had a junior suite which was spacious and exceeded our expectations.The hotel staff are friendly and helpful.We looked at the gym, which we didn't have time to use, but it appeared of a good standard.We used the Barking Dog restaurant next door for breakfast - it was good. We would have liked a bigger lobby - there are no real communal areas, but it wasn't that big a deal.Location is good - walking distance to many attractions and Fifth Avenue shopping. We used the subway nearby to get to Battery Park for the Ellis Island/Statue of Liberty tour.

<Content>Great Stay Great Staff Booked this hotel through a website but had stayed at another affinia in manhattan. From the minute we pulled up to the door with our vehicle the service was fantastic. Check in was great and the doorman and the porter were awsome with the kids and made us all laugh. He delivered the bags to our room, recommended restaurants in the area, made sure we got the right pillows that we wanted to try (they have Ipod conected pillows with built in speakers for the kids...WOW were they in heaven) we had a choice of four or five types of pillows at our request. He came by later to make sure we got everything we needed from housekeeping. They took our vehicle away and brought it back without any issues. Expensive parking for a large SUV but worth the time and hassle saving of just unloading at the front of the hotel and giving them the keys and bringing it back when we checked out right in front of the door... really impressed with the staff and the cleanliness. Not the most central location but it depends where you want to go.

<Content>Overall very good Our second 5-day stay at this property. Overall a very nice.Highlights:Friendly and attentive staff, VERY spacius rooms (we were in a Junior Suite). Fantastic views if you are on a high floor - ask for it when booking.(we were on 35th).Very good value for the price.Minor flaws:Aircondition units are quite noisyRooms and hallways are a bit tired and would benifit from a paintjob in lighter colors.

<Content>Yes I would stay here again! A great choice of Hotel to stay in. Very relaxing, spacious rooms and very comfy beds and pillows and good linen! The rooms are clean and it was nice to have the kitchen although there are plenty of good restaurants close by. We stayed in a one bedroom and were on the 29th floor with a great view of the East River and the Chrysler Building, amazing view, i did request a view on booking, and I was impressed with the natural light we had in the room, perhaps it is because East 34th is a wide street, ie 2 lane traffic. We had no hassles with check-in or checking -out, it all went very smoothly. I was keen to pay extra for a good hotel, I am so pleased I chose Affinia Dumont.. i will return and I did love New York!

<Content>Fabulous views and huge rooms We stayed at the Affinia Dumont inn March 2008 for our honeymoon and it did not disappoint. We booked a junior suite and we were really impressed by the size of the room. Room size seems to be a bit of an issue in New York but it is not a problem at the Affinia Dumont. We also had the most fantastic view - two enormous windows, one looking right over to the Chrysler Building and the other down to the East River. It was great to watch the city light up in front of us in over a bottle of wine.The space in the room came in very handy to store all the shopping too! There is so much to see and do in New York and we did most of it on foot. This made the extra big and extra comfy bed in the room very welcome at the end of a really busy day.We did not eat in the hotel restaurant, prefering to go out for the evening in Greenwich or East/West Village. This was really easy because there is a subway stop about 5 mins walk away. We did eat in an Italian restaurant just around the corner from our hotel on our first night which was very good. It was called Da Ciro and is great if you are too tired from the flight to venture out any further! A travel tip for anyone flying into JFK is to get the AirTrain from JFK to Jamaica Station. You can then get the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) from Jamaica to Penn Station. Penn Station is about 10 mins walk along 34th St (past the Empire State Building) to the hotel. The trip from the airport only takes around 35 mins and is probably quicker than a taxi (and cheaper). You must remember to buy a separate ticket for the LIRR as the Metrocard is not valid on this line.

<Content>Wow, what a fantastic hotel We stayed at the Afinia in late June and were lucky enough to have a corner room on the 34th floor with views of the East river and the Chrysler Building. We often use Trip Advisor to help choose a hotel and I think the reviews here are fair. The hotel itself is good, the rooms are big, the beds are comfy and it is useful to have a kitchen area if not just for the huge fridge. The real reason to stay here is the location, it is great. A couple of blocks further up 34th and you start entering the hustle and bustle of the city, however it is relatively calm in the hotels district. There are countless restaurants and bars all within walking distance and having a Duane Reed across the street helps. We ate at the Barking dog, once for breakfast and once in the eve. The breakfast was OK however the evening meal was not up to much. Beware if you sit outside as water drips off the top of the building even if it isn鈥檛 raining and the staff seemed adamant that the customers were crazy! With all of the choice just outside the hotel the Barking dog should really be given a miss 鈥?go to Penelope鈥檚 instead if you want the freshest and tastiest food for both breakfast and dinner! Some people have commented on noise, and yes there are a few ambulances in particular because of the two big hospitals that are just down the road. All I can say is that if you think this is noisy go stay in a central hotel and then compare it!All in all the hotel itself is very nice, the staff very helpful and yes the room is a little dated, but you know what, every thing worked and was spotlessly clean. The location is the main reason to stay here. We will stay again!

<Content>A Good All-rounder We stayed at the Affinia Dumont at the beginning and end of our two week tour of the North East of the US. Our first stay was for 3 nights in room 1804 which was fine. There was a problem in our bathroom which we called reception about, and within minutes, Dave from Maintenance was knocking on the door to sort it out. He fixed the problem and even sorted out some fresh towels from housekeeping for us. Aveda shampoo, conditioner and moisturisers are nice touches. Was a bit disappointed about the Internet access though, it's not cheap ($5 for 15 mins!) and there's no wireless in there either so you're a bit stuck. Jaeselite (or something like that!) in Reception was really lovely and helpful. She organised the best room for us for when we returned to NYC for our last night. This was 3704 - on the top floor and the view of the Chrysler building lit up at night was spectacular! The location is great, well placed to meander to most places and there;s a nice little minimarket on the corner to stock up on bits for the kitchenette. We had some breakfast at the Barking Dog on one of the mornings which was nice.Would definitely stay there again, everyone was friendly, the location was fab, and the bed was massive! The pillows were some of the most comfortable I've ever slept on!

<Content>Should be a 5 Star!!!!!! My daughter, her friend and myself stayed at the Affinia Dumont for 5 days last week. This was one of the best hotel stays I've ever had. Our room was on the 31st floor and we had a corner room. The views were spectacular. Everyone was completely helpful. We were complete novices in the big city and the staff was always helpful and friendly. After seeing some of the other hotels that I was considering choosing, I am sooooo glad that we chose this one. We chose the Dumont because of the reviews on this website and they were completely on target. Thanks for making my daughter's graduation trip so wonderful.

<Content>Beautiful, clean hotel We went to New York for a week to celebrate our daughter's 18th birthday and high school graduation. We booked the Affinia Dumont based on TripAdvisor reviews and loved it! Initially, I was worried about the cleanliness of hotels in New York City, but the Affinia was exceptionally clean and stylish. The staff was also wonderful-so friendly and helpful. My daughter loved the sound pillow and complimentary iced tea. The hotel offers many amenities, such as bathrobes and specialty pillows, but you have to ask for them. We ate at the Barking Dog next door a few times-the food was okay. Although we took a taxi to Times Square and used the subway often due to the hotel's distant location, I highly recommend the Affinia Dumont. You won't be disappointed.

<Content>Good Location could do with new carpets Stayed here in July 2008. Staff are very friendly, location is good, rooms are good size for New York but the room we stayed in needed to be steam cleaned. The carpets were dirty and the furniture needed to be steam cleaned or replaced. This is not the fault of the day to day cleaners as linen, kitchen area and bathroom were clean and they have done all they can. The lobby is nice and beautifully tiled but please replace the carpets in the lift as they are a big let down. Asked for a recommendation for a restraunt one night and got sent to a scary place with only a few people in it and it was hugely overpriced even for New York.

<Content>Couldn't have been better!!!! What a fabulous vacation! The staff at the Affinia was absolutely fantastic!! Everyone that we dealt with was super helpful and friendly. The room was extra clean, comfy and so roomy. We loved the little kitchenette. Perfect for having breakfast in the room and then heading out for the day. The hotel was in a perfect spot-in a quiet neighborhood but still close to subways and attractions. You can pick up the Grey Line Tour bus just a couple blocks down from the hotel at the Empire State building. There is a little market right next to the hotel that is perfect for picking up groceries. We were there over the 4th and the hotel opened up a room that looked out over the East River to watch fireworks. We had the best view!! We will most definitely stay here again and most certainly recommend it to anyone!

<Content>Excellent Family Hotel. We love the Affinia Dumont We had a fantastic stay at this hotel in mid June. All of the staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful. Our suite was very large, and accommodated our family of 5 very comfortably. It was very clean and the Aveda products are great! The kitchenette came in very handy especially for breakfast and late night snacks. The restaurant offering room service was reasonably priced and decent. Not the best food we've had but the pizza was perfect for the kids. There is a great fitness room which my husband and sons raved about. (unfortunately I never got a chance to go...). This is a top notch hotel and perfect option for a family or large group. Perfectly located just 2 blocks from the subway, within walking distance of lots of sights. I felt safe in this neighborhood even walking alone at night. We will definitely stay here again and I give it a major thumbs up!

<Content>Loved the Affinia We stayed for three nights in June at the Affinia Dumont and found it to be just perfect. On arrival we were greeted by Alex doorman/concierge who took care of our luggage and helped with my wheelchair as N.Y, cabbies don't seem to like helping with these. Check in was very efficient and the receptionist supplied us with maps and info for our visit. Our room was on the 25th floor with great views of the Chrysler Building, thought the pillow menu excellent idea but we stuck to the feather and down pillows, bed and pillows very comfortable. The hotel was in a great location and we were able to walk to Empire State building, Macy's and Central Station. Took Alex's recommendation on where to eat on our last night, a little Italian restaurant just around the corner, he didn't let us down it was lovely. Overall we had a great time and would certainly stay here again if we come back to New York.

<Content>Amazing views, friendly staff, great location - highly recommended! We booked the Affinia solely on it's rating on Trip Advisor and I'm pleased to say that you all have excellent judgement! We only stayed 2 nights as we decided to spit the stay between here and a cheaper place as finances were tight, but I'm really glad we did as it was a fabulous place to end the trip. We stayed in a junior suite on floor 33 (or something around that number) and we got an amazing corner room. You can't determine the exact room when you book so it's partly luck of the draw, but we booked a fair while in advance and asked for a room that was high up with a good view and preferably on the corner and they obviously made the effort to meet our wishes.The room was huge - if one person was on the sofa and the other on the bed, you had to speak up slightly to be heard! The bathroom was impeccably clean and well fitted out and the spacious kitchen area was an unexpected bonus. Everything was spotless and the cleaners even washed up our dirty cutlery (which I felt very guilty about!). But by far the best feature of the room was the breathtaking view - you only have to look at the pictures here on trip advisor to see what I mean. The hotel is in a great location - not smack bang in the tourist district, but close to most attractions on the subway. The staff were friendly in a very genuine way, especially our lovely porter who was really helpful. We didn't eat in the restaurant, but were advised that there are many places nearby (hundred yards or so) that are nicer  better value. We ate breakfast at a great coffee place about 1min from the hotel and there was a great 24hr grocery store nearby on the corner with a lovely deli (the lemon chicken was to die for). With a kitchen in the room this means you can actually save quite a bit on eating out. All in all we had a wonderful stay, and would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a luxury stay at a reasonable price in central New York.

<Content>Watching the 4th of July fireworks in a great hotel The past few years I only select hotels based on the reviews in TripAdvisor. Again we were very pleasantly surprised with finding and chosing the Affinia Dumont hotel located in Murray Hill on this website. We first searched the big hotelwebsites, Expedia's, Kayak's etc. to find a good deal, but in the end the best deal was on the hotel's website itself. As a matter of fact I cannot remember when I booked a hotel or flight through one of these big sites for the last time. I am afraid they are losing their value-add for me.We also followed the advise of a previous reviewer to go to Penelope's (Lexington Avenue) for breakfast: great place and staff. And the Affinia advised us two great restaurants: Jackson Hole (for a good American hamburger - down PArk Avenue) and Daciro (Italian - also down Lexington Avenue). All very close to the hotel which does have a restaurant next door (Barking Dog - also okay), which also delivers for the room service of the hotel. I am not sure whether this is part of the hotel as such - if so, maybe they should be more clear about this.For the 4th of July the hotel made a suite available for its guests from where we could view the fireworks. Great since it was raining and nearly impossible to access the viewing points (we we walked back after several attempts to get there; we were stopped everywhere by the police). We had a large one bedroom suite with all we needed for our one week stay. We were on the 29th floor and traffic could still be heard, but not in a way that it kept us awake.So: great!

<Content>Great place! I had a wonderful stay at this hotel. The staff was very courteous and the room was modern, clean and made up perfectly every day including washing the dishes that were used in the kitchen (which included a small microwave, full size fridge and a gas stove, I could have cooked for myself all weekend if I hadn't planned on eating out so much). I requested a view of the East River but could not get one because of the high demand on the 4th of July weekend, but the hotel had opened up three rooms on the upper floors for guests to watch the fireworks outside the windows and it was perfect, much better than fighting the crowds outside. All the people I encountered were very friendly and it was clear that they were concerned with making my stay as pleasant as possible. I will definitely stay at the Affinia again next time I'm in New York.

<Content>Perfect Place for a family Our stay at the Affinia Dumont was good. We had junior suite which was perfect for a family of five. We enjoyed having the kitchenette (complete with sink, dishes, stove, microwave, refrigerator/freezer, and toaster). It made it easy for us to eat breakfast in everyday. The staff was helpful and filled all of our requests for more towels and pillows.

<Content>Very nice. Booked through travelocity - flight and hotel $2500 for 5 nights. my wife and i stayed in the junior suite (room #1001) which was clean and pretty large. kitchen included a dishwasher (which the maid ran with all our dirty dishes every day), a large fridge, dishes, pots and pans, microwave and coffee maker (unfortunately they give you puck's coffee wich is just terrible). living room has a very large desk, pull-out sofabed, a couple comfy chairs, huge mirrors, stereo, tv, internet connection and cable, decent view that isn't really anything to write home about. the bedroom is a decent size - you can move around the room very easily despite a king size bed. lots and lots of closet space including a walk-in but also several drawers and two more closets for hanging. failry typical-but-clean bathroom accessible from bedroom only. thermostats adjust to 70 degrees automatically fairly early in the AM which was pretty annoying given the summer heat. the attached restaurant was very nice and not terribly expensive for NYC. all service was very nice - however, the maids are borderline OCD about the do not disturb signs and might yell at you if you don't use them. the spa and workout facilities are really what make this hotel so fancy... you should plan on using them. the hotel is located 8 blocks south of grand central. a quiet area that you'll feel safe in but probably wont really want to hang out in. several 20-something bars and a couple decent restaurants just 2 blocks away.

<Content>Huge rooms in the city! The Affinia Dumont was overall a wonderful place to stay in the city. One block from the 33rd St. subway stop. We arrived early, and the hotel was very accomodating with our baggage. After we returned to check in, the process was quick  painless. We had a junior suite  regular suite connected by an adjoining door; which formed a 2 bedroom/2 bathroom suite. Tons of places to eat nearby. My husband was annoyed that WiFi cost an additional $49/wk (or $10/day); for the price it should have been included. He also hated the in room coffee pot; minor inconvenience but worth mentioning to him :) A shopping market was located 2 doors down from the Affinia Dumont, so we were able to pick up a few things for our kitchen, which was very convenient. The hotel staff was very helpful  friendly; we had a party of 5  a ton of luggage. The concierge arranged for limo transportation to the airport at a rate close to cost of one taxi ride (and we would have needed 2). Overall a great experience!

<Content>Gem in a Non-Touristy Area We booked based on online reviews alone and were not disappointed. I like to find places that are not full of your typical tourists and most people don't know about this place. We got great service, a great view, a terrific location and a few other things that are unusual for big city hotels (e.g., the pillow menu and the emphasis on physical/health activities). I was told that visiting professional sports teams often stay here and that there is a private gym in the building for them. I can see why -- nice accommodations and privacy out of the prying eyes (mostly) of tourists. I want to stay here again.

<Content>Great stay at the Affinia First trip to New York with my husband and 3 young boys. We had a fantastic time and really enjoyed our stay. The beds were really comfortable. We used the kitchen a lot and we were able to bring leftovers from Grimaldi's in Brooklyn and eat it the next day. The Murray Hill Market on the corner has a great deli. We would buy omletes and pancakes for breakfast and eat in our room. The suite even had a dishwasher and stove plus the refrigerator.  Everyone that worked there was very friendly and helpful. If I requested anything it was taken care of right a way. I have had to wait more than an hour at other hotels for a pillow or anything else. It was clean and we felt safe walking around the hotel. The doormen were very, very nice to my boys. The hotel is about a ten minute walk from Grand Central Station and there is also a subway station up the street. We would definitely stay at the Affinia again. It was perfect for a family with young children.

<Content>Would stay at the Affinia Dumont again and again I stayed at the Affinia Dumont over the weekend of 6/28  6/29 2008 with my two daughters, ages 12  18. We all loved it. Staff was great, we had a corner room on the 36th floor with a spectacular view of the East River. Very clean. The only fly in our proverbal ointment was a broken very large balloon shade. A staff member safety pinned it in an up position as to not impede our view. We would stay again, in a heart beat.

<Content>Great location and staff! We stayed at the Affinia Dumont for one week. The hotel is very clean, centrally located and has a wonderful restaurant, Barking Dog, next to it. The staff, in particular, Don, were great and gave us tips regarding other restaurants and shopping. We will stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Nice but noisy Asked for a high, quiet room with a view and had a room on the 28th floor with a fantastic view of the Chrysler Building.Our only complaint was that we could still hear the very noisy sirens and horns on the quite busy street below,although to be fair to the Hotel,we didn't complain or ask to be moved!The whole area was busier than we expected given that this hotel is in a predominantly residential area.Easy walking distance to shops and Metro and staff friendly and efficient.

<Content>Good hotel, great room, fantastic view, friendly staff This is a good hotel in a good location.Stayed in a studio suite for 4 days (20th/06 - 24th/06) on the 27th floor and the room was large, clean, well equipped and the staff very friendly. Had a fantastic view of the city .It's a little expensive (although isn't everything in NYC)!A great gym and use of the sauna in the spa in a nice touch.My only comments for improvement would be as follows: Check in - problematic. Was checked in, only to be given the key for an occupied room. When we did eventually get an unoccupied room we were disturbed approx. 3 times in the 1st 30 mins by various staff wanting to check the room (which was frustrating as we were napping after a long haul flight). On the 4th knock we asked the person to come back later to be told 'I haven't checked the mini bar so if you get charged it's not my fault' - hardly professional (plus this should have been carried out BEFORE we were checked in)!So I would say there are a few area's for improvement. But on the whole very good.

<Content>Very Nice Hotel We booked this hotel after reading the reviews on TripAdvisor. We were not disappointed. It's not a huge hotel, in fact, the lobby is quite small; but the room was WONDERFUL!!!! It is so much bigger than your average NY hotel room with a full kitchen. The furniture was lovely with a huge wardrobe and a beautiful full size mirror on the wall. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was located at the front door, away from the sleeping area of the room. The hotel is on 34th Street, so you're not right in Times Square or the Theatre District, but we enjoy walking so it wasn't a big deal. We throughly enjoyed our stay at the Affinia Dumont.

<Content>Another great stay The Affinia Dumont was once again a wonderful facility for our 6 night New York visit. My 22 year old daughter and I requested a high floor with view of Chrysler Bldg. We arrived late and our room was ready as requested. The pillow menu is wonderful. I selected the Swedish temperpeudic and my daughter fluffy down pillows. The bed is very comfortable. The best part for me is the location. It is in a fairly quiet part of the city in Murray Hill. The 6 subway is just a short 2 block walk which takes you past a Starbucks. Empire State Building is easy walking distance as is Macys. The Murray Hill Market is right next door for those breakfast items and to pick up things for the room. A full kitchenette is in each room, so it is very handy to keep things fresh. Of course we would never cook while on vacation...being able to keep fresh juice, milk, half and half...perfect. I can't say enough about the staff. The doormen and desk staff are wonderful. They warmly welcome you back each time you arrive. Iced cold iced tea and fresh fruit are available at the front desk which is so nice after long walks around the city. For the price this is a great deal for New York as far as room size and facility. I call the Affinia Dumont my New York home.

<Content>Loved the Dumont What an awsome place to stay!!! Four of stayed at the Dumont from 6/11-6/17/08 and the service can not get any better anywhere. The rooms are huge by NYC standards. They gave us a beautiful view on the 33rd floor of the river. It was breathtaking!!!Rooms are so clean and the kitchen is an extra bonus. Nice to have a place to keep bottled water cold and left over food.Sara Candee you are a wonderful person and so caring. Thank you for all you did for us. We will be staying with you when we return to NYC hopefully during the holidays.Everybody at this hotel gives top notch service. They give you good choices of where to eat. The location is awsome right in the heart of Murray Hill. Close enough to TImes Square, but enough distance to enjoy some down time when returning to your room.Thank you for an awsome stay!!!The Toth's

<Content>Terribly Overrated I picked the Affinia Dumont for our party (4) because I had read the reviews and had seen such terrific compliments. In fact, I recommended it to people based on what I'd seen on this site. There ended up being several people from our group who stayed there b/c of what I'd seen on TripAdvisor. I had never been to NYC before and was looking forward to staying in a quality, smoke-free hotel that (apparently) had great service. What a disappointment!The disappointment started right off the bat when we were put into a room that was obviously not used very much (on the 3rd floor) even though we checked in early and stated that we would be willing to wait for something to open up so we could get a decent room. We had booked this hotel months in advance and had asked repeatedly for a nice room with a view. We didn't get that. The view I could live w/out but I expected a nice hotel room. The room we were given was musty and moldy smelling and it had a horrendous view of apartment buildings in the back. That wasn't too bad until I found out that several other people staying in the hotel had booked after we did, had the same # of people in their party, and got a great room. Didn't make me happy. Because of the mold and must, two of us ended up getting incredibly sick and were coughing throughout the entire weekend.During our stay, we had the toilet break down and it wasn't fixed until the next afternoon and only until after we'd called twice in the morning to see if it was going to get fixed, after being told that maintenace apparently doesn't have any type of emergency service after business hours. So we went all night w/out a working toilet. 4 women sharing a toilet that didn't work for over 24 hours? Not good. I ended up using someone else's bathroom on the next floor up.We also asked repeatedly for extra towels and blankets and had to keep calling and asking to get them. If they were having trouble finding these items, all they had to do was say that the hotel was booked solid and that they were looking. The front desk just kept telling us that they were contacting housekeeping as though they'd forgotten that we'd just called 10 minutes earlier.One of my roommates also had significant trouble with her internet and called twice to try and get it sorted out. Everytime she tried to bring up the internet, it kept asking her for credit card information all though she had already given it and her 24 hours wasn't even close to being done (same day). This hotel is getting five star reviews and all I can say is that I hope that those people were/are being treated better than we were and that they get a room that is actually used. I won't be staying @ this hotel again.

<Content>Loved it! Awesome place. Well kept, well organized. Great to stay at a hotel with a great selection of exercise options. Location is a bonus too. Fantastic price and everyone working there is incredibly friendly. The pillow menu is what puts it over-the-top! I can't begin to express how happy I was to get high quality pillows. I highly recommend the Affinia.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel This was our first trip to New York and like so many other people used Trip Advisor to decide where to stay. We weren't disappointed as on arrival we were shown to our suite on the 33rd floor where the views were just astounding. The room was huge with a king size bed plentiful on-suite bathroom, sofas, an office desk plus a kitchen. The room was very clean and tidy which is what you'de expect from a hotel of this calibre. The staff were very friendly and helpful when requesting directions or ideas. The Affinia Dumont is in a super location, on East 34th Street within easy walking distance of the Empire State Building and Macy鈥檚. The Barking Dog restaurant next door is a perfect place for breakfast lunch or dinner as we had all 3 at some point during our stay and enjoyed each one.I had let the hotel know in advance that it was my wifes 40th birthday treat and on arrival found a complimentary card and cake in the room which was a lovely touch.We would definitely stay at the Affinia Dumont again and fully intend too when we return in a couple of years time

<Content>Highly recommend this hotel The hotel on 34th St is located a short walk from the Empire State Building and Macy's. Penn station is a few blocks away. The junior suite overlooking 34th St was very clean, well maintained and spacious with good quality fittings and furniture including living room space, office desk, phone/fax and computer facilities. There is plentiful wardrobe space and an in-room safe for valuables. The bathroom (good size) and kitchenette were well appointed and the king bed was very comfortable. The hotel staff were helpful and friendly. The hotel does not have a dining room facility but a small restaurant bar is located directly next door. There is a mini market, supermarket and laundry facility if you need these nearby. A number of good quality, reasonably priced restaurants and bars are a short walk away in and around 3rd Avenue. Ethos (Greek) or Hudsons Restaurant and Bar are recommended. We booked directly through the hotel website and paid in advance receiving the best available rate. The hotel was ideal for a six night stay in New York and we would certainly stay at the Affinia Dumont again.

<Content>Affinia Dumont - Short Review To confirm previous guests experiences. Staff were helpful - moved us up the the 34th floor once a room was available. Bring ear plugs - even at that level - just a New York thing I guess. Location reasonably good - but hard to be in a bad location in NY. Big rooms and pretty well kept. One downside - don't let them book you a limousine! We did (by mistake) and it looked like it had been in more than one accident. Not a modern or fashionable hotel, but the import of this depends on how much time you spend in the room.Otherwise a positive experience.

<Content>Great place! The Affinia Dumont is a great base in New York. It's a tiny bit off the beaten track and in an area that, in countless trips to NYC, I hadn't been to before. This didn't detract from our experience at all - in fact it was great seeing a new bit of the city. The Affinia Dumont is a few minutes from the Hudson River and about 10-15 mins stroll in a straight line to Macy's and the Empire State. Since it's in mid-town it's perfectly located if you want to go either downtown to the Village or uptown to Central Park and the shops at the top of 5th Avenue - both are a relatively cheap cab ride away. My biggest recommendation is to stay local for breakfast though. When we first arrived we staggered out to find somewhere to eat and stumbled across Penelopes, the cutest little cafe/diner a few blocks away (turn left out of the Affinia, left at the top of the road and it's on the corner of 32nd or 33rd). Go early or late for breakfast at the weekends because it fills up FAST but don't miss the nutella french toast and definitely throw the diet out for a night and try a burger for dinner, one of the best I've ever had...Back to the hotel - beds are SUPER comfy, the size of the room is great, bathroom is all you'd expect with lots of lovely towels, on-site gym is a really great bonus and staff are very helpful (we asked for a cot for my niece and, unlike in some other hotels we looked at, were told that this was no problem at no cost). Ask for a room on one of the top floors and get a fabulous view of the Hudson at night too.My only gripe with the Affinia is that I turned 30 while I was there and my dad had read that they treat you to a cake on your birthday and mentioned it in advance. Thankfully I didn't know this so didn't expect anything but no cake ever appeared so don't expect one if you too have also read about it and go to NYC for your birthday!

<Content>Comfort and Convenience - Affinia has it all After much research via tripadvisor reviews and the tripadvisor forums which are great for finding information, reviewed over a period of a few months, I finally settled on the Affinia Dumont. True to other people's reviews it truly was a nice, comfortable and central hotel in New York City. We stayed here May 4th to May 10th. Prior to arriving I telephoned the hotel to request a floor change to a higher floor, and because of the professional manner of the reservation person dealing with my request I felt reassured and was looking forward to my trip . I was delighted to receive a room on the 35th floor, overlooking 34th street, with of view of the Chrysler building. With time difference we awoke the first morning at 5am to a fantastic sunrise.we booked a one bedroomed suite, myself, husband and 14yr old daughter. Glad we done this as my daughter was able to go to bed whilst we stayed up to watch TV.Beds are extremely comfortable and very large. Not enough clothes hangers though. There is also full size ironing board and iron, plus a laundry service available. No teapot, or kettle but you could boil a pot of water on the full size cooker. Suggest you bring a small teapot with you if you like to make tea. Coffee maker was great with coffee replenished each day by the maid. And daily newspaper left on door handle each morning was nice. I also asked reception for a bath rubber slip mat which was delivered promtly within 10 minutes to our room. Yes decor is alittle dark - browns and creams but no damaged furniture, or torn wallpaper so overall to me rooms are fine. But I am not into hotels with flamboyant colours and retro furniture. We paid approximately $350 more over the full week for the one bedroom which was well worth the extra. And compared to other hotels the prices are average for the Affinia Dumont. I compared many hotels using TA prior to my decision.Staff:Friendly and doorman advised us to watch our backpacks especially around Times Square. My phone charger would not work there and a Manageress, I think her name was Grace brought me to the basement area and found a charger for my phone which I returned on leaving at no extra cost. This was very much appreciated by me.Would definitely consider returning to Affinia Dumont again. Hope to get back next year.

<Content>Nice Hotel in Midtown Location Stayed here with two girlfriends for our stay in NYC. We chose the Dumont based on reviews on Tripadvisor and weren't disappointed. The room was large as was the bathroom. The small kitchen was a nice amenity. We ate at the Barking Dog resturant a couple times for breakfast and dinner and was very happy with the food and service. Nice to have the little market next door as well. Hotel is one block from the Green Line subway and walking distance to Macy's. This is a great location in midtown in the Murray Hill neighborhood.My next trip I will stay in the Upper East side as it is where all the museums are and Second Ave restaurants.However, highly recommend this hotel for anyone wanting a midtown property in NYC.

<Content>Best Experience I had read a lot of reviews about this Hotel, and decided to book a stay there. Which I am so glad that I did, we had a great room, the beds were so comfortable, room was very clean, and also very spacious. The staff was very helpful and friendly, and above all we felt very safe there. I can`t complain about anything, our experience with this Hotel was perfect, and would jump at the chance to stay there again, when we return to New York in the future.

<Content>Great Staff - Hotel OK. We booked the Affinia Dumont after reading the reviews on this site, and we were expecting to give it another five star rating. After staying there for our long weekend, we just don't think it deserves it though.Yes the staff are absolutely outstanding and do everything they can to make your stay perfect. For instance we'd requested a high floor room which of course can't be guaranteed and unfortunately we were given a room on a lower floor. The staff were happy to move us next day and we spent the rest of the stay on the 28th floor. The lads on the door remember you and always had a smile.Reception always had fruit juice available and also morning coffee.But we just thought our doubled bed studio was just ok. Yes it was large with plenty of space for our clothes, but is it any better than a British Lodge/Inn? We didn't think so. We've stayed in rooms which were cleaner and these days most hotels give you free internet service - the Dumont charges $10.My only explanation for all the 5* ratings is perhaps, if you need a room for four people or a seperate lounge and bedroom, then this could be the place for you. If you are a couple just looking for a room, perhaps you might find something better/cheaper.

<Content>Thank you for the view We have just returned from a stay in New York and would like to thank the Affinia Dumont Hotel for a wonderful stay. From the moment of entering the hotel we were impressed by the doorstaff and the helpfulness of the reception staff. This continued for the duration of our holiday. We had requested a room with a view but would like to thank the hotel for exceeding our expectation by providing us with a room on the 28th floor with a spectacular view of the Chrysler building in all its night and daytime glory. Our room was spacious and extremely comfortable and the facilities of a quality hotel supplemented by the ability to use the studio kitchen to eat in or out was a bonus. The position of the hotel was ideal providing easy walking to the Empire State Building ( 5 mins ) Macys ( 10 mins ) and Times Square ( 20 mins ) and superb subway links throughout Manhattan. Thank you to all the staff for a fantastic stay in your wonderful city!!!

<Content>Great place to stay at!!! Affinia Dumont was definitely a great place to stay at. Stayed here for a week in May. It is centrally located in mid-town and within walking distance to many places. Very close to the Empire State building and a block away from subway stations. The room was larger than expected and included a kitchenette which comes in handy. Room was well kept and had a comfortable feeling. Staff were very polite and friendly as well. Complimentary refreshments and fruits were available to guests in the lobby. Would stay here again!

<Content>Big rooms, great location, bad reservations / room booking experience My family spent a weekend at the Affinia Dumont. The rooms are big and the location central, though the hotel completely messed up my family's reservation by guaranteeing (in writing) one room-type then not having it available when I got there. Of course, I was traveling with 4 people and they ended up putting us in a room with 1 bed and a pull-out couch. I was very upset and it put a blemish on our weekend. Initially they didn't seem to feel bad but after I expressed extreme disappointment they did apologize.I also had been very impressed when making my reservation that they provided many options - you could reserve a crib, your pillow type - all sorts of preferences - NONE of them were in the system when I got there! So, word of caution - double confirm your reservation!!!While the rooms are huge and the location is great, the rooms however, are a bit tired around the edges (the carpets are a bit worn, etc.), but, they are so big that I can live with that. But, at some point soon they will need to attend to details.I'd consider going back, but I'd first do a price comparison vs. other Affinia hotels in the midtown and uptown areas and I'd consider trying one of their other properties first.

<Content>It is all true When I read the reviews, I was sure that Affinia Dumont was the right place to stay in NYC. I was not wrong. This hotel is great, the room is spacious, the bed is very confortable and the staff is so helpful. I麓ll definitively stay there again and recommend it to everybody.

<Content>Love this place This was our 2nd visit to this hotel and once again it was amazing.The year before we had gotten engaged whilst in New York and loved every second of our stay.When we decided to go back to New York we had no hesitation in staying here again, making this the 1st time either of us had decided to stay in a hotel for a second time.we stayed in a junior suite. These rooms are amazing. Large bed, lovely bathroom, a really nice little kitchenette, a nice sitting area as well as desk but it also has amazing views.The location is great as it's really central, the staff are really nice and I can't recomend this hotel enough. Both our stays here were brilliant

<Content>Best Hotel Ever! My Husband and i stayed for 4 nights in a Junior Suite on the 37th floor! The room was the best in the hotel as it had views of the Chrysler building from one window and views over the river to rooklyn and Queens from the other! Amazing to see the views everyday and watch everything light up in the evening! Candace Cortez who works at the hotel organised the room for us and also a bottle of champagne which I requested was waiting in our room on arrival on ice! There are loads of restaurants within walking distance. We tried Blockheads mexican restaurant which was nice and not expensive. We also ate at El Ciro (Think thats the name!) italian restaurant just round the corner from hotel which had lovely pizzas. The Murray Hill market next to the hotel was very good for drinks , snacks etc to keep in your fridge. We would recommend this hotel and would def stay here again if we go back to NY which I hope we do as it is a wonderful city! Thanks again to Candace.

<Content>Fantastic Place, Fantastic Location, Fantastic Staff We stayed at the Affinia Dumont from 15th to 18th May in Room 3103. After requesting a view of the Chrysler Building from a high floor, we were not to be disappointed and had spectacular views of the building. We could also see the Hudson River which was a bonus. If it hadn't been for previous reviews on Trip Advisor we wouldn't have requested this room and would have missed out on a treat. We were also left a complimentary bottle of wine which I presume was down to us celebrating Birthdays / Wedding Anniversary while we were there.From a location point of view, it couldn't have been better. 10 mins walk and you could be at Grand Central Station in one direction or virtually Times Square in another. The Empire State Building was only a 5 minute walk along 34th Street. We didn't go up the Empire State and elected to go for the Top of the Rock - this was only a 10-15 minute walk away and didn't have the horrendous lines the EPS had - it also gave a fantastic view of the empire state itself and great views of Central Park.Everything within the Hotel was great and the front desk staff were genuinely friendly and made you feel wanted from the moment you stepped foot in the place (larger chains should take note)This was our first stay in NYC and we loved the place. We do want to return next year and on the basis of this visit would only consider booking the Dumont.

<Content>Great Stay at the Affinia The hotel stay was great. No problems with checking in. The room was bigger than what I expected for NYC and the small kitchen was a nice bonus. The location was nice because it was in a residential area. The 6 subway is up approx 2 blocks or you can walk to Grand Central. There is a group of restaurants on 33rd which we did not discover until our last day there. I would recommend walking down there. Everyone at the Hotel was very friendly. I would definitely stay here again or at another Affinia location.

<Content>Well worth it! My husband and I stopped at this hotel for 4 nights and enjoyed every minute of it. We stopped on the 11th floor (Room 1104) and although we could hear the noise from down below this did not effect our stay after all we were in the city that NEVER sleeps. Room was very spacious, we loved having a kitchen to toast our bagels in the morning and having Aveda products free in the bathroom was a great touch to this hotel. Staff were great and friendly and informative( Mathew-you were great) except one of the bell men very miserable and unhelpful. The BARKING DOG next door was a great place to eat large portions and reasonable priced and service with a smile. Visited the Spa looked fantastic but unfortunately no time to try it out. Again hotel was centrally located very near the Empire State building. We would defintely come back to this hotel and would reccomend this to others though would probably book direct next time and not through Expedia for better rates.

<Content>Truly Enjoyed - Great Boutique Hotel This a great boutique hotel. I would say a solid four star. The rooms are nice size. We stayed in a room with two queen beds as we traveled with our teenage girls. Plenty of room. Two beds, a rather large desk, comfortable chair with ottoman. A full kitchen, which we did not use. Nice to have the fridge though. A view of the East River. Ask for view room when booking - I did.The front desk staff was nice and friendly. The doormen/bellmen were outstanding! Alway helpful.Now understand, this is not the Ritz or the Plaza. But, great quality for the price.Located in the Murry Hill area a block (or two) from the Empire State Building. Nice little deli stores. All in all I would stay here again!

<Content>Great hotel outside the bustle of the city New York was the last stop of our three city tour. After opting for cheaper accommodations in Boston and Washington, we (two couples, no children) were happy to spend a little bit more money in New York for a comfortable hotel. The Affinia Dumont hotel was lovely and we were very happy with our choice. Our rooms were massive - bigger than some studio flats I've lived in and nicer than some 5 star hotels I've stayed in - with kitchen (oven, microwave, coffee maker, crockery, cuttlery, glasses), bathroom and comfortable chairs to lounge on. The room service food and drink comes from the restaurant/bar adjacent to the hotel and was reasonably priced.The hotel takes an interest in health and comfort and so offers free lemonade and fresh fruit in reception, and a selection of different pillows are available. There is a spa in the hotel, but with only three nights in New York and so much to do and see, we didn't have time to use it.Although there is no breakfast provided at the hotel, there is a lovely diner round the corner from it on 33rd and Lexington (Murray Hill Diner I think). For those of you who can't eat a big fried breakfast in the morning, try the cinammon toast.Location is usually the most important factor when I select a hotel, but this time I opted for the quality vs cost instead, so the hotel was a little more out of the centre of the city than I'd usually go for. However the area surrounding the hotel was nice and it felt safe to walk around without the hustle and bustle of Times Square and the likes. It is only a few blocks from the Chrysler Building, and a few more blocks again from Grand Central Station and the Empire State Building. Although further than that, you might want to consider a taxi or the underground.Our room was 12 floors up and we could hear still hear the street traffic, although as we were very busy during the days, it didn't keep us awake for long. The other couple on the 17th floor couldn't hear anything.Travel hint - there is only one boat tour company allowed to land on Liberty and Ellis islands and tickets sell out so look to buy in advance before you go to avoid disappointment and print out the internet voucher they send you. You can buy tickets for just transport to the islands, or you can add a monument tour (the base that the Statue of Liberty stands on) and/or an audio tour. If you opt for both tours, I recommend catching the first boat out in the morning and head straight for the monument tour when you land otherwise you'll spend a long time in queues. The audio tour for Ellis island is handy as it directs you around the building and saves you having to read the masses of information dotted around the place.

<Content>Over rated Travelled from UK to Orlando for a wedding and then on to NYork for 4 nights stay at the Affinia Dumont with my Parents - their first time in the States.On arriving at reception the girls were friendly but not warm, one girl asked me 3 times was this my first time staying at the hotel!! Had booked direct months in advance and had requested quiet rooms on high floors. My Parents got a room on the 4th floor and our room was on the 14th floor. The rooms were huge which was a plus but no way near quiet. After the first night I suggested to my Parents that they move rooms but they didn't want the upheaval of it all.On the third night there were road works all through the night directly outside the hotel. We complained the next morning and we received apologies and were asked if we would like a free breakfast which we declined as we had already eaten.The hotel is expensive for what you get. I agree it is in a good location within walking distance to Empire and Macys which was great, but the little extras that you needed to pay for were silly. I also agree that there should be no charge for use of the internet when most other hotels offer this service for free.I had a look at the Spa prices which I thought were high but then some people are obviously happy to pay.When checking out of the hotel I spoke with a really nice guy who was very helpful, I mentioned to him that we were not happy about the noise and he give us a $100 discount between the 4 of us.Overall, the hotel was nice but not good value for money.Myself and my Husband are returning to New York with 6 friends and we won't be staying at the Affinia. I really don't know what all the hype is about!!!

<Content>Nice stay, but neither fitness nor luxury, some rough edges The hype of this hotel is totally lost on me. Don't get me wrong, the hotel was nice and rather warm and pleasant for its size (though not particularly memorable) and fairly well-located. Perhaps I was wrong to assume that the service would be a cut above other chains or perhaps we were just a bit unlucky, but the little things did add up for us:- it was raining so we asked the bellhop to hail us a cab for five (e.g. the Toyota vans, but a lot of Escapes and even Crown Victorias will do it, too). He simply said no, without explanation. We then asked him to call one for us, he again said no, then walked away. We just hailed it ourselves then. (To be fair, in the same situation the next day, the other bellhop was very nice and got us a cab for five in less than a minute)- we chose the hotel partly because two people in our party were preparing for a marathon. The complimentary running kit advertised on their web site and on the night stand was eagerly awaited, but eventually none were available during our entire 4-day stay. This kit, among other things, consisted of such things like a wet towel upon arrival, stretch bands, a NYC running map, etc. Even if you run out of such things, at least they could have procured more or assembled part of the kit. Instead, they told us to try again tomorrow (until tomorrow became the day we checked out) For a hotel that labels itself fitness, I don't find this acceptable.- despite a specific request in the online reservation and calling ahead to confirm, the sofa bed was not made up and we eventually had to request that they prepare it after arriving at night.- the shower changed temperatures from hot to cold and vice versa continuously, so you had to change the setting constantly to make sure not to freeze/burn. Very low water pressure also (OK, I'll sacrifice something for the 30th floor view)- I had authorized another member of my party to check in before me, and when I called the hotel to see if he had arrived, they said no; he ended up waiting for me for two hours because he had in fact arrived already.- Lastly, any hotel that still charges for wireless internet doesn't fully merit a five-star rating in my opinion. At least most chains (e.g. Westin) will give you free use of the business center internet or lobby internet when they charge for in-room access, but not even that at the Affinia Dumont. I don't understand how hotels can seem so committed to the customer's experience yet charge for something so basic. The result is we didn't use the Internet (a minor inconvenience) and the hotel didn't make any money from us, they only inconvenienced us a bit. Same deal for the $7 water bottles in the room.Again, these are small things, but to be worthy of such high tripadvisor rankings/awards and rates around $500 (even in NYC), you have to do better than what we experienced at the Affinia Dumont. I can think of a few other hotels like the Sofitel and even the Tower level of the (Ramada) New Yorker where I've had better stays in the same/lower price category.To end on a more positive note, my favorite parts were the view from the 30th floor (no complaints there, gorgeous Chrysler building views) and the generally helpful staff (e.g. when we wanted a vase on Mother's Day, it was brought to the room immediately). It was also nice that we had a mini-kitchen with a big fridge in the room.I guess my two cents are that the Affinia is a pretty good choice for a city hotel, but there are a range of other options out there, too!

<Content>My new hotel in NYC This is now the only place I will stay in NYC. I booked a long weekend trip to the city for my mom and I. We were greeted and then were referred to by name anytime we went in or out. My mom loved it! The location was close enough to a subway station that my mom had no trouble. The ability to choose my pillows was wonderful as my mom actually uses one of the special types. Our view was on the higher floors with a corner room and we had 2 full walls of windows. What a view!

<Content>Always a great stay! I frequently visit NY for business and always make it a point to stay at the Dumont whenever possible. By NYC standards the rooms are very spacious and the staff is always extremely helpful. I always sleep very well in the comfortable beds and enjoy the selection of pillows they have to offer. The gym is large for a hotel (have not been to the spa) and the Barking Dog downstairs is always a sure bet for a decent meal at a reasonable price. The hotel is convenient to the subway and 3rd avenue has a great selection of restaurants.If you are a light sleeper I would recommend requesting a room on a high floor, as the street noise can often be a nuisance.

<Content>Really enjoyed our stay What a great hotel, the staff were so friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay here again.We stayed for 6 nights earlier this month, very convenient for subway, restaurants, Macy's etc. Lovely spacious room, the bed was so comfortable, the room was spotless. It was lovely to be able to make a cup of tea in the kitchenette and have the fridge to store milk etc. Lots of closet space, room safe, good lighting and great make-up mirror in the bathroom.We had a lovely time in New York and staying at the Affinia Dumont was a good choice.

<Content>Spacious room, very comfortable, great location Well first off didnt get the Crylser Building view requested at time of booking, not a problem, limited rooms have it.Room we did get was very spacious and clean. Bathroom was a bit small relative to the size of the room but was adequate and clean without being amazing. We didnt use the kitchen as there is so many places to eat in NYC.Hotel is in great location, 2 min walk to subway and 15 min walk to Macys and on to the other shops!This was my 2nd time in NYC and will be definitely returing to Dumont as it was a great hotel. Our first trip we stayed at the Sofitel which is a more impressive hotel lobby wise etc but there wasnt a major difference when it came to the rooms and you do pay alot more for the Sofitel!Would recommend.

<Content>Room with a view! Stayed at the Affinia Dumont for 5 days at the end of April 2008. I haunted the forums of trip advisor for months trying to choose the right hotel and I wasn't disappointed! It was hard decision choosing a hotel as we had a decent budget and we found that there wasn't allot in it price wise for the top rated hotels-except the Affinia it was the only one that offered a significant saving on the others which swayed us! We booked direct and they also offer non-refundable rates which offer even greater savings. We'd requested a room on a high floor with a view of the Chrysler building which we got. Wow what a view! Walking into the room and seeing that view is just something I'll never forget. The rooms are large and very comfortable. The bed was large and comfy and the kitchen was an added bonus having coffee making facilities. Although we never cooked in there the fridge was handy and the ability to have a quick slice of toast with your coffee first thing was also great! As others have said this hotel isn't opulent but it doesn't charge rates which reflect this either. To be honest it was as nice as the rooms in which we stayed at in 5* hotels in Las Vegas later in our trip. We have very little interaction with staff in general on our holidays unless we have a problem which we never did however all the staff from the doormen to the cleaners were friendly. the location of the hotel is quite residential with the barking dog next door which do breakfast lunch and dinner all at a good price and I found the quality good/expectable for what you paid. There is a little market next door too where you can get milk, wine, etc if you like. There are a couple of dinners close by too and bars and restaurants close by if you don't want to stray far. There is a subway stop about 5 mins from the hotel and this was our preferred method of getting around the city. The ESB is about 10 minutes walk away and Flatiron another 5 mins away. To me the location wouldn't be important to me if I returned as everywhere is accessible and you're never going to be close to everything. The Times Square area would be the only area that I wouldn't be interested in staying in and around just not my scene. This is a great hotel, my favourite thing was the view and if I were to return to NY I'd certainly check the rates for the Affinia and stay again!

<Content>Affinia Dumont is THE place to go!!! We had a great stay at the Affinia Dumont: 4 nights in April and 2 nights on our way back in May. We had room 3606 both times (thank you Affinia Dumont staff!!!), which had a great view almost all around because it's a cornerroom (2 double beds studio). We had more than enough space, while travelling with 2 adults and 2 children. The children loved the sound pillows! Check in was quick, our suitcases were brought to our room immediately. we ate breakfast at Guy and Guillard on our way to Macy's. Almost next to the hotel (first corner) is one small store of them but if you just walk a little further towards Macy's there is a bigger Guy and G. This one we liked more. If you like eating sushi or Teppan Yaki you just have to go to Aji Sushi. Just cross the street from the hotel to Duane Reed (convenient to buy some drinks) . It;s just 2 minute walk from the hotel and we ate our best sushi ever!!! It was our first time in NYC and we liked it very very much. The view from the other side of the Brooklyn bridge is AWESOME! To see the Manhattan skyline this way impressed the 4 of us. NYC was much more appealing to me than I thought it would. Felt safe and secure and just love to shop in the big city. On our way back we had too much luggage to fit in a taxi. We got an offer through the bell boy to go by limousine for USD85 including taxes and tip to JFK. Cheaper than 2 taxis and WOW, what a nice closure of our fantastic stay in the big city. I can't wait to go back to NYC and we'll definately will stay at the Affinia Dumont again: great staff, beautifull luxury room and great location!

<Content>Loved the Dumont We just returned from a trip to New York City and stayed at the Affinia Dumont. It's a wonderful hotel, with a great location. The Staff is always courteous and helpful. The suite was very spacious and relaxing. After a long day walking around the city, coming back to our home was wonderful. The beds are so comfortable you can't help but get a good night's sleep. We tried out the Oasis Spa. When we walked into the waiting room it was so peaceful with soothing music and candles. The 60 minuted Swedish Massage was just what we needed after a day of shopping. The Affinia Dumont is a great place to stay in the City.

<Content>Great Stay Had a Mother/Daughters weekend in NYC on April 25th. The hotel definitely lived up to our expectations and looked just like their website. The staff was friendly and very attentive to your needs and inquiries. The rooms were very large, with comfy beds, and Aveda amenitites. The bell hops were quick to service you even in the rush of check-in and check-out. You are able to have luggage storage upon your checkout so you are not inconvenienced and they even offered a room to freshen up before our departure back to Canada. Overall I would definitely recommend a stay at the Affinia Dumont Hotel.

<Content>Another outstanding stay at the Affinia Dumont We spent another great week at the Affinia Dumont in NYC. Again, the location can't be beat. Within walking distance to Central Park, Times Square, the UN, Macy's at Herald Square, and Grand Central Station. It was again spotlessly clean, with quite large rooms and very pleasant hotel staff. A true gem in the NYC hotel scene.

<Content>We were "WOWED" This trip was for myself and my 2 daughters-in-law. I have traveled to many places in the world and stayed at many 5 star hotels. The budget did not allow for that this time. The location of the hotel, the price and the fact that I could get a room with 2 queen beds was extremely important to me. Most NYC hotels have very small rooms, let alone suites with a kitchen for the price of this hotel room. I did weeks of research online and selected this hotel based on your website and reviews of the hotel on other travel websites. When we arrived we were first shown to a room with a king size bed, when I had reserved a room with 2 queen beds. The problem was immediately solved and we were shown to a suite with a wonderful view of the Chrysler Building. I must say that all three of us were wowed by our room, the view, and the friendliness of the staff. Having a seperate living room, bedroom, and fully equiped kitchenette was priceless. Alex our bellman and Donald the doorman were always friendly and helpful. We looked forward to the lavender scent that greeted us when we entered the hotel lobby. It was very uplifting after a long day of wandering around the city. We loved the location of the hotel, the neighborhood and the many little stores nearby. Anything we wanted or needed was within a block from the hotel. Even though the weather for the first few days of our trip was dreary and cold, the hotel was warm and welcoming. Sure, you could hear some honking horns and sirens at night, but come on, this is New York CIty. The spaciousness of our suite made us feel very at home. If we are lucky enough to return to NYC in the future we will definately stay at this hotel.

<Content>Many thanks for a wonderful stay All the reviews are completely true, Affinia Dumont is fantastic. Not only is the location ideal, the property and staff are excellent. Prior to arriving my boyfriend emailed the concierge to check the possibility of a room with a view as it was my birthday during our stay. Not only did they oblige, they gave us the penthouse (Room 3704) with the most incredible view of uptown and The Chrysler building. The reception staff were very helpful with general information about New York and booking attractions. Many thanks, we had a wonderful stay at Affinia Dumont.

<Content>Love the Affinia Dumont I was placed at the Affinia Dumont by the company I was working for in New York for two weeks. I hadn't heard of it, though I lived for many years in Manhattan. I LOVED the hotel. The service is as good as it gets in the U.S.---and not the fake attitude of service that a lot of pricey places try to substitute for the real thing. The staff at the Affinia Dumont all delivered wonderful, cheerful, genuinely helpful service. Our suite was cozy, well appointed, had real separation between the rooms, and a perfect little kitchen. Right next door and across the street are delis and sandwich shops so it's easy to stock the kitchen if you like. The fitness center has plenty of machines, and supplies headphones for the TVs that are on all the treadmills and elliptical machines. I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to get everywhere in the city from there---lots of cabs in the neighborhood. We were on a high floor and it was quite quiet. I would stay there again any time. A pleasant surprise.

<Content>Nice BIG rooms We've just arrived back from a short trip to NY and stayed 3 nights at the Affinia Dumont.We selected the hotel based purely on TripAdvisor reviews and have not been let down. The location is very good (Lexington and 34th) so everything is quite close by and check in was painless (although it did look a little busy in the morning). We had 2 studio rooms (one with king bed and one with two queens) and the rooms were huge in comparison to a typical NY hotel. To my surprise they also had a fully functional kitchen which was great if you want to eat in for breakfast/dinner.Admittedly the rooms did look a little dated (regualr TV vs plasma and a typical 'hotel' style carpet) but they were clean, the beds were very comfortable and there's a choice of 6 pillows! You even got mouthwash in the bathroom which was a first for me and a must after a big night out. Saying that if you are looking for a hotel with a wow factor I wouldn't say this is the one for you.The Affinia is billed as a fitness style hotel and I was able to order my yoga and running pack for working out. I believe you can get a free training session from monday to friday but I couldn't as it was the weekend. One word of advice- the hotel was listed as sold out on expedia so I called and booked direct and got a good rate.All in all a nice stay- I'd go back for sure.

<Content>Loved our stay at the Affina Dumont We had a great stay at the Affina. The staff was great. Our favorite was Chris Chopin the hospitality professional at the front door. He really kept his eye out for you and seems to enjoy people. Listen to where he tells you to eat...he was great. Our junior suite was very nice. Loved the pillow menu and the exercise kits. Room was nice and clean, roomy and set up nicely. Aveda toiletries was a nice touch. Gym was very good. Loved the location of the hotel. Walked to everyplace from here. Bathroom was small but kitchen was great. Great neighborhood. I would stay again in a minute.

<Content>Great location for walking around Manhattan Great hotel - we stayed 3 nights April 2008.The hotel staff were the friendliest we've encountered in years - we got a free upgrade to a suite overlooking the East River. They also recommended several restaurants that were superb (try Il Cortile in Little Italy).The rooms are clean, well equipped and spacious. The heating/aircon systems could do with a bit of maintenance and the bathrooms are ready to be refurbished but the overall package is good value for money based on the hotel location. There is a mini mart (Murray Hill) almost next door so you can keep the fridge well stocked.We walked to Central Park (45 mins) so you don't need a cab for most of the main sights - Times Square, Grand Central and 5th Avenue shops are all less than 30 min walk.

<Content>3 nights in April - a bit dissappointed;-( After reading all the reviews we thought this sounded ideal and didn't mind paying that little bit more for it. The location was excellent and the people working there were great, very helpful but the room itself was very tired looking. We had a 2 bed queen suite on the 23rd floor but the wall paper was patched, and the kitchen was old and tired. Definately not luxury by any stretch of the imagination.Although coffee was free, everything else was charged (including $7 for a bottle of water) but there are some nice little deli's nearby so just make sure you take your own water!They are very geared up to fitness, which as tourists was not what we were looking for.The room was a goodsize and was clean but could do with redecorating and freshening up. After spending two weeks travelling around the states this was the most dissappointing of all the hotels we stayed in, including JFK airport hotels at $150 less per night.

<Content>Little gem in the centre of Manhattan On TA advice, I sepent 4 nights at this hotel with my teenage daughter. Although there had been a problem with my initial booking for the first night (we had a floor on only 11th floor in spite of my request for a high floor room), for our 2nd and subsequent nights we had a room on 34th floor. At night it was just wonderful - fab views of NYC including our favourite, the Chrysler Building.The rooms have fully equipped kitchens so that you can buy breakfast foods and eat at the hotel before sight-seeing - very useful if you are trying to avoid enormous American breakfasts.The location of the hotel is superb , turn left out of hotel, 10 minutes walk to Macy's, Gap, Old Navy, Hennes etc and the heart of NY shopping, turn left for good restaurants. Lots of good small restaurants and dinersin the area. Easy to walk everywhere from the hotel, subway 7 minutes walk. All felt v.safe. Staff at hotel nice and helpful - offering good advice and annotated maps.Really a great hotel, we'll be back, as Arnie says.

<Content>simply the best Stayed for 5 nights and it lived up to the reviews on tripadvisor(i checked tripadvisor before i booked it). We stayed on the top floor 37th and wow what a view. Im scared of hights, but i wasnt in the room or looking out of the windows. The size of the room was enormous the room service was excellent and the staff were really helpfull and friendly and always had a smile for you. The barking dog next door was really nice although i warn you one plate would feed two of you. If you want a good steak go to the Rare Grill in Murry Hill (ask for directions its a five minute walk) the food is fantastic and try the cowboy steak, its the best steak we have ever tasted. Macys is 10 minutes walk away and well priced, Bloomingdales worth a visit but a bit pricey, Century 21 is great for mens clothes but not womens although the bags, belts are good. One department store that i have never seen advertised (and should be) is Lord and Taylor on 5th Avenue, a few blocks away. Fantastic and well priced like Macys. Hop on Hop off bus is great, if you buy the ticket off one of the touts its fine but they tell you the 48 hours start when you get the first bus, its not, its when you buy the ticket. We will definatly stay at the Affinia Dumont when we return to new york.

<Content>Lovely hotel exactly as described Just stayed at Affinia Dumont for three nights 11-14th of April, fantastic! First time in New York to celebrate my husbands 40th and can't wait to return! Like many others we booked the Affinia Dumont because of the reviews. Hotel is exactly as described, no surprises all good! Arrived early evening shattered after delay with Virgin. Reception very quick and efficient, made us feel relaxed and at home straight away, gave us keys and maps and information. We had a one bedroomed suite on the 32 floor, I had asked for a very quiet room as was worried about sleeping and that's what we got, all that could be heard were the distant sounds of the sirens, no noise from any other room and they were occupied. This was a surprise trip and had told my husband to expect a small room (the norm for NY hotels so I am informed). He was amazed when we entered our suite, large room with sofa, two chairs, desk, tv, midi system, books, mini bar snacks etc. Small but very adequate kitchen inc. dishwasher, coffee maker with free coffee! Microwave, toaster, oven and hob, full size fridge/freezer stocked with mini bar drinks, all the usual plates etc, everything you need! Separate bedroom with very comfortable huge bed and three lovely pillows (chosen from pillow menu). Bathroom good size, full bath and shower, sink and toilet, plenty of soft white fluffy towels and toiletries. The whole suite was immaculate, even the taps and grout, (I had read a lot about grotty bathrooms!) We were on the side/rear corner overlooking the East river, uninterrupted views! Beautiful to watch the sun rise before setting off for the busy streets! Ordered room service that night as late, huge pizza for 拢7, more than plenty for two adults.The hotel is situated in the lovely residential area of Murray Hill, with local diners including Barking Dog (really missing their food)! and markets (corner shops) with hundreds of beautiful fresh flowers for sale outside! This was the only place we saw this in NY and it added a sense of wellness and sophistication to the area. This is a lovely tranquil area to return to at the end of the day. Checking out is noon but as our flights were in the evening we checked out early and Affinia kindly stored our bags for the day, I knew that they offered this service free of charge from the other reviews, this gave us the whole of our last day free from luggage, we did see many people walking around with theirs! When we returned we had free use of the spa changing rooms/toilets to freshen up before leaving. They arranged a car to JFK for $65, taxi to the hotel had been $57, so it was very reasonable. Nothing was ever too much trouble for this hotel, the staff were always there for us. I know these reviews are read by the hotel, so thank you Affinia Dumont for a wonderful stay.

<Content>Great Value in Midtown New York We stayed at the Affinia Dumont in January 2008 and had a very nice room on an upper floor which gave us views of the Chrysler Building and the East River. The rooms were large and comfortable - and even had a full kitchen. The pillow menu is a nice touch. For the price and location you cannot beat this hotel and we would stay there again.  Be aware that the Affinia Dumont is not really a luxury hotel (3 star max). There is no restaurant in the hotel - a real pain if the weather is bad and there was no concierge to assist us with dinner plans. The front desk did give us a list of the restaurants in the vicnity...but could not give any specific guidance.

<Content>Half century winner Stefan L from Essex writes:Have just returned from a five day break in NY with family including four sons and wife who celebrated her big 50 whilst away. Hotel and staff could not be faulted. Concierge and reception team just wanted to help in any way possible and yet still had time to chat with guests to make them feel special and welcome. Our three suites on 21, 33 and 35 floors were superb and large enough for our four sons to chill out en masse. Family used the gym whilst I explored the local Murray Hill facilities and shops(and the Barking Dog next door).Great location in quieter (if there is such a thing) part of Manhatten. Would recommend the baseball in Central Park on a Saturday afternoon for a restful hour in the sunshine. Visited Empire State Building late in the evening and no queues but still busy- a result. and a great view.Had special meal out booked at the Maze (Gordon Ramsay venue) which was really special but could not fault food anywhere including Chinatown and local tratorria just down the road. Local coffee and breakfast venues all brilliant.Will be returning to NY and will most certainly book to stay at the Affinia again. Thank you all.

<Content>Good location We stayed for 5 nights in a one bed suite in March.Overall the hotel was very good - but it gets such amazing trip advisor reviews that I think it is difficult not to build up your expectations too much. It is a very comfortable hotel, extremely well situated and provides the facilities you need in your room. It is not however a truly luxurious hotel, and is in need of some updating / refurbishment. The suite was large - especially by NY standards. The kitchen was well equipped, and the sofa bed adequate for the children. The bathroom however was tiny - too small really for 4 people. We were a little disappointed on arrival at 1am local time to find that the sofa bed had not been made up for the children, despite my e-mail stating they would be with us. We had to wait with very tired children for sheets to be delivered, which were just handed to us with a comment that 'you know how to make up the bed' - housekeeping were unavailable, but this was not really the service level we had expected. Similarly there were only towels for 3 people in the bathroom - when clearly we were 4. Minor points, but illustrate that this is not the mega pampering service level some reviews would have you believe.We thoroughly enjoyed our breakfasts at the Barking Dog - and contrary to some reports felt they were very good value - $40 for people to eat huge amounts of pancakse, eggs, muffins etc seemed a great deal.The hotel lobby arranged a car back to the airport for us, which was no more expensive than getting to the hotel - a good service.Overall, I do think the hotel was a good choice, and may well stay there again, but just don't think people should go expecting everything to be absolutely amazing.

<Content>Perfect stay! We arrived at the Affinia Dumont on 1st April after an uneventful flight with Virgin.We were slightly early for check in, but were given access to our room straight away, which was a nice touch. The room itself was lovely. On the 37th floor with views of the Chrysler Building. Must admit before we went I was a little nervous about being a little out of the action, but found that I relished the (relative) peace and quiet the hotel offered. Found everyone who worked at the hotel to be lovely and helpful. Even when asking random questions about locations of different shops etc. We got them to organise us a car to the airport at the end of our stay and this was $75, which I didn't think was bad. Only dissapointment was they tried to charge us for two movies which we didn't watch in the room. We didn't actually touch the pay for view part of the TV. This was resolved quickly and easily though. All in all a wonderful stay and if we were going back we would book it again without question.

<Content>Really good choice Stayed at this hotel after reading review and noting the travellers choice award. Very good hotel for space and location combination. Yes, carpet was a bit worn but decor was good and customer service was the best I have experienced.The doormen actually did their job and never failed to rush to open doors with a friendly word.Staff on reception were very polite and efficient.Only complaint would be food we ordered. They forgot half the order but then managed to find it. They told us the mashed potato was baked when it was clearly boiled... yuk. They insisted that they couldn't send up any butter as they didn't know what it was and didn't use it....very suspect. Anyway... there were lots of places to eat other than room service.

<Content>Lived up to the hype I picked this hotel because of its reviews on TripAdvisor and was not disappointed. First, great location - walking distance to Grand Central or Penn Station, Empire State Building and Times Square but still reasonably quiet for New York (there will be sirens at night wherever you are!). We were near the top (35th floor) and had an unbelievable view of the Chrysler building. Decor is a little 80s but rooms are huge, beds comfortable, everything worked and if we had been staying longer, mini kitchen would have been a plus. Gym is small but functional - ten or so machines of the treadmill, cross trainer, bike variety and similar number of Nautilus weight machines plus free weights. Reception friendly and helpful. Only complaint is that room service food was poor and staff in the Barking Dog seemed overworked. Not cheap for a hotel which Expedia rates as 3.5 star but we were only there for a couple of nights so wanted to splash out and didnt regret it. We had a two room suite and it looked just like the video tour on their website.

<Content>A lovely quiet hotel in the middle of Manhattan I stayed at the Affinia for three nights while on a business trip. My room was huge with a very nice kitchenette and bathroom. Staff were friendly and helpful. It's a great location but very quiet. Only negative: I think it's cheeky to charge $10 a day for high speed internet access when you are charging top $ room rate - I know many hotels do so but why not include internet in the room rate.

<Content>A good place to stay Two adults and two boys, ages 11  13 spent 3 nights at the Affinia Dumon in March 2008. It was a nice experience. The hotel is in a nice area with grocery, delis, restaurants  a Starbucks a block up the street. Duane Reade drugstore is across the street. Empire SB is a few blocks up the street, and Times Square is a bit of a walk, but doable. Hotel lobby is fairly small and compact. We asked for an early check-in and a nice view and were told upon arrival that we could check in early but a nicer room with a view would be available in a couple of hours, which was fine with us. At the recommendation of the conceirge (all wonderful) we went around the corner to Patsy's for lunch. A great find: terrific pizza, outstanding salads, liquor license, Zagat rated. Another great spot a few doors up is Jackson Hole, a burger joint which is not to be missed. Enormous burgers with every topping imaginable. Liquor licence there too and I think there are a few of them in the city. Zagat rated too I think. We had a spacious corner room on the 23rd floor with a view of the East River-not the Chrysler Building but quite nice all the same. Comfortable beds and nicely appointed bathroom. The kitchen was basic with fridge, micro, stove, plates, etc. but only a sauce and fry pan, so don't expect to cook up a pasta dinner. I suspect these kitchenettes are designed for quick breakfasts and keeping beverages cold, which in the end suited us fine. We didn't use the gym or spa, but it was one of the most complete ones I've seen in any hotel. It's on the 2nd floor with windows looking out onto 34th St. My only suggestion to management would be that the in-room carpeting and hallways are not up to par with the overall hotel appointments. It looks like its good quality carpeting, it's just starting to look a bit worn. New carpeting would make the place sparkle!We would stay at the Dumont again. Nice location with large comfortable rooms.

<Content>Great hotel, great location We stayed in the Affinia for 4 nights in March 2008 and can recommend its great location and practicality. We are a family of four and it was great to have a little kitchen (breakfast next door at the Barking Dog was a little steep) where we could have cereal in the morning, or get a sandwich from the great deli next door to have in the evening when we were exhausted from walking. The room was clean and good size although the bathroom was a little small. The gym was great - unfortunately, didn't get to use the spa. We had a problem with the heater which was noisy but someone came and shut it off for us. The location is great for sightseeing as it's pretty central and of course getting a cab is always easy. We were on the 18th floor but with all the other tall buidlings around it didn't seem high.

<Content>Great hotel, really spacious Totally recommend this place for business or with family.I've stayed in maybe 10-15 NY hotels for business or with family. They seem to be in three types. 1) Ridiculous and expensive with 20 staff jostling to move your bag from one bellman to the next 2) Tiny, tiny rooms overlooking AC units. 3) The W type trendy ones where they have painted the tiny room purple and made the staff all wear hugo boss (but the rooms are still tiny!)I've now stayed at the Affinia around 5 times and it is great for business people who really just want a big modern room and helpful staff that act like real people. There are nice touches like fitness packs and welcome drinks, but really this hotel is just the perfect neutral space for a trip, where it all works, everyone is nice and you look forward to checking in.There is no restaurant, but in NY that is a definite non-issue as there are plenty of options around and the kitchen is well suited to juice and bagel type breakfasts.

<Content>Extremely Dissapointed After reading the wonderful reviews on multiple websites I was quite excited about the Dumont. Having just gotten off the phone with the absolute rudest reservations agent I have ever spoken to, I am no longer excited, and am now searching for an alternate location for a combined business and pleasure stay. I sure wanted to try something new for a change (usually stay in doubletree suites, waldorf, and others with a more central location), and I am disappointed my hopes are dashed.I, as any consumer would I believe, asked questions about the rates because my online research just over the past few days has seen a rather large increase. I was courteous and primarily curious, but the agent could not be bothered by my questions. Her tone of voice was condescending, and not the least bit helpful. It is very infrquent that I get off the phone with a customer service representative and feel kicked in the stomach just by someones telephone attitude. Guess today is my day, and guess my thoughtful search for the perfect place for a buisness trip that would include celebrating my soon to be 16 year olds birthday present will have to start over.

<Content>A good value. We join others in praising this hotel. It is well maintained and the staff are friendly and helpful. Our double studio room was decently large for NY and had a very useful kitchen. The weekend AAA rate was $252 per night. The Murray Hill neighborhood has many good restaurants (Cosette's and DiCiro's especially) and is just far enough away from the theater district and the midtown glossies to give a sense of peace after returning from a visit to those locations. We are happy to recommend the Dumont to our friends.

<Content>Great hotel and location We just returned from Affinia Dumont and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. We stayed for 4 nights before traveling to las vegas and then stayed again for 3 nights on returning from vegas. The hotel looked after our bags while we where in vegas which was a big help. The rooms are big and very clean with a nice little kichenette.The staff were great ,and very helpful and polite. It has a great gym and spa which are well worth a visit. The mini bar in the room is very expensive but why use it when there is a 24hour grocery store next door selling all you need. There is also a diner round the corner on 34th street which is great for breakfast any time off the dayThere is a tube station round the corner on 33rd street which will take you to grand central where you change for the time square shuttle all for $2 or you can walk. Maceys and other shops are only a 10 min walk from hotel.Great value for money as most hotel rooms in NYC are very small. Ask for a high floor as the views are fantastic. We got the 28th floor facing the chrysler building and what a view.On our next visit to NYC we will be staying here again.

<Content>Great little hotel at a very reasonable price The hotel is situated to most central places of interest. Grand Central Station, Empire State Building , Macys, Times Square all within a 20 minute walk. The staff were very helpful  obliging. The rooms were clean and the beds comfy. I was amazed at the number of pillows you can request, some even have speakers in them that you can attach to your MP3 player or to the CD player in the room. The barking dog restaurant was value for money and the steak was cooked to perfection. I would recommend this small friendly hotel  would certainly stay there again.

<Content>Perfect Hotel My family and I stayed in the Affinia Dumont on 150th  34th St from March 26 - 29th. The hotel is great. We had a suite with 2 queen beds, small kitchen, bathroom with a great shower, plenty of towels etc. The kitchen was equipped with coffee, washing liquid, microwave, Fridge and full cooker. Although we did not really use any of the kitchen facilities, except the fridge, it was convenient to have available.The staff were very helpful with good recommendations for nearby restaurants etc. The restaurant - the barking dog - beside the hotel has great food and is good vaule for both dinner and breakfast. The location beside Murray Hill was great with a subway just 5 mins walk. When I stayed in New York in 2002, I had stayed near Madison Sq Garden and I hated the noise from traffic etc. The Affinia Dumont is approx 15 mins walk to Madison Square Garden, but the difference in traffic noise, especially at night is greatly reduced and is a big plus.I would recommend this hotel for all types of singles, couples, families.I also used a limo service called Double Diamond in New Jersey for transport between Newark and Manhatten and would strongly recommend it for service and price. They are available through the web.

<Content>Large rooms, very nice staff, but not really a luxury hotel Our family of five spent four nights there in mid-March 2008. We had two rooms, each a one-bedroom suite, on a fairly high floor. This is a very good hotel in a fairly quiet area of Manhattan. The rooms appear to have formerly been appartments in this tall but fairly small building (only 7 rooms per floor). The staff was kind and helpful. The Barking Dog restaurant is attached to the hotel and provides room service. The rooms we had were quite large, with small fully-equipped kitchens, and nice views. The beds were quite comfortable, with very nice linen. Nice bathrooms too. However, the decor in the rooms is a little drab (brown, yellow, etc), and the hotel lobby is very tiny. The room service breakfast, served in styrofoam containers, was inexpensive and not very good. The Dumont is a nice hotel that is well run, but it does not look and feel at all like a true luxury hotel. It is surprising that it was ranked so highly among U.S. luxury hotels in the Tripadvisor rankings. It is really not that kind of a hotel, particularly by New York standards. But if you know what to expect, a very nice hotel.Pros: large rooms, very clean, nice view if high floor, kitchenette with a full-size fridge, very kind and polite staff, nice little deli/grocery on the block, quiet area.Cons: not the look and feel of luxury, tiny lobby, room decor a bit old, lousy room service food and presentation.

<Content>Very satisfied The staff at the Affinia Dumont could not be more friendly and try very hard to be helpful. I stayed here with my husband and two teenagers in a one bedroom suite. We had a wonderful time with plenty of space for the four of us, especially for New York. The beds were very comfy and we liked having the choice from 6 different types of pillows. All our requests were met with ease and efficiency including room service (which was just fine but there are definitely better options in the neighborhood) to an extra blanket to a dvd player in the living roomWe would definitely stay here again. We had a room on the river side on the 22nd floor and it was nice and quiet and the view decent. There was a small dog that yapped quite a bit, somewhere near us but it did not bother us enough to complain. The kitchen had a microwave and a full size refrigerator, which was great to have. There is also a full set of dishes and silverware. The gym was a little disappointing as this is billed as a fitness hotel. The spa treatment area was probably nicer than many hotels but the workout area was suitable but not great. If you only use cardio machines you are all set but if you want to use weight equipment this is just okay. Try the running routes from the map from the front desk - this was great fun. The Murray Hill area has a lot of restaurants and is a more residential area so it is a little less hectic than other areas. We enjoyed going to La Giara (3rd), Artisanal (Park) and RIce (Lexington) all in the vicinity of the hotel. The hotel was completely full the three nights we stayed but there was never any problems with this. We will come back again.

<Content>Amazing staff, hotel, location and view I stayed here over the Easter holiday with my mum. The staff were amazing, friendly and very helpful. We arrived late on the Wednesday night and they upgraded us to a jnr suite as they had no rooms left. They said we would have to change rooms the following day. However, when i went to reception to see what room we'd be changing to, they let us stay for the remainder of our trip in the upgraded room for no extra charge!!! All of the staff, from the porters to the reception desk were so friendly and very helpful, giving us great suggestions on where to eat and what to see. The room itself had amazing views of the city (34th floor) and the room was very clean. It was also in a prime location, a 5 minute walk to the Empire State building, 10 minute walk to Maceys.I would recommend this hotel to anybody going to NYC

<Content>Very friendly and comfortable. Stayed three nights and found the hotel to be top class. Staff were friendly and efficient. Room (29th floor) was very spacious, clean and comfortable. The little kitchen area is a bonus, although we only made the odd cup of coffee. Superb views too. The hotel is in an excellent area - Murray Hill - and is only a couple of minutes walk from the subway. Loads of bars and eateries nearby should you not wish to stray too far. I will happily return to this hotel.

<Content>Great hotel  We stayed here in November for 6 nights, choosing the hotel after reading many reviews on many websites.As I work in hotels I am always nervous as to what to expect but was not to be dissapointed.From our arrival where the receptionist provided maps, brochures and answered all questions to the very friendly  helpful concierge and the housekeeping staff, all gave a smile and made us feel welcome.The room was spotless - better than some 5* hotels I have stayed at in London  Las Vegas, was a very good size and was in good repair.The location of the hotel can't be faulted, a block to the subway  a couple from the Empire State building - a sight that put a smile on our faces every morning.We are looking to return again later this year and would have no hesitation at all in choosing this hotel.

<Content>Friendliest hotel ever. My friend and I went to New York with slight trepidation, not sure what to expect from such a busy city. Well, we couldn't have hit it better with this hotel. The staff at reception were the all round friendliest and thoughtful of any hotel I've stayed in. They organised tickets for us, helped us in any way we wanted and made us feel REALLY welcome in the Big Apple. The room was very big with two double beds but most surprising was the full size kitchen with fridge- freezer, microwave, cooker, toaster and coffee maker. Not that we ate in but if (or rather when) I go back with my husband and kids, that would be a huge help to our finances. It was also in a superb location, well within walking distance of most of the sights. LOVED it. Thanks folks.

<Content>Great spot With a list of reviews like these then it was no contest as to where we booked. The staff are genuinely eager to help and the suites are spotless and very well appointed. Be sure to request a room at the front of the hotel floors 30 and above - that way you get a terrific view of uptown Mnahattan.I had mentioned when I booked that I wanted a room with a view because we were there for my partner's birthday....we got a great view on floor 33 and a birthday cake to boot!!Location is also great for the 4/5/6 subways through 32nd street - make sure you take the local subways because the express doesnt stop at 32nd.Foodwise there are plenty of bars, delis, restaurants in the area. Guy  Gallard on the corner of 34 and Lex does great breakfasts and Pizza Mercato next door will show you what a large  american pizza looks like. La Giara around the corner on 3rd is a pretty good italian. We used the Murray Hill deli next door to the hotel, but there is a better one a couple of blocks down towards 2nd Ave. If you like Starbucks then there is one on the corner of 34 and Lex - although be warned the queues can be long.The visitor center on the ground floor balcony at Macys will issue you with 11% discount cards for Macys and they have a load of tourist info with some good multi booking deals.We flew into Newark - the taxi cost $65 plus the tolls of about $7 I think. The hotel got us a car back for $75 so there's nothing in it.Wasnt too impressed with the Barking Dog. We tried it on night 1 because we were so tired and just needed food. You get a LOT but its no great cuisine.

<Content>Great place to stay! Booked this hotel with a week to go at a busy time. Asked for a queen studio on a high a floor as possible as it was our first trip. They gave us the 17th floor but unfortunately the room was next to a group of lads who were quite loud. The hotel moved us with no fuss as all to a lower, smaller room (it was a busy hotel) with no view to speak of but the room was fine, clean and plenty big enough for us and the view didn't matter as we just slept after a long day doing the sights. The staff were excellent, helpful, going out of their way to assist us whenever we needed help. They messed up with some requests that i had made before arrival (i had cancelled a champagne and chocolate order and asked for flowers instead to take to a friend). Everything was in the room when we arrived including the flowers which were in a vase which i had asked be hand tied to take away. The hotel did not charge us for these - i assume to make up for the mistake and the room switch. Overall i would reccomend without hesitation, the only problem is if everyone books this hotel there will be no specials in the future - but they deserve the patronage, really good value for money in NY and clean and spacious.

<Content>Fantastic stay Stayed 7th to 12th March and booked after seeing the reviews on Trip Advisor - we were not disappointed. As recommended we requested a room looking towards the Chrysler building and on arrival we were a little disappointed to find none available - however they said they would move us the next day which they did. This room was on the 29th floor and had a fantastic view. The room was clean, tidy , spacious with huge comfortable bed. All the staff were friendly and helpful, particularly the doormen who always had a friendly greeting and helpful recommendations. We found the location ideal, within walking distance of Empire State Building, Macy's, Times Square, Grand Central and much more.We only used the Barking Dog for one breakfast but found it to be very good. We can recommend the Balthazar, 80 Spring St. in SoHo for a super 'bistro' meal and Roxy's Deli in Times Square for enormous sandwiches. This was our first visit to New York but we will definitely stay at the Affinia Dumont when we return.

<Content>Wonderful! Stayed for a long weekend, with the youngest in the party being 11 and the oldest 65! Clean rooms, our room was on the back side away from the street, so it was very quiet! Though the other room we had was street side and on the fourth floor, it had a lot of street noise. Though nothing that a pillow or earplugs didn't quiet!Oustanding staff, ready to do whatever you requested. Beds were comfortable in very spacious rooms! Ate nextdoor at the Barking Dog, pretty good food, and the service there was great too!Murray Hill Diner around the corner is great for an inexpensive breakfast!Will definately stay there again!

<Content>loved it, loved it, loved it. Like many people we used trip advisor to give us the best advice on picking our hotel. We thought the Affinia sounded too good to be true. But we really did love it. We had stayed in New York before but thouhgt we would try a different part of the city.Our trip started with a small blip. On our arrival we were told that they didn't have the room we booked (2 double beds) however they were very sorry and would move us the next day. We were very tired at this point and after a view moans and groans (which resulted in some money off the bill and a free breakfast the next day) we went up to our room which was very spacious and clean. The next day we went down to reception where we were greeted by a very helpfull reception desk who apologised again for the problems the night before and they would make sure that our bags were put in our new room while we were out. We returned later in the day and we were quite aprehnsive about what our new room would be like. And all i can say is wow. Our new room was a suite with the most amazing view of the the Khrysler building. There was a large living area with a kitchen and next to that 2 large beds a nice size bathroom, we were stunned for a moment and thought they had sent us up to the wrong room, on the desk was a bottle of wine and a note apologising again for the mistake. The location is not as central as some might like but you can easily walk to Macys, empire state building and grand central station. And a very short walk to a subway station. And if you come out of the hotel and turn right you come to some really lovely bars and restaurants. So all in all we loved our stay at the Affinia the staff we very friendly and nothing seemed like too much trouble for them. I would recommend it to anyone. oh and the iced tea in reception is very nice as well.

<Content>Affable Affinia Would thoroughly recommend the Affinia. Stayed in NY for a wonderful 5 nights. The staff were very friendly and helpful - provided us with an adapter,helped check-in online, had a problem with the heater which they fixed the same day and the icing on the cake was when we told them it was our 5th wedding anniversary a bottle of bubbly arrived in our room.We were on the 36th floor so had a great view, and had a studio with small kitchen. Bed and pillows were v.comfortable. Don't expect super luxury or grandness - the fittings/decor are a little dated - but for the price, location and staff friendliness as well as the gym, then this is a great place. Next door the Barking Dog is tasty, and the Murray Hill deli next door is great for a take away bagel and freshly made juice - if only they had deli's like this in south London! Would def.go back here and to NY.

<Content>absolutely fantastic we stayed here june 07 with three kids,two teenagers 16 and 13 and an 8 year old.we stayed in a one bedroom suite and it was fantastic.it had a massive living room with great views and a large bedroom with two massive beds which were the most comfy beds i have ever slept in.there was also a kitchen which came in very handy with three kids who are always hungry!the location is brillant,just around the corner from empire state building and within walking distance of all the tourist attractions.we had breakfsat most mornings in the murray hill diner which is just out the door and keep left and we also ate in the barking dog restaurant beside the hotel at night which by the way served great food and the staff were very helpful and nice.we are going back to new york next year and plan to stay at the affinia again,cant wait

<Content>very nice experience Took husband and kids 11 and 15 years old. Stayed in room 2706. Very nice and very clean--this is coming from Mrs. Germ Phobe--no hairs in the tub, or sink, no mold on the shower curtain, the bathroom counter was spotless, as was the kitchen. The pillows were yummy, the mattress was just regular not bad but not great. Internet access is $9.95 for 24 hours- should be included. Only wish they could have turned the hotel building so we could have had the awesome view of the Chrysler Building.

<Content>Great hotel - really recommended Just got back after a great stay in New York at the Affinia Dumont. The hotel was recommended to us by a friend and he told us to ask for a room with a view. We were not disappointed at all!From the moment we walked into the hotel we felt really welcome by all the reception staff, who could never stop trying to help us and offering there services to us.We stayed on the 28th floor in junior suite but the view was superb. The room was very large, with a big tv/bathroom/cupboard as well as a kitchenette (which was really useful as you could leave drinks and food in the fridge to eat or heat up in microvave or toaster).The location was fantastic. Deli next door (very good with the kitchenette), 5 minutes from Empire State Building, 10 minutes from Macy鈥檚 and not much more from Maddison Square Garden. Taxi to Rockefeller. Times Square and Bloomingdales cost betweem $5-6.We walked miles on the 1st day as you can imagine in New York. And it was great to get back to the hotel and they were laying on complimentary drinks, canopes and cheese/biscuits (we think they do this twice a month). 2 times we ate in the Barking Dog which is the pub/restaurant next door to the hotel. The staff were really helpful and friendly and were more than happy to chat to you. It was also good to pop in there for a quick drink after a long shop without having to walk far back after.The gym was also very good and you can access it 24 hours a day. There was enough machines, gym equipment and weights to not have to stand still at all.Whilst it was quite a nice touch to always have complimentary fresh fruit in the reception area and fresh coffee in the mornings.The only disappointment we can have is that an NBA Basketball team were staying at the hotel whilst we were there and being from England we had no idea who any of the players were! Just imagine if Manchester United had been staying at the hotel!Great hotel, really recommended to couples, families and anybody wanting a very good hotel at a very reasonable price. You can see why the rates on this website are so good.

<Content>Perfect hotel for New York Trip We stayed at the Affinia for 6 nights during February and had a really wonderful stay. The hotel is well located to all mid-town attractions (same street as Empire State and Macy's), but a couple of blocks from the hussle and bussle of the city. The hotel was clean and well serviced. We stayed in a junior suite, which had a lot of room, a lounge suite and a seperate kitchen (which was handy for making tea and toasting bagels!).There are several coffee shops, delis and restaurants virtually on the doorstep to this hotel. It does have a hotel restaurant, which we were recommended not to eat at. The deli next door sold basic grocery supplies, eg breakfast cereal, as well as deli snacks, toasted paninis etc. There was a great deli across the road (Guy and Gallard) which did hot meals and coffee from breakfast until dinner, and starbucks was short stroll.A dining highlight for us was Da Ciro, an authentic italian restaurant around the corner on Lexington. The food was delicious!The staff at the hotel were really helpful - they provided advice on restaurants, transport and were wonderful at hailing cabs during rainy peak hours!There is a gym, but we never saw it. All that walking around the shops was enough exercise! There was a professional ice hockey team there at the same time as us though, so the facilities must be quite good.The Affinia is not a boutique or trendy hotel. It is clean, welcoming and well-located. My husband and I would have no hesitation in recommending it to other travellers.

<Content>Great, great stay for my first time in New York There were four of us that stayed at the Affinia. There was more than enough room for all of us. We had a small kitchen with a fridge, microwave, stove and sink, great for getting juice, cereal etc. The beds were very comfortable, the staff excellent. We asked for a room in a high floor and got an excellent view. The location was great. Few blocks (city blocks) from Macy's, Empire State Building. If you want to ice skate, don't rent skates at Bryant park. They were plastic and dull. Nice places to eat, just walk outside, you will be overwhelmed. Alot of little deli shops to get snacks and drinks for the hotel....save yourself some coin. I felt very at home at this hotel and where it was located. I will be coming back here on my next visit to New York. And New York was a great city too!

<Content>Fine some positives some negatives I recently stayed 6 nights at the Affinia. In summary it was acceptable/fine even if not fantastic:Goods points:- Suite included full kitchen which allowed me to eat in if I wanted to- Free fruit at front desk, papers delivered etc- Housekeeping was good, room was clean (I honestly can't say I noticed any unclean areas as mentioned in earlier reviews during my stay)- Pillow menu is a novel option and my requests were bought straight up upon calling- Reception was responsive (eg on check in I took trip advisor's advice and asked for a room with a view and was given a room on level 36 with view over the harbour/wall street area, they also promptly fixed up a maintenance issue I had whilst I went out for lunch)- Comfortable bed, big desk to work at- Shop around and you can get a range of prices, I used gta hotels site and got a much cheaper deal than other sites offeredBad/not so good points:- Older style rooms, don't go there and expect luxury, it is a 3 to 3.5 star hotel- Noisy aircon/heating in my room, made it difficult to sleep with it on but it could just have been my room.....- location, for a first time NYC visitor I felt it was a little out of the for walking or buses (I didn't use the subway so this may be more convenient), I still felt safe in the area even though it wasn't particularily busy at night. - Barking Dog cafe didn't really impress me

<Content>Overall a nice experience I stayed here for 1 night on a Saturday in February. It was a last minute girls' weekend trip to NYC (I live upstate). We booked the room through Orbitz (when I called the hotel directly they said they were booked, but Orbitz still had rooms). The cost was $259 plus tax (came to $305). We were really looking forward to it after reading the reviews on TripAdvisor and seeing the pictures on their website. We arrived after taking the train into Penn Station and walking about 5-6 blocks. It was 2:15 pm when we arrived, and we were told that the hotel was overbooked and we might not get a room. Then suddenly, the clerk found us a room, but it wasn't ready. We were slightly disappointed because we wanted to go up to the room and freshen up. The nice thing was- the bell hop held our bags for us, and they let us go up to the 2nd floor and use the spa bathroom to freshen up a bit. Then we were on our way to hit the shops!When we arrived to get our room several hours later, we were happy to find we were on the 30th floor and had a view of the Chrysler building. Overall, here are the pros and cons:PROS:Large roomSoft sheets, very comfortable bedAveda bath productsLarge bathtub, good shower water pressureGreat locationBarking Dog Cafe was delicious for breakfast and right next doorGreat restaurants and bars nearby (we went to Blockheads, Bar XII, and Tonic- all fun neighborhood bars and Blockheads had $4 mojitos!)Matthew at the front desk was very friendly and accomodatingCONS:No bathrobes in the rooms as pictured on their website (when we asked about this, they said they provide them upon request because too many people were stealing them). Of course we found out about this too late.The pillow menu was not available- we asked about this, and supposedly they ran out. Water temperature would not stay steady- it kept getting very hot, but when you adjusted it just a tad, it would be far too cold.We couldn't get a later check-out.Expensive.Overall, this was a nice hotel and we were comfortable staying there. If I got a better price I'd stay here again, otherwise I would probably look for something that's a better value.

<Content>Massively over rated by Trip Advisor I always take Trip Advisor reviews for what I think they are - basically good marks are for value for money. For suite hotels like the Affinia chain this tends to mean can you sleep many people comfortably To be fair this is a problem for hoteliers -unless they impose stringent controls at check in - because it means that the fittings get put under immense strain -  if the housekeeping on your floor is slightly weak after heavy use by previous guests things get shabby real quick.Location is good - not stunning. Especially impressive is the choice of restaurants of decent quality within one block. I'd guess this is probably one of the most densely populated Zagat recommended blocks on Earth. Nothing Earth shattering but great choice, variety  price equation.Enough of being considerate - even by New York standards this hotel is overpriced for the offer. The problems are;1. Poor public area/reception space compared to hotel space. If you are out of your room by midday you will have nowhere to sit if you have a late flight out of NYC.2. Shabby decor -  lack of cleaning of public areas - especially elevators.3. In this case, an extraordinarily shabby 2 bedroom suite. Filthy dirty carpets, stained furniture - notably the sofa bed  dust everywhere. Indeed it wasn't a 2 bedroom suite at all it was a studio with a suite connected through opened connecting doors. This meant we had two kitchens and 2 of the rooms were dominated by huge desks - BUT we had no dining table.Sorry to be picky but this place does not even compare with the Envoy Club let alone somewhere like the Kimberley.To give a sense of proportion I stay regularly at The Affinia Manhattan, The Westin Times Square  The Tribeca Grand as well as the hotels mentioned above. They all have their points but they are all in my opinion fairly reviewed on Trip Advisor.As a previous reviewer said 鈥渄o not expect luxury鈥?- fact is - it is barely 3* let alone 4*. And to keep that 3* level based on my experience it needs some serious attention to housekeeping!Oh and I only booked through Expedia because the groups own website is astonishingly ineffeicent - even for registered Affinia group registered members.

<Content>Not what I expected. Nice, but not luxury at all. Based on the reviews on this site, I was anticipating a very luxurious hotel. Perhaps this was unfounded on my part. The hotel is nice, but I would describe it as a 3-1/2 stars based on quality, and level of finish. The doorman was extremely friendly. There is a full kitchenette with full size refridgerator, so if that is what you are looking for, this would be a great bet. Just don't go looking for a robe and slippers in the closet. Fabulous views of the New York lights. Great work setup. Again, everything was fine, just not a luxury hotel. Certainly a notch above entry level hotel chains. One peculiarity, I had a flight and asked to check out a bit late, and this is the first time I have ever been told flat out no, they had already met their quota of late check outs for the day. I thus ended up storing my luggage for two hours and roam around unproductively as opposed to working in my room. As a constant business traveler this was my first experience where no flexibility whatsoever was an option. And the check in time is fairly late, so I didn't understand the management premise. I would not stay here again. Unless it was for an extended stay, or perhaps if I had kids, and needed the fold out sofa in addition to the bed.

<Content>Not luxury.... A real Disappointment I I have just returned from a three night stay at the Affinia Dumont. The trip to NYC was a birthday present to my mother from myself and my dad to celebrate her 60th birthday 鈥? So the trip was supposed to be special and the hotel was also supposed to be special to mark the occasion, however, when we arrived the hotel was a huge disappointment. First impressions were not good: no bell boy took our bags from the cab to the hotel; no on one held the door open for us 鈥?we had to struggle through the doors with our bags. The staff at check in were very nice and helpful, however, we were not shown to our room and no one offered to do so. The lifts were pumped full of awful music and again the interiors were very tired looking. The room while being very spacious especially for NYC (this is my 5th trip to NYC.. so I know what I鈥檓 talking about!) was not the 鈥榣uxurious鈥?setting that the hotels website had shown nor the reviews on trip advisor had described. The carpet was an ugly brown and very wrinkled and worn in places; the furniture was in heavy wood and very old fashioned.. There were a number of light bulbs missing from sockets. However the beds were gorgeous and very luxurious, kitchen a good size and the bathroom big. The Aveda products were nice but there was no shower gel only soap and no sewing kits / cotton wool pads/ razors that I would expect of a hotel rated as 4 stars. The view: I had specifically requested when booking a high room, with a view of the Chrysler building because it was my mothers birthday and this is her favourite building in NYC. This was the main reason why I chose this hotel over others that I had considered (including the W hotel, Soho house, Tribeca Grand) as it was my mums birthday and I wanted her to see her favourite building during her stay. While we had a view which was great .. it was of downtown and not the Chrysler. The room was also situated near to the cleaners cupboard and it was very noisy so I asked immediately to be changed. While the reception staff were friendly they stated clearly that they could only move us to a lower room. I am amazed that I could not be accommodated especially as I booked this at the start of December and was very clear in my request about the room and the reason why. Unlike other hotels that I have stayed in when celebrating events my mother was not made to feel special in any way by the staff despite me clearly stating when I made the reservation that it was a very special birthday.when we left a member of staff put a lot of pressure on us to take a car to JFK for $65.00 he was very pushy despite the fact that i stated clearly that we were going to take a cab ($45 + toll and tip) . this was not a pleasant way to end a trip. Overall the hotel was in a good location, the room big, with good views, lovely beds, good sized bathroom but the service at the hotel was not great and the furniture and carpet made the room look very tired. Not the luxury I was expecting!

<Content>Highly Recommended This was my 4th visit to New York and previous hotels I stayed were always something of a disappointment upon arrival. They varied from the delux but with a tiny, tiny bedroom (or maybe it was a cupboard!) to the old fashioned and a bit grim and noisy. This time round we decided to use Trip Advisor.The Affinia Dumont was great in comparison. Huge, modern, spotlessly clean room. Large, very comfortable bed (even a pillow menu!), breathtaking view of the skyline (often a rarity in other NY hotels) - we had a room on 31st floor - it was worth it. Complimentary Aveda toiletries in bathroom. Kitchen with microwave, fridge etc (didn't have any reason to use it but good idea for families I'm sure). Same with the gym - wished we'd had more time to use it - the free fitness kits were a great idea. Would have liked to try the in room massage but thought it was a bit pricey at $120 for 1 hour. Hotel staff were lovely and all were really friendly, nothing was too much trouble from booking a restaurant to suggesting travel arrangements. Very personal feel to the hotel. Good location, seemed like a good neighborhood away from the hustle and bustle, one block away from the subway and within 5 minute walking distance of the Empire State Building and Macy's. Very close to Greenwich Village and Soho. 3 days in New York is never enough once you get there so we shall definitely be back and will certainly stay the Affinia Dumont again. Nice to at last have found a good value, high standard hotel in New York that lives up to its reputation.

<Content>more gushing about the Affinia!! This is getting repetitive..............but I can only confirm all the other reviews. We have just returned from a four day trip and I would be hard pushed to find anything negative about the Affinia.Front desk/staff:The young ladies on reception are faultless. We requested on arrival a nice high room with a view and got the 33rd floor!The doormen were great. The ladies that cleaned our rooms we're also very friendly, efficient and eager to assist.Hotel:The Hotel itself is very comfortable, extremely spacious and very clean and welcoming. The rooms/suites are very much home from home, which after a long day pounding the pavements in search of that ultimate bargain are a welcome relief. The only slight criticism I could make is that the mini bar and movies on command were a little pricey and we missed the first ten minutes due to a technical hitch. (told you I would be hard pushed!!) but that really is nitpicking!Location:I don't think we could have been better located. We were in very comfortable walking distance from most of the attractions and subway. We were close enough to the action without it being 'touristy'. If ever I find myself heading to New York again (which is quite likely seeing as though I feel I have only scratched the surface) I shall certainly be checking in here!!Top Tip* You must try 'Cucinas' restaurant in Macys, The pasta is cooked to order and is delicious and very reasonably priced. (huge portions too!!)

<Content>Confortable, spacious and welcoming I visited NYC with my boyfriend on Christmas 2007 and we loved our stay at the Affinia Dumont. We booked a king size room and the bed was so big and comfortable, definitely my favourite thing about this hotel. The room was very spacious and bright with huge windows. We stayed on the 23rd floor and the view was amazing! The kitchen was very useful, with a good size fridge, microwave, cooker and kitchen utensils. The bathroom was pretty and cleaned every day, with nice white towels also changed every day and Aveda toiletries. The staff was always friendly and polite. The newspaper by the door every morning and free iced tea in the reception were a nice touch. The Barking Dog restaurant was better than we expected. We stopped by for a quick snack and the Caesar salad with grilled chicken was delicious. The location is excellent, very central with a subway station within a few blocks distance, drugstores and supermarkets nearby. I have already recommended this hotel to friends and will definitely stay there again if I go back to NYC.

<Content>I understand what all the fuss is about.... I needed a one-night stay, for a pre-cruise Saturday in January and had previously booked the Hampton Inn. Based on the recommendations here, I decided to try the Affinia Dumont. I paid $180 (plus tax and tags) for a one-night stay for two people in the cleanest, most spacious and comfortable room I've had in Manhattan. They gave us an early checkin (1pm), a late checkout (2pm), kept the car for a few extra hours and were the nicest, friendliest staff I could have hoped for.The room was spacious - two queen beds, a comfy chair, an Aeron desk chair, a great bath with a wonderful shower, and a kitchen unit (which we didn't use). WAY more room than most studio apts. It was immaculately clean, had an ironing board, and a safe.... everything I could ask for.The staff were friendly - when they overheard a conversation about dinner, the bellman offered a few suggestions. (I wouldn't rush back to the Italian place he mentioned, but I can't blame him for helping.)All in all, it was a terrific stay... it doesn't get any better.

<Content>Awesome Hotel We stayed at the Affinia Dumont after seeing that it was rated 3rd on Trip Advisor. We were not disappointed, and can now see why it's high up the list.Location was brilliant, East 34th, so a 10 minute walk from the main shopping area, Macy's and so on. In fact on the same road.A few minutes from the Empire State building, and midtown! Which meant, half way between Central Park  Grenwich Village.The room was awesome, 20th floor and extremely spacious. This was my 4th visit to New York and certainly the best hotel I've stayed in. It even had a kitchenette! The bed was HUGE and comfortable and even a choice of 6 pillow types!The Affinia is supposed to be a health  fitness hotel, to be honest we didn't get a chance to chek any of the facilities out, as we did enough walking during our stay in New York to last a whole year!There is the Barking Dog restaurant downstairs which was great. Food was yum and good value for money! Waiters were very friendly.Very hard to fault the Affinia, a cute little hotel that we will definitely look up next time we're in NYC!

<Content>Awesome hotel, great staff AND a laundry room!! We stayed 8 nights at the Affinia Dumont and it was fabulous. The rooms are big and clean. We were on the 32nd floor and our view was of the East River and the Chrysler building. The hotel is a block away from the subway. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We really loved the fact that there was a laundry room right in the hotel! If I had known this prior to booking the hotel I would have taken less clothes! There are plenty of bars and restaurants within walking distance. We loved bar X11  Benjamin. There is a drugstore right across the street and a post office as well. I would highly recommend the Affinia Dumont. If you have any questions about it please feel free to message me.

<Content>Great Hotel Spent a weekend at the Affinia Dumont. The room was large and very comfortable for 2 adults and 2 kids. The pillow menu is a great idea as we all have different preferences for pillows.The staff were all very pleasant and helpful. We arrived several hours early and had no problem getting our room. We will definitely stay here again.

<Content>Really Enjoyable Stay at The Affinia Dumont Had a suite at the Affinia Dumont for five nights (on vacation). Booked there because of TripAdvisor rating and was pleased I had selected the hotel. Had a really great suite with a fantastic view consisting of a large living room, nice sized bedroom, small, well equipped kitchen and bathroom (bathroom could have been a bit bigger possibly). Everything worked well, cleaner excellent. Overall accomodation much better and more spacious than at other hotels I have stayed at in New York.Staff very friendly and efficientSome parts of the hotel are a bit worn but in fact this seemed to make it somewhat more comfortable - a bit English Country House style.Was wondering how staying in Murray Hills would work out but this turned out to be a really good area to stay in. It is quieter and a less touristy that Uptown etc however is still very convenient for getting anywhere.Would definitely stay at the hotel again and I suspect that we would be greeted like an old friend.

<Content>Terrific family option in New York We had a three-day stay at the Affinia Dumont. House amenities and services are at a strong 4.5 star level. In room amenities -- a full kitchen, an over-sized desk with Aeron chair, etc. -- are superior.The suites and rooms are some of the biggest and (for their size and the overall hotel service level and good location) best-priced in New York. The one-bedroom suites are larger than most one-bedroom apartments in New York City and can accommodate a family with 2 or 3 young kids with great comfort. Taking nothing away from the studio suites, which put to shame most studio suites in New York, the few dollars extra for the one-bedroom suite is worth it. The basic rooms -- which are can also be classified as suites given the kitchenette -- are also exceptionally spacious and well-appointed for their size. Some high-floor rooms have breathtaking views -- be sure to ask for one at check-in.We did not sample the hotel gym or business center and can't speak to that.One qualm: the Barking Dog restaurant is advertised as the hotel's restaurant, and it's physically in the same building, but it doesn't have an indoor connection to the hotel. When the weather is bad it's annoying to have to go outside to get to the restaurant's door.

<Content>FABULOUS ! From beginning to end this 4 day trip was amazing .... The hotel was comfortable furnished to a high standard - and this was just an ordinary room the staff were outstanding and could not do enough to help you. The pillow menu is a must !. The hotel is only a few minutes walk away from The Empire State Building you can start at the bottom of 5th Avenue and work your way up (credit cards at the ready !) Park av, Madison Av Grand Central Station all within easy reach. Macys is blocks away too ... The staff can direct you and advise you without any problems what so ever. 4 Days is just not enough and I cant wait to go back. I would book a stay at this hotel again without even looking at anything else. New York is a must for anyone that loves sights and shopping and bucket fulls of food its a non stop trip of a lifetime the only bad bit is having to leave !.

<Content>Value and convenience in Midtown! We loved the Affinia! Perfect location for Midtown, huge room with kitchen, and friendly and helpful staff. We were on the 21st floor with a corner room and had a beautiful view of the East River. Booking early for a stay in January also saved us about half the price of the regular rate. As far as getting around, the Empire State Building and Macy's are an easy walk away, and the subway is a block and a half away on 33rd. Nightlife is plentiful just across the street on 3rd Avenue with several bars to choose from for the twenty-something set. There is a little grocery at the corner of Lexington and 34th that came in handy a couple of times. I used the gym once and it was nice and clean with quality equipment. I think with the Affinia you get a lot of hotel for the money and I would book it again for the next trip.

<Content>Perfect My boyfriend and I visited NYC in Jan 2008, for our 1st holiday together and also his birthday. We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights and it was the perfect stay. Soon as you walk in the staff were incredibly helpful and very welcoming. Door men were quick to help (we had a lot of luggage on the way back!). Our room was on the 34th floor, with a fab view especially at night. Room was great and large in size, little kitchen if u need it, HUGE bed! Location is great (2 blocks away from empire state building) and 10mins walk away from Macys (what more could a girl (or boy) want!!)! The hotel staff helped us book all the trips we wanted to go on. Room service was very efficient we ordered dinner at 11pm and the guy on the phone could not have been more helpful! I could write about this hotel for ages, it is undoubtedly a 5 out of 5! We had a fantastic time the city was amazing and the hotel just made it that extra bit special. We also got the room at discounted price 鈥?what a bonus! Thank you to all the staff at Affinia Dumont and a special thanks to J - for sorting the birthday cake, ballons and rose, it was just PERFECT. We will be coming back next year and will def be staying here! I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone, a home away from home. Totally loved it!!

<Content>Great Value in Midtown Booked for New Year. Specifically requested a high floor, and views of Chrysler. Although didn't get views of Chrysler, room was fantastic. Corner room on 33rd floor with river and downtown manhattan views. I was literally amazed at the size of the room. 2 huge beds, kitchenette and plenty of spare space. Just a couple of blocks from Empire State and subway stops. Didn't get their breakfast, just went to Murray Hill Diner round the corner for excellent grub. A bit pricey, but for it's quality and location, a snip compared to other similar hotels.

<Content>Really good Hotel Great value We were recommended this hotel by friends and it was very good. The Afinia has a great midtown location on 34th street East. We think its important to have the right location in New York without paying the earth. We booked hotel through [-].Macy's is not far and there are good bars and restaurants nearby. Our room was huge with a kitchen area which came in useful. There is a spa and gym but we did not have time to use them unfortunately. We requested a high floor room and had great views. Staff very helpful. Would definatley recommend.

<Content>There isn't a better hotel in NYC I have gone to NYC at least 10 times over the last 4 years. I have stayed at hotels that were rated highly and upon arrival I cringed, wondering if the reviews were posted by the hotel staff themselves or crack addicts..But the Affina Dumont! This was a little different.All I can say is wow! We arrived December 26th at 12:15 PM. Early check-in. No problem. High Floor. No problem. From the doorman to the bellman to the front desk to housekeeping, everyone was 100% helpful, kind, and gracious. Not only upon arrival but the entire 7 days we stayed there.And they remained so while checking out and saying goodbye.All I know is from now on when I go to NYC, the Affina Dumont is where I plan on staying.The neighborhood is great. Good bars, restaurants, groceries, etc. Plus if you shop and find you have a lot to bring home, there us a UPS Store up the street. You can drop off all your goodies and they will box it up and ship it back to you.You can walk around town easily from here. I actually walked from Hell鈥檚 Kitchen to the hotel one day at it was a pleasant walk.The 6 line is around the corner and if you know how to use the subway, you can get anywhere you want easily.I really cannot say enough about this hotel.Go and stay there. You will not be disappointed.

<Content>Great Place to Stay but Not Perfect Four of us stayed at this hotel for a girly week away 5-12 Jan. The hotel itself is great. It is in a quieter part of town so it is possible to get a good night's sleep after a day of shopping and sightseeing and all the major attractions are within easy walking distance. Having seen Times Square at night, we were very glad that we hadn't booked a hotel in that area given the level of noise (New Yorkers like to use their car horns all day and all night!!).I booked the room directly through the hotel website and requested a quiet room on a high floor with a view and that is exactly what we got. We were in room 3206 with a view of the East River and downtown Manhattan. It was lovely to watch the sun rise over the East River in a morning. The room itself is very spacious and the kitchen is very handy as we sorted our own breakfast out every day. Other reviewers have remarked that the bathrooms are small but we didn't think so and there was four women to accomodate!My only issue with the hotel was the level of service which was quite poor when compared to other 4 star hotels I have stayed in. All of the staff are very pleasant and have plenty of advice. However, prior to arrival, I had requested hypo-allergenic pillows as one of the travellers had a feather allergy. However, once in our room, we discovered that both the pillows and duvets were duck down. This was just plain annoying and took about 3 phone calls to reception to sort out, We also only had 3 towels when their were four of us - again only a little thing but something which a four star hotel should pick up on. However, I have to say that the housekeeping staff did ensure for the rest of our stay that this was corrected and our room was always spotless.We found that we were having to contact reception a number of times about the same issue when the problem should have been sorted out after the first call. Quite often, I got the impression that the reception was too busy.There are plenty of places to eat near the hotel. If you go out of the hotel and turn right, we ate at Blokheads (mexican), Cinema cafe and Penelope's (Italian). The food was very good and cheap. Our favourite was Penelope's which does fantastic pizzas. Duane Read's which is opposite the hotel is great for provisions. Its a pharmacy but basically sells everything. We got cereal and milk etc from here and its much cheaper than the deli on the corner.We also went to a steak restaurant which had been recommended to me by a friend - Smith and Wollensky - near Grand Central Station which was fantastic. If you are a fan of steak, then don't go anywhere else. The portions are huge and the steaks cooked to perfection. However, we went early on a Monday night and by the time we were leaving, the place was full. There is also a steak place on Park Ave nearer the hotel (called Wolfgang's Steakhouse i think) which we were going to try but this was too busy on the night we went.We did all of the touristy things and shopping and found that this was a perfect time of year to visit. A tip if you want to see a show - there is a discount ticket booth in the Marriott Hotel on Times Square - don't go there as its packed. There is another ticket office in downtown Manhattan and we walked straight in and got our tickets for half price.One final tip - DONT book your taxi to the airport through the hotel. Our taxi from Ne warkairport to the hotel was $71 plus tolls and tip. I asked the hotel to book a return journey and was astounded that the Company they recommend was charging $120 for an SUV (we had a lot of luggage!!!). I then called a number which I found in my guidebook and they charged $69 - bit of a difference. Needless to say that I cancelled the taxi through the hotel. However, when we came to leave, the hotel hadn't actually cancelled the taxi and our bags were loaded into the wrong taxi. It was a good job that we checked before setting off and got our luggage put in the correct taxi, otherwise we would have been paying an extra $50.Overall, I would recommend this hotel to others and would stay there again.

<Content>New York Christmas We stayed here for 6 nights over Christmas with our two teenage sons and had an excellent time. We had a single bedroom suite with a sofabed in the lounge which was a little small and uncomfortable for our two lads but there was plenty of room for three in the huge master bed! Kitchenette is useful for drinks and snacks. We were on the 12th floor so views not great but very quiet. Staff all very helpful and the location is superb - close to the ESB, Macys and some other good shopping in and around Herald Square. Thoroughly recommended.

<Content>Had a fabulous time Loved It!The hotel couldn't be faulted. The room was a lovely generous size and very clean. Reception staff were always polite and had loads of information to share. We didn't try the gym or the spa as there just wasn't time.Its only a 5 minute walk to Macy's and the Empire State so pretty central.Fantastic recommendation for breakfast just round the corner a couple of blocks is Sarge's. Superb pastrami, sublime cheesecake, and such friendly staff, its a must.Would recommend definitely

<Content>Loved the Affinia Dumont! New York. Affinia Dumont Hotel. date:10th January 2008Reviewer: Jayne, DoncasterBooked this hotel after reading various reviews on this site, which were absolutely spot on. In short, could not find a negative with this hotel. Staff were always extremely helpful and poite, and there was nothing they wouldn't do for you. Had corner room on the 28th floor which was excellent-couldn't have been cleaner! Not to mention the six pillow choice menu! Views were amazing from this room.After having travelled around New York, I realised the hotel was excellently situated, only a five minute walk up to the empire state building! Macy's and Times Sqaure not much further.The Barking Dog Diner next to the hotel was excellent food and value for money! We ate there every morning!This was a trip for our daughters 18th birthday in December 2007, this hotel definately helped make it memorable. Can't wait to return to New York and will definately stay in the Affinia Dumont, won't consider looking anywhere else. Excellent value for money.

<Content>EXCELLENT HOTEL EXPERIENCE Following research on Trip Advisor we booked the Affinia Dumont for a girly shopping and sightseeing break and to celebrate a special birthday. We were certainly not disappointed.On arrival all the staff were extremely helpful and although we arrived too early for check in, they offered suggestions on how they could accommodate us and what we could do until the room was ready. We decided to go and explore so they took care of everything until we eventually got back to the hotel in the evening!We were very pleased with the size of the room and were fortunate to have been allocated a high floor so the views over the East River were spectacular. The room had plenty of space and the two very large twin beds very comfortable. The room. bathroom and kitchenette were all very clean, the toiletries provided daily and the pillow menu were also very welcome. Our thanks go to the housekeeping staff who made sure that their good standards were maintained and that we were comfortable. We found the hotel's location to be very convenient and had absolutely no difficulty in walking to all the main sights and shops! Near the hotel are plenty of good (and inexpensive)restaurants, drug stores, a delicatessen and a supermarket, all of which we made good use of.We had an evening flight home and on check out day the hotel were kind enough to let us keep our room a little past the checkout time. They also stored all our luggage and then helped us pack our last minute purchases. Many thanks also to Donald for arranging an excellent car back to the airport - it was very much appreciated.We did not have one negative experience while staying at the Affinia Dumont. The key to this was a clean and comfortable room, but more importantly, exceptional staff. Nothing was too much trouble and all members of the team are a credit to the hotel. Thanks to everyone for helping us make the most of our first (and hopefully not last) trip to New York City.

<Content>Brilliant view of Chrysler Building Spent weekend with mother and two sisters for 70th birthday treat. Asked for high level suite to take advantage of views, and they were spectacular. Hotel also arranged for complimentary birthday gateaux - lovely touch. Excellent suite - clean and very comfortable. No breakfast - but fresh fruit available in foyer. Very convenient for Empire State Building (2 blocks away), tube stations and shopping - Macy's, Old Navy, American Eagle. Definitely worth a visit.

<Content>excellent hotel i stayed at the affinia dumont with my boyfriend this christmas for 4nights.we had a standard room on the 32nd floor(good view) the bedroom and bathroom were both very clean (housekeeping was good everyday, with clean towels/bathmats everyday)and spacious for a city hotel.nicely contemporarily decorated.the bed was very large, there was also a big desk with chair, an armchair,a tv with many channels, a large full length mirror , strong hairdryer (i have long thick hair and was very glad of this!), wardrobe with lots of hangers, a magnified make up mirror in the bathroom, (soap,mouthwash, shampoo,conditioner, shower cap, moisturiser ) were replaced everyday. we didnt cook in the small kitchen, but it was well equipped, and the fridge/freezer was handy, aswell as the plates and knives and forks which we used to eat the fresh fruit that could be picked up in the lobby everyday(apples/pears/oranges etc) we took lots of this fresh fruit everyday and the staff didnt mind at all.the staff were very friendly and helpful including the cleaners. handy maps provided at reception.we ate breakfats in the hotel restaurant one day and it was very pleasant and not too expensive.however if you go out of the hotel, walk left then turn left theres a fantastic little cafe on the corner, very cheap and delicious food with quick friendly service!we didnt use any of the gym facilities.

<Content>Loved the Affinida Dumont We didn't know what to expect from the Affinia. This trip to NYC was with our son for his 18th birthday. Our 23 year old daughter joined us. My wife, myself and children stayed comfortably in a one bedroom suite with a full kitchen. The room was clean, spacious (for NYC!) and the staff was helpful and extremely friendly.

<Content>We recommend Affinia Dumont! Excerpt from my Trip Report - We stayed at the Affinia Dumont (AD, located on 34th btwn Lexington and 3rd Ave). Picked AD because of larger room, two queen beds and attractive rate. This turned out to be a very good decision. We arranged our trip on short notice and decided to prepay (non-refund.) for the studio suite room to get the $234/nt rate (after adding in all of the taxes was $270.80/nt). I saw this rate later, just before we left for NYC, without prepay required. We gave high marks to all of the staff, who were very friendly. The room was oversized with a small kitchen, was very clean and modern looking, great view and had a nice big desk that I liked to use at night to spread stuff out and plan for the next day. Some may consider the fairly small bathroom and hotel location as drawbacks, but we did not. Bathroom size was manageable and we preferred being in a more residential area (although it meant more walking/cab fare to get to attractions). As a side note, when we initially walked into our room, there was a slight odor of cigarette smoke. This is a non-smoking property, but we think that somebody cheated. I picked up the phone, requested a room change and was accommodated after a short wait with the identical room layout but seven floors higher. I thought that the AD handled this well.

<Content>Very nice A very nice, centrally located hotel in Manhattan. Room was big, with a very comfortable king bed. It is a fitness/spa hotel so there was a choice of 5 different kinds of pillows in case you needed them. Only stayed for a short night so, cannot comment on spa etc. Staff was very friendly.

<Content>fab hotel just returned from the Affinia Dumont. Before I booked the hotel I had read several hotel reviews and didnt see a single negative review about the Affinia and I wasnt disappointed. Staff were all polite and courteous, room very clean and the kitchenette was an added bonus. I was travelling in a party of 4 and the room was very spacious for us all. The hotel is ideally situated being within walking distance of many attractions. Cant wait to visit New York again and I'll certainly stay at this hotel

<Content>Super Friendly Staff There is a review a couple down from this one that I tend to agree with - the hotel is a good hotel, but not sure why it is getting the level of review it is getting.The rooms are a decent size (first time in NY so can't comment on other hotels) and clean - but not over the top special. Nothing to complain about on that front, but nothing to write home about either. We had a room 23 floors up with a great view over to the Chrysler building which was cool. Even at 23 floors, the traffic noise (taxi drivers sure know how to use their horns!) is unbelievable - all part of the experience though!The price per night was pretty steep, but then so were most other NY hotels - certainly don't feel conned by what we paid given the research we did before booking.The best things about the hotel were :1) the staff - they were so friendly and helpful - always wanting to help with our bags or advise with where we should be eating, what we should be doing etc etc. And they have some great stories to tell too! And on our final day, we had a late flight so they let us up to use the spotless changing facilities offered by their gym - a really nice touch.2) the location - a couple of blocks from Empire State, which makes for a great late night, on your way home, trip up for the views at night. 15 minute walk to Times Square, 10 minutes to Grand Central and pretty walkable to Central Park or to Wall Street etc (we did it, although it took a while).Think that we may stay nearer Central Park next time, but that's not to say we didn't like the hotel - it was really good (if not quite as good as the reviews make out!).

<Content>Service with a smile...in NEW YORK??!! I stayed at the Affinia for a Christmas weekend with the girls (Mom, Sissy, and Mom's Sissy). We are all native New Yorkers, but have migrated over time, and all need our annual NYC Christmas fix. The Affinia was the crown jewel of our weekend!! The rooms were twice the size of a normal NY hotel room, for half of the price, the service was impeccable!! We were actually joking that there was a person standing right outside our door anticipating our next request (more pillows, towels, you no sooner hang up the phone and the doorbell is ringing). They happily honored our early check in request (10:30am) and gave us a lovely high floor corner room with no hassle!!Jennifer Baldwin should be commended for fantastic service!! We will be back! (and maybe actually get to the gym and spa next time!)

<Content>Great Hotel! We stayed in the Affinia Dumont for 1 night in December with our 2 children 11 and 13 years old. I found the staff to be very helpful. Everyone from the valet, front desk and lost and found staff went out of their way to help us. The rooms were very clean and spacious with comfy beds. We usually stay in much more expensive hotels and this was equally as nice for far less money. The location was very central. Great hotel will definitely stay in the Affinia Dumont next time we are in NYC.

<Content>Not Bad, but don't understand the hype Spent 3 nights between Christmas  New Year's. There was nothing really bad about the hotel but don't really understand why it gets the amazing reviews it has on Tripadvisor. The staff are friendly (particularly the big guy on the door). The rooms are a decent size but the bathroom was not as clean as it should have been (scum you could write your name in around the countertop behind the taps). Decor is nothing special and our room (on the 21st floor) looked like it could use a coat of fresh paint and a new carpet. Carpets throughout the hotel are in rough shape. We booked using the hotel website but I had the feeling they couldn't find our reservation on check-in. Had requested an upper floor with a view and was told we were getting that on the 21st floor. Turned out to be a view of the back of other buildings. Have stayed in several mid-town hotels and this rates as no more than average. Would go back if the price is right (not the $400+ currently showing as the price on Tripadvisor).Breakfast at the Barking Dog is better than the Murray Hill Diner. Don't miss Max Brenner's on Broadway, off Union Sq. - the best hot chocolate and deserts.

<Content>Comfy Cozy! We stayed here for one night, just for New Year's Eve - but boy, do we wish we had rang in the New Year in our room rather than the chaotic, blocked off, cop-filled streets of NYC! We did not know it, but found out that this hotel is a health and fitness hotel. Besides the spa and 24-hour gym, they have a fitness concierge desk where you can find out about yoga and, well, obviously other fitness. There are helpful pamphlets on local healthy eateries and, yes, the hotel is smoke-free.At check-in the desk clerk was super friendly and helpful. In the lobby, you can help yourself to a glass of iced tea or some fresh apples or pears, glistening with cool water from a recent wash. The room was very big and had a small kitchen. The bed was huge and had crisp white sheets and blanket. The pillows were sooooo comfy and so was the bed. Oh, and they have a pillow menu offering everything from organic wheatgrass pillows to swedish thereputic pillows for you to choose from - for free :) We were so warm and cozy in our bed that we hardly heard the partiers come in at 3 AM and start BLASTING their music right next to us. One phone call to the desk, and I don't know what that guy said to those people, but within minutes the music was off and the people had gone to their rooms. Needless to say, service was excellent.Thanks Affinia for a great nights sleep (and on New Year's in NYC no less!).

<Content>Great hotel at a reasonable price My family and I stayed at the Affinia Dumont between Christmas and theNew Year and were very impressed. We booked this hotel based on the reviews on Tripadviser and were not dissappointed. We stayed on the 27th floor and as it was a corner room, as requested we had fantastic dual aspect views to the East River. The room was very spacious and spotlessly clean. The beds were the most comfortable I've ever slept in.All the staff were exceptionally helpful.We would definately go back again with out hesitation to this hotel asit is within comfortable walking distance of everything in Midtown Manhattan.

<Content>Superb location I stayed at the Affinia Dumont with my 2 grown up kids for 3 nights in December. We were doing a whistle stop Christmas shopping  sight seeing trip  booked this hotel on the back of reviews on Trip Advisor. And we were certainly not disappointed.Firstly it is in a magnificent location, Macys is 8 mins walk away (I timed it!!) Empire State Building about 6 mins  about 15 mins walk to Time Square. There are several nice bars  restaurants close to the hotel. The Barking Dog which is attached to the hotel is a great place for a late afternoon, post shopping beer! We ate in here also  the food was great  not expensive. We also used Blockheads - a mexican restautrant close to the hotel - the food was great here too  really cheap.The staff in the hotel could not do more for you if they tried. Sadly my son was taken ill when we were there (we thought he was having a heart attack), whilst we were waiting for 911, they sent a CPR trained member of staff up to help  2 other staff to calm me down! No hotel could have done more  I will always be truly grateful to them for that. It turned out on our return to the UK that my son had a collapsed lung - so I cannot be so complimentary about 911 service that said he had pulled a muscle!The rooms in this hotel are massive  spotlessly clean  the beds just waht you need after a hard day around NYC.If or should I say when I go back to NY I will definitely stay in this hotel. No question.

<Content>fantastic hotel Stayed in this hotel for 7 nights March 2007. Had arrived in NY and was booked into another hotel - when we arrived there we were told that no booking existed. were moved to affinia by our excellent and efficient travel agent immediately.What can I say about this hotel - excellent all around - most friendly and helpful staff I have encountered for some time. no request was too much for any of them. 3 of us were in a junior suite and comfort and spaciousness was brilliant.I would definitely return there again- have booked another trip there for march 2008 - cant wait!!

<Content>Absolutely Perfect Experience We just came back from an anniversary celebration in New York. We stayed at the Affinia Dumont, and from start to finish, everything about the experience was ideal! First, the staff: I can't say enough about them, especially Gisellie. She was outstanding!! She was helpful and went out of her way to ensure that our stay was comfortable and all we expected. We also appreciated Donald and Christopher, and their helpfulness and friendliness. The room was on the 29th floor. I'm a bit fanatical about cleanliness, and this was spotless. Nice kitchen, stocked with pots, dishes, stove, microwave and fridge. The beds were spacious, beautifully appointed and very comfortable. Our view was great, looking out over the East River and the city. We loved it at night. The hotel's location was fine, in a quiet area within walking distance of Times Square and an easy cab ride up to Rockefeller Center. Need to also recommend the little Barking Dog cafe next to the hotel for brunch or in-room dining. My only quibble with the hotel was the price, which was a bit pricier thanks to the holidays. In all, I've stayed in a number of hotels in NY, for pleasure and business. None has been any better than the Affinia Dumont. I highly recommend it!

<Content>great value! For the price, it could not be beat. It is cheaper than a lot of pricier hotels in the area, but the quality leaves most of those other over-priced places in the dust. The staff is wonderful. The room was beautiful - try the buckwheat pillows! We only stayed there for two nights, but would gladly have stayed there for a month. We're definitely coming back here next time in NYC.

<Content>Absolutely Fabulous! This hotel is fantastic! My husband and I visited New York for the second time for a short break in February 07. We had visited in January 05 and stayed at the Omni Berkshire Place which was a very nice hotel also but not a patch on the Affinia Dumont, which is actually classed a star lower for some unknown reason. We were so impressed when we were shown to our room as it was absolutely HUGE!. We had booked a studio room. It had two large king size beds, a fully fitted kitchen, a lovely modern bathroom and a fabulous view of New York and we were only 5 mins walk from the Empire State Building and 10 mins walk from Macy's!. This hotel is a definite must. You will not be disappointed at all. If we ever go back to New York we would definitely want to stay here again, maybe next time we'll take our 3 children and book a two bedroom suite.

<Content>Ideal for Travelling with young children Overall we enjoyed our stay at the Hotel. It was ideal as we were travelling with a 6 month old and a 2 year old. The hotel room was big enough and as we had booked a suite we could sleep the children in the bedroom while we relaxed in the sitting room area. The kitchen area allowed us to prepare meals for the kids at any time. We were 5 minutes from the Empire State building and close enough to 5th Avenue to walk with the pram - saved us jumping into cabs with a pram etc. The room was clean/quiet and well maintained. Two negatives - Firstly - when we had booked I had requested several things in the room, high chair/cots/allergy free bedding etc. None of these had been prepared so we had to wait for several people to come and deliver cots etc. As we arrived late and were lagged this was an inconvenience. Secondly - when we requested the concierge to organise a cab back to JFK - he offered to get us a private car for $100. As we had paid a flat rate of $45 to get us there I thought this was a real rip off. All we needed was was of the larger yellow cabs which he could have called for us. In the end my husband went out onto the street and flagged down a larger cab. The concierge did not even offer to help my husband with the bags/prams, he did not even open the door for me with the pram!!! Overall we had a really good stay, its disappointing that one individual stopped it from being an excellent stay........

<Content>Amazing location, great view!!! My boyfriend and I just came back from our lovely vacation to NY. We didn't know where to stay and we decided to book our stay at this hotel based on the reviews that others wrote. We have absolutely no complaints!! this place was amazing! When we arrived we were taken care of quickly, we even checked in early. They had given us a room on the 14th floor where we really weren't that happy with the view. I called the front desk and there was no hassle in getting a higher floor. We ended up on the 36th floor (building has 37) with an incredible view of the Chrysler Building, a plus we had was that it started snowing the minute we entered our room!! VERY ROMANTIC!!! The staff was very friendly and gave great advice on where to go and were to catch the nearest subway. The rooms were huge for NY hotel rooms. Our bathroom was VERY clean, the kitchen was clean, and the bed was very comfortable, with a choice of 5 diff pillows to choose from. The location was great and quiet! you're minutes away from the Chrysler building, Macy's, Madison Square Gardens, Empire State, Times square...you could literally walk to all these places. They have great restaurants around the area and a 24hour convenient store in the corner (Must try Charles steakhouse!! Great philly cheesesteak ). Overall, we loved this place and we'll def stay here again!

<Content>best trip ever, lovely hotel! My partner and i have just returned from a 5 night stay at the affinia dumont hotel in New york. As with many others who have stayed here we booked this hotel based upon the brilliant reviews that it had recieved on trip advisor. this was our first trip to new york so we were anxious about booking a hotel as we had heard that nice, clean, spacious hotels are hard to come by. We trawled through hundreds of reviews on different hotels before booking, many of them a very disapointing. However, all we can say about the affinia dumont is.... believe everything you read, this hotel is truely wonderful. Huge rooms, very clean, with spectacular views of the chrysler building and new york sky line. (request a room as high up as possible, we were on the 33rd floor with a spectacular view of the chrysler building, and as reccommened by another couple on trip advisor we slept with the blinds open as not to miss a second of the breathtaking views). Fantastic location, nice quiet neighbourhood. Our bed linen and towels were changed everyday. Staff were very friendly and helpful, they provided great advice on places to eat/ visit and the best ways to get around the city. Nothing was too much hassel for them. Even the small touches were perfect, such as complementary ice tea and fruit available at reception at anytime of the day. Can honestly say we couldnt fault a thing.Food at the Barking dog resturant, directly next door was also very good. we ate there on our first night as it was getting on by the time we arrived to the hotel. and had breakfast there one morning too.Also worth mentioning that during our stay we saw 2 NBA Teams who were also staying at the hotel, so it is obviously a popular choice with the major american basketball teams too!!We will definatly be returning to the affinia dumont on any future visits to new york. Cant wait to return. It is a wonderful time of year to visit. If you are planning your first trip to New York i would definatly reccommend the 48 hour all loops (hop on/Hop off) gray line sightseeing tour as a away to get your barings when you first arrive and get around al the major attractions.Enjoy the Affinia Dumont experience!!!

<Content>Perfect Hotel My partner and I have just returned from New York and had booked into the Hotel Mela for the full 5 nights. Although this hotel was a good location and very new and modern it had no view whatsoever apart from overlooking a construction site. Apparently all executive rooms were like this and at nearly 800$ a night it wasnt what we expected. We had previously read great reviews on the Affinia dumont and my only regret about the holiday now is that we did not stay there for the whole time. We booked a studio suite and it was very big, it also had a separate kitchen area and large bathroom. We just turned up at the reception and checked in there and then. We asked if it was possible to have a room with a view and were informed unfortunatel that there was not any available which was to be expected as we were requesting at check in. However after going to our 33rd floor room , we were extremely please as we had a view of New York City very clearly and after what we came from it was fantastic! I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone going to NY. It is very centrally located. Empire state is 5 mins away, Macys another couple of minutes on, and the subway is just round the corner, which after we figured out what to do was an ideal way of quickly getting around. We had been told to stay in the Times Square area before we went, but it really isnt necessary as you can walk/subway/taxi there so easily form the hotel.Please feel free to ask me any questions about my review.Oh and we are booking to go back there next year!

<Content>Quality Staff Make the Difference My wife and I recently returned from a stay at the Affinia Dumont. The hotel is situated about 5 mins from the Empire State and about 10/15 mins from Time Square. We found it a great position as the Murray Hill location was quieter than the the hussle and bussle of Time Square but within an easy walk of many of the attractions. The rooms were spotless and a good size - having the kitchen in the room was useful for tea/juice and snacks etc. Attention to detail was good - there was even a pillow menu with a choice of 6 different types of pillow! The thing that makes the Affinia Dumont stand out from its competition is the quality of its staff. Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful. I think it was the staff that really set the tone for our first trip to New York. They made us feel very comfortable and relaxed about finding our way around the city. I really hope we can return to New York soon - I will definitely stay at the Affinia again, next time we'll bring our kids!

<Content>Fabulous stay at the Affinia Dumont!! My boyfriend and I have just returned from a week in the fabulous Affinia Dumont! We booked our flights to New York back in August, and then took time to research various hotels using trip advisor's reviews as our guide. Having booked the Affinia Dumont on the backing of previous reviews, we were not disappointed! We arrived at night, and were in awe of the view from our room when the bellboy pulled opened the curtains! Along with the magnificent Chrysler Building and the New York skyline just outside our window, the bell boy informed us that the building in front of us was the HQ of Opus Dei, corner of 34th st and Lexington, as mentioned in the Da Vinci code...nice little touch! We stayed on the 35th floor (room 3504), and every night we slept with the curtains open just to take in the spectacular scenery, (Worth requesting a high room before you go).We had a lovely big room (suite), king size bed... extremely comfortable! There was a kitchenette off room with fridge, microwave etc., and a safe in the closet. No problems with heating and there was always hot water. Daily maid service, always clean.The location is great, quiet residential area, able to get a good night's sleep to recharge for the next day, in comparison to hotels in the busier Time's Square district! There is a supermarket and a drug store conveniently situated just outside the hotel. TIP: The Murray Hill Diner around the block on Lexington Avenue does a great breakfast! and it has a great New York City diner atmosphere too. The staff were courteous, helpful, and friendly, and always greeted us with a smile. On the day we were leaving the bellboy arranged for us to travel to the airport in a private car for a flat rate of $65 including tip and toll charges. He said it would be 'a nice clean comfortable car'. To our surprise it was a white stretch limousine!. I was worried that when we arrived at the airport, the driver may haveasked us for a lot more than $65, but sure enough that's what it cost!The Affinia Dumont is a fabulous hotel in every way, and we would haveno reservations about recommending it to others. It deserves to be in trip advisor's top ten most recommended hotels. We will definitely be returning to the Affinia Dumont on our next visit to NYC!!

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Service, Great Location We stayed in a junior suite in the last week of November 2007 after booking the hotel via its own website. All of our requests were catered which included spectacular views of New York. The rooms are really well cleaned and maintained. The doormen are extremely welcoming and make a real effort to remember you each time you return to the hotel. Check in was easy, just a couple of minutes. Only a ten minute walk from Macy's and less than five minutes to the underground, the hotel is in a great location. I鈥檝e stayed in hundreds of hotels over the last few years and this by far, without any reservation, has to be the best one by far. If you want good service, standards and location then this is the hotel to book. The people at this hotel just cannot do enough for you.We are really picky about our leisure hotel bookings and looked through hundreds of reviews. If this sound like you, then have faith in the other good reviews for this hotel.

<Content>new york trip before booking i read the reviews and this hotel seemed to the best[bearing in mind my price bracket]i must say that it does deserve the superb rating.location is central being midtown a short walk from macys grand central station the chrysler building,and a couple of blocks from the empire state building.the broadway shows are a little further but within walking distance as well. the rest of manhatton is a fairly short taxi ride away.which will not be expensive.as for the price its considerably less than its london equivalent.the booking went perfectly well.hotel staff were very friendly and helpfull.the room was excellent,and well serviced.had a corner room high up which had great views especially the chrysler building which seemed right outside the window.i would definately book again at this hotel.

<Content>Loved the Affinia Dumont We just returned from Affinia Dumont and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.The room was big enough ,very clean,with a nice little kichenette .There are grocery stores no more than a block away.The staff were great ,and very helpful and polite.One doorman was awesome he said I look like Don Knotts,which several people have told me in the past.He even gave me one of his personel scarves for the cold weather.I recieved a great rate by calling the hotel directly.If I get that great rate again I will run back.

<Content>Long weekend in new york city Plus points: large rooms, very clean, extremely helpful staff, quiet residential area, lots of restaurants in area,Minus points:smallish bathroom, good walk or taxi to major sites. (Taxi fare $6 - $10 so not really a problem)Would be my first choice when I visit again Would recommend the New York Party Shuttle for an introductory tour of New York. 5-6 hours guided tour in small minibus. Excellent.

<Content>Good price, good room, good location The hotel is in midtown about 4 blocks from the Chrysler Building and we felt safe walking around the neighbourhood. Plenty of restaurants to choose from. The hotel suite was very nice and the staff very friendly. The price was right too, so all-in-all we'd definitely recommend it.

<Content>You can do better We had a junior suite, high floor, great size room for a NY hotel. The view was beautiful, and the bed was quite comfortable. That's the good news. However, there is NOTHING luxury about this hotel. The staff is very friendly - in fact they are actually informal - almost uncomfortably so. The elevators were kind of dingy, the hallway ok. The room was clean enough. The bathroom was SO small there was no where to set anything but on the floor. The shower head was SO old only a few streams came through and the water would go hot, warm, hot, etc. The towels were horrible - they were paper thin and rough! I asked for nicer ones and I just got whiter paper thin rough towels - like cheap roadside motel towels. This is simply not a luxury hotel. They don't act it, they don't treat you like it, and it's not finished that way. It was fine, but you can simply do better for this price in NY. I have traveled for many years to NY and you'd be better off at one of the mass production Marriotts. I would not stay here again, but wouldn't warn someone not to - just be aware that luxury won't be found here! It's comfortable, warm, and friendly though.

<Content>Great place This is an excellent hotel in Murray Hill. 2 blocks to subway. Great restaurants in the neighborhood. Our room (Jr Suite) was a corner room and had stunning views of both the east river and the Chrysler Building (very Deco at night). The counter staff were friendly and helpful. The doormen are 1st class and great at getting you taxi. The room was spotless and the bed was very comfortable. Definitely will stay again.

<Content>Fabulous!!! Having been put in charge of finding our girls weekend hotel I was quite daunted . My friends have very high standards so I knew I had to get it right. The Affinia did not dissapoint in fact it exceeded our expectations!!!The location is perfect for us as we have visited NY on many occassions and know the city well. It's within spitting distance of The Empire State Building and Macy's also if you want to walk to MIdtown { although Midtown seems so tatty compared to Murray Hill} it's a short walk.The Deli on the corner is very handy for your provision needs. The staff are very welcoming {quite unusual for NY} and are extremely helpful.Don't be fooled by the tatty carpet in the lobby and the elevators, it is not an indication of the room standards.The rooms are excellent ! large and airy {not words you would normally use to desribe a hotel room in NY} also the beds are roomy and extremely comfortable, with lovely fluffy duvetsThere are many little extras that we really liked ie: Umbrellas, Jogging gear, yoga kits, aveda bath products ,pillow menus ...some very thoughtful touches .We all loved the kitchenette as we were all on different time zones so it gaves us the freedom to make that jet lag cuppaAll of us were very impressed and will be returning in the future to The Affinia Dumont

<Content>Another Satisfied Customer - 24/11/07 - 29/11/07 Booked this hotel on the back of previous reviews and was not disappointed. 10mins walk from Grand Central Station. Room excellent and exceeded all expectations. We stayed on the 32nd floor and the view was amazing. Our room had two queen size beds, desk etc. The kitchen area was a godsend especially the fridge. You always need a beer or two after a full day shopping!!!Great food and drink establishments local to Hotel - made life easy.Hotel staff very helpful and always friendly. To be honest there was absolutely nothing wrong with the hotel. This was our 3rd trip to New York and definitely the best to date.

<Content>Affinia Dumont Big  Three of us booked a junior suite the thanksgiving weekend. We had a corner room with windows that overlooked the city and the River!! It was beautiful and very roomy - large king sized bed and pull out sofa. Mattresses were a little hard but furnishings and amenities were lavish. We really didn't use the kitchen except to make coffee and ice our weary legs. The only problem with this hotel is that there are no restaurants nearby - you can't even find a bakery!! It is within 2 blocks of the 6 line which was great but it is nice to be able to get some fresh ice cream, bagel or light snack when you want in NYC. It did have a wonderful pizza place across Lex that was fabulous and a dunkin donuts about 2 blocks up. The staff was beyond excellent and we would recommend this hotel as long as you are prepared to look for snacks before you get back in the area!! The two gourmet supermarkets nearby are limited and their baked goods stale! Highly recommend this hotel!

<Content>Absolutely Fantastic What a city what an hotel. We had room 3304 and the view was absolutely breathtaking, we slept with the curtains open just to take it all in. The staff could not do anymore to help you they are the most professional, helpful and informative I have ever known. Inside tip you can cash travellers cheques at the desk ($100 per day) and they dont charge you anything. Must do's for New York First Timers - Century 21 on Cortlandt St near Ground Zero is a shoppers paradise. Carriage Ride in Central Park - pick it up opposite FAO Schwarz's toy shop. The carriage ride only cost 拢17 plus tip for 1/2 hour. Radio City Music Hall Rockettes absolutely ROCK precision dancing of an Olympian Standard, you must see these girls go.Do use the subway it is quite safe before 10pm very cheap (metro card $10 gives 6 trips and can be used for up to four people on one card) and easy to use, just enter the station on the side of the road thats traffic direction is the same direction as you want to travel. Taxis are cheaper than London and the buses have a flat fee of $2 which you have to pay in quarter dollar coins. If you see one city before you die you must see NEW YORK I went with my partner who is a country boy and even he said he will go back.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Contrary to guide books all the people we encountered were very helpful it is just worth using the old addage ' treat others how you would like to be treated '.

<Content>Yes good hotel good location cant wait to go back Just arrived back after staying 3 nights at the Affinia Dumont.This is the second time in New York - Last year we stayed up by Times Square which was great for us location wise - this year I have to say the Affinia was great - good room although no view as we were on the 15th floor but clean and above all very quite for new york!The staff were very friendly and helpful , especially the doorman who made our coming and going a pleasure as he was always so pleased to see us.Ideal location for Macy's and Empire state building and Times Square a 15 min walk. The Barking dog restraunt was okay but we found the Tick Tock Diner which was under the New Yorker Hotel (just past Macy's about 4 blocks) was much better - we had a really great breakfast in here and it was always packed which is a good sign.Would definitely recommend this hotel to anybody staying in New York and We will be staying here again.

<Content>Incredible View Booked our stay months ago. I was looking forward to the trip so much that I felt something had to go wrong. First contact was Iris and she pleasantly gave us our room keys and welcomed us. We excitedly went to our room only to discover a room with no view. My dissappointment was immense. If I had not researched the hotel through trip advisor I probably would not have known any differently, but I had and I had requested a room with a view for we were celebrating our anniversary. My husband and I went back down and Iris immediately gave us another room. The room was supposed to have a king bed not a queen, but who cares I had a room with a spectacular view. It was cold while we were there and on the third day we went to turn on the heat to get the nip out of the air and the heater would not work. They sent someone up immediately and within 15-20 minutes our heater was up and running. Donald was very helpful and helped to make our stay memorable. Except for the few small bumps our stay was the best we have had in New York. I had high expectations for the hotel as a result of my reviewing trip advisor on a daily basis and those expectations were met if not exceeded by Affinia Dumont and their exceptional staff. We would highly recommend the Affinia Dumont.

<Content>All the reviews are right - this is a GREAT hotel I just wanted to say that I can completely understand why this is rated the #4 hotel in New York.We stayed here for 4 nights in mid-November.Pros -Staff:friendly and helpfulLocation:Absolutely fantastic - literally 5 mins to Empire States and MacysA 24 Deli right next door with ATM and great sandwiches, a 24hr pharmacy across the road. Great diner across the road (cinema cafe), restaurants and pubs literally on your door step. Plenty of cabs around whizzing past, so easy to hail one. I know most first time visitors want to stay in Times Square area, but I cannot stress enough how much better it is to stay in another less hectic area. In New York, everything is a taxi ride away. Here you are midtown, but well located to go both uptown and downtown. Times Square is great for a visit, but having stayed there before, I can definitely say this is far better - less noise, less manic, Times Square still within easy walking distance, or a 2 minute cab ride.Rooms:HUGE rooms- and we had the smallest type. 2 big queen beds, loads of room for suitcases etc, a desk area, kitchenette, large bathroom, these rooms were big by normal hotel standards not to mind New York. After staying previously in teeny rooms in NY, this was a pleasant surprise.Noise Level:This is New York and it was SO QUIET! couldn't believe it. we were on the 20th floor and could barely hear sirens etc. It was fantastic!!!!!Cleanliness:Hotel bathroom and rooms were spotless - no bad candid photos here as there were none to take Elevators:Never had to wait for themPillow Menu:This is really fun - you can choose what type of pillow you want. We tried the sound pillow..you plug in your ipod and there are tiny speakers in the pillow so you can listen to music as you sleep!Gym/Spa:We didn't use them but they're there for those who want themyou can also get massages etc in your room!Checking out:although we couldn't get a late check out as the hotel was full, they stored our luggage for the day, didn't mind when we took over the lobby packing and unpacking last minute shopping and then ordered a car for us to the airport. tip* get the hotel to order the car, we did and they sent a black stretch and we only had to pay $65 for it.Anyone considering staying here, feel free to contact me with questions. This really is a GREAT hotel, I will never stay anywhere else in New York.

<Content>Good Hotel Have just returned from my stay at Affinia Dumont. The hotel is in a great location, same street as Empire State and Macys. There is also a subway close too. There are a few places to eat around the hotel for a quick breakfast. On arrival at the hotel, the lobby smelt very clean and the staff at the desk helpful. The room itself (2903) was on a high floor with a great view of the Chrysler Building, large living room area, kitchen and bedroom with 2 queens. The bathroom was ok, my only gripe would be that the shower area and shower head were a bit grubby. However, this did not spoil my stay here as everything else was immaculate. The staff in particular, the doorman, were very helpful. I would definately recommend this hotel to others.

<Content>We'd definitely stay here again ...... We've literally just returned today from NY, staying in a suite on the 34th floor of the Affinia Dumont which we booked due to the great reviews read on Trip Advisor. We were absolutely delighted: Paul on the front desk checked us in and allocated us a fabulous corner suite with a view straight over to the Chrysler Building. All staff were really helpful, the gym (24hrs) was great, hotel location was superb: easy to get to the subway or just to walk right to the shops. Wear comfy shoes:it's amazing the distances you cover. The Barking Dog next to the hotel is great for breakfast (around $25 for two people) or to have an evening drink. Bed was huge and really comfy too made up with really good quality bed linen. There are a couple of grocery shops just up the road where you can get your basic provisions if you do book a suite with a kitchenette area. We didn't actually use the kitchen much but it was useful to have the option and we really felt the benefit of having the extra room space as we had quite a large lounge and study area too. We would definitely stay at the AD again. (Review by CCB + MT)

<Content>Wonderful Hotel...Amazing Price!!! ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!! This was my 4th trip to NY, but the first with my family, so I was tasked with finding a mid-town NY hotel with a little bit of extra room. The studio bedroom was ENORMOUS my NYC standards. The room contained 2 queen beds (a 3rd queen would have easily fit), a desk (bigger than the VP's of the bank I work for), and a sitting chair and ottoman. The bathroom and kitchen was bigger than the ones I've seen in an average NYC apartment. The location was great too. There's a deli on the corner, Starbucks one block away, and a Duane Reade 2 blocks away. It's close to subway stops and taxis are plentiful.I've stayed at the Ritz Carlton in Battery Park and the Plaza Hotel, and neither comes close to the overall value and service of my experience at the Affinia. The staff is wonderful, whether its giving directions or finding last minute tickets to a show, they will stop at nothing to make sure you are satisfied.I did have a couple of billing issues, but both were resolved very quickly once I contacted the hotel.Great hotel for families or small groups of travelers who want to stay together.

<Content>Great apart from minor points Agree with all the comments. Won't bother repeating the accurate info on the subway, deli next door, location in general - all excellent. Worth adding that a right turn out of the hotel and you have 3 or 4 excellent well priced restaurants within a minute's walk. One slight downer - booked on the hotel website and requested a high floor room. Also sent an e-mail to verify after reading all comments on this site. On check in was even asked if we preferred a high room; we said yes - but ended up on 13th floor without much of a view and with (generally tolerable - this is NYC) road noise. Also, the junior suite is described as having a separate sleeping area; in fact this means it's in a separate part of the same room; I had anticipated some sort of screening off to offer my sister and my wife and I privacy.Having picked up on the above, I'd definitely re-visit the Dumont for the location, the excellent staff attitude and the large room with comfortable beds. A gem.

<Content>Major screw-up resulted in much disappointment When we arrived at the Affinia Dumont, we found out that the room we reserved was not available. For my husband's birthday, I had made a non-refundable reservation via phone almost 2 months in advance of our trip for a 1BR suite w/2 queens. We had a15YO, 5YO, and toddler w/us. The man I spoke with via phone was very helpful, but the manager said he should not have told us that we could get 2 queens. The manager said they over-booked the rooms and we would have to get a king-sz bed with a pull-out sofa. This was a big problem - our toddler needs to sleep separately from people or he will be a terror. And he was, as a result of their screw-up. They tried to make up for it - better rate, free breakfast, the correct room on the following night that we wouldn't have to move our luggage to. It was not enough when the result was being kept up most of the night by a toddler  then our teen says she had the worst night sleep ever because of the uncomfortable sofa. We had to pack up our stuff - 45 mins of a waste of time (lots of stuff w/3 kids) - then they neglected to move our items to the new room. We learned that this over-booking situation happened to at least 1 other party. The 3 grown women (sisters) ended up sleeping in the same king-sz bed. There were other minor things. The new room was better, but we already had a sour taste in our mouth. Our massages were mediocre. On the plus side - the rooms were clean  relatively spacious, the beds/bedding were comfy, the amenities were nice, the bellmen were personable, and location decent.

<Content>The Best Hotel for the price In NY My wife and I stayed at this hotel last year for her birthday. This hotel has to be one of the best hotels we've stayed in in New York. It's centrally located without being right in Times Square. The staff is extremely nice and the room was large with a small but fully equipped kitchen. We've decided that this will be our NY hotel every year. Thanks to tripadvisor , because I chose theis hotel from the reviews it got from other customers.

<Content>fabulous hotel Good location on 33rd. Check in/lounge very small, but i suppose thats new york. they did have ipods at the seating areas with preloaded music/movies, so thats a nice touch. Our jr king suite was excellent, however. very large, mega-nice bed and bedding. the corner-room view was spectacular (of the water and the city). superb executive-level desk. all furnishings nice and especially comfortable.. even pull-out sofabed.

<Content>Nothing but good to say about the Affinia Dumont Just returned from a long weekend with our son and his girlfriend and stayed at the Dumont after reading great reviews on Tripadvisor. It is all true. The staff was wonderful and helped us with all our questions. The room was perfect and on the 35th floor with awe inspiring view of the city and the Empire State building, The beds were comfortable and the kids enjoyed ordering their special pillows. The sofa was made up and turned down each night for our son's girlfriend and everything was perfectly clean. Kitchen was a nice touch even though we really didn' t use it. Room service was right on time with breakfast and very reasonably priced. A great place to stay and convenient to everything in New York.

<Content>Best Value for $ in NYC! I found this hotel in TripAdvisor and booked via [-]- which had the best rates.I've visited NYC for business on many occasions and never had such a hopel experience.I was able to check-in to the room after a very long transatlantic flight even though it was very early in the morning. the reception staff was nicer than any I met in NYC. The room is very big for NYC standards and I enjoyed it very much. The bed is huge and comfortable, and there are 5 types of pilloes to choose from (including an mp3 pillow if you're into it...) The rest of the staff in the hotel was also very friendly and welcoming. They really went out of their way to make me feel at home away from home, and I did.I will recommend staying with you to anyone and really hope to be back soon.Thanks for doing a great job!

<Content>great hotel, good location Stayed in the Dumont for 4 nights in late October. The staff are very pleasant and helpful, particularly the front desk. They organised tickets for us for an ice hockey game one night in Madison Sq garden.Rooms are very large by NY standards, very comfortable, clean and quiet. The bed in our junior suite was great to fall into after long days sightseeing and shopping. We were on the 13th floor (of 30-something) and were able to sleep no problems. To be fair it is probably not the noisiest area of Manhattan. We didnt go into the Barking Dog, after reading the hilarious mouse story in another review, so can't comment on it. We got breakfast every day in the Murray Hill Diner on the next block and it is cheap, cheerful and very tasty!The location is 2 blocks from the Empire State building and a little further on is Macys. for transport, the hotel is one block from a subway station (green lines 4,5 and 6), so there is no problem getting around. Would recommend this hotel to anyone or definitely stay there again. Overall, it is well worth its lofty perch among the top hotels in New York!

<Content>This place is Fabulous!!!! The location of this hotel is great. It's an easy walk to the subway and to many tourist attractions. The staff is very friendly and go out of their way to help you. The smell of lavendar greets you as you step in the lobby and instantly relaxes you. The elevators are fast, the rooms were huge, beds and linens extremely comfortable and it was great to have the use of the little kitchen in our suite for breakfast. We ate brunch at The Barking Dog restaurant next door, which is not actually part of the hotel, and the food was very good. (No evidence of Minnie or Mickey visiting on the Sunday morning that we were there, but there were plenty of other people waiting to have brunch.) I would definitely stay at the Affinia Dumont again and would highly recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Fantastically satisified! I picked the Affinia Dumont because of reviews I read on trip advisor and I was not dissappointed. The rooms where huge, beautifully decorated, great value and centrally located for all my requirements. But the one thing that must get a special mention is the staff. Not one let this hotel down at anytime and they were the nicest, professional and relaxed bunch of people I have ever met in one work place! Special mention about Chris the doorman who was an outstanding ambassador for the hotel.Thank you for making myself and my friends stay such a memorable experience - we will definately be back sometime in the future!

<Content>The hotel I judge all other hotels by We booked this hotel to stay over New Year in 2006-2007, and we were not disappointed.Our bags were taken from us the second we got out of our taxi by the hotel staff. The receptionist was fantastic, very efficient, friendly and helpful.On first impressions of this hotel I was very impressed and it only got better.The room was massive, with a seperate sitting area, with flat screen TV's in both rooms and very clean.It is about a ten minute walk to the Empire State building and close to all transport links.This is just the best hotel I have ever stayed at, and the fact that it seems pretty much booked solid for the next few months backs that up.I would stay in this hotel again without hesitation.

<Content>Fantastic Dumont What an incredible stay at the Affinia Dumont! We experienced fantastic service, from the doormen to the reservation staff, to the wonferful housekeeping crew. We were kindly greeted upon arrival, a bit too early for checkin, and were told that our room was worth the wait. Indeed, it was! We were on the 35th floor, which in itself was awesome, but when we opened our door, we discovered a corner room with views of the Chrystler Building and the East River. For our first visit to NYC, this was enough to make our whole trip worth while. The room was spacious, beautifully decorated, and had all the comforts of home (big tv, comfy sofa, large desk and plenty of room to store clothing). The location was perfect - just a block or so away from the 6 train, which takes you uptown or downtown with convenient stops, yummy restaurants closeby, and a lovely market next door. Don't miss this hotel. You will not be disappointed.

The location is ideal, close to subway and there is a great deli next door for a late night coffee after a night out! Room size was great for the price, the staff were friendly and overall would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a moderately priced room in NYC in a good location, do not think that you can get better value.

<Content>A great choice! We chose the Dumont when it was rated #2 in New York on Tripadvisor. The reviews didn't lie. What a choice! We travelled with two teenagers and had a double bedroom suite on the 34th floor for 4 nights - fantastically comfortable with the superb pillow menu and views looking north that will live in the memory forever.We found the city amazingly busy and noisy - the Dumont was conventiently located but away from the action. Why stay in Times Square (post-apocolyptic in our view!) when there's the Dumont? That said, light sleepers will still be disturbed by sirens and horns so bring the ear-plugs!The staff were great and friendly, arranged airport transfers and checked us in online for our return flights. In a city where we found service to be somewhat patchy it was refreshing to come home to the Dumont.The Barking Dog restaurant gets mixed reviews in these pages though we found the food and value good. We tried the Cinema Cafe on 34th and 3rd for breakfast - quiet and good but pricey - yet the Italian restaurant next door was very good and very busy on a Saturday night.Other than that we did all the major must-sees; Top of the Rock IS better than the Empire State, the Staten Island Ferry IS the best value trip (Free!) and you must take a helicopter flight, though we flew Liberty Helicopters and experienced a long wait and surly service.Do not hesitate to chose the Dumont, it made our stay and we'd go back in a heartbeat.

<Content>What a great place to stay In a city with a thousands of choices where to stay what a relief to fall lucky and find a gem at a reasonable price. Against this hotel you have street noise on the lower floor rooms (where wouldn't you in New York!) and the in-room movies weren't working in our room. On the positive side I could go on for hours, great location a couple of hundred yards from 33rd st subway where you can take the 6 train to the north or south. The staff are great, so much so I did feel slightly guilty for not having enough dollars to leave a reasonable tip on leaving. The rooms are big and ours included a small kitchen area although we didn't get chance to use it on a 3 day stay. All in all a great value for money place to stay

<Content>As good as it gets! We've just returned from a stay in the US, and spent part of it at the Affinia Dumont. We loved the hotel, the staff were great, and the room was good. We had great view of the Chrysler building.This was our second stay in NY and we really appreciated having more space than a conventional hotel as well as very helpful and friendly staff.Whilst it wasa little way from the main attractions this was still a good place to stay and we would definitely use it again.We also used Big Apple Greeters when we were there -this was a great service and well worth using. We did not use the adjacent restaurant -The Barking Dog - we'd heard bad reviews and there were good alternatives nearby..Overall a great place to stay.

<Content>Great Stay in a Great Hotel We have just returned from a holiday to New York where we stayed at Affinia Dumont. The hotel was perfect and the staff couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful.We were in New York to get married and had decided to have the ceremony in our suite so choosing the right hotel was very important. When we booked the Affinia Dumont through Expedia I e mailed the hotel to request a room on a high floor. This was obviously listened to because we were given a room on the 32nd floor. It had L-shaped windows so we were able to get married with views of the Chrysler and the East River and Brooklyn Bridge.We had a bit of a nightmare with delayed luggage and the staff went out of their way to ask about it and offer help.After the wedding we went on a dinner cruise and when we got back the staff had scattered rose petals in our room and left us a bottle of wine and card. It was so thoughtful and over and above the call of duty. It was such a nice end to the day.Hopefully we will be back in New York to celebrate an anniversary and I would definitely stay in the Affinia Dumont again.

We booked a one bedroomed apt - wellworth it as we had space to relax after a hard days shopping. We liked the Barking Dog restaurant next door. Food was good enough and atmosphere relaxed and easy going. Italian round the corner also verygood.

<Content>Fantastic Views My husband and I stayed at this hotel for a long weekend 19th-23rd October 2007. It was our 10th Wedding Anniversary/40th Birthday treat to us and it was fantastic.I would always recommend contacting hotels/airlines if you are celebrating something special. We got an up-grade with BA and when we arrived at the hotel we had a wonderful corner room (3406) with views of downtown New York and the river. The hotel also left a bottle of champagne for us. We couldn't have asked for a better start to our break.Chris, the door man was really friendly and all of the staff were happy to help with any questions we had about taxis or restaurants.The menu at the barking dog was limited so we did not eat here during our stay, but we would recommend a diner just around the corner on Murray Hill, great service, food and prices. You need a good breakfast before you start your shopping/sightseeing! We also would recommend spankys steak house and the little French restaurant just behind the hotel. The owner was really friendly, the atmosphere romantic and the food great!If you want to go up the Empire State building then I would recommend you get there around 8am otherwise the queues can be 2-3hours long. We went to the newly opened 102nd floor and the views were amazing. Yes it was an early start to the day, but we went straight in without any waiting.Macys was great for shopping (ask at hotel reception for discount vouchers) and although we didn't find them, we were told by some locals about great out-let stores for even better bargains. You are in New York and even on the 34th floor you can hear the sirens at night and the cars below, but if you walked around like us you will not find any problem sleeping at night!We did use the underground to get around. You can buy tickets in the stations for about $2 and that will get you down to the (Bowling Green) stop were you can catch the boat out to Liberty Island ( well worth a visit great views for $12).I hope you enjoy your stay in New York as much as we did!!

<Content>Nice place with noisy aircon We, a family of four, recently spent 4 nights at the Affinia Dumont. I chose the hotel because of the great reviews and its location. Unfortunately, we did not get the high floor room we asked for when we reserved 10 months ago.The studio we got had a comfortable size for the four of us, it was very clean, and the beds were comfortable. Service and friendliness of the personnel was great. What really turned me and my husband off, was the very noisy and drafty aircon. Since we had more than 80 degrees Fahrenheit and very humid weather, we had to leave it on over night. It was placed under the window, so my husband who slept next to it was in a constant draft of cool air. We did, however, not bother to ask for another room, because we could not imagine that the Affinia would have different systems in other rooms. Nevertheless, since everything else was good, we would probably stay there again next time.We definitely do not recommend to dine at the Barking Dog next door. While the servce is friendly, the food is not good, the table was not even with plates sliding to one side, the personnel carried all sorts of beer kegs etc. through the restaurant constantly bumping into one of our chairs ... It was by far the worst eating experience on our 12-day-trip to the Northeast.Just go 15 steps to the corner of 34th Street and 3rd Avenue: there are several nice restaurants there. We can especially recommend Patsy's pizzeria across the crossing: best pizza we ever had (thin, crispy, not greasy)!

<Content>Made my trip to NYC complete My fiance and I stayed at the Affinia Dumont from 6th to 11th October. It was my 30th birthday and his first time in New York and this hotel helped make it an amazing stay. We requested a suite on one of the higher floors after reading reviews from this website - what we didn't expect was a corner suite which offered even better views of the NYC skyline. The room was huge, the kitchenette well equipped, and the bed very comfortable. The staff were always very helpful. It's just a few blocks from the nearest subway, the Empire State Building, and if you're a shopping addict like me, close enough for more than a few visits to Macys and the shops on 5th Ave. There were lots of food supermarkets around so we could easily stock up on bottled water and deli food when we weren't up to eating out. Blockheads was the biggest bargain when it came to local restaurants - great Mexican food with $3 frozen margheritas, Cinema next door was a bit pricier but also nice. Check out Century 21 if you love bargains - although be prepared to rummage a bit. And if you can afford it, go to the River Cafe for dinner under Brooklyn Bridge which is very romantic, classy and has stunning views of the city. Walk across the bridge on the way there and get a swanky car back to the hotel (what I did on my actual birthday!) I loved Duane Reade too - it's a pharmacy but if you're from the UK you'll find lots of cheap, good quality makeup, some which aren't available in the UK. I'd definitely recommend Affinia Dumont.

<Content>Fabulous I couldnt be happier with the Affinia Dumont. The room was large and comfortable the front desk staff was wonderful, the door staff was wonderful and the cleaning staff was too. This is definitely where I will be staying from now on when I visit NY. The location was perfect too. It was close to the subway and close to main attractions, if you want to walk- I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>The Higher The Better There are lots of great reviews and we did enjoy our stay due mainly to the excellent reception staff and the brilliant door staff at this hotel.The suite we were given was the most spacious we have had in New York with a seperate living,kitchen and king bedroom.The only thing we would have liked was a room on a higher floor, On our floor (16) we looked directly into apartments across the street but what was frustrating was that by standing on a chair we could see a little of the Chrysler building. A view which must be brilliant from the upper floors. I would certainly beg for at least the 25th Floor next time.We would be pleased to go back to this hotel but would be tempted to return to the Millenium Hiltion simply for the views.

<Content>Clean, well located,friendly Our overall experience was great! The room we requested was not the type of bedding they had when we got there. But the manager found us other acceptable arrangements. So we were happy with how we were treated. The bellmen were nice. The kitchenettes in our 2 rooms were fully stocked. Very large rooms. Most important for me, the rooms very clean! Good location, close to subway. Small fitness spa to exercise or to change clother if your room is not ready when you arrive.

<Content>Lived up to our expectations. We have just returned from a long weekend stay at the affinia Dumont hotel in New York. As always I choose the hotel by the reviews on Trip Advisor and we weren't disappointed.The hotel is in a very convenient position with the Empire State Building in the same street and 4 blocks away. We had rooms on the 31st floor and we had a spectacular view of the Chrysler building. The room was one of the biggest we've ever had, spotlessly clean with a huge kingsize bed, roomy bathroom and lots of hanging and drawer space. I had booked 2 rooms with king beds but the girls wanted singles (These were huge too!) and the girl at the desk changed the rooms to suit and made sure they were very near one another. Nothing was too much trouble and all the staff were very helpful and courteous.We ate breakfast at The Barking Dog next door which was very reasonable and did the best pancakes!!The Red Lobster 5 Times Square is worth a visit(do book or you may have an hours wait) and we had a fabulous meal there. I can highly recommend the coconut covered battered huge prawns and crab legs!!! Again, a reasonable price.We had been told by a friend in Queen's to try Patsy's Italian restaurant 236 W 56th Street which we booked for Saturday evening. It was like walking into The Sopranos!!! but again the food was excellent but a bit more expensive, around 拢120.00 for four with drinks.Where ever you eat the portions are huge and the drinks seem to be doubles!We had a fantastic time in New York and saw all the sitesand the girls gave the credit cards a bashing! The taxis are very cheap too and worth using.Will certainly stay at The Affinia when we return Thanks for making it a great break.Yvonne and Dave Freeborn and girls.

<Content>Enjoyed our stay at Affinia We have just returned from 5 nights at the Affinia hotel, NY. We chose this hotel as it couldn't be beaten on price and the reviews on trip advisor were very good. I've never visited NYbefore so haven't experienced any other hotels in the area but can say that it's location was brilliant. We were very central to all the attractions, which were in walking distance or there were nearby tube and bus stations if you want to use them. Our hotel room was huge however we were hardly in the hotel room. The bathroom was average and the kitchen was average as well. Our view was absolutely fantastic as well. There was an air conditioning unit in our room, which made a noise but this didn't bother us at all. We were on the 24th floor and could just about hear traffic outside but I think this would have been the same in any hotel in NY and again it didn't bother us at all. We felt as though the hotel and rooms needed modernising but apart from that I would definitely recommend it. Although I would not recommend the Barking Dog, which is the hotel's restaurant. We went there on our first night and didn't return. The food tasted processed and I ordered lasagne which had been warmed up as the middle was freezing cold and had been made with sour cream! We could also see mice running around in the seating area outside, which put us off going back as well.

<Content>Good value, great space, excellent service. I booked this hotel on the strength of the reviews and the space it offered three visitors in a one bedroom suite. Its good value, has spacious rooms and the staff are first class. Our rooom on the 20th floor had a view but not one to rave about. The room was comfortable, clean had everything in it you could wish for, but some of the furniture was looking a little tired. The fridge is well stocked with items, if a little pricey, but the free Coffee is a nice touch. Staff really are first class, acting promplty to fix a broken TV in our room and providing extra linen for the sofa bed on request. However, there is no getting away from the first impression of getting a hotel room with a broken TV and where you have to ask for extra linen when the booking if for 3 people and there is only one bed. So its the staff that make this place as does the space it offers. These are the two main reasons in my opinion to stay here. Its loacted about 5 mins from the Empire state building in a relatively quiet location for NY. Its close to the major attractions / shopping, but if I'm honest I prefer to stay in the mid 40s off 5th avenue as I like being able to walk to Central Park within mins and up museum mile - but its a well located hotel none the less. We ate at the barking dog and it is pretty poor quality. I didn't think the prices were too high, just the food was prepared badly with over cooked fries and a charred burger. We ate one night at a nice little Italian call Da Cira I think, right around the corner on Lexington. The deli on the corner of 34th and Lex is also nicely stocked should you wish to catch a quick breakfast in your room.

<Content>Beautiful Views, Comfortable Stay I highly recommend the Affinia Dumont. We arrived to a helpful, cheerful check-in staff. Our room was a suite on the 25th floor with gorgeous views of the Chrysler building and the East River. Loved the Pillow Menu. The room was sparkling clean, fresh, and spacious. The bed linen was soft and the bed was VERY comfortable. Much more than I'd expect for the price we paid. A very nice touch was a bottle of wine sent to the room when the staff learned we were there for our anniversary. As the health-conscious staff says, Be well.

<Content>Great as usual Our 3rd stay in 4 years. The 1 br unit had lots of room. Having a kitchen is a real plus for morning coffee and heating up leftovers.The staff is friendly and efficient. Always feel welcome. Good local restaurants. Located in a safe residential area away from the tourist crowds but easy access(bus and subway) to theater, etc. Our favorite Manhattan hotel.

<Content>great stay Just returned from New York and the Affinia Dumont was one of the highlights. We stayed for 2 nights and everything was top notch. The location is great although it should be noted that the hotel is in a more residential area. Nevertheless, it was very easy to walk everywhere and the subway is 2 blocks away. The rooms are very spacious, nicely furnished and equiped with a kitchenette There's a market/deli on the corner which is a nice alternative to eating every meal out. The Murry Hill Diner around the block also offers great breakfasts.The only disappointment was that we requested a room on an upper floor, were told that our request was granted but were given a room on the 11th floor. So, we really didn't have a great view and it was a bit noisy due to street traffic.Overall, I highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>It's True, AGreat Place to Stau We recently returned from a spending a week in NYC at the Affinia. I had done a lot of research and consideration before choosing this hotel and after our stay I'm convinced it was the best choice considering our priorities. The criteria I considered when deciding included the following:Type of Facility - there are a lot of choices from large full service hotels to small boutique hotels to bed and breakfast/guest houses. I like to have all the essential amenities (private bathroom, room service, sufficient bedroom and bathroom floor space, comfortable bed and linens, etc) but don't need a fancy lobby, prestigious name/address and so on. The Affinia Dumont delivered. More than enough space, very comfortable bed, linens and pillows, nicely furnished, kitchen with freezer space is a real bonus.Location - Midtown, central location, great subway access, relatively quiet neighborhood, nearby shops and restaurants. Safety and cleanliness - very safe neighborhood, very clean room, always got good maid service, even when sleeping in late.Good value - a nice room in a decent hotel in a good location in NYC doesn't come cheap. You can pay less but you're going to get less in one or more of the criteria above.Read the reviews and you'll get a good idea of what you will get. I could say a lot more but most of it has already been said by other reviewers. Some personal experiences - Book ahead of time as much as you can. I booked about four months in advance. The room type we booked was not available and it had gone up about $80/night as we got close to our travel date. I had requested an upper room at booking, when confirming about a month before, and was told we were set for a room on the 30th floor (I think) when I called two days before our departure. On check in I was given a room on the 17th floor. Not exactly what I expected but it was a corner suite and it was high enough to escape most street noise but not high enough for a great view, so I didn't pitch a fit. Also, had problems trying to get a pay-per-view movie one evening. They had a technician up to the room in minutes. He was able to determine that the service was out for the whole building, called the service provider, got them to reset the service and I was watching my selected movie in no time. That type of service that is hard to find anywhere.I highly recommend this hotel. It truly deserves its high ranking. I would especially recommend it for family trips where you need more than one bedroom and you want a safe neighborhood.

<Content>Affina Dumont is great! We are a well-travelled family of four - two adults, two teenaged daughters - and we really enjoyed our recent visit to the Affinia Dumont. Centrally located in Midtown near the 33rd Street / Park Ave. subway station, it served as a wonderful, reasonably-priced oasis. Very spacious, comfortable, clean, and quiet room with large bathroom and nice complete kitchenette. Great beds, and the girls went crazy over the pillow menu, offering a choice of six different pillows ranging from buckwheat to contour foam. (I went with the magnetic therapy pillow and slept like a baby.)Wonderful in-room spa amenities and use of a very nice fitness center are complimentary - unusual in Manhattan.The entire staff - bellstaff, front desk, housekeeping - was unfailingly polite and helpful. They bent over backwards to accommodate our every request. They appear to actually enjoy working at this hotel!Just around the corner on 3rd Ave. at 33rd St. we found the best coffee / bagel shop / bakery in town - Bagel Du Jour. All pastry homemade on site, wonderful Italian espresso.Without hesitation, we will return to the Affinia Dumont on our next visit to NYC.

<Content>Excellent New York Hotel We just returned from a New Yorker Festival Weekend (Oct 5-7, 2007) at the Affinia Dumont near midtown Manhattan. I can't say enough good things about the hotel. It's well appointed, has modern bed  bath, and a friendly staff. The rooms are unusually spacious for New York, including a lovely modern desk and a functional kitchen in our studio king. The location is a good starting point for a lot of activities in New York. You can easily walk to the Empire State Building, 5th Ave, the library, Penn Station, etc. The nearest subway is the number 6 on Park Ave. which is not the best, but works ok to get downtown.

<Content>Absolutely fabulous Just back from a five night stay at the wonderful Affinia Dumont.The weather was hot for our stay and it was great to get back to the air conditioned room which was so comfortable. We were three women on a shopping spree and the doormen were so heplful when we arrived with our shopping., especially Christopher. also Ronaldo for getting us a taxi to the theater. Like all the other reviews no complaints with the housekeeping or reception they were excellent. The area itself it so safe with the Murray hill market just at the corner for stocking up on water, milk etc. Will definitely go back to the Affinia Dumont.

<Content>Loved the Affinia Dumont! My mom and I visited NYC for my dream trip in August, and the Affinia Dumont was fabulous. I had contacted the hotel via email about a month prior to the trip, letting them know that it was a special vacation, and that if possible, we would appreciate having a room with two beds on a high floor (our original reservation was a king room). They happily met our request! We stayed in a double queen studio suite, and the room was very large. We absolutely loved having the kitchen! There are a lot of delis/grocery stores in the area where we could get cheap breakfast. The room was also very clean and had nice white linens and comfortable beds. We loved the neighborhood. The front desk staff as well as the bell staff was FANTASTIC and very, very friendly - always willing to help with directions, and always wished us a pleasant evening. It was nice to be able to grab a piece of fruit and some iced tea in the lobby as we returned. We didn't try the room service, but I was surprised at how reasonable the prices were. Overall, a great stay. I will certainly look to stay here on future trips to New York!

<Content>A Wonderful Stay at The Affinia Dumont My family has just stayed at the Affinia Dumont as my daughter was getting married in Central Park.The hotel staff could not have been more helpful or friendly and nothing was too much trouble for them. From surprises for my daughter and her husband to be, and for me and my husband as we were celebrating our 30th wedding aniiversary - such nice touches.The hotel itself is well placed for the ESB (and Macys) and is only a 15 minute walk to Times Square - or a taxi was only app 7-8 dollars + tip.The rooms were large and clean and the housekeeping was extremely efficient. The views from the hotel are amazing - we were on the 36th floor and had wonderful views of the Chrysler Building and out of another window, the East River.The Barking Dog restaurant next door served great breakfasts and snacks.I have been to New York twice before and now would not consider staying anywhere else!!5 stars in every category.

<Content>Great Hotel This is a great hotel. The staff were helpful  our room was spacious  very comfortable. Good to have a fridge to keep drinks etc. Only slight disadvantage is that the air-conditioning can be only on or off, can't turn the temp down/up.The doormen were particularly helpful when we thought we had lost something on leaving. They will get you a limo to the airport if you ask - better than a taxi  not much more expensive, you can agree the price in advance which is even better if the traffic is bad (it was terrible to JFK so leave plenty of time at peak hours).Close to Empire State Building so get there early or better still book in advance  by-pass the queues.

<Content>Best value in NY We are from England and the last time we stayed in New York City we had a terrible hotel. After researching reviews on Trip Advisor and getting prices we chose the Dumont and were so pleased with it overall. OK. the foyer looks a bit jaded, but the staff are helpful and the rooms are clean and spacious, comfortable beds, good bed linen, bathroom etc. I think they would go up a further notch if they supplied bathrobes but that's just a niggle. It is really central for all attractions and shopping. We booked with Quikbook.com and got an excellent rate.

<Content>Difficult to beat As with other reviews this hotel is indeed in a great location. For those with a disposition for walking it is well placed to walk to most places on Manhatten within 60-90 mins. For those who want to use public transport there is an underground station 5 mins walk away and there are several bus route pickups close to the hotel.The hotel staff were friendly and helpful. We were upgraded to a suite which was pretty large with a lounge and well equipped kitchenette.One downside was when we ordered breakfast in our room. The quality of the food was poor and overpriced. For those who want an alternative location for breakfast try penelopes on lexington within 5-10 minutes walk

<Content>Nice Stay in NY This hotel is a really lovely hotel and I'd recommend it if you're going on your hols to NY. The rooms are really quite large and it's great that they have a fridge aswell. The staff were really helpful through-out our stay and the barking dog cafe next door is great for snacks and breakfast. The hotel is just 4 blocks down from the Empire State Building and is fairly near to all the main tourist attractions(Macy's, Times Sq, Madison Ave, 5th Ave, United Nations). The room is fairly well equipped for all your needs - and they have a variety of pillows which you can try each night. If you're feeling energetic there's also a fitness suite!A word of warning though - this is Manhatten where they just luuurrrrve their sirens - so if you're a light sleeper take ear plugs - no matter what floor you are on!

<Content>Loved the Affinia Dumont! All the great reviews here about the Affinia Dumont are correct! This hotel is just great, especially by NYC standards (where I expect the rooms to be small and very noisy). The staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful. I had a beautiful corner room on the 33rd floor that was huge, with views of the East River and gorgeous buildings. It was so much quieter than other NY hotels I've stayed at. The doormen - Don with the hat especially! - were so kind and helpful. The location is wonderful - very safe, yet near so much (Lexington, Madison, Park Avenues... easy walk to Macys and more). I will definitely stay at the Affinia Dumont again. On another note: I used Dial 7 car service to/from JFK and had very nice drivers in clean comfortable cars. Also, we went to the meat packing district one evening and ate at the Spice Market restaurant - really different and fun, plus such great people watching!

<Content>Mice in the restaurant My mother and I stayed at the Affinia Dumont between 11th Sept and 19th Sept. We went to eat in the hotel's restaurant, The Barking Dog on our third night, and suddenly saw a mouse running around the floor of the restaurant. It had a long tail, so it was either a mouse or a little rat. We immediately told the waitress, who said oh yes that's been here all afternoon, we can't get it out and walked off. A few minutes later, nobody seemed to be doing anything so we asked to see the manager (we were the only people eating in the restaurant). The manager said that the mouse / rat had come in from outside because they had the outside doors open. She said that this particular mouse frequently came in (obviously it hadn't occurred to her that there might be more than one mouse). We said that we were appalled, in the UK a restaurant would at least stop serving if a mouse was running around. She said that she'd called her boss, who told her to continue serving food. The mouse continued to run around the restaurant for the duration of our stay there. Our food came, needless to say we hardly ate anything, and asked for the bill. The bill was brought to our table, no thought of any reduction for the mouse. Eventually we spoke to the manager again who decided that as a special gesture she would cancel the bill. We felt honoured. We immediately spoke to the duty manager of the Affinia Dumont who said that despite the fact that the Barking Dog is advertised on the hotel's website, despite the fact that the restaurant is recommended by the concierge as you arrive and despite the fact that all the hotel's room service comes from the restaurant, it has nothing to do with the hotel. Evidently the hotel leases it to a separate company who do the catering on an agreement with the hotel. The next day the restaurant was still serving food, and there was no talk of room service being suspended. I saw the same manager we'd spoken to on the Sunday evening (three nights later) who said that she had contacted the owner of The Barking Dog, who had said he was too busy to do anything about the mouse / rat. She said that there would be a meeting about the rodent the following day, so she suggested that the hotel had done nothing about this and allowed guests to continue eating food from the restaurant for three days. The next day, she said that she'd just found out that evidently a rat-catcher had come to the restaurant the day after we saw the mouse, and they had a clean bill of health. She offered us one night to be deducted from our bill. I saw Jennifer Baldwin, a Director of Affinia Dumont as we were checking out. I said that I was surprised that we were being asked to pay anything for our stay. I had never eaten before in a restaurant with rodents running around, and was disgusted that this was treated in such a cavalier way. She apologised, but said that New York has a rodent problem, as though what had happened was kind of normal. She refused to refund more than one night of our stay. She said that the rat-catcher comes every Friday to the hotel and restaurant (even though the other manager didn't realise this happened). She said that the kitchens were clean and there was no risk of us having eaten food which was contaminated by rodent faeces. How would she know? How does anyone know that this was a single mouse and not a family? If there isn't a rodent problem, why do they have a rat-catcher come as often as they do? I thought mice were nocturnal, and I thought they preferrred living inside in warm dark places rather than outside so how did they know that this wasn't a colony living under the floorboards? And, given that it had a long tail, was it a mouse or a rat? In reality, I don't think they really cared. I was checking out, we hadn't told anyone about what had happened, and the hotel was full that night. Ms Baldwin did say that she would help me with rates next time I stayed at the hotel. I cannot imagine why she thought I would return - I would not be seen dead in a rodent infested hotel, irrespective of the price. Throughout all of this, I had to start all the discussions. Neither the first manager, nor Ms Baldwin, made the effort to contact us, on the three occasions I spoke to them I had to go and find them. If they were really bothered, why would they not have made an effort to get in touch with us? We paid 拢1800 for 7 night's stay, so this wasn't exactly a cheap hotel. My mother is 71, she was wearing a dress on the evening concerned, and the mouse was literally inches from her legs. She's still having nightmares about this, I would imagine any woman wearing a skirt would do. So, unless you have a passion for rodents, and love bottom of the rung service to go with them, I would take your 拢250 a night and invest it in a better hotel in NYC - there are lots of other options and I'm sure at least some manage to keep mice and rats out.

<Content>Good Location We stayed here for 4 nights during September. It is a good location being in Murray Hill and only takes 15 minutes to walk to Times Square and 5 minutes to the nearest Metro. The hotel does not have a traditional reception and bar / restaurant area. As you walk in the front you are faced with the reception desk and then the lifts to the rooms are behind that. In place of a standard bar and breakfast/dining area there is a bar and cafe adjoining the hotel called the  Barking Dog  which you can use for breakfast etc and charge to the hotel via your room card. The staff are friendly enough there and it is reasonable value, but for anybody who likes a draught beer in the evening there are only bottles.I would suggest you insist on a high floor floor room as we were stuck on floor 4 with only a view of a brick wall. The rooms are spacious enough with a kitchen area for those who require that sort of thing. We didn't use ours as we were in New York to get about not sit in the room and cook.All in all not a bad place to stay but if I were going to New York again I might think again about something more traditional in its layout.

<Content>What a hotel! My wife and I (not royalty) just got back from the big apple after staying at the Affinia Dumont. We had wanted to visit NY for years and wanted the stay to be as enjoyable as possible, good hotel in good location. The Affinia meeets and surpasses these requirements, it is a cracking hotel in a cracking location. from our 25th floor room, complete with kitchenette, we had an excellent view of the Crysler Building and the waterfront. You are only a couple of blocks from the Empire State Building and Macys. Ask for a room as high as possible, there are 37 floors from recollection.One additional benefit for us was to be upgraded to Club Class on the outward journey, how cool was that and what a way to start our visit.

<Content>Upgrade to Huge Corner Suite A bad start in that we didnt get our room until 6.30pm after arriving at 1pm (they sent us to the bar for free drinks). We had a junior suite booked and they kindly upgraded us to a full suite. As we were staying 10 days, it was a major bonus, massive room, couches, tv's, kitchen, office and separate bedroom. Loads of space everywhere. The location of the hotel really is super, its 2 blocks to the subway and right on 3rd avenue for excellent eating options. Very clean, quick elevators and great views. Quite expensive, but hey its NY.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Location Stayed here for 2 nights last week after a 7-day Carnival cruise. Wanted 4 nights, but could only negotiate 2 thru Priceline.The hotel and staff were perfect. And the location, superb. Murray Hill was much quieter and nicer than our other 2 locations, Times Square (a madhouse), and Penn. Station.Great bars and restaurants, all within walking distance. Subway 2 blocks away.The best of the 3 hotels I booked. Would go back anytime.RichieOxnard, Calif.

<Content>Healthy-sized rooms at the Affinia Dumont The Affinia Dumont is marketed as a fitness hotel, and its many accoutrements reflect this philosophy throughout its experience. It's only from these various thoughtful features, though, that you'd guess it was a fitness hotel, since the guests look the same as any other medium-to-high-end hotel in Manhattan, not exclusively the lean, low-cholesterol, somewhat toned specimens you might expect.We were greeted on entry by a couple friendly faces at the front desk, surrounded by a canister of iced tea and a bowl of fresh fruit (because they're healthy). A set of free weights in a plexiglas cabinet looked less out of place than you would expect. As it was in the morning and our room wouldn't be available until 3p, an extremely robust bellhop named Christian took our luggage and promised to keep it safe. We had no doubts.The rooms are enormous by NYC standards. You could easily roll out a yoga mat or two and do your sun salutations while meditating on the downtown skyline (ask for a south-facing room on high floor if this is appealing). Most shocking to my eyes was the desk in the corner with a Herman Miller Aeron chair. Paradise! If you need to do any kind of work in your hotel, this is the place to stay. It would be perfect except for the daily usurious internet charge of $9.95. But you'll pay it with a smile as you relax in the Aeron. After you're done working (or stretching), you can fry up an omelette (egg whites only, of course) in the kitchen, equipped with a gas stove and full-size refrigerator. Several menus were in the room. A room service menu from the restaurant next door; a fitness menu describing some sort of fitness kits; and a pillow menu with at least seven (!) kinds of bed-based head support options, including buckwheat, feather, hypoallergenic, memory foam, magnetic, and other alternatives that I've never heard of before. Also available was an intimacy kit in case all that yoga on the Aeron chair gets your chi flowing - very thoughtful.In my bleary-eyed state, I failed to notice that the fitness theme had stretched even into the elevator, where a small monitor played kickboxing, yoga, and pilates videos in the morning. Everyone in the videos was smiling, beautiful, and taut. I think they change the videos to ESPN in the afternoons.The bathroom was of good size, spotlessly clean, and well appointed with Aveda products (my favorite). Also included was a 100x magnification mirror so you could monitor the health and fitness of your pores.Overall this was a great hotel in a decent midtown location. Highly recommended for anyone, but especially those who value health and wellness, spacious rooms, or Aeron chairs. The staff are friendly and always bid you adieu not with goodbye but be well!

<Content>Staff were fantastic! My husband and I stayed for our honeymoon here - The staff found out and gave us a bottle of wine and a fruit basket. the location of this hotel is very central a couple of blocks from the empire state and times square. the staff at the hotel especially the door men were absolutely wonderfull and took time to talk to us everytime we were in the lobby. we love this hotel!! and would recommend it to anyone. our room was on the 31st floor and overlooked the chrysler building and the Opus dei building. we could also see the east river in the not too far distance. this hotel makes it easy to access both central park area and greenwich as it is very central. if you want a perfect holiday or are in new york for business then this hotel is perfect.

<Content>Really great location, very good room, overall good value Excellent location in mid-town Manhattan. Large rooms with great views (at least from the upper floors. Our room had a kitchen which was useful. Small bathroom.Only downside was the lack of a restaurant - the adjacent Barking Dog serves as the hotel's restaurant.The staff were helpful and friendly. Overall it was easily the best of the four places I've stayed in Manhattan.

<Content>fabulous NYC experience We needed a room for one night in manhattan.The affinia was a great experience from start to finish. Every staff member was extremely courteous and helpful. The room was perfect with a awesome view of the city. I would come back here next time I visit the city and would recommend it to anyone going to new york. The train station is a few blocks away and we were able to walk there for a fast train ride to the newark airport.

<Content>Affinia Dumont was \as good as advertised I have to thank all of you for this trip as I used the trip advisor rankings when searching for a place to stay in New York. The hotel was the Affinia Dumont. I never stayed there and was simply going on the reviews of the hotel. I can honestly say that I was blown away! The location could not have been better. On 34th st between 3rd and 4th ave the Murray Hill area offers nightlife, shopping, restaurants, etc.. By only being a couple blocks from the Lexington Ave subway it made sightseeing easy and inexpensive! The rooms were comfy and the staff friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay again!!!

<Content>Beautiful, classy, great location! You'll love it! We can't stop raving about our stay the the Affinia Dumont; we stayed for 3 nights in May 2007:SERVICEThe service was impeccable! From a quick check-in and extremely courteous and helpful bellmen and front counter people, we were recommended some nice restaurants and my husband even had a good conversation with one of the doormen about baseball! FUN STUFFThey have a pillow menu where you can choose from a variety of special pillows (buckwheat, magnetic, down, etc) free of charge. It was fun trying out different pillows although we often opted for the regular down pillows in the end!There's also exercise packages that you can borrow...they include pedometers, cd players, weights, etc that you can check out. We checked out pedometers to see how far we walked in the city. This service was also free of charge.There's also free fruit and yummy iced tea in the lobby.ROOMSThe rooms were extremely large- we had 2 queen size beds, a lounge chair and an executive size desk with all too much room for just two of us! We had a beautiful view of the city from our large, multiple windows-- it was great at night with all the lights!The bathroom was beautiful with marble, granite and brushed stainless steel fixtures.LOCATIONA great location for catching the subway or the bus...just a few blocks to any transportation. There's some small shops along the walk if you need to pick up anything. GOOD EATSPizza 33 was recommended by the concierge and we loved it! We tried almost each type of pizza (by slices or whole) while we were there. We even brought some with us for our plane ride home!There's a small cafe/deli that's on the corner before you get to the hotel. I dont' remember the name, but they have special coffee drinks, a full deli (soups, sandwiches, salads), smoothie bar...and FREE INTERNET (the hotel charges a daily fee).Overall, we loved our stay at the Affinia. Great location, helpful staff and a very classy hotel overall.

<Content>a pleasant surprise! We booked the Affinia off of travelocity - mainly because we needed 2 queen beds and those are apparently hard to come by in NYC. The Affinia was a pleasant surprise - very clean, spacious, well decorated and staff was very courteous and helpful. I am a huge Westin fan....and this hotel is the same calibur. Beds were very similar. Would definitely recommend and stay there again.

<Content>Wonderful stay at the Affinia Dumont After reading the many wonderful reviews on TripAdvisor, we booked the Affinia Dumont for a 3 day stay (9/3-6) prior to our cruise out of NYC. The many positive reviews were absolutely on target. Upon check in we were asked if we wanted a suite on an upper floor (we said of course!) and were given a corner suite on the 24th floor. What a magnificant view of both the Chrysler building and the East River! The room itself was spacious, quiet and so very comfortable. The bed ws superb, and the full kitchen was great (especially with the market 3 doors down, where we could buy food to cook or goodies to store in the refrigerator at pretty much any hour).The staff was friendly and very helpful too. We loved the location (especially with the taxi strike on Wednesday) since we were within walking distance of many key locations, and 2 blocks from the subway. We would not hesitate to recommend the hotel to others, especially anyone with a family who needs a bit more space then the average hotel room.

<Content>Clean and comfortable, recommend it. We stayed at the Affina Dumont 150 East 34th st from the 29/08/07 - 05/09/07. We can reccomend this hotel without exception, the location is good for all your travel locations or activities. The rooms, we had two on the 21st  24th floors were spotless, comfortable and quiet regarding hotel type noise and the kitchenette was particually useful. The staff were always helpful and the door staff were an unlimited sourse of information and some of the nicest guys you could meet. If you want meals just around the corner from the hotel is the murray hill diner excellent food, clean and good prices and service.About new york: This was our first time and we used Greyline city tours (London open top buses) on a 2 day ticket to get our bearings the info given saved us tthe cost of the tickets and some telling us where to shop for bargains in Union sq at a shop called Filene's Basement ([--]) my wife bought a handbag and a shoulder bag by Ralf Lauren for about 45% off the Maceys price and they were current stock. A chain of bakery/coffee shops called au bon pain are good for cake, rolls, soups and coffee. The Radio City tour is a must, what a place. Tiping a pain as your obliged to do it for everything. If you are downtown by ground zero and wall st pay a visit to St Pauls church on broardway about 3/4 blocks up from wall st very moving place this is where the emergency personel went for rest breaks I am a 53yrs old man not religious and very cinical the place put a tear in my eye.The taxi's from JFK to Manhatten are a fixed price of $49 45 plus 4 for a tunnel toll. Lots more to see for another trip.

<Content>Fantastic! We booked the Affinia Dumont after reading the reviews on trip advisor. We were not disappointed. On arrival we were greeted by very helpful staff who checked us in early and were even willing to change our room the next day to a room with a view! Our room was clean and spacious. The location is excellent as although Murray Hill is a more residential area you get the best of both worlds. A 5 minute walk to the Empire State building and fantastic restaurants and bars where the locals would go on your doorstep.There is an excellent diner just round the corner on Lexington Avenue called the Murray Hill Diner which serves breakfasts that will keep you going all day. On 3rd Avenue there is an excellent Mexican restaurant called Blockheads which does $3 Margarita's.I would go back to the Affinia Dumont every year!!

<Content>It was perfect for our family! Our family of five had an awesome stay at Affinia Dumont in June. It is so hard to find a place in NYC that allows 5 people per room. Besides accomodating our large group, our room had everything we could want - 2 TVs (no fighting between the kids), a nice size bathroom, kitchen space to make snacks, and the separate living room and bedroom gave us plenty of space to stretch out. The doorman remembered my 11 year old nephew each time we returned and made that boy feel very special on his first visit to NYC. The front desk staff was so welcoming and very helpful. The beds were SO comfortable after long days of touring. Although some other reviewers of this property have complained about street noise, it didn't bother us at all. The neighborhood was very nice and I always felt safe. This was my first time using Trip Advisor to help me select a place to stay and this hotel was as great as the other reviews said it was! I'm so glad we picked the Affinia Dumont - they really made sure we had a nice stay!

<Content>Mixed Thoughts About Affinia Dumont I have mixed thoughts about giving the Afinia Dumont a three star rating rather than a four--it may well be that the hotel situation in Manhattan is so terrible that a four is justified by comparison, (I've never stayed in a Manhattan hotel before, but if you stayed in this facility in San Francisco, Honolulu, Scottsdale, etc. you would have no trouble rating the Dumont as a Three at best. Consider the advice of those with more Manhattan experience.We stayed 8 nights Aug 26 - Sept 2 07. Arriving Saturday night we were given a 4th floor room by an apologetic night clerk who assured us (without prompting) that we could be moved to a higher floor the next day if we asked. This deserves brownie points even though we didn't move. We loved our corner room with windows on two sides giving great views of 34th St, including the Third Avenue intersection. A personal choice. I mention this because of another review suggesting staff was not helpful with this kind of situation.Very Good Overall:Location on 34th: 1 1/2 blocks to #6 subway line (one stop Uptown to Grand Central Station and all points everywhere. A few stops Downtown will give you easy transfers to express subway trains headed to Wall Street etc.. Don't underestimate importance of this.Room size: Big! The reason we chose this property after seeing TripAdvisor reviews.Bed - The King was excellentBathroom - Very attractive and functional except for the modest counter space.Work desk - big.Electric outlets - lotsExcellent staff attitude, friendliness,and response to requests everywhere--front desk, concierge, spa/exercise room, housekeeping.Very good exercise room (good treadmills (3), eliptical trainers (3), and bikes (2), each with individual TVs. Weight machines and free wieghts are more than adequate for all but the very serious lifters.) When I was there (around 5 pm daily), there was almost never more than several other guests in the room.We enjoyed neighborhood restaurants and the hotel restaurant.Improvement needed:Antiquated television - Purchased at a garage sale?Neglected KitchenGood:Small gas range and oven Freezer-over refrigerator.Small coffee maker (with coffee packets supplied daily).Cups, plates, and glasses for 3 or 4Frying pan, 2 sauce pans, small glass bowl serving dish, 1 spatula, 1 can opener.Bad: Not much else in the kitchen. Not even a sharp knife to cut cheese with. No additional mixing dishes, serving dishes, measuring cups, juice or beverage containers. Tiny antiquated/underpowered microwave (despite lots of available counter space available for something better). No dishwasher (there is plenty of space for regular one and more than plenty for one of the small ones that was just installed at my office at home).Internet connections:We never got it to work--used dial-up instead. (Admittedly I gave up quickly, but I rarely have a problem.)The phantom Business Center. Their web site lists a Business Center as an amenitity, but it doesn't exist unless you count the single work station in the small front lobby ($6 for 20 minutes).I defer to those who have much more Manhattan hotel selection experience.Feel free to contact me. --Jeff

<Content>Loved the Affinia Dumont Excellent hotel! This was my first trip to NYC and it couldn't have been a more wonderful trip, thanks in part to our comfortable stay at the Affinia Dumont. We stayed 8/16-19 in a one bedroom suite on the 6th floor. The room was beautiful, very quiet, and the bed was ultra-comfortable! Exceptional staff who are friendly and helpful. Great location, near Penn station. Looking forward to another trip to NYC and would definitely stay again at the Affinia.

<Content>Affinia disapointing this year We have stayed at the Affinia for the past several Labor day weekends with positive reviews (some probably posted here). Just returned from 3 nights and we were a little disapointed. The hotel seems to be more run down since our last visit in 2006 and the staff wasn't their usual perky selves. (Except for the bellman with the hat!) When we got to our junior suite on night 1 there was a funky smell in the room. I won't go into details. It was fairly late after a long day at the Tennis tourney, so we simply called the front desk and asked if we could be moved to a cleaner room the following day. We were told of course, pack up your bags in the morning and we will move your things. So the next day when we returned to the hotel, again after a long day we checked at the front desk to get our new room #. It was almost 5 and we were told the new room wasn't ready (our old room wasn't made up either, never was that day). So we headed back out and returned around 7 or so when the front desk gave us our new keys. But we had to go and collect our things as no one had moved them for us afterall. Basically the Affinia is in a nice location, has great size rooms for NYC, but on our next trip we will be trying a new location. May be time for a change.

<Content>Loved the Affinia Dumont My three girlfriends and I (including an appellate court judge) just returned from a four-night (ladies weekend) stay at the Affinia Dumont -- and can't stop talking about the hotel. First off, I booked the hotel for the group based on the past reviews and I am glad I disregarded the few bad reviews. The hotel was perfect for the four of us -- plenty of room (big by NYC standards); the kitchennette came in very handy (especially with the Murray Market next door); the location was great (away from noisy Times Square) and within walking/cab distance to just about anywhere; and the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating. We will definitely be staying here again on our next trip and have even told my husband that next time we are in NYC we too will be staying here. In one word the experience was truly WONDERFUL!

<Content>Affinia Dumont, A real Gem We looked and looked for decently priced hotel in Manhattan and we were losing hope when we came across this gem.It is only a 45-minutes cab ride from JFK. The lobby is really nice and you can use their computer in the lobby to print out your boarding passes.The staff is very friendly and the gym area is nice and relaxing. The lockers area was clean and I liked the special touches, such as providing fresh towel and a sanitizier machine for the combs and brushes they provided.The room was on the 25th floor, very nice, up there. The only drawback is the very noisy air conditioning that you need to keep on otherwise you boil in there.There was even a kitchen fully stocked and a little cute bottle of dishwashing liquid.The bed was very comfortable and the pillows were great. The even asked us if we wanted different pillows. They have a whole menu of pillows in the room and you can order the ones you want.The sheets were very soft as well. There was a tv, a safe, lots of closet space; the bathroom was big as well but it did not have a fan so if you take an extra hot shower, you will swelter in there if the door is closed.In the weekday mornings they also put a newspaper at our door which was nice.I even saw guests with their little dogs coming out of the rooms.There is a little supermarket deli next door that sells really sweet smelling flowers, water and prepares sandwiches and bagels as well.All in all, it was a great stay!

<Content>Hello Benjamin! Hello Benjamin and the guys! Sorry for the delay in posting our review! Myself and 3 girls from Liverpool stayed here in July for a week. The hotel staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful. The guys on the door couldn't do enough for you, be it recommending restaurants, places to see and clubs! Especailly organisng the Limo for the journey home! The hotel is in a nice location, we have stayed in the Affina Manhattan before and it does tend to be noisier.. the Dumont is in a quieter loaction but still handy for all the attractions.. Ask for a room on a high floor and you can't go wrong (especially if its a corner room). There were 4 of us in our room and we all managed ok. The Cinema Cafe around the corner serves great coctails, the nightlife tends to be better downtown, Nolita, Little Italy, Meat Packing district etc.. only a cab ride away... I would definaltey recommend this hotel to anyone.. Back to the door men! Benjamin, my friend who stayed last week passed on your message! Its a very small world! Lyndsay, Geraldine, Sherryn and Carrie. x

<Content>One Of The Best  We returned once again to one of our favorite hotels in the country. Probably our best vacation there yet. Our room was on the 37th floor, a huge room especially by NY standards, magnificent view with 2 banks of windows overlooking the East River. As always our accomodations were super clean and quiet. The staff at this hotel is great, very helpful but not intrusive. No problems whatsoever this time. We figured we were in the room approximately 3 hourse out of every 24 but after a hard day (and sometimes night) of sightseeing, plays, concerts and shopping having a nice, quiet, clean home to return to is just what we needed. The sunrises were magnificent. Close to wonderful restaurants and public transportation. We always stay at an Affinia hotel while in NY and this was the second year at the Dumont. We will definitely be there next summer.

<Content>Very convenient hotel Affinia Dumont is a confortable hotel very convenient for visiting NewYork city. There are many sites you can just walk from there ( EmpireState, Macy's, 42th St,..) and the tube station is really convenient justa couple of blocks far from the hotel. Rooms are really big and they can have great views ( ours did!). There are plenty of restaurants nearby the hotel and also an American restaurant by the main entrance, where you can enjoy massive portions and delicious breakfast.Definitely Affinia is my choice for New York and I have already recommended it to several friends

<Content>Lovely stay at the Affinia Just returned from 3 nights at the Affinia Dumont. Had a studio with 2 queen beds. Plenty of room for a family of 4, children ages 11 and 16. Nice corner room on the 24th floor with a view of the East river. Bathroom very spacious, kitchen was nice to have. Quick walk to the Empire State Bldg, subway, shopping, and grocery stores for bagels and snacks. Loved the Barking Dog next door and the hotel staff was just as wonderful as everyone has said. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Just okay! Like so many others, I booked this hotel on the back of the rave reviews on this site. On the plus side, the rooms were certainly large and the hotel staff were pleasant. They moved us to a much higher room after our first night which was great.On the down side, the hotel and the room were a bit shabby - chipped paintwork and dated decor. It was really only just okay.The sofa bed was right in front of the door of the suite making entering a little tricky - makes me think that the furniture was not that well planned for the space. The bathroom was disappointing - I expected towelling robes at a hotel of this quality and the products were average. Like most hotels, the towels were too small.The spa was okay - no magazines provided in the relaxation area. My masseur was brilliant though.Location is pretty good although not much to do at night in the immediate vicinity. I could have done with more to do suggestions in the hotel guide to help choose a local restaurant.Barking Dog was pretty good although the outside area was shabby and pretty grubby.Fine if you want a large spacious room in New York but don't expect luxurious accommodation.

<Content>superbe service and great value! We stayed three nights in Affinia Dumont. Check in was effeicient and we got a high floor studio with a lovely view. Room was very spacious with a full kitchen and large fridge. I was very impressed as the hotel is non smoking and it smelled fresh as soon as you walk into the lobby. Very helpful and friendly staff , especially door men Chris! Much better than the Radisson Martinique where we stayed before at twice the price! Will be back!

<Content>It's as good as it gets! We stayed at Affinia Dumont NYC is July and it was a fantastic pick. We couldn't ask for more! The room was spotless and the hotel staff was the best! Be sure to tip them well and leave your left-over subway cards if you still have money left on them.We liked the Barking Dog restaurant for breakfast and a happy hour beer later in the day.

<Content>Good location, try to get a high floor room Stayed here for 5 nights in March - would generally agree with all comments here - the hotel is good value, location is good, rooms are quite large (especially for New York) and the staff are very good.Try to get a high floor - we had a 30+ level south facing room, the room was bright and airy and the views fantastic. Downside is that there isnt a great selection of food stores or restaurants close by.We would definitely stay here again next time we visit NYC.

<Content>Highly recommend Staying in NYC looked like a bit of a minefield, with plenty of scope for spending a lot with little to show for it. Based mainly on other reviews and availability, we booked a room with two doubles to share with our two children and were not disappointed. The room was furnished to a high standard and was scrupulously clean, and the staff were friendly and helpful. Our children were thrilled to be staying in the same street as the Empire State building, and the location is convenient. Although not cheap at $325 a night, I reckon this was good value for NYC and would certainly recommend it.

<Content>Location, location, location..... Took my wife to NYC for here B-day and we got everything we expected from the Dumont; great location, view and comfort. The people at the hotel were very helpful and with the neighborhood, Murray Hill, we were able to get a taste of NY as if we lived there.

<Content>A bit dissapointing After all the amazing reviews this hotel recieved on Tripadvisor we were really expecting this to be a great place to stay. We booked in for three nights a fimlay of five. The first disapointment was that we booked a limo through the hotel to pick us up as a surprise for our children. The excitement at the airport was great, but the limo... never arrived. After several phone calls we were eventually picked up an hour late in a pick up which cost the same price! They claim the limo was in a crash that morning, but judging by the phone conversations we overheard on our journey into New York, we were not the only ones who had been let down.When we arrived we had requested a high floor but were given a room on the 4th floor. We asked for something higher but were told in the week of 4th July there was no chance and bascially forget it. The staff did say they could have a look again the next day but as we were only staying 3 nights it wasn't worth it. This meant we had a very dark and very noisy room as you are so close to the road that the noise goes on all night.The room itself was very large and this is why i think it rates so highly among others on this site. You really couldn't complain about the size of the suite or the location of the hotel which was walking diatance to the sights. But the room was dirty. The floors in particular needed a really good steam clean and there were stains everywehere. Now maybe we just got a bad room but this was dissapointing.All in all if you are looking for space and location I would recomend, but donlt have too high an expectation based on high ratings here.

<Content>Highly Recommended the Affinia Dumont We decided to book the Affinia Dumont, after reading MANY hotel reviews for NYC. We spent 5 nights there with our 7-year old son. My husband took the train each morning to work-related meetings in NJ. My son  I spent our days exploring NYC. This was our 1st time in the city and we had no problem figuring out the subway/transportation system and had an absolute blast! I am a very picky traveler - I must say the Affinia Dumont was one of the best hotels, overall, that we have ever stayed in. We had been warned about the size of hotel rooms in NYC, but our room at the Affinia Dumont was by no means small. There was ample storage space, which enabled us to unpack for the entire week. The full kitchen in our room was over-the-top!! We did some grocery shopping a few steps away, which enabled us to eat in for several meals. It was relaxing to wake up and not have to worry about getting dressed to go out 1st thing in the morning. If we wanted to grab a quick lunch or snack...it was at our fingertips! Our 1st day in NYC brought rain. My husband took the complimentary umbrella in our room, for his morning commute. The Bell Hop was quick to offer my son  I umbrellas for our day out. Which brings me to my next comments - kudos to the absolutely WONDERFUL Bell Hop and front desk attendants. They were exceptionally friendly and very, very helpful. We brought along a portable DVD player, but forgot cables to connect it into the TV in our room. My husband went to the front desk to see if we could get cables; the front desk attendant sent a technician up to our room within minutes with a DVD player. He connected it and made certain it worked before he left. I also made use of the fitness center, which was also very well-equipped. There is also a self-service laundry, which came in handy, on the basement floor. We would most definitely stay again at the Affinia Dumont!! The rooms were fantastic and the staff was outstanding!!

<Content>Not as good as I expected I stayed at the Affinia with my husband and 14 year old daughter at the beginning of July for 5 nights and our experience wasn't as positive as many others posted on TripAdvisor. We had a room on the 8th floor with very little natural light which meant the room was quite dark even during the day. When we asked to be moved we were told that the hotel was full and it wouldn't be possible but we later discovered that there were free rooms on upper floors. Our room was a reasonable size but the bathroom was small and although the kitchen was useful it did need to be upgraded. I was particularly disappointed to discover that many items in our minibar selection were past their use by date and I hope that by the time you read this that the management will have resolved this problem. On a more positive note the Affinia is good value, there are plenty of places to eat in the area, Bagel de Jour has a vast muffin selection as well as the bagels, and the location of the hotel is good for easy access to many of the main sights. The hotel allowed us and other families the opportunity to watch the fireworks on 4th July from an upper floor room. This gesture was very much appreciated. This room was nicer than ours.

<Content>Great stay in NYC Took the kids to NYC for Spring Break - wanted a place with a suite that wasn't too expensive (I know everything in NYC is). We really enjoyed our stay...clean, convenient, great location, and very helpful staff. Since we have been, they have kept in touch and have offered special deals on a return stay. We go to NYC often and will be back.

<Content>Great Experience at Affinia We were quite pleased with our stay at Affinia Dumont. We arrived early in the morning on the day we were supposed to check in (a Monday) expecting to leave our bags while we toured around. To our great surprise, the staff offered and were able to find us an outstanding room on the 37th floor immediately. We were glad to have to opportunity to have some downtime after the long trip. The views were incredible (included the Chrysler Bldg  East River) and the room was nice, clean and comfortable. The Juice and fresh fruit bowl at the front desk was a nice touch. During our 2-day stay, we walked to the little store a couple of doors down for some light snacks to have after a long day of touring and we started the day with a wonderful meal at the Barking Dog restaurant at the hotel. Affinia Dumont is situated just a couple blocks from the Empire State Building. From the Affinia Dumont, we walked around touring the City. Some of the other sights we saw were: Rockefeller Center, Grand Central Terminal and Time Square. We had a wonderful time and would definitely recommend the Affinia Dumont to friends.

<Content>Affinia great location and value great value and locationaway from noise and chaos of midtownwe had a large suite w/kitchen and always stay here because our daughter's apartment is in Murray Hill.The #6 Lexington line is a short walk and easy connections to other trains. Also close to Grand Central station.small market next door great for stocking up kitchen to eat a few meals in and save $$$. Great sandwiches etc.Staff at hotel all very kind. We checked in at 10am after being up all night on a west coast red-eye flight ,and they were able to get us right into our room for badly needed rest!Lots of great little cafes in the neighborhood to walk to.Great area. Walk to the Morgan Library.Warning, avoid the hotel restaurant. Very bad food, bad service, and overpriced. Lots of other places in the neighborhood to have coffee and breakfast.

<Content>great hotel It was our first time in New York  the Affinia Dumont was a great introduction. After reading many reviews I chose Affinia Dumont, it was a great location on 34th St. as this street is a 2 way street but for New York it wasnt overly busy like around Times Square area. I requested a quiet room  we got a lovely large room, very comfortable queen bed  choice of pillows  most definiately quiet (upper levels). They even allowed us to leave our luggage for 3 days while we went by train to Washington DC  Philladelphia even though we were not staying again when we got back - had already booked their other hotel - Murray Shelburne see my review on this). I also liked having a guest laundry so I could do my own washing often very late at night especially good for those travelling with children. Overall we found this hotel great in every way ps cant comment on the food never ate at the Barking dog. PPS loved having the free refreshing tea at reception available at all times.

<Content>Can't get much better than this I just got back from a three day stay at the Affinia Dumont and the experience was amazing. We were three professional women travelling for a bit of fun and culture. We were not able to check in early, but were upgraded to the fitness suite which was FANTASTIC. The in room sauna was an expecially nice feature. I rarely been in a Manhatten hotel room that had as much floor space as any of the three rooms we had to choose from, all with a spectacular view of the Chrysler Building. The staff was knowledgeable, courteous and extremely helpful. The place was spotless, well appointed and overall a delight. I would recommend the hotel to anyone who wants a little extra space. The location is fabulous too - very close to the Queens Midtown tunnel, so if you are flying to LaGuradia the trip isn't painful at all. Centrally located, easy to catch cabs or transit ... You can't say enough about it

<Content>Exceeded My Expectations I booked this hotel after reading reviews from a few different sites. Later I was surprised to find out that a close friend of mine had stayed here many times on business and was very positive on this hotel. So my expectations were high. My family (5 of us with 3 older boys 24, 23, 16) enjoyed the large rooms. We had two bedrooms with a sofa bed in a separate middle living area, 2 baths, 2 kitchens, 2 desk and 3 very large TV鈥檚 (not flat screens). We all came to NYC for a 4 night vacation. We found the hotel to be very clean and the staff to be very helpful. The fitness was very nice by hotel standards. The elevators are always there 鈥?seemed liked we never waited for more than 30 seconds for an elevator. The Barking Dog bar / restaurant was a great experience. There is a store (with most every thing) on the corner less than 100 yards away - great for stocking up your kitchen and saving a few dollars. The subway is just about a 录 mile away. It is a very nice location to see the city. I will come back.

We enjoyed visiting with the doormen everyday and pleased that they attempted to remember our names. We stayed for four nights in a lovely room that was spotless and so comfortable. If and when we come back to New York, we will certainly stay at the Affinia Dumont.

<Content>Loved THe Dumont!!! My mom and I stayed at the Affinia June 29-July 2nd. We chose our hotel based on reviews from Trip advisor. We were not disappointed!! The hotel is beautiful and the entire staff was extremely helpful. I am a VERY picky person about the bed I sleep in and these were some of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. I had to ask before I left what type of beds, pillows and sheets they used. We never heard one noise all night and it was one of the most comfortable stays I have ever had in a hotel. There was one young Lady her last name was Cortez and she was more than helpful. Everytime we asked her to recommend a restaurant, store or any questions we had she was ready to help. She had the best recommendations and always provided a map. She was SO helpful. So were all the door men and staff. This whole thing made our stay in New York an incredible weekend!!

<Content>My favorite hotel in NYC Have stayed at the Affinia Dumont on numerous occasions, thanks to having originally discovered it thanks to tripadvisor.The location is excellent - there is both north, south and east, west transportation virtually outside the door. The doormen are courteous and helpful, as are the front desk staff.I've always gotten a room on a top floor, in a corner and the view is fabulous. The room itself is large and nicely appointed. They will provide robes upon request. The hotel used to be an apartment building, so there is a small kitchen, which is very handy if one is staying for a few days.The only disclaimer is that they charge for high speed internet.

<Content>Great Location, Average Hotel We stayed at the Affinia Dumont from June 19th through June 27th, 2007. The location of this hotel (34th Street and Lexington Ave) was perfect for my family that includes two teenage daughters. The valets treated you like royalty and were very helpful with directions and suggestions.The fitness room met our expectations - spacious, modern equipment, and ample choices. The downside was there was no swimming pool, no community sauna, and the steam rooms were located inside the mens and womens restrooms.The rooms were spacious and adequately equipped but this definitely was not a five star hotel. Security was good and we felt very comfortable inside as well as outside of the hotel.

<Content>Excellent Just finished a three night stay at the Dumont. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The studio suite was exceptionally spacious and very comfortable. The beds, pillows and comforters were outstanding. We had two adults and two teenagers, so having two queen beds was a big plus. I will definitely stay there again.

<Content>Lived well up to expectations Back home in Scotland after a 5 night stay in NY. We chose this hotel based on reviews on this site and we were not let down. We were assigned a room on the 5th floor with an immediate apology that if we wanted one higher, we could move for the remaining nights of our stay. We opted to do this and the result was a 20th floor view of the 4th July fireworks over the East River.We had a junior suite and this had all the room we needed and more. Granted the bathroom is on the small side but it was good enough. The staff were helpful when required making arrangements for holding our luggage and arranging a car to the airport on the day of our departure.I have no hestitation of recommending this hotel assuming that you have read the facilities and made sure it meets your needs.

<Content>a flawless stay in NewYork We had a wonderful stay at this Hotel over the Independence Day holidays.Our major pre-requisite to staying anywhere is - cleanliness. This Hotel was immaculate: clean surfaces, crisp towels and bedding, spotless common areas and bathrooms. 10 / 10.Next: location. Again , wonderful: a 10 minute stroll to the Empire State Building (go early in the morning and avoid the queues), and then another 10 minutes onto Maceys. Even central park and the sumptious shops of 5th avenue are walkable - although it can take an hour at a mild pace! Times Sq  Broadway Theatres are maybe a 25 minute walk (or a $10 cab). We saw Spamalot - it was hilarious; our teenage kids, who hadn't even heard of Monty Python beforehand, are still chortling days later!Staff at the Hotel were always pleasant, and the tip from the bell hop that the best place to watch the fireworks would be from our bedroom was spot on - we had a fab view.Room service was brilliant: good quality food, promptly served and very reasonably priced. Again: faultless.Our rooms were brilliantly appointed: good size en-suite, nice spacious lounge and well spec'd kitchen all help make this a wonderful stay.The small housekeeping problems we had (faulty lights) were dealt with within an hour of our mentioning them to the front desk.Finally, there's a 24 hour drug store opposite the hotel, which is brilliantly convenient.All in all, our stay here was beyond our expectations. The Hotel was reasonably priced especially given the quality of the service we received and we look forward to staying here again.

<Content>Impressed Traveler This hotel was selected for our anniversary based on the reviews submitted on Trip Advisor. After going through AAA travel, I was sold on and anticipating the stay in the Affinia. From the moment we arrived and was welcomed by the Valet, I felt like it would be a good experience. The front desk staff was friendly and very helpful. The housekeeping staff was very accommodating and the valets continuously opened the entrances doors when they saw us coming  going and asked if we needed assistance with anything. The exercise area/spa was the cleanest and most pleasant smelling area. All the niceties were there if you needed them, which was a good thing.The room was large and spacious as a suite as well as the mattress was so comfortable. The only thing that was somewhat inconvenient was needing ice and waiting for someone to bring it up to the room ( It took sometimes 5 -10 minutes to get to the room). All in all, it was a great hotel.

<Content>It's better than perfect. (Theo, age 8) First of all, this hotel has an exellent locaation. The Empire State Building and The Chrysler Building are just block away!!!!!!!!!  You can watch television in the elevator while riding in it. The rooms are exeptionally clean and the staff friendly without being cheesy. The rooms are also very nice. They include a C.D. player, 2 comfortable king-size beds, 1 kitchen, 1 bathroom, a large T.V., and a work desk, and everything you might want with a hotel. I wouldn't be surprised if it was hotel best with everything in N.Y.C.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Content>Wonderful Hotel Stayed here at the end of June for 5 nights and thoroughly enjoyed it. The reason we picked this hotel was that we wanted a spacious room and we certainly got it. We were very happy. The staff were so helpful, we just wish all hotel staff were so nice. It really makes your holiday to know that nothing is too much trouble for them. One little minus point is that one of the 'f's' in the Affinia sign outside the hotel is at an angle. This is a very small point but I think it needs to be rectified because it gives the impression of a second rate hotel which it certainly isn't.

<Content>Great hotel; fab location! Just returned from a weeks stay in the Affinia Dumont and we were delighted with the location of the hotel and the friendliness of the staff. The rooms are large by NYC hotel standards with the kitchen an added bonus. The real beauty of the Affinia is its location, 10 min walk to Macys, Empire State, subway 5 min and a great variety of bars  restaurants in the immediate vacinity. We were definately impressed with the Affinia and plan to stay there again on our return to NYC. If there was one thing I was not pleased with its that I had contacted the hotel in advance to request a high room. However we were disappointed to discover that we were in a lower floor  were not given the option to change during our stay. The receptionist merely shrugged his shoulders when we asked. I had explained in the email that this trip was a special occasion  it would have been nice to see our request had been dealt with.However, this did not affect our stay too much  overall we were delighted with the rest of the staff of the hotel who went out of their way to be helpful particularly the door staff.

<Content>Hospitality? None Better! What a wonderfully pleasant hotel to stay in. I don't believe I've felt more comfortable at any other hotel. The staff consistently accomodate you from the second you pull up to the hotel. If you are looking for a hotel with warm, inviting smiles and a positive, gracious attitude you will find none better than the Affinia Dumont. Great for families! Rooms are very nice and spacious with a small kitchen sufficiently appointed. Markets, restaurants, pharmacies, etc. are all within the immediate area and all are reasonably priced (as prices go in NYC). I leave today after staying here for a week and I have never been more at ease. The hotel has even accomodated our late departure today by allowing us a late check out time as well as keeping our luggage and allowing us to remain in their very relaxing lobby. At no time have I felt rushed or pushed out. Kudos to the Affinia chain and the Dumon'ts incredible management and staff. Thank you for making our first experience in New York just a little bit better. Great City, great hotel, extraordinary staff! Additionally I must acknowledge tbe restaurant next door to the Affinia, The Barking Dog. Equally as pleasant and accomodating as its hotel neighbor.

<Content>Fantastic Stay My wife and I honeymooned in New York and used the high marks from tripadvisor as a factor in choosing the Affinia Dumont. The high marks were well deserved. We were always warmly greeted by the bell hops, they even learned and remembered our names. We asked for a higher room on our first day and by our second we were given a room on the 29th floor. It is about two blocks from a subway station and near a number of decent restaurants. The cab fare to Times Square/Theater District ranged from $8-15 depending on traffic. We would definitely stay again when back in New York City.

<Content>The best choice in NYC This is the best hotel in NYC in my opinion. Although it is not in the Times Square area one can get there in about 15 min by taking the 6 train from 33rd/Park ave. one stop to Grand Central Station and the Times Square shuttle one stop to 7th avenue. This hotel is a few blocks from the Queens Midtown tunnel which makes for an easy arrival and return from LGA.The Affinia Dumont has very comfortable beds and provides hypoallergenic bedding if needed. The staff is very pleasent and the door staff always welcome you back upon your return. I particulary like the fact that having a small lobby means you do not have to traverse through a crowd to get to the elevators and up to your room. I highly reccomend the Affinia Dumont

<Content>A great hotel! I recently stayed at the Affinia Dumont Hotel on 34th street from June 7-10 while having a girls trip to NYC! This was all of our first trip to NYC and I was designated to find and book the hotel. I searched TripAdvisor and ultimately booked at the Affinia Dumont based on reviews I read. I have to tell you that it was perfect in every way! Perfect location in terms of walking to the Empire State Building, shopping on 5th Avenue and Broadway and about a 20 minute walk to Times Square! The accomodations we had were excellent! We booked a suite and were very happy with the room, cleanliness and decor as well as the service from all the staff there! I would definitely stay there again and in fact intend to book at this hotel any time I am in the city!

<Content>great hotel hotel welcoming after a harassed trip from airport iced tea and fresh fruit .( had checked trip adviser before booking and other comments were correct.) We had a studio with a view to the chrysler building room very comfortable . barhroom is small but who wants a big bathroom when the bed and room is large loved getting back after site seeing knowing there was a nice cold drink in fridge or a fresh tea . the deli near was great for fresh provision for breakfast. spent some time in the barking dog adjacent and bar staff excellent only when busy ,waitresses got a bit disorganised. will go back and will recommmend to friends etc nearly forgot all staff in hotel pleasant and helpful

<Content>Affinity with the Affinia Dumont! I hate to be one to follow the crowd, but the glowing reviews here are all spot on! My wife and I have just stayed at the Affinia Dumont for 5 days as part of our honeymoon and it exceeded our expectations on every level. Considering we'd been desperate to go to New York for years (this was our first time there) that's no mean feat!Having mentioned our honeymoon when making the booking, on arrival (early check-in) we rocketed up to the 24th floor and found we'd been upgraded to a large suite with kitchen, king bed and an amazing view over midtown Manhattan (including the Chrysler Building!). The room was spacious and incredibly well designed/furnished - a true slice of NY chic. They even provided us with a surprise complimentary bottle of champagne and a note of congratulations! The staff were friendly and attentive throughout our stay, helping us without a moment's delay when we asked for an international plug adaptor, looked like we needed a cab, or stored our luggage for 8 hours after checking out (we had a late flight home). This customer-focussed approach extended to staff at the excellent Barking Dog bar/restaurant next door, who also provided Room Service for the hotel. The portions were immense, but that's NY for you!The hotel's central location is a major plus point. Sat towards the east end of 34th St (a major shopping street as it turns out), several key sights/streets are within easy reach, with a subway station just one block away for getting to those attractions further afield. It's even on the same street as the Empire State Building and Macy's!To sum up, we were hugely impressed by the Affinia Dumont and would certainly consider staying there again. Having travelled a fair bit in recent years, I can tell you that hotels of this type/price don't come much better!

<Content>Great location, excellent hotel Myself and my wife travelled from the UK and this was our first visit to New York . I booked this hotel on reviews that I had read on Tripadvisor. We were not disappointed, this is an excellent choice.The Affinia is in a fantastic location. Easy walking distance to Empire State, Macy鈥檚, Grand Central Station. In fact you can comfortably walk to Times Square but it was so hot whilst we were there, this was like torture.There are many Delis, Caf茅s  Restaurants nearby so you don鈥檛 have to stray far for food. The Murray Hill market is just next door and they make great hot  cold sandwiches 24/7. This shop is well stocked for just about everything 鈥?except wine. You need to travel a little further if you want a nice relaxing bottle for your room.The check-in at Affinia was smooth and very friendly. We had reserved a Junior Suite and when I mentioned to the girl at the check in that we would like a good view of Manhattan she immediately swapped us to an end room, where you get a two sided view. This was no problem, and no extra cost. We were on floor 25 so were above many of the buildings in the neighbourhood. On entry the room was very clean and had been well prepared. There are IMHO a couple of minor niggles with this type of room, but we will get to them later. The view of the Manhattan skyline was fantastic. The facilities of the room were excellent with a handy well equipped kitchen, big bathroom and comfortable King bed and living space. This all made for a very relaxing stay. However I thought that the room was set up more for a business traveller than a holiday stay. The wardrobe was tiny and nowhere near fitted our clothes. Bearing in mind that this stay was part of a 3 week North American trip we had a lot of stuff with us. I use hotels for business all the time and the space was quite adequate for a short business trip. The business theme is further enhanced by a large double desk and office chair. Again, this is fine for business but not much use for us. Just takes up room. I realise that the Affinia has to cater for both markets, that is why the room was set up like this. The only other niggle was a very efficient but noisy AC unit. Boy, did we use this as it was 90F on some of the days. When the AC unit was on it was noisy and we left it on all night. This may have troubled a light sleeper, but not us.The hotel staff are top notch. They are very friendly and knowledgeable and will offer help and advice on any matter that you care to ask. They do not fuss, which is also good. The doormen are so helpful and will flag down taxis or book you a town car at a moments notice. They have full internet access at a PC in the lobby 鈥?you have to pay. They also have internet available on the in room T.V.鈥檚 and also wireless connection.The hotel is very clean and the cleaners are a real friendly bunch who always chat to you. The standard of room cleaning every day was first class.As for food, we ate breakfast most days at Austin鈥檚 Caf茅, which I can recommend. This is left out of the Affinia, across the street and then up , about a block and a half towards the Empire State. Lots of choice here, from breakfast sandwiches, omelettes to vegetarian and freshly sweezed juices. The staff here are pleasant and can understand an English accent, which we found was a rare skill in NYC. The Barking dog restaurant (next to Affinia) was another story. They employ pleasant young eastern European girls for FOH and waitress but they just do not understand enough English. We were all laughing trying to communicate. They understand the American accent and phrases fine but not English. When I ordered a draught beer, they were confused. When I mentioned 鈥淪tarter鈥? 鈥淢ain Course鈥?they had no idea what I was talking about. They only know what it says on the menu. Appetizer and Entrees. We ate there on the first night and even with the language issue we had a nice meal. Our Russian waitress was very polite and eager to learn and we taught her a little English on the fly.The second occasion(our last night) was a different story. It was very busy, the Romanian waitress spoke poor English and did not write the order down. You can imagine what happened next. My starter (er Appetizer) arrived after 20 mins wait and then the Main Course arrived straight after. I had to sit there and finish my starter looking at my steak going cold. The Main Course was only luke warm so it had been stood a while. I complained to the waitress saying that I had never before had a Main Course delivered whilst eating the starter. 鈥淩eally?鈥?she replied and smiled. Probably didn鈥檛 understand me. These issues could all be solved with decent staff training, which obviously doesn鈥檛 happen. An altogether unsatisfactory visit.Room service is another story and we used this only once to eat and they were quick and efficient.Another good help is that the Affinia will arrange a town car to pick you up at the airport. You pay the driver direct, either cash or card, and it is only around $20 more than a yellow cab. This worked great for us as the driver was at JFK to meet us and because all the town cars were out, we got a stretch limo for the same price. You can email the Affinia customer services to book this before you travel. They set it all up.All in all a great trip and a great stay at the Affinia. We were sad to leave and will definitely return before too long.

<Content>fabulous hotel, great price for NYC We just stayed for 5 days, my wife and I, our daughter, and two of our daughter's friends (all 13). We had a two bedroom suite. The rooms were fabulous: large, excellent amenities, clean, etc. Staff was fabulous and helpful in all things. (Once the girls clogged a toilet and they were up to fix it within 15 minutes. Another time they ran bandaids up to us to deal with a small cut.) for NY the cost was really low. 2300 for the four nights, much more on the weeknights. Under 400 for the weekend nights, for a large living room, kitchen, bath, and separate bedroom, attached by a door to another studio suite with king bed, office area, kitchen and bath. We plan to stay here whenever we are in NYC.

<Content>Loved Affinia Dumont! My best friend and I did a girls weekend June 7-10 for our first trip to New York. We booked a room with the Affinia Dumont, based on the reviews at Trip Advisor.Boy, were we pleased! We arrived around 1, and we had a couple special requests with our room, so we knew it wouldn't be ready, and that was fine. There are a lot of things to do and a few resturaunts around the corner on 3rd, so we had pizza while we waited.Our room was fantastic! Huge by most hotel standards. The shower was great and the beds were AMAZING. After walking around New York for hours and hours, it was a treat to come back to our hotel and enjoy the comfortable beds and pillows.The staff was more than helpful throughout our stay, they were very educated about the area, and recommended which trains to take where, and we had no problem going around the city. They also recommended a few restaurants and we were pleased with their suggestions.On our last day there, I ordered take out from the Barking Dog (a restaurant next door) and loved the food. The manager was really nice and gave me a free soda for picking it up. I thought that was a nice gesture.

<Content>A wonderful experience Booked a junior suite for one week in May based very much on the reviews on Tripadvisor. This was our first visit to NY so we were anxious to make sure that our hotel was comfortable and well located. Boy, were we not disappointed!Hotel staff are so polite and helpful and nothing seems to be too much trouble for them. The front desk staff in particular are just great.The room was on one of the higher floors and took in a corner of the hotel giving us amazing views of the city - uptown to the Chrysler Building and out over the East River. Hotel location was perfect and just a block away from the nearest subway and 2/3 blocks from the Empire State Building. I would recommend this hotel to anyone, especially the Junior Suites.The Murray Hill Diner just round the corner from the hotel served us great breakfasts all week (apart from one day we ate at Sarabeth's on South Central Park which was excellent) We tried to eat at restaurants mentioned in the guides and on Zagat.com and were not disappointed once.A great holiday, a great city and a wonderful hotel.

<Content>Affinia is great...great...great! First off, I just wanted to say that I booked the Affinia Dumont off of the reviews I read on here. Almost all of the reviews were great. My first impression of this hotel was fantastic. The lobby was bright and colorful, and the doorman greated us every time were came into the hotel. The front desk staff was really helpful and friendly, except for one thing I will talk about later. The hotel even has a computer to print out boarding passes free of charge. You can also pay to IM or email. Free iced tea and fruit was available on the front desk. The elevators, despite the 37 floors went really fast. I stayed for a weekend and every time I used the elevator to the 31st floor, I did not stop on any other floor. I was amazed by this. The spa looked very nice, but I did not use the services. They have guest laundry in the basement with a vending machine. My room was excellent. It was a studio suite on the 31st floor, #3102. It was way bigger than any other NYC hotels. I loved the kitchen, very convienient for a weekend. We kept our leftover food and pizza there, along with beverages and milk for coffee. Our coffee pot was hard to use though, becuase we had a hard time getting the pot off. We did no cooking, but it was convienient. The beds were very comfortable. We had two queens and ordered pillows off the pillow menu, I ordered a hypo allergenic. There was a nice big desk to do work, or store your travel papers and all of your shopping buys. The tv was nice and big. The air kept it nice and cool, although we broke the front using it. The hotel even had a safe. There was a large closet and many drawers in the hallway as you entered the suite. That was where the safe was. We also forgot our code to the safe, so we had to call the front desk for somebody to come up and unlock it. The bathroom was also very big, a nice shower and sink. There was even a telephone in the bathroom. The Aveda products were a nice compliment. The hotel hasan Affinia Fresh promotion where they give you toothpaste, razors, mouthwash, eye solution, etc. free of charge. The location was very nice in Murry Hill. Nice on the east side close to Macys and the Empire State Building. There was a Murry Hill Market right next to the hotel. They sold convienence items and really nice flowers outside that were extremely cheap. We would have bought so many, except we flew into JFK. We found that walking everywhere was the best way to get around, but if you are tired of walking, then take a taxi. They were really cheap to the hotel and very fast. We took the bus twice, but we waited a while for the to come around, and waited more to try to find out what bus to take. We booked the City Sights NY tour (The Blue Buses) and took the tour of downtown. They picked us up at the Empire State Building, about 4 blocks west. Also Macys is a stop where you could catch the bus. The tour guides were very nice and helpful on the buses. We saw the bigger sights of NYC like Rockefeller Center and Ellis Island/Statue of Liberty and all of the neighborhoods like Little Italy and Chinatown (Hated Chinatown). The negative thing about the hotel was that we booked through hotels.com and it was $162. The hotel tried to charge us $212. We fought for an hour and called hotels.com and we called hotels.com and they were very helpful and got us the $162 price. Then we paid, and the women at the front desk tried to not give us a reciept. Other than this minor price problem, the hotel was nice. I would definatly stay here again, but the only other hotel I would stay at is the Sheraton in Times Square, because it looked nicer, and about the same standard regular price as this hotel. I would stay were again because of the rooms and amenities.

<Content>This place is Fantastic! Everything it was cracked up to be and more! Commence with the rambling.... Got an early check in and late check out. People were all very friendly and helpful. The location was excellent close to lots of restaurants and the subway to get you anywhere. It was in a neighborhood where people live and walk their dogs which made us felt very safe. The bed was SOOOO comfortable and the shower....the shower. Best shower EVER!!! It's worth the price of admission alone. The place was sparkling clean. They let us use the spa to freshen up since we had a late flight. You're able to print your boarding passes at their computer in the lobby. Nice fruit and iced tea at the front desk. What was most amazing was the fact that this hotel was about the same price as some very dumpy places, which will remain nameless. Highly recommend; would definitely love to stay here again.

<Content>great hotel and great location We recently stayed at the Affinia Dumont for a family vacation - 11 of us - it was a great choice. The two bedroom suite was great and slept 7-8 and a one bdrm suite sleeps 4. The location in Murray Hill is a great part of lower midtown and one block from the 6 train (lexington subway line) that allows you to take the subway anywhere - SoHo, Little Italy, China Town, Times Sq, 5th Ace, Central Park - a GREAT spot. The rooms are well appointed and the kitchen is great - the room is better then most midtown appts!! Too many good restraunts nearby to mention and Rare is a great bar on Lexington.

<Content>As good as ever! Great hotel - we had a top floor room and it had a great view over the city - Last time we stayed we had a room much lower down and didn't have such a good view but this time we got lucky. The rooms are very big by New York standards and altho this hotel is not far east quality (to be fair not many outside the far east are!) its very good, spacious and clean! The staff were always friendly - the doorman very accomodating and helpful and altho I dont believe the Barking Dog is affiliated next door they serve great food and have great staff - highly recommend!

<Content>Great value plus a menu of pillow choices We booked this hotel for a weekend getaway in Manhattan. The location is perfect -- walking distance from all the sights. Our 36th floor room was very large, with a comfortable bed, great view, nice Aveda soaps, and a pillow menu of 5 complimentary pillow choices. Yes, it's a gimmick, but it's unique. We had a kitchen, but didn't get to use it because there are so many nice restaurants nearby. The front desk staff were very good. I called ahead and arranged for champagne in our room on arrival, and the concierge took care of it and added a fruit plate too!One problem we had was that 3 movies appeared on our bill, but we didn't even use the TV. (Who wants to watch tv on a weekend in Manhattan!) 2 of them were before 8am on Saturday, when, of course, we were asleep. It took an unfortunate amount of pleading with the desk and skeptical looks from the staff before they removed them from the bill -- it wasn't a nice way to leave, feeling as though they didn't believe us.Overall, I'd come back here. Expensive yes, but given the competition in New York, I think this place offers great value for your money.

<Content>very nice hotel We stayed at his hotel for 3 days at the beginning of June. Since there were 5 of us, we booked the 2 bd, 2 bth suite, and we were very pleased. It is an extremely clean hotel, the staff is friendly, and the location is decent (it's about 4-5 blocks from the Empire State Bldg). I cannot say enough good things about the room. It was a 2 bd apt pretty much, and it had lots of privacy in the bedrooms. Everything about it was very convenient, and we had a view of the Chrysler bldg! The only thing that we did not like was the room service. It was not good. We ordered the first day, but after that steered clear. However, there are a ton of shops right around the place and starbucks 2 blocks down, so it wasn't a problem. Plus, if you wanted to bring carryout back, you can warm it up in the microwave. I would highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Excellent - would stay again! Booked this hotel based on the reviews on Trip Advisor and we were not disappointed.Studio room, the view was fantastic. Room had everything you would need, kitchen was well equipped bed was very comfortable and everything was very clean.The staff were very friendly and helpful.Eat at the Barking Dog a couple of times which was really good - recommend it!. The Murray Hill Deli was excellent for take out bagels,omlettes etc , they had a fantastic choice of food. Starbucks was up in the next block and overall we loved the area, so easy to walk to Times Square, Chrysler Building, Grand Central etc. A central but quiet location and a hotel I would definitely recommend and stay at again.

<Content>A great small hotel On my way home from picking up my daughter at a New England college to head back to the Carolinas we took four days in New York City with my younger 9-year old daughter and a family adult friend. The four of us were extremely surprised to see how roomy and comfortable our two-bedroom suite was!The Affinia really got it right with cleanliness, spaciousness, quietness and bed comfort. These are the most comfortable beds, and what a relief for tired travelers!Check-in was a breeze, the doormen always welcoming and so charming; my daughters LOVED them! Breakfast at the Barking Dog restaurant (adjacent to hotel) was good (have the waffles and fruit) and later at night we had drinks and desserts there too (very good!!) We did not have a very high-level floor(18th) and even though we faced 34th street the room was VERY quiet. Don't complain if you don't have a great view because this hotel offers so very much more in spaciousness, comfort and quiet. Murray Hill is a nice safe residential neighborhood with great little restaurants and also good little grocery stores within a two minute walk. I was so glad I did not choose a hotel on Times Square (I almost did!) because I now realize that you just walk into a mob scene on the square when you come out of a hotel there. It is a constant flow and sea of humanity. I would not have wanted to start or end my day with my family this way. This will be my only hotel choice when we return to spend some time in the Big Apple again. We recommend this without hesitation!!

<Content>Fantastic Stay! As travelers to New York for the first time - we booked this hotel solely on the reviews listed here. My daughter's dream vacation was to travel to New York - (a college graduation gift)The Affinia Dumont exceeded our expectations. Staff was upbeat, friendly, and helpful. Our room was large, clean and the beds were fantastic. After a long day of seeing all of New York the thought of a comfortable bed and not to mention the pillow menu choices made all the difference. The deli on the corner was a great place to pick up breakfast items as the kichenette had a refridgerator, microwave, coffee maker and stove - with all the cooking and eating utensils. The room was quiet and we noted how good it smelled when we arrived. ( usually I pack a travel candle to freshen the room - needless to say it didn't leave my suitcase!) We do plan on re-visiting New York and we WILL book our stay at the Affinia Dumont. I would highly recommend this hotel for your stay while in New York

<Content>Fantastic! A truly fantastic place to stay, especially for the price we paid (less than $200 by booking far in advance on the hotel's website. Prices went up significantly closer to our date of stay). The fabulous staff let us check in at 8 am, which was SO appreciated after a red-eye flight, and when there was a slight problem with our key, they sent up a bottle of wine to compensate us for the whole 5 minutes we spent with the bad key! That was above and beyond what was necessary. Our room also had a nice view, which I didn't expect, but since the hotel isn't buried in a sea of skyscrapers, I think most upper level rooms would have a view.Everyone else has raved about all of the things I would rave about, so I'll mention some different stuff. First, I loved the location. It was close to a subway line so getting around was easy. It was in a nice neighborhood-Murray Hill-rather than in an overly touristy location like Times Square (not an Olive Garden or TGIFriday's in sight here!). The location made it very easy to get to the Lower East Side or Greenwich Village by cab for going out for dinner/drinks at night-it was a way cheaper and faster cab ride than if we'd stayed in the heart of Midtown. It was also easier to get up to the shopping of Midtown East or the Upper East Side. You can walk to Penn Station. The rooms have kitchens, and there is a great little market just a few doors down where you can buy groceries. For breakfast, skip the hotel restaurant, but go to Daniel's bagels, just a few blocks north on 3rd. They make egg sandwiches and all sorts of bagels, and it's a real locals place to go.I will definitely stay here again, even if I have to pay much more for the room.

<Content>What an amazing hotel! While in town for the night with colleagues representing TripAdvisor.com at the 11th annual Webby awards I was delighted to stay at the Affinia Dumont. Upon arriving in the room, it was so massive I at first did not notice the small kitchen enclave located near the living room area. Wow!I must admit I hadn't been in such a fine hotel room before. The bedroom was massive with really really fine lighted closets and an in-closet safe. There was a wall-mounted tv in the bedroom, and another tv in the living area along with a nice office space and Aeron chair.Although everything seemed quite perfect, i must admit i was a bit surprised by the bathroom! There were so many hand rails in the shower/tub area along with two movable mirrors (one outside of the shower, and one inside) that i felt like i was some metal cattle prodding area. =/I didn't stay in the room more then a couple hours altogether, but I'd love to stay there again. The view outside the room isn't much too look at, but the decor inside is quite nice. If you're willing to check out the room - it is room 501. I had a friend stay on the 35th floor and his view of the river was spectacular (he had a corner suite). Very nice!

<Content>Why go elsewhere? As a suburbanite who indulges in overnight NYC stays, I have tried at least 25 Manhattan hotels. While I ordinarily prefer a location in the west 'fifties, I got a very fair price for the Affinia Dumont on Expedia, and based on other Trip Advisor reviews, we decided to try it for my husband's birthday weekend. I will from now on always try this hotel first! The staff were uniformly friendly and helpful. The room (on the 34th floor) was very roomy by NYC standards. The bed was comfortable, and there was even a pillow menu one could use. The full kitchen was so convenient for storing odd items we picked up en route to the hotel at the Grand Central food hall, and for making morning tea and coffee with real (as opposed to powdered) milk. We had a fabulous view of the Chrysler building lit up at night. The look was fresh and contemporary. I must mention that when I booked I mentioned that this was for a birthday weekend and requested a quiet room. Imagine how surprised we were to find a welcoming note directing us to an ice cream cake in the freezer! We found that it was a short, four dollar cab ride to the theater district, which certainly made this un-touristy (for museums and theater, anyway) location perfectly convenient. I can't imagine why one would choose to pay two or three times as much elsewhere. Great lodgings!

<Content>Excellent!!! We have been to New York several times, but Affinia Dumont is the best we have stayed by far. We got a two-bedroom suite on 27th floor with a magnificent view of the Chrysler Building. The room was spacious and clean. The hotel staff was very helpful. Breakfast at the Barking Dog caf茅 near the hotel is convenient.The Murray Hill neighborhood is quiet and has many restaurants. There is a grocery store nearby which opens 24 hour. We really enjoyed the whole experience and cannot wait to go back again!

<Content>Fanastic , Wonderful and Simply the Best !! England Travellers What can I say from the moment we arrived at the Affinia Dumont i knew i was going to the love the place. Reception was lovely and check in was easy . The receptionist knew from my emai that this holiday was for my husband as we were celebrating his 40Th birthday. We had a room with a view being on the 30th floor room number 3004. Once wev entered our room the first thing i said was WOW it was wonderfully BIG, clean and perfect. My husband had a card and bottle of wine for his birthday which we had not expected . The location was great easy 10 - 15 mins walk to Macys and other shops. You can use the subways safely with no hassle. We even walked to Times Square which is further so wear good walking shoes. The people love our English Accent and we loved theirs as well. The Barking Dog next door to the Affinia was great maybe a dollar or so more than Murray Hill but i would say they are both the same. The portion sizes are really big so only ate half the amount but the food taste so nice you want to eat it all. ( i was trying not to over eat as you could easily do it ). We went to see Color Purple with Fantasia from American Idol the show was outstanding a must to see if you have ever seen the film. The BUS Tours are great as you can hop on and off but mostly good for sight seeing. We went to a Baseball game which was more for my husband who loves sport. If you intend to go to Ground Zone I would suggest you stay on the Tour Bus as there really is not anything to see as it is hidden with a covered fence which surrounds it so you can not see anything. Visit the Empire State Building at night you get to see the city all lit up. The bus tour at night to Brooklyn was good and everywhere is lit up but take a cardigan or jacket as it is very breezy up the top at night. As a suggestion get some New York passes as you get into alot of attractions for free and this will save you loads of money .  Anyway go to the Affinia Dumont you will not be disappointed and use common sense as your safety and you will not go wrong. The Reviews are the best thing to go by and I made the right choice to stay. Donald at the door was a good help for information great guy.

<Content>My Affinity for the Affinia The Affinia Dumont is a great hotel in a great location. I am from New York and go to NYC at least once a year, and I will definitely stay at the Affinia Dumont again (I stayed 12 nights this time). The hotel lobby is quaint and well-decorated, and you can listen to iPods built into the lobby chairs. Everybody is very friendly and they are always telling you to Be Well, which is their slogan. There is so much to do on 3rd Ave. and everything is easily accessible from the hotel. I stayed in a 2 room suite with my father. He had a nice room with a King bed, and I slept on a very comfortable Queen pullout. The room was just under 600 sq. feet, and it had a kitchen with everything you need (stove, dishwasher, frig, etc.). The room was definitely a converted apartment because I felt like I was at home the whole stay. The one downside, and it is very, very minor, is that I had to share a bathroom. I used the kitchen sink sometimes to brush my teeth, etc. We had a nice room with a view of the East river, and there were TVs in both rooms. The one channel that is missing on the TV is Bloomberg TV, which I believe is a necessity for business travelers. That's subjective. The maids were very friendly and attentive and our rooms were always spotless. The manager, Dave, is a very nice guy, and he made a our stay great. On the 2nd level, there is a Fitness and Spa, which have everything you need. I worked out a few times and it was perfect. Each treadmill/elliptical has its own TV screen. All in all, I had a great time at the Affinia (difficult to say since I am a Hilton Honors member - I have stayed at the Doubletree Suites, The Waldorf and the Millennium Hilton, and although the Hilton rooms are great, they are not as good as the Affinia in my opinion.) I am going to find out if the Affinia Dumont has a rewards program because I would like to stay there again and again...Seth

<Content>A good option but not cheap The hotel has a pleasant midtown location (34th between Lexington and 3rd Avenues). The area immediately near the hotel is pretty uninteresting but it seemed safe to me.The #6 train is about 5 minutes walk away, the Empire state building about 10 minutes and Macys about 15 minutes.The staff were very courteous and helpful. The hotel has a gym and spa if you like that kind of thing.What I liked was the well equipped kitchen which allowed us to make meals, keep cold beer in the room etc. We still went out for meals but it was goos to have somewhere to make snacks and drinks etc.There is a market almost next to the hotel and a pharmacy on the same block.There are cheaper places to stay but then again you could save a lot by preparing meals in your kitchen and maybe just eating out once per day (because you MUST experience eating out in New York)The selection of restuarants near the hotel is not that great (but Jaiya Thai is good) but you are a 10 minute subway ride from the East/West Village, Tribeca, Soho etcEnjoy New York baby!

<Content>I didn't want to leave I loved this hotel so much. The suite was so large and comfortable and clean. I didn't want to leave. I am actually booking a return stay today.I was given a choice of view -- I had a high floor with an incredible view of the skyline featuring the Chrysler Building right there. You could almost touch it.There was a kitchen, a tv in the living room and bedroom (they were old sets, I think to complete the ambiance they should have been flat screen and new). The beds were very comfortable. The bathroom was very large and even had a dressing and ironing area firhg outside. Very clean and modern.The Murray Hill neighborhood is quiet and has many restaurants, it's close to everything I was interested in and I really enjoyed the whole experience.

<Content>First Class The service, location and welcome in this hotel is fantastic. We had booked using [----] and got a brilliant deal even cheaper than quikbook! I emailed the hotel directly to request a large corner roomwith a great view and on arrival thats exactly what we received on the 32nd floor looking directly over to the Chrysler building with fab views of the east river. The room was very large and extremely comfortable and had the biggest bed ever and so comfortable which wasjust what we needed after all the walking. The kitchenette was a bonus - with all you needed: very large fridge, with mini bar inside and a daily supply of tea and fresh coffee, we didnt cook as it wasso cheap to eat out. We went to Eee's Cafe (turn left and cross over outside the hotel and its just over the lights on the right hand side)[----] every morning for the breakfast special egg on anybagel with coffee for $1.95, which was excellent and strictly Kosher and altogether so much nicer that Starbucks!!! We also bought fresh fruit for morning at the Murray Hill Deli on the corner.The staff at the Dumont were very friendly and courteous arranging taxis for us and providing us with maps for our stay. The Affinia is 5 mins from the Empire State Building and about 10 mins from Maceys.It is situated in a residential area just off Lexington Ave (near Opus Dei Headquarters - Da Vinci Code !!and was really safe and and pleasant to walk around during the day and in the evening. We would definately recommend this hotel and will stay again when we decide to visit New York . Stay at the Affinia you will not be dissapointed!!!

<Content>best we've stayed in new york It's very clear that the staff and management really care, so rare these days. We were extremely pleased with the room, the view, the service, the attitude of the staff, all of them! This is the kind of service we always want, but rarely get. The beds were comfortable, rooms, including bathroom, clean. The little amenities in the room brought a smile to my face....the disposable camera, the yoga cards--it's clear that someone was really thinking about what the guest might want. We also enjoyed having breakfast brought up from the Barking Dog next door, the quickest room service ever! However, what was advertised as a 200 calorie breakfast had bacon and more added on. (But perhaps they have discovered that what people order is not what they really want!)We would return here in a minute. For the price, it was a real bargain. We had a corporate discount so did not pay the full advertised rate. Location was perfect too. Always a taxi passing by with the Metro stop just a block up the street.

<Content>Fabulous Affinia Dumont The service, location and welcome in this hotel is fantastic. It was our wedding anniversary and on our arrival a bottle of wine, card and bowl of fruit was there to help us celebrate. The room was very comfortable and the kitchenette was a bonus - not to mention the fantastic view from the 33rd floor bedroom window. The staff were very friendly and courteous arranging trips for us and recommending restaurants etc. We had a couple of plumbing problems in our room which were dealt with very quickly. The Murray Hill Diner round the corner from the hotel is great for breakfast too. We would certainly recommend this hotel - we hope we will get the chance to go back again soon!

<Content>No tipping of the hat at Affinia Dumont We arrived a few minutes before midnight and the porter was there to help us but there was no tipping of the hat as I had expected. Although we had been pre-registered there was only one recepcionist wearing an open shirt ... kind of strange for a hotel of this category. I notice the letters of the hotel sign are tilted and thought it may be the style but when I double checked the next morning the sign is kind of rusted and that's the reason the letters are tilted.Big room: The biggest room I ever had in NYC.Kitchinette: Was clean and well stocked . It was missing a cork screw we needed to open a bottle of wine but one was delivered in a timely manner after calling the front desk.Great location: The Barking Dog and deli at the corner are very convenient.Overall , we were NOT impressed by the Affinia Dumont.

<Content>Friendly and charming boutique hotel Long weekend break in this great mid town hotel. Our friends had a room with a view of the chrysler building. Handy for all the midtown attractions and a short walk to the subway. We also found a great little breakfast place the Bagel du jour (turn right from the front door then first right again), popular with locals and a real NYC experience.

<Content>Fab Hotel and Location - Pam, Stockport UK We were recommended The Affinia Dumont by friends and were so glad we stayed there. We stayed for 5 nights and thought the hotel was great. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful and offered great advice on trips and subways etc. Our room was lovely and spacious with a fantastic view of The Chrysler building and the small kitchenette area with fridge was so handy. The rooms are very comfortable and clean with fresh towels and Aveda toiletries each day. We really liked the Murray Hill district as it was away from the main hussle and bussle but within walking to most areas with The Empire State, Macy's and 5th Avenue just 3-5 blocks away. The subways are also close by too. (We stayed in the Upper West during our last stay 3 years ago which was very nice but found we it was so far away we had to get cabs everywhere so loved being able to walk most places this time).The Barking Dog bar and restaurant which is connected to the hotel has a great atmosphere with fab food and staff, we didn't eat breakfast here though as there are so many deli's close by where you can grab a coffee and breakfast.We loved our stay in New York and would definately stay at The Affinia Dumont again.

<Content>Loved the Affinia Dumont We stayed at the Affinia Dumont from Friday May 4th to Monday May 7th. We don't have a single complaint about this hotel. From the moment we arrived we were treated as though it was a priviledge for them to have us stay at their hotel. They couldn't have been more accomodating. Our room and especially the bathroom was very clean (that's a really big thing to us). The bed lives up to its claim as being custom designed, we always felt very rested in the morning. In fact I almost slept better there than in my own bed at home. We didn't take advantage of the fitness room or room service so we can't speak to those issues. It was our first time in New York and we loved it, but after a day of sightseeing it was always nice to return to the less hectic neighborhood of Murry Hill where the hotel is located. Everyday we would stop in at The Barking Dog restaurant attached to the Affinia and get coffee and a lite bite or the fabulous cheesecake. Again, the treatment at The Barking Dog is every bit as welcoming as at the hotel. We would absolutely recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great place to stay We stayed for 7 nights in a Junior suite. Only has positive things to say about the Affinia Dumont -staff were excellent, professional and friendly, the room was spotless and large, bathroom  kitchen were fine for our needs and the king size bed was great.The location on 34th betw. Lex  3rd was excellent - close to drug stores, supermarkets  corner stores and there's a load of great bars  restaurants on 3rd avenue in the 30'sHighly recommended!

<Content>Great location The Affinia Dumont is in a very good location in the Murray Hill area of New York and it is within easy reach of many of the main attractions - only about 4 blocks from the Empire State Building. We chose this hotel following lots of research - particularly the reviews on tripadvisor.com. Overall we were not disappointed as the rooms are very spacious (particularly for New York), the location is very good and the check in/out was very easy and the concierge was excellent. The rooms also had a kitchen area which you don't usually find in New York. The Barking Dog cafe/ restaurant next door served excellent food and we usually had breakfast or lunch in there. The hotel is excellent value for money although the decoration is a little shabby and the lobby area rather dark. However, as long as you are not expecting 4 or 5 star luxury (which you will pay for in New York), you will not be disappointed. Overall there can be no complaints and I would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Not so bad, but not so good . . . You need to look past the hotel's slightly faded decor to appreciate the comfortable beds and spectacular view. The staff were friendly, if not always particularly efficient, and we found the hotel to be wonderfully located - less than a five min walk from the Empire State and less than ten from Grand Central and the Chrysler Building. Our 24th room floor didn't look out to the Empire or the Chrysler, but we did have a wonderful dual view of East River and Lex. I was, however, a little doubtful of the cleanliness; although the bedding and bathroom were clean, the kitchenette looked somewhat neglected and we had to wipe down the counter tops ourselves - not great.Mini-bar and sundries were OUTRAGEOUSLY expensive and not worth it. Pop to the market on the corner and stock up before you use anything there! Also have to second the Murray Hill Diner; gorgeous breakfasts and very reasonably priced. We did not eat at the Barking Dog, but did take in a drink there. We'd stay again, but more for the location that the hotel itself.

<Content>I expected better Affinia Dumond is in Murry Hill, near the Empire State Building, upscale, but not centrally located. It rained throughout our entire trip and cabs were very hard near the theaters so we were stuck. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. I was horrified, however, when I turned back my bed on the first night and found it full of hair. I don't think I'll stay there again. I'd hoped for better.

<Content>Totally Top Shelf Three of us stayed here and we were so pleased with our stay. The room was a one bedroom suite on the 34th floor, overlooking 34th Street. The room was very spacious, super clean, well maintained, and had a great view of the Chrysler Bldg. which was even more beautiful when lit in the evening. The staff was exceptionally accomodating. This room also has a full kitchen set up which was great for early morning and late night snacking.I would most definately stay at this hotel again, and recommend it to you and friends....don't pass it up.....you will be sorry you missed it.Also, very convenient to a 24 hour deli/gourmet store on the corner and some great food on the opposite corner, with restaurants every few feet.....can't wait to go back. Again, don't pass it up!

<Content>Great Hotel Booked this hotel based on the reviews on this site. Couldn't have been more pleased.The staff was very friendly, made sure that we had the maps of the city that we required.There was a slight mixup on the rooms, had booked a king, but it came through as two doubles. The staff were very prompt in sorting it out, gave us a king on the 37th floor. Very nice views of the city from there.I would recommend it to anyone looking for a centrally located hotel.It is a block from the subway line, and within walking distance to the Empire state builidng. We walked up 5th to Central Park - long walk, but we could have taken the subway if we wished. We also took the subway down to Battery Park to visit the Statue of Liberty. Not a bad ride. Everywhere we wanted to be in less than 20 minutes of travel.We would stay there next time we visit NYC.

<Content>Home Away from Home Used Trip Advisor's reviews and this hotel was highly recommended and rightly so! It lived up to all the excellent reviews that it had received. We came for a family vacation over spring break- March 31st to April 6th. We booked a one bedroom suite. My teenage daughterenjoyed sleeping on the pull out couch in the living room area and myhusband, son and I slept in the bedroom with two queen beds. Even before arriving, I contacted the concierge and she was able to help us book tickets to see Wicked. Those tickets are very hard to come by. As promised the tickets were waiting for us when we arrived. We really enjoyed the show! The Wicked show was amazing! Back to the hotel.The staff all seem to take pride in making you feel welcome and go out of their way to be helpful. It is interesting to note thatthe hotel has a poster on the coffee table in the lobby- proclaiming their popularity in Trip Advisor.com and they certainly aim to take wonderful care of you. The hotel was spotlessly clean, sheets fresh every day. We enjoyed wonderful breakfasts at the Barking dog- everything was delicious and usually accompanied by lots of fresh fruit salad. There was some wonderful restaurants close by- we tried the Thai restaurant, a Greek restaurant and Italian. The minimarket close by was very handy. We found we were glad not to by so close to the hustle and bustle of Times Square. We could take a taxi to that area when we needed to be in that area- but found the area near the hotel to be more restful- still busy, but not being swept off your feet busy. We also found our room to be very quiet- could not hear our neighbors at all. Highly recommend this hotel and we would definitely stay here again.

<Content>quiet oasis My husband stayed at the Affinia for our first visit to New York, having chosen it due to good reviews on Trip Advisor.We arrived quite late and were met by a very courteous and friendly reception staff.Unfortunately the pillow menu was all used up and we had to make do with standard, but the next night we had buckwheat and I am now trying to locate one for home!As it was late I did forget to request a high floor and so we had a room on the 13th floor with not much of a view. However as we were out a lot it wasn't an issue.It was remarkably quiet at night.The room was medium size with a kitchen( slightly superfluous to our needs) and a good sized bathroom with large bath.We had a king sized bed that was very comfortable and a large desk. Plenty of cupboard space and loads of hangars.Everything was spotlessly clean with plenty of towels and regularly replaced toiletries.Staff were helpful and provided maps and information.The location was good being a short walk from the subway, and five to ten minutes from Empire State and Macy's. We ate breakfast at the Deli just across the road.I would definately stay here again.

<Content>Great location, great service We stayed here in March 2007. I picked Affinia following an excellent stay in one of their other hotels in NYC. The hotel itself was again at a very high standard. The Service was better here than in the other Affinia, although this isn't to say that the other one was bad, it wasn't. This hotel's service was excellent. The concierge were extremely friendly and their recommendations were spot on. The room was great, plenty of space and as usual very tidy with a lovely decor. The only problem I had here was that although the door that joined us to the room next door had been sealed we could still hear every conversation that our neighbours had. The door might aswell have not been there.We arrived late in the evening and headed straight for the Barking dog cafe next door. They were happy to serve us and the food was excellent.The hotel is in an excellent location and once again the price of the hotel was extremely cheap.Thanks again Affinia.

<Content>definitely can't complain I agree with the other reviews that the hotel was of high quality and service. The front desk (and bellhops) were courteous and helpful. We asked for a top floor room with a view and they definitely satisfied our request.Being a 'fitness-oriented' hotel there was quite the 'fresh' smell that welcomes you everytime you enter. Never used the gym but was well-equipped.Our corner room was spacious with a kitchen, desk and great view. It was clean and orderly with modern furniture. The bed was a bit soft for my liking. The bathroom was more than adequate but starting to show signs of wear and tear. However the water pressure was excellent. The hotel was quiet and never heard any of the neighbors. (maybe I was lucky).The location is good, close to the Empire, 5th Ave etc. Overall it was a great hotel so recommendable to everybody.For any 1st time vistors to NYC that don't know, I highly recommend to book tickets in advance for all tourist related sights and events in order to avoid the long queues you find everywhere. One risks wasting a lot of time waiting in line for tickets if not purchased before hand.

<Content>Roomy oasis Myself, partner and two sons stayed here for five nights 22-27 March. We had a room with a king bed on the 33rd floor and my sons had a twin on the 37th floor. Both rooms had spectacular views, comfortable beds, decent sized bathrooms and well equipped kitchens each with full size cooker, huge fridge freezer,microwave,toaster,coffee maker,pots,pans,dishes etc. Although we did not use these facilities, apart from making the odd cup of tea, a lot of people seemed to be using them. There is a twenty four hour deli a few yards from the hotel and I saw many people arriving back at the hotel in the evening looking exhausted from a day sightseeing with bags from the deli ready just to rustle something up in the room.Also opposite there is a twenty four hour Duane Reade pharmacy where you can get all your toiletries.There are many restaurants and bars within minutes of the hotel making this an ideal base. We will most definately stay here again.

<Content>traveling with 5 month old at the affinia Where do I start? This was the best hotel for kids, we had 4 girls and a baby and managed to fit everyone very spacious. We stayed at a hotel last year and we could not open our suitcases at the same time it was awful. We had a room with a kitchenette and the crib fit perfectly in there. The bathroom was spacious with Aveda products yummy. We were a block from the 6 train which is great. Walking distance to midtown, Macy's, Empire State Building lots of stores along the way. The staff were wonderful and very helpful. They managed to get us into Wolfgang Puck's Steakhouse very last minute on friday night. We could not have loved this hotel more and will definitely stay there again and again.

<Content>Great location restaurant does a lovely breakfast We travelled to NYC for the St Patricks day parade and after a lot of research chose to stay at this hotel. We were not disappointed the rooms were a great size and very clean, all of the services were excellent, we had requested a high floor which we did not get but it was a busy weekend so fair dos, our view was of nothing really except the back of buildings. We did not spend a lot of time in our room so it wasnt a problem.The only thing I would say is that we flew into Newark and asked the hotel to arrange for a limo to pick us up, my 13 year old niece was most upset when we got an suv. We were charged $150 for this excluding tips (a little high we all thought). We had arranged a bus trip for the next morning and had to be at Time Square the next morning for 8.30am, as none of us had a clue where to go we asked the hotel to arrange a taxi for us. Once again we had the same driver who picked us up from the airport in the suv, this journey took at the most 8-10 minutes and is approx 1mile, the charge this time was $50, I was astounded and questioned the price, the driver spoke poor english and we had no choice but to pay. When we returned to the hotel I complained and they were extremly dismissive and advised that this would be correct as it is classed as a town car. Do not use the car service without confirming the price.The barking dog next door to the hotel is amazing warm, cosy, quick and fabulous food we ate breakfast there every morning.

<Content>actually didn't get to stay... I was to stay at this hotel with two friends. We were (supposed to be ) flying from Phoenix AZ. on 3/15/07 on the red-eye- 10:15 pm. Our airline was JetBlue. Our flight was cancelled two hours before the scheduled time.  We called the hotel immediatly to cancel our reservation, and they were unsympathetic. to say the least. Our pleas to the upper managment went un-acknowledged and we were charged for one nights stay. I would love to have stayed at this hotel, but I will not consider the option for future visits. Don't make reservations here if there may be issues out of your control that may have you cancel your reservations/stay. |They are simply not very understanding.

<Content>Really great hotel but soft bed We stayed for one night with 5 people in a very spacious 2 bedroom suite. The rooms are huge! The bed seemed comfy but was actually somewhat soft. But that's my only complaint. Noisy, but you expect that from NY. Ask for a room that does not face 34th Street. That may solve the problem.

<Content>Loved it! Just returned from a 4 night stay at the Affinia Dumont and I can't praise it enough. The studio room was a great size and very clean. The staff were friendly and very helpful and we had a great view from the 25 floor. The location is great, close enough to walk to many of the sights but fairly quiet. There are a lot of good restaurants in the areas, we ate at the Barking Dog, Lemongrass (Thai) and Blockheads (Burritos) all of which are within minutes of the hotel.Would highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>A great hotel in bustling Manhattan I stayed in the Affinia Dumont at the start of March for 7 nights with my husband. It was our first time in New York so I spent quite a long time choosing a hotel before we arrived in the city. I picked the Affinia after reading all of the reviews on Trip Advisor. As we were staying for 7 nights I managed to get a better rate than on expedia by booking directly with the hotel's website on their weekly rate. By doing this I managed to book a junior suite for the same price as I would have paid for a standard room on Expedia.We arrived at the hotel quite late and found that although I had requested a room with a view we were only on the 13th floor. I was told to check again in the morning as a room on a higher level might become available, which I did, and we were moved to a room on the 23rd floor which had a great view of the Chrysler building and the East river etc. The only slight niggle is that the room that we were moved to smelt quite strongly of cigarette smoke, which I found quite strange for a no smoking hotel. We left the windows open when we out each day so that when we got back the room smelt a lot fresher. We decided that the view in the room was too good to give up!!In terms of the facilities in the hotel, it was great to have a kitchen area. There were some days when we walked so much in the city that all we wanted to do was come back to the hotel room and collapse and for that the room was ideal. The kitchen was well stocked with cups, plates, cutlery etc. There was also a cooker and microwave but we didn't really use those. It would be possible to cater for yourself the entire holiday given the equipment available if you wanted.The bathroom was a good size with a bath which was long enough to lie down in (I've heard this isn't always the case in New York!). The bed was huge and very comfortable and we had a desk and arm chair and sofa in the room as well which came in handy.There isn't a bar area attached to the hotel but this wasn't really a problem. There are so many bars / restaurants that are a 2 min walk away from the Affinia that it didn't inconvenience us.We both found the staff at the Affinia very friendly and helpful and the cleaning of the rooms was of a high standard.All in all, we had a great trip to New York. Would definitely recommend the Affinia Dumont if you want to stay in central Manhattan. It is ideally located .... just a short bus ride away or 20 mins walk and you are in the centre of the city.Minus points: room smelling slightly of smoke and having to come home!!

<Content>Loved it! I stayed at the dumont with a group of six for one night. We got a 1 bedroom suite with two queen beds and a pull out sofa. The room was awesome, on the 35th floor with an incredible view of the city. Everything in the room was clean and the bathroom was spotless. The beds were amazingly comfortable! It was a great time and I would recommend this hotel in a heartbeat, also the people at the front desk are very nice and the restaurant has an awesome breakfast selection for very reasonable prices...I had a fantastic omelet with hash browns and a biscuit for under nine bucks! You can't beat that In NY!

<Content>Wonderful hotel! Spent four nights in this hotel. Found the staff and the room to be top notch. Tennille at the front desk is a real gem. It was my husband and I's first trip to NYC. The bathtub was LONG enough to let me stretch out after walking, walking, walking in NYC for a good soak with some epsom salts. For you women, the hotel uses Aveda toiletries, which is a nice touch. They work hard to make your stay very pleasant and there are plenty of amenities. We had a full kitchen (which we never used because we didn't have time). The only downside was a small dog barking but it didn't seem to bark at night so not a problem. You don't have to go any further in your research ... stay here.

<Content>Top Marks For The Affinia Dumont My Friend and I stayed at the Affinia Dumont for 4 nights  we loved it!!!!The hotel was a great size not too big that you got lost but still very classy.The rooms were clean, large and the beds were so comfy we nearly slept all day!The Reception staff were very welcoming and they would help with any query we had. The Door staff were great too - especially Christopher who pointed us in the direction of some great Bars.It is situated less than 5 mins away from the Empire State Building and 10 mins from Macys (so not far to walk with all the shopping bags!!!).There is a great shop on the corner which sells almost everything - there tuna melt paninis are lovely and try there Chocolate Crumb cake!!!!The next time I am back in New York I will without a doubt be staying at the Affinia Dumont.Beth from England

<Content>Great base for New York trip As first time visitors to New York we wanted a decent hotel, close to the main attractions that we could base ourselves in for the week we were visiting New York City. We have used Trip Advisor on several occasions for recommendations and again we were not disappointed!Our hotel room was a junior suite on the 27th floor with great views of the Manhattan skyline, especially looking out at the Chrysler building lit up at night. The room itself was great with more than enough space for the two of us. The king side bed was extremely comfortable, by the end of the week it was pretty hard to get out of!! While the kitchen was on the small side there was more than enough room to prepare breakfast in the morning, make a cuppa upon returning in the evening and having a fridge to store some beers in meant you weren't dipping into the mini-bar!The staff were extremely helpful and friendly. We messed up our booking dates (totally our faults) and the front desk staff sorted it out within minutes. The cleaning staff also deserve a mention as the room was spotless on our arrival and throughout the stay.Manhattan is easy to get around once you get your bearings. The Empire State building and Macys are a 10min walk down the street, with Penn Station just a little further down. We tended to walk a lot but there is a subway station (Line 6) one block away on 33rd street (one going uptown and one downtown on opposite sides of the road) and a good bus service around the corner that goes cross-town the length of 34th street. A $10 metro card will get you 6 trips on either the bus or subway. Failing that the doormen are always on call to hail you a cab (expensive during peak time, but not so much at night). Like other reviewers we hired a limo to get us back to the airport in Newark 鈥?a bit overpriced at $80 but it included a tip and tolls.We ate in both the Barking Dog (the special pork chops were really good) and Thai restaurant (recommend the green curry) either side and both meals were good. We also got some food from the Murray Hill store/deli to take back with us to the apartment which was also quite reasonable. On one of our lazier nights we rounded the corner onto 3rd avenue to a number of pubs/clubs with some good nightlife. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in New York and I have no doubt that the comfort, cleanliness and location of the hotel contributed to this. We would definetly recommend it!

<Content>Believe every word you read! We have just returned to the UK from our 4 day/5 night trip to NYC and this was our chosen hotel. (a full trip report will appear later when i have caught up). From the moment our taxi pulled up outside the hotel and we were met by a smiling Chris on the door, to the early morning call on the last day to tell us our ride to JFK was waiting outside, we have nothing but praise. We booked a junior suite and were on the corner of the 26th floor with a view from one side up Manhattan towards the Chrysler and on the other towards the East River. We were visiting for my wifes birthday and i had casually mentioned that when booking last November - and on arrival there was a card, complimentary wine and fruit. The room was huge and the bed lovely and comfortable - in the mornings we raised the curtains, propped up the pillows and with that first cup of coffee, watched the sun rise over the East River skyline. Admittedly the bathroom was a little dinky but more than adequate. As for location - as everyone else has said you are on E34th street but we found it to be the ideal place. It was fairly quiet (as much as NYC can be) 5 mins from ESB, 5-10 from GCT and the Chrysler, 10 mins from Macys and 15-20 from Times Square. There are loads of places to eat and drink within a 10 minute walk (Sarges is just around the corner on 3rd and Keens Steakhouse a light stroll away). You also have the 24 hour deli/market a couple of doors away or a Starbucks within 3-4 mins. All in all a great place to stay and we will definately return.

<Content>Great hotel, well worth it I was amazed to get a deal to NY for 5 nights/days with flights for 拢550 each. Checked tripadvisor to ensure the hotel was good鈥?and it was. Thoroughly great hotel. Big room, bed was excellent. Kitchen was a little pokey but we didn鈥檛 use it at all. Views were great, I had the Chrysler building out of my window.Location was good as it鈥檚 a short walk to Macy鈥檚 and so is not in the hustle and bustle. The reception staff were excellent and very responsive. The doormen were a lot of fun. Try the Thai restaurant next door for some great food. Lots of places to get breakfast nearby.Thoroughly recommended.

<Content>Lived up to the reviews When we planned our trip to New York, we looked at the reviews of a lot of hotels and this one came out tops. We've just spent 4 nights there and have to say that we couldn't have wished for a better place to stay. From the moment we arrived, the staff were friendly and helpful, as were all the people we met in New York, contrary to what we'd been told by friends who'd told us to expect offhand, unfriendly people.We'd asked for a room with a view of the Chrysler Building, but none of these came with 2 queen beds, so we were given a really large corner room on the 26th floor, with a great view of the river. It was wonderful to see the sun rise over the buildings each morning.We didn't use the Barking Dog diner but did have breakfast in the Murray Hill diner, just around the corner. It's spotless, with great food and service, so give it try.We also took advice from previous travellers on this site and booked a limo to take us to the airport - much nicer than a cab and not much more expensive when you add in the tolls on the cab drive.We had a wonderful trip overall in this spectacular city and when we return, it will definitely be to the Affinia Dumont.

<Content>It was Great We really enjoyed staying here as a treat for my 18yr old son. The rooms are very big, and there Aveda goodies in the bathrooms. The fridge and kitchenette was very useful. It is in a lovely area away from the madness of Times Square. Very Close to Macy's and the Empire State. The Barking Dog pub was really nice with some very friendly staff. The receptionists were really good as were the Bellman and the Doorman. There was a really good place for breakfast around the corner in Lexington St.I would denfinitly stay again in this hotel. We did not use the fitness suite but it looked very good.

<Content>Fantastic hotel, Good for Children We took our two boys to NYC  stayed in Affinia Dumont. It is in a great area, Murray Hill - not right in a busy area, but close enough to walk to most things ie: Empire state 5 mins, Macys 7 mins, Times Square 15 mins. Grand Central 5 mins. Lots of good diners, delis  restaurants - the Barking Dog next door is also well priced and does good food- burgers, wraps, pasta, salads. We stayed in a Queen Studio - plenty of room, two good sized beds, kitchenette - very comfortable, modern, clean, quiet.Staff were very friendly  happy they paid the boys lots of attention. The concierge staff were great, lots of good, relevant information  always had time to chat.This hotel is marketed as an executive business hotel but I think it makes an excellent base for a family base hotel. Its a great place !!

<Content>Great Hotel! Great view, amazing room. I have stayed in a number of NYC Hotels and this one is by far the best bang for the buck! A large desk in every room with two cozy chairs, great roomservice, and a real attention to being healthy make the affinia a MUST STAY when in NYC on business. I also love this part of the city so if you like the nightlife you should have no problem finding a bar or restaurant on 3rd. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!

<Content>Clean *and* Perfect for Travel with Pets My husband and I not only want to stay at clean hotels but also are members of the House Rabbit Society and proud owners of two wonderful, free-roaming bunnies. We travel with our pets often, and found that it's very difficult to find a pet-friendly hotel that is sparkling clean, luxurious (given our middle-class budget), smells well, and has a very comfortable bed. But after staying at Affinia this December, we've found our favorite hotel! We'll never stay anywhere else when we're in NYC. Why? Perfect Mannhattan location; super-comfortable bed with a matress that comforts to your body; no problem for our pets to roam free; quiet; super friendly staff; fantastic fitness center; very clean; a 24-hour grocery store less than a block away.

<Content>Nice hotel We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights in January.Good location and easy/safe walk to attractions.Rooms are large and clean and have a small kitchen which we found really useful.Staff were helpful.Hotel seems to focus on health/fitness and I believe they have a fairly extensive gym {unfortunately I was too busy eating and drinking far too much to visit}.We would use again.P.S. Enthusiastic Gourmet walking food tour on the Lower East Side is a great way to spend a morning-incorporates Jewish,Italian and Chinese parts of town.

<Content>Affinity Dumont will amaze you if you have ever stayed in other NYC hotels. This place was incredible! I can't believe the price, less than half other hotels' single rooms for a junior suite! There was not a single smell in the room (my pet peave), the room was huge with a kitchen  sitting area. Great view on the 21st floor through the many windows in the room. Room service was lightening fast and food was great. Lots of treats in the room (for a charge, but still great to have). The staff was so friendly and regular. The cleaning woman was sweet as can be. Valet parking. I hear they have a great gym though we didn't use it, and a great restaurant. There is a deli just next door to get juice, coffee, cakes, sandwiches. And lots of restaurants nearby. We can't wait to go back. We usually stay aroung 42nd street and 5th, but that is so congested and noisy at night. This area was really nice and quiet and near the East River too. Oh, and the best part? There were these really bright reading lights over each side of the bed for us baby boomers who need lots of light to read! The whole room was well lighted with dimmers. (I am so tired of these dark hotel rooms!) Oh, the other best part? They are pet friendly! I can't believe it! Everything you could possibly want in a hotel. We were toying with the idea of getting an apartment in the city but now we think it would be nicer and less expensive to just stay at the Affinity Dumont when we go down. You will NOT be disappointed.

<Content>Exceeded Expectations My wife and I and our daughter stayed this past weekend at the Affinia Dumont. We decided to book the room there after reading all of the terrific reviews others had given it. We were in a one bedroom suite on the 31st floor. We had a great view of the Chrysler Building, and the East River. Location was just good, not great. But if you are up for a little walking, it takes just a few minutes to get to Macy's, Times Square, Fifth Avenue, Empire State Building, etc. The room was large, bathroom very large and very clean. Very nice small kitchen, would save you a lot of money by not having to eat out for all of your meals. We visit the city a couple of times a year, and we would definitely stay at this hotel again. The best hotel we have stayed in at NYC.

<Content>What a fantastic bed!! A great hotel located on 34th Street with Lexington. From the moment we pulled up to the minute we left the staff were really helpful.The rooms are huge and so are the beds.I thought it was good value for money, considering we arrived on New Years Eve I didn't think the price was too horrendous. Although I'd wish I hadn't fallen asleep at 6pm and woke up at 2am completely missing the celebrations!!Not much else to say really, just give it a go you won't be disappointed!!

<Content>Excellent hotel Awesome hotel in a convenient location. Super friendly and informative staff. Rooms were sparkling clean and fresh. The beds at this place are unbelievable! I usually toss alot but I don't think I even moved at all. Great hot showers! We stayed in a junior suite on the 37th floor with spectacular views of the Empire State Bldg, Chrysler Bldg, river and more. We paid $195.00 per night on Travelocity. The hotel's site also offered the same deal. Overall, a great experience. Would highly recommend.

<Content>The Best Hotel I'Ve Ever Stayed In! What an amazing hotel! We were able to stay in one of the suites and it was just beautiful! The staff were so friendly and really helpful. I would stay in this hotel again and again. In fact if we visit New York again - this is the only hotel I'd stay in.Ignore the negative comments - this hotel really is worthy of its hype!

<Content>So Much Space I have been meaning to do this review for a while so it's a little late......We loved the Affinia, we were on a budget but wanted to push it a little bit to enjoy our stay and not have to worry about the air conditioning breaking down or hearing the neighbour going to the toilet, we were not disappointed, not only could we not hear the neighbours toiletry habits we couldn't even hear the street below, no sirens, nothing!We stayed for 6 days and the main thing about this hotel was the space and comfort. It was the largest room I have stayed in in all my mid budget travels. It had a kitchen which came in handy with our budget, the bathroom was modern with great complementaries (even mouth wash). It was the best night sleep I have had in a hotel ever, it was hard to drag myself out of it some mornings. We had a large desk that doubled as a dining table with internet connections and all the mod cons. The location was perfect (5 mins max to the empire state, great restaurants and bars in any direction and metro/trains)The staff were very friendly and helpful and were prompt and efficient, it was the world cup and the cleaning lady has loads of insight into the world cup teams, my boyfriend would get updates from her on the games he missed due to too much sight seeing.We did the typical sightseeing things, we got on the double decker buses that toured around Manhattan, the tickets lasted for two days and doubled as a taxi ride to our favourite places as we could jump on and off as we pleased. There was a torrential rain while we were there in the middle off summer and it was great fun sitting on the top deck in our rain coats and under our brollies while water rushed beneath our feet flooding the below decks, everyone was laughing or crying, it was great fun. We just jumped off when we saw something that looked interesting and jumped back on when we were ready.We didn't use the hotels restaurant or room service as every morning we would get up go to 'our favourite' cafe, pick up coffee, warm croissants and freshly cut fruit only 1min walk away, grab a paper and go back to the room for a relaxing breakfast. Our kitchen came in handy to store leftovers for later, make that extra cup of coffee or cook up a quick snack if needed. Usually we wouldn't be back to the room till late afternoon / early evening and once there we'd freshen up and go our for dinner at one of the many local restaurants of our choice, we would just walk along until one took our fancy, one night we found and great tapas bar which amazing cocktails and spent the night listening to live music and drinking huge pina colads. The hotel staff were always ready to recommend a bar or restaurant to try, they would grab a cab for us and tell the driver were to go if it was too far to walk.It was such an amazing trip and made even better by the hotel. I've been to New York before and the hotel I had stayed at was clean and tidy but tiny, cramped and rushed. The Affina made New York living fantastic and I cannot recommend it enough!!!

<Content>Hot summer bliss We stayed here for our honey moon. The suite was huge, beautifully furnished and very cool - important on a summer visit to the Big Apple. Girls - nice toiletries and a spa on the 2nd floor! Boys huge TVs in every room and a kitchenette with a big beer fridge and dishwasher (which the maid - not wife stacks for you every morning). Location very good - few blocks from Empire State, 5th Avenue and Macy's. Also very close to a few different underground stations - although we mainly walked to help us not feel so bad for eating excessive amounts of food.Very friendly staff - hotel seems to attract both business and leisure travellers. Having stayed in New York a couple of times have never stayed in such comfort without paying double the amount. In a way I'd like to keep it a secret - but I am now pregnant so trips to NY are v unlikely. Enjoy on my behalf!

<Content>Consider booking here carefully I was very disappointed with my experience at Affinia Dumont in mid-December. I had booked a Suite for one night to celebrate my mother's 60th birthday. My parents and I arrived separately and by the time I had gotten to the hotel (running late as always), my parents had been sitting in the lobby for close to 45 minutes because the front desk person said that they wanted to wait for me to arrive to discuss the room. This seemed strange to me, esp. when I had called 2 days earlier to make sure everything was confirmed. When I got to the desk, they said that the room was not ready yet (although it was 20 minutes past check-in time and I had requested an early check-in). So, my tired parents and I sat around the hot lobby for another 30 minutes, when, one of the desk agents announced that our room was not available and could she put us in a standard room? I could not believe that this was happening!!! Esp. on my mother's birthday! I had planned the weekend 2 and a half months in advance to make it special, made all the final confirmations two days ahead of arriving and there were still issues. The desk agent could not explain why the room was unavailable - she actually said I can not explain why this has happened - it just has. The manager did not come out from the back at all during this whole ordeal except to handle the paperwork to finally transfer us to Affinia Manhattan, a hotel of lower quality. Because my parents and I were trying to have a nice time, everyone went with the flow, but I knew my mother was disappointed with the shoddy accommodations at the second Affinia (there was a big stain on the carpet and our room was next to the service entrance). UGH!! It was a truly disappointing experience. The desk agent said that they oversell the hotel ALL THE TIME. So, there are individuals all the time who are turned away due to the hotel's disorganization. I am about to write the hotel company a letter. For over $400 a night, one should expect better service. This is NOT budget travel!!!! Oh, did I mention they comped our parking fee? This provided little relief as the whole ordeal tired all of us out, made us late for our dinner reservations and forced us to rush through a night that was supposed to be a true celebration.

<Content>Loved it. Fab rooms and very friendly staff My boyfriend and I were looking for somewhere central to stay but without the hassle of Times Square for New Year. We looked at so many hotels but got a good price direct on the affinia's own website. We had a corner room, so had two huge windows with great views from two sides. The rooms are a very good size, with the kitchen area a huge bonus for the early morning coffee and juice! The bathroom was clean and also a good size, the shower was powerful and the bath nice and deep for a relaxing soak.The staff were friendly and helpful and there was always someone on hand for general questions. Didnt try the Barking Dog restaurant for dinner, but went in for cocktails and coffee, both times the staff were really friendly and the atmosphere relaxed and easy. The food looked great and the prices were very reasonable.No faults at all with this hotel, would gladly recommend and will certainly return.If you are staying for a few days, get a 7 day Metrocard, its $24 (which is about 拢12.70 right now) and you can travel anytime on any of the subways. This is a great way to get about when your legs are just about to give in.For cheescake try Carnegie Deli, 854 Seventh Ave, at 55th St. The food here is lovely, but HUGE portions, so be careful what you order, although you can always take it out with you if you dont finish it!

<Content>Great hotel, excellent service, clean room!! My wife and I wanted to stay in NYC for one night from Saturday, December 30th to Sunday, December 31st, 2006. After extensive searching on the internet for a decently priced hotel, we settled on the Affinia Dumont hotel on 34th St. I booked and paid for my reservation through Orbitz.Posted check in time was 3pm. We arrived at the hotel at 1pm and asked for early check-in. Sure enough, they had our room ready and allowed us to check-in. We were giving a room on the 25th floor, on the front of the hotel with a gorgeous view of the NYC skyline, especially the Chrysler Building.The room was one of the most spacious I've been in for NYC. To my surprise, the room also had a kitchen, complete with stove, refrigerator, sink, and plenty of counter space. Thats good to know for future reference!! The bathroom was a typical hotel room bathroom, with decent water pressure in the shower. There was also a large desk with an internet connection available if you need to stay connected. Our room also had a very comfortable king-sized bed and a nice 27-inch TV.As for the the location, the hotel is within walking distance to the Empire State, Rockefeller Center, Times Square, Penn Station, Grand Central Station, and St. Patrick's Cathedral. There are several restaurants, delis,  coffee shops in the area. This area of NYC looks very nice as there are a lot of condos and buildings with rooftop gardens.One small complaint that I had is that the room initially smelled like the previous guest was a smoker, even though the rooms are supposed to be smoke free. I guess there are still some inconsiderate folks who choose to smoke in these rooms and ruin it for the next person. However, the windows in the room could be opened, and after a few minutes, the smell dissipated or we got used to it. I wouldn't consider this the hotel's fault though.My wife and I were very happy with this hotel and will definitely use it again if the price is right.

<Content>Great for groups, very nice, large clean rooms, good location As a group of 5 ladies who regularly visit NY for December shopping, we were looking for a 2 bedroom apartment that could accomodate us, without having to separate all the time into pairs. We have tried several options in the past, but none has offered the perfect solution provided here. A large king in one bedroom and two Queens in the other, plus a pull down in the sizable lounge was ideal. Kitchen with large fridge freezer definitely a bonus and the sheer space, given the shopping bags was great. Bathrooms large, clean and pleasant. The overall hotel and room feels well turned out.I was worried that the location in midtown was neither close to the uptown shopping or to our preferred eating and drinking locations downtown, I needn't have worried - we found a new area for exploring and the whole area around Macy's, within 10 mins walk, is complete with all the usual shops you would expect to find. Taxi's were a few dollars wherever we wanted to go. The hotel restaurant was fine for breakfast, but we went elsewhere for dinner. On the first night the staff recommended Italian just around the corner was very good.Staff were very helpful and apparently the spa/gym area was small but adequete, our only critisism was the combination of bellman duties and door duties, which meant one person running about trying to deliver bags and catch taxis - they needed to put an extra person on for this.We will definitely visit again.

<Content>Practically Everything If you're looking for a romantic boutique, you've come to the wrong place. If you are looking for a clean hotel with excellent service in a fine location, you're there. We stayed for three nights and were able to walk to some wonderful spots like Rockefeller Center, Times Square, and Chelsea. The staff was very friendly and helpful, and we had two meals in our room from the restaurant downstairs. As far as ambiance, unless you're into all of the comforts of home including a kitchenette, large desk, and all of the sporting videos you'd ever want, you may be underwhelmed, but if you are looking for a comfortable, clean room in a nice neighborhood, you won't be disappointed.

<Content>Good, but could have been better I followed the advice of fellow travellers and booked this hotel for a recent weekend shopping trip to New York. Overall I was very happy with my stay and the hotel  room lived up to expectations. However, it could have been better. My flight was delayed so I arrived late on Friday night. No-one showed me up to my room so I was left to try and work out how everything worked in the kitchen myself (never could get the cooker to work). The room was scrupulously clean - probably the best I've yet seen in a New York hotel room - and having a restaurant next door and a 24 hour deli/market on the corner was very handy. Niggles: whilst the restaurant next door (the Barking Dog) serves basic comfort food and is very reasonably priced the service is slow and inefficient. I also used the spa and did not enjoy my massage. The room was so over-air conditioned, with cold air actually blowing on the table, that I froze.

<Content>Simply the best hotel I have ever stayed in Taking into account value, location, service and room this is simply the best hotel I have ever experienced. Well done trip advisor - you never get it wrong! The staff were eager to help, the room was massive and beutifully equipped right down to the complimentary umbrella. I will be returning here for my forthcoming honeymoon - so how's that for a recommendation. Enjoy.

<Author>M & C been there
<Content>If we designed a perfect business hotel, it would be the Affinia Dumont The Affinia Dumont is one of the most well thought out hotels we have ever enjoyed. The two and one-half room suites are large, and comfortable. Everything that you need to live is there...a great full length mirror, coat hooks by the door, effective dimmer reading lights by the bed, a fully functional small kitchenette with stove, refrigerator, microwave and basic accessories. There is a desk with a Herman Miller Aerion chair that is actually comfortable to work at. There are enough easily accesable outlets at the desk for computers, chargers, etc. Comfortable sofa and chairs in the Living roomA large TV ia in the living room and another TV in the Bedroom. There is even a shaving mirror in the shower. The Affinia bed is extremely comfortable and they offer 3 types of pillows: down, hypo-allergenic and temperpedic foam.The bellmen were friendly and helpful, the front desk efficient and accomodating. My only complaint is that they have wired, but not wireless high speed internet.....they have thought of everything else. We will definitely be staying there when we stay in New York from now on.

<Content>You'd better believe it! We chose this hotel based on the reviews on Trip Advisor - it was rated the 2nd favourite hotel in NY. Having booked it, I then had second thoughts because I'd never heard of it and we've previously stayed in the places like the Waldorf Astoria.On arrival, first impressions were not good - a very small reception area with some tired chairs, it looked more like an office block than an hotel. However, this is the only tiny negative niggle about the whole experience.The staff were unfailingly cheerful and helpful. I requested a room on a high floor (as recommended in one of the reviews) and we were allocated a Junior Suite on the 20th floor. A corner room, it had huge windows on two sides - one with views of the Chrysler Building and one with the sunrise over the East River. The room was huge, well equiped with a huge wardrobe (with an iron and ironing board!), lots of drawer space, a desk area and a seating area. A small kitchen contained a kettle and coffee machine with complimentary tea and cofffee (as well as an oven and microwave).The bed was very comfortable. They have nice linen and a pillow menu offering three very different types of pillow! Despite the large windows the blinds had blackout linings and were very effective at keeping out the light.Despite taking our exercise kit to try out the extensive exercise facilities, we never entered the gym. The 34th Street location of the hotel meant that we could walk to Central Park and Bloomingdales in one direction and Soho and Greenwich village in the other so we had more than enough exercise.Do believe all the reviews - this hotel is a great find. The Junior Suite cost less than a double room in the Paramount which was the size of a small double bed with about 2 feet on each side! We will definitely stay there again. The Affinia Dumont is especially suitable for families and we are recommending it to all of our friends.

<Content>great for families with small children; big rooms Stayed at the Affinia Dumont for a 4-night stay with our 2 year old. The room was very large by NY standards (we booked a Jr Suite) and paid only $185 a night, cheap by NY hotel standards. While our view was non-existent and very loud on the 3rd floor (we had requested a high floor, never got it), loved the kitchen and overall spaciousness. NY friends thought it was niver than most NY apartments! We asked for a crib which they also did not honor but found one for us along with a stroller which made our life easier. Staff as courteous as can be with very helpful doormen who helped hail cabs and even put luggage in the car. Very conveniently located, great restaurants all around. You won't be disappointed!

<Content>Good Deal on a Reasonably Priced Hotel Just got back from one night at the Affinia Dumont in New York City. Although it had received glowing reports on this website, I was a little leery of staying there, since I am more used to staying at the Waldorf or the New York Hilton when I am in the city. However, the hotel was close to my meeting, so I gave it a try.I booked on the hotel website, and reserved a King Junior Suite. When I checked in, I was upgraded to a corner double queen one-bedroom suite. The room was very spacious for New York, complete with separate sitting room, small but complete kitchen (microwave, refrigerator, dishwasher, and even plates, silverware, etc.) A very nice sized desk for working, and a very large TV, sound system and sofa. I was on the 31st floor, with a great view of the Chrysler Building. The room was very comfortable, but not luxurious, like you would find in the Four Seasons or the Ritz Carlton, both of which I have stayed at in other cities. The room was clean, and the hotel is totally non-smoking. There were nice big windows for a great view of the city. I tend to get claustrophobic in small dark hotel rooms, and had no problem here. It was nice to have a large room, which is rare at these prices in NYC. I paid $269 plus tax, for a total of $310.49.The bathroom was a nice size, clean, with separate vanity area with plugs for hairdryer, etc. The amenities were Aveda, but no cotton balls or sewing kit. In these days of quart size toiletries, it would have been nice to have these. The water pressure in the shower was good, there was also a phone in the bathroom, and a make-up mirror, although the lighting left a little to be desired. The towels were good size and very white ( I hate towels in any color other than white, becuase you can't see if they're really clean or not). No robes available, but there was a pillow menu which allowed you to request special pillows. The bed was very comfy and the pillows were fine.The lobby wasn't much, but the people at the front desk were very nice. If you're in the mood for a little quaint french bistro, there is a place just right around the block called Cosette which was very good, basic french (not the fancy stuffy kind) food and service.Would I stay there again? If you are with a family, I think it would be great, due to the kitchen and the extra room. I prefer to be closer to mid-town, but these rooms make it very easy to save money by using the kitchen for breakfasts, and snacks. (Avoid the expensive mini-bar, and buy your snacks and drinks down at the Duane Reed on the corner). I would certainly stay there again if I had the reason to be in the area. I felt safe in the neighborhood, and at the hotel. Room 3103 was very nice, and you won't be disappointed if you stay there.

<Content>Would Defo stay at the Affinia Dumont again...... I trolled through endless reviews about where to stay in NY...and whittled it down to a couple, so I asked the local experts on TA for advice and came to the decision with their help, on the Affinia Dumont - and I am so glad I did. My hotel criteria was: Preferably modernish hotel, central to sights, good views and it came up to that  more. I e-mailed the hotel prior to arrival asking for a room on a high floor with a view, when we checked in we were given 504 which faced the street but no view as such, they were really busy. However they changed us the next day (moved all the luggage etc while we were out sightseeing) to room 2904 - what a view!! We ended up sitting in fron of the window when we came in for the night just gazing at the lights, it was breathtaking. The bedroom was really large (had a office workspace in one part) and was really airy. The bed was just soooooo comfortable - ideal for a good nights rest after a hard day in New York City. The kitchen area, with coffeemaker (coffee supplied) , fridge (stocked minibar), cooker and utensils were handy - we used it in the morning for coffee (and a quick croissant from the deli just next door, on the street) before we set off for the day. The bathroom was a reasonable size (bath and shower), hairdryer and toiletries supplied. The location of the hotel was great, I was slightly dubious when I was booking it as some of the reiviews said it was in a 'quieter' area鈥ut for us it was perfect, after a day in all the noise and excitement, it was good to go back to a slightly 'calmer' area and the added bonus of less street noise at night. It was a 5 minute walk to the subway if that (which got us everywhere), 10 minutes max to the Empire State Building, and 15 mins walk to Macys. There weren't loads of restaurants in the area but we did find a nice bar a couple of blocks down called Blancs (great barman called Ambrose) and there were palces around if you didn't want to eat in all the hussle and bussle - there was also the Barking Dog next door where we had a drink and bite to eat the first night we got there - staff really friendly. All in all I would definitely recommend the Affinia Dumont and would stay there again without a doubt.

<Content>Great hotel and location Just back from New York after a 3 night day in the Affinia Dumont. This hotel is a great find, room was a twin with very large beds, and also had a full kitchen! We arrived and were allocated a room on the 4th floor, requested a higher floor as first time visit for my sister, they asked us to come back in 30 mins and then gave us a room on the 37th floor! View was great to downtown. hotel is very close to Empire State building and close to restaurants, very good Italian around corner called Da Ciro recommended by the hotel. Also went to Penelopes diner on 30th and 3rd avenue for brunch on Sunday which was very good, Guy and Pallards is a great deli for paninis and bagels for breakfast and on corner of Lexington beside hotel. Zagats restaurant guide is spot on and well worth getting. Weather was great so didn't get to use the subways, concierge very good at getting cabs for us and the hotel also organised a car back to JFK on Sunday for $65 (it started lashing rain so not many cabs around!). Really enjoyed the trip and will definitely go back to the Affinia Dumont.

<Content>pleasant surprise My friend and I stayed at the affinia dumont for three nights in october. We had originally booked at the Shelburne Murray Hill which is owned by the same company. When we arrived they told us that we couldn't stay at the Shelburne but they told us we had room waiting for us at the Dumont. We were skeptical because we liked the New York charm of the Shelburne. We were told that we were welcome to come back the next day or we could stay at the Dumont for the same price. They gave us cab fare and put our bags in the cab ( it was just around the corner). Although it lacked the charm of the Shelburne's stone facade it was more than made up for in modern comfort and service. The room was really big with a kitchenette, aveda products in the bathroom, large triple sheeted beds and a nice view. Although we were out and about all day it was nice to have such a comfortable room to crash out in. Oh yeah and the water pressure was amazing. I wanted to move in.

<Content>Great Hotel I and my 2 girlfriends have just returned from a 4 day stay at the Affinia Dumont. The hotel accomodation is fantastic and the service was excellent. We stayed on the 22nd floor and even though our room number was an 02 we still had a great view of downtown. The room was extremely roomy and had plenty of storage space for all our shopping. Our beds were the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in a hotel. The staff were very helpful with recomendations for sushi restaurants etc. I will definitely stay there the next time I go to New York.

<Content>excellant hotel Just got back from 4 nights at this fabulous hotel. Studio room 3504 has great view of chrysler building. The biggest most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. Small kitchen with fridge handy for milk etc- do not buy any drinks left in fridge or on counter by hotel- they are vey expensive! Plenty of local shops for groceries near by. Short walk to Empire State and just a bit futher to Herald Square, Maceys and Grand Central. Would definately recommend this hotel- try and get a room above 25th floor ending in 03/04/or 05.

<Content>Dumont is great value for money This was our first trip to New York and found the Dumont a great location for getting around. It is extremely close to the 33rd Street subway station for the 4,5 and 6 trains which run up and downtown frequently. It's also a short walk to the Empire State Building.The hotel itself is decorated simply but the staff are polite and welcoming and the rooms large and clean. We managed to get a suite for the price of a standard room on Expedia and as result we had a room the size of small apartment with a living area and a kitchenette. The room also had a fantastic view of the Chrylser Building (when it wasn't raining!). We never ate in the Barking Dog restaurant which is attached the hotel but instead we visited the various diners on Third Avenue and got great value breakfasts. I would recommend the Affinia Dumont without hesitation.

<Content>Fabulous Affiinia!! We JUST got back from our stay at the Affinia Dumont  I have to write about it! This was the perfect hotel for a visit to NYC. I am no stranger to NYC (used to live there) and have certainly had my share of stays in 5 star hotels. The Affinia may have the occasional flaw - a crack on the ceiling, etc. But they really do provide a higher-end experience (especially amazing considering the price!) Friendly staff - one guest told me the doorman ran 4 blocks in the rain to find her a cab. I'm 5 months pregnant and was still getting over a bad sinus infection, after an early am flight I was desperate for a bed. The staff was able to accomodate my early check in within about an hour of my request (just enough time to have breakfast around the corner!) Comfortable beds with wonderfully soft, cotton sheets and down pillows - you also have the choice of 4 other types of pillows just a phone call away - housekeeping had my extra pillows in my hands (cases were still warm from pressing!) within 5 minutes! We were supposed to stay at the Roosevelt during my husband's conference, but after reading all the bad reviews we quickly switched. For a few dollars more than the discounted conference rate at the Roosevelt, we got a king 1BR suite. Can we say huge? Our place was bigger than any apartment I or my friends have ever had in the city. The neighborhood is just far enough away from the hustle and bustle of Herald Square, but there's plenty nearby - grocery store (Gristide's), gourmet markets, cafes and diners - try the one at 33rd  3rd for breakfast!). The internet fee really is insignificant when you realize the going rate at the kinko's on 33rd and park is 30 cents per minute.)In a nutshell, the best way to feel at home while away from home!

<Content>Best hotel I've ever stayed in! We stayed in this hotel in October for 6 days and cannot say enough great things about the hotel. The suite was huge with great views with the Chrysler Building on one side and the river at the other window (corner suite). The staff were terrific and were extremely polite and helpful. The room was very clean and like an apartment. The Murray Hill area is fantastic with great little restaurants and shops; very different than Times Square where it's so crowded and hard to find good food. The bed was extremely comfortable and was great to have a kitchen. I'd love to return to New York and stay at this hotel and I give it 5 stars!!!! What a wonderful experience! My boyfriend travels for work a lot (and for about 15 years) and has never stayed at a nicer hotel. He loved it as well.

<Content>Great Rooms We recently stayed four nights here. Our bed was very comfy and we had a lovely view of the Chrysler Building and the East River from our suite. As many reviewers have noted, the generous size of the rooms and the proximity to a subway stop are the best things about this hotel. Two amenities would elevate the Dumont from good to great -- 1) A true concierge, rather than the very busy desk staff, and 2) free wireless internet in the rooms and in the lobby. (For almost $400 per night, it seemed rather chintzy to pay an additional ten bucks a night for internet access.) Overall, an enjoyable stay.

<Content>We Heart Affinia Dumont! We have just come back from staying a week at the Affinia Dumont in NYC and we weould go back in a heart beat. We had 2 one bedroom suites, one for my husband and I and one for my mom and sister. We had wanted the two bedroom suite, but we know we would have been unhappy with that, how much time do you want to spend with your family!? Our suites were on the 20th and 28th floors, overlooking the East River. The suites were 3 times bigger than any hotel I have ever stayed in in NYC. Having the kitchen was great for breakfasts and left overs. We had two large closets in the bedroom and a big bathroom, while my mom's room had 3 closets and a slightly smaller bathroom. The pillow menu was great and the bedding was wonderful. We have a Tempur mattress at home and we never sleep as well when we travel, but the Affinia bed was almost as comfy! The staff were very friendly and accomodating and helped to make our stay enjoyable. The area was great and there are a ton of restaurants on Third Avenue to enjoy. Macy's is a short walk from the hotel, and the area feels very safe. We will definitely be staying at the Affinia Dumont again!

<Content>Affinia DOALOT it could be called.... As we stayed here just recently while in town for a long weekend. The management team is supurb here and the accomodations are some of the biggest - space-wise - that you will find in NYC. As usual we booked our stay on Expedia.com, and upon checking on their website for our confirmation # less than 24 hours before check-in, we realized that the rate for our Junior Suite room had dropped. The Expedia agent called the hotel and spoke with the front desk manager and the manager waived the cancellation fee and we rebooked at the lower rate. This was a positive and exceeded my expectations on what the hotel may do as a result of our inquiry. Checking in was a breeze. We encountered a couple of problems with the room service and also the smoking (the hotel is all non-smoking) - and a barking dog (the hotel is very pet friendly so you may hear this during your stay) in the room directly across the hall from us - but all was taken care of upon my bringing it to the manager's attention. We were promptly re-located to another room (Junior Suite) on a higher floor (29 vs. 18). The view from 29 is amazing - if you can imagine - as you can see the Chrysler Tower to the North and the East River to the East.....it's breathtaking both during the day and even more so at night. The hotel room itself is huge - as stated before - bigger than most even beyond the Big Apple. Most / or all Junior Suites I was told are in the corners...giving you ample room and the view I spoke of. The amenities are first rate in the room, an umbrella stand with an umbrella, and Aveda toiletries. I was impressed. The decor could use a minimal update as the kitchen - albeit bigger than most studios in NYC could use a minor facelift and the couch is older. The TV is what I was most expecting to be a plasma/lcd given the rank and file of this type of hotel - as it caters to business and pleasure travel. Overall, the management did everything to accomodate us and even after our stay sent us a follow-up survey and responded to our comments within hours. This is the biggest city in the US with a hotel on every corner - literally - what differentiates this hotel from the others is it's service and management team. Thank you Trang for your help during our stay!

<Content>We loved Affina Dumont We stayed for six nights in September while attending the US Open tennis championships. I booked the hotel through its website after reading all the good reviews and we were very satisfied. We got a great special promotion rate!!Great location near our subway transportation out to Flushing Meadows. We asked each morning at the front desk for a list of the days tennis matches and after a few days they had them ready for us in the morning!! Our room was very comfy and quiet and clean. The new grocery store right next door was very handy for late night sandwiches and great salads. And Guy and Gallard just a few steps across Lexington had good coffee and bagels. When it poured with rain the Drugstore across the street provided us with ponchos.The area around the hotel felt very much like a comfortable neighbourhood and the hotel felt like home! I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to other visitors to NYC.

<Content>Wonderful/Reasonable in NYC We stayed here over July 4 and couldn't have picked a more perfect location. It was just up the street from where the fireworks were being launched. The hotel was very clean and the king-sized bed was increditbly comfortable. Every day after an exhausting day of sightseeing we were greeted with smiles and some absolutely wonderful iced tea and fruit. This hotel is located a few minutes walk from the Empire State Building, a block from the subway, around the corner from an incredible deli called the Murray Hill Diner and by several great Italian pastry shops and Patsy's Pizza. We were on the top floor and had a corner room with a wonderful view of the river and the Chrysler Building. We took a lot of pictures of the city nightlights from our windows. Aveda products are used in the bathrooms and our room had a full kitchen with a refrigerator to store leftovers and sodas bought down the street. A lot of hotels in NY have small rooms, this was large and the sofa bed was perfect for our children, it seems to be queen-sized. I would HIGHLY recommend this hotel for either a couple or a family.

<Content>Great family hotel in New York City Our family (two teenaged sons) stayed in this quiet neighborhood (Murray Hill) near Times Square over Labor Day week-end. The hotel has a tiny lobby and a restaurant nest door. Also on the other side there is a small corner grocery (with gourmet deli) soon to be getting a liquor license. This is a very user-friendly and QUIET neighborhood. The windows open (!) and there are kitchens complete with dishes and full stoves. We got a 2bedroom suite ( one bedroom with king bed, living room with sofa bed and 2nd bedroom with fdouble bed) for $1200 for two nights. The value and amount of space was phenomenal for New York city. Everything was very clean, staff atentive, and nice duvets on the beds, too. We considered this a major find!

<Content>Great value for money We have just returned from a holiday in the states and we enjoyed a 6 night stay at Affinia Dumont, New York. We searched trip advisor to see which would be the best for us and after weeks of reading reviews decided on Affinia, as it was 2nd best. We needed a 2 bedroom suite and the room size was great, nice and roomy. The bed was comfortable, which I'm fussy with as we have such a comfy one at home, and there's a pillow menu as well if you need it. It was very clean as well, especially the bathroom which I'm extremely fussy about! However being a hotel where pets are allowed to stay the carpet was a bit smelly, especially when you first entered the room but after a while it wasn't to bad. The staff were friendly and helpful, I was expecting rudeness after reading reviews on other places and staff, but they were great. Overall it was a fabulous place to stay for our first time in NewYork and the location also was excellent. Close to Empire State and restaurants and so on......Keep up the good work Affinia See you again soon Cheers From Red Hill Victoria Australia

<Content>Perfect and unpretentious I stay at the Dumont whenever I'm in New York and since I've been there regularly since 1999 I've seen the hotel emerge from a rather shabby _ but well located and friendly _ place to a comfortable, chic property.I always go for the junior suite, which feels like a little flat. Since I'm usually in New York on business and work in my room, the big desk and Aeron chairs are greatly appreciated. The bed is huge and comfy and the bathroom spotless, with a deep tub for soaking.The kitchenette is tucked away and you don't have to look at it while in bed, which is nice. I appreciate the fridge, too, for storing a bottle of wine and some water and snacks.The neighbourhood is good, too. There's a great gourmet cafe-sandwich bar at the corner of 34th and Lex, as well as a decent nail salon and drycleaner (can you tell I was practically living at the Dumont for a while?) The one really dreadful thing is that a great bar, Brew's, used to be next to the hotel, but it was torn down a few years ago for the new development. Still, there are good neighbourhood watering holes a quick walk away.The location is good. Murray Hill isn't as cool as some other neighbourhoods, but it's located kind of in the middle of everything and that makes it a pretty quick cab ride to anything. All in all, it's a great place.

<Content>Good Price, Good Location, and Roomy to Boot We stayed in a junior suite on the 31st floor with an excellent view of the city. It was a clean and well thought out accommodation. Not huge, but definitely roomier than any other place I've stayed in NYC. Shower pressure was very good. Shampoo and soap also nice. The kitchen, although we did not need to use it, was perfect and I could easily see it being used during a longer stay - it is equipped with dishes and cookware and dish soap. The bed was comfortable plus you could choose whatever kind of pillow you preferred. Clock radio has cd player, and is not the kind of annoying bright that keeps you up at night. The staff was very nice. It was quiet - relatively because you can always hear NYC traffic, sirens and such, no matter where you stay. I would definitely stay there again on my next visit. I did not try the restaurant/bar, but there were certainly plenty of places to eat close by. There's also a pharmacy across the street in case you forget your toothbrush or just want some snacks or drinks for your room. Empire State building is very close.

<Content>Definitely will stay again We stayed at the Affinia Dumont for one night on September 2nd. We love this hotel! It is by far the largest hotel room we have had in NYC. It is probably triple the size of other hotels rooms, this is not counting the kitchenette in the room. We had a great view of the East River in the morning from the 29th floor. Location is great, in the Murray Hill area. Lots of restaurants nearby. You can choose a pillow from their pillow menu. In room massages are available. There is a gym but we did not use or see it. We will definitely stay here again when we are in NYC. The staff was very helpful and very friendly. Do not valet the car at the hotel as there is a garage across the street with cheaper parking. Our only complaint is that the reception for ESPN was bad. If it wasn't the first weekend of college football we really would not have even noticed.

<Content>The Affinia is a lovely hotel We stayed at the Affinia on our first visit to New York a few days ago. The hotel is lovely, the staff are very helpful and polite and whenever we asked them to reccomend somewhere they always came up with some great places. The location is good, restaurants, cafes and bars all nearby. Times square is around 25 mins walk away. Grand Central is around 15 mins as is fifth avenue, madison etc. Handy for subway stops etc.All in all we would probably stay here again. we didn't try out the spa but the room was good. Always clean, neat and tidy. We had good views from the 28th floor.

<Content>This hotel is the best! When we arrived our room on one of the top floors wasn't ready but we were promised it and told to leave our bags and come back later. Unfortunately that guest had decided to extend his stay and we were offered a room on a much lower floor for the first night and then promised one on the top floor for the rest of our stay. We said OK and the manager gave us and the children a complimentary breakfast at the Barking Dog Restaurant next door. She also comped us a cocktail each there. She even took the trouble to hand write a letter of apology over the mix up. When we returned the next day, all our stuff had been packed up and moved for us. All the staff on the desk and the doormen were absolutely lovely and so friendly and also very knowledgeable. The room was huge and the kitchen was great as we bought food in for breakfast and the evening meals. I must recommend the deli up the road called Greenleaf Deli/Grocery. The staff made us try their different dishes, the portions were huge and really reasonable and a lot of the locals seem to use it which seems a good sign. The Affinia is in a pleasant, safe location and I would definitely return and recommend it to others. The children loved the IPODS in the lobby.

<Content>Horrible It was my third stay in New York and i thought i would try a different hotel to stay at . BIG MISTAKE!. I usually stay at the W HOTEL(tuscany), wish i was there this time around. Location can be close to subways and shops but very far from time square and other key areas. Doorman service was poor. Myself and my parents had to lug our 3 jumbo suitcases over the steps, while the doorman were haveing a conversation with eachother!. Lobby is tiny with alot of children and tourists checking in  out. The actual sitdown area was dirty messy with food residue. Elevator was small and cramped. all of us (3) could not fit in one elevator!. i needed to use the washroom, so i asked an worker they weren't even sure were it was!. finding out bymyself its on the second level in the spa. Going to my room. the Junior suite has good value for its buck.Matress was a good size. However sheets were very dirty the televsion didn't work and we were only given two pillows and no sheets for the pull-out sofa!.NOISEY AT NIGHT!. Only given one little bottle of shamppoo for three people for the whole stay. (4 days and 3 nights)!. Our room was hardly ever neat when we usually came back around 7.

<Content>Awesome! Quick Looking and Start Booking What an awesome hotel. Superior service, LARGE rooms, attention to detail. You will not be disappointed. I cannot understand why this hotel doesn't have a higher rating but it will. We stayed for a weekend for the US Open with a group of 13 and their attention to us was great. They are very interested in satisfying their customers and our large group with kids was well attended to. This is great for families because of the room sizes and personal service. It would also be a romantic place for two.I cannot say enough about the place.

<Content>Excellent Hotel What can I say that hasn't already been said. This is an excellent hotel. The location is superb, the staff were extremely friendly (and I mean all of them), the rooms were spacious and spotless and the view from the 32nd floor beautiful. We spent seven nights here in July, (myself, my wife and two children) and loved every minute of it. Its's ideally situated with only a 5 minute walk to the metro, 10 minutes to the Empire State and 15 mins to Grand Central. There are loads of places to eat within easy walking distance and you feel perfectly safe walking around day or night. The doormen were particularly pleasant and helpful and made my six year old feel very special by greeting him and engaging him in conversation every time they saw him. I would definitely stay here again and would recomend it to anyone visiting New York

<Content>Great Place I have stayed in 10 to 15 hotels in NYC, and this ranks with the best of them. HotelVery friendly staff, always greeting you with a pleasant hello in the morning and afternoon. The room is huge for NYC, and included a small kitchen, very comfortable king bed, and a large desk and ergonomic chair for working in the evening. Also, if you want to spoil yourself (as I did one evening), the spa is excellent, and great value.  LocationThe hotel is located in Murray Hill, a very nice and quaint neighborhood. This was the first time I stayed on the east side, and it was perfect. A 20-25 minute walk to Times Square or Union Square. The subway is a 5 minute walk from the hotel, if you need to get somewhere fast. This was much better than staying in Times Square, where the crowds can be overwhelming.PriceExceptional value for NYC. I paid $270 during the week, and $200 on the weekend. Overall, great place, excellent staff, and Trip Advisor is spot-on, ranking this hotel number #2. However, the 3 Stars is too low. Should be a minimum 4 Stars.

<Content>A dog was barking and the on site restaurant forgot my food order. Twice. I was a the Dumont last year on a two-week business trip. I liked the room, the view and the really comfy bed. However, the family staying in the next room left their barking dog, alone, in their room (all night)! Imagine trying to sleep with a whining, barking dog next door! And even though the Barking Dog restaurant forgot to fill my take-out order (twice in one night) the manager apologized and did not charge me for the order. Overall the good cancelled out the not so good.

<Content>Great location and room We had a junior suite on the 15th floor on a corner facing the east river and chrysler tower. The room was huge (by European standards) and very clean - the aveda products pleased my girlfriend. The staff was always polite and helpful but unfortunately we couldn't take up the offer to meet the hotel manager and take in a free beverage and snacks.It was worth paying a fraction more for the junior suite to get a little higher up in the hotel away from the general NYC street noise that while not too bad in this location, could bother lighter sleepers.We initially had some concerns about not being downtown, but the location was fantastic. There is plenty to do nearby both day and night - Houstons restaurant on Park Ave is worth a mention for the excellent value and service. 10 blocks / 15 minutes walk downtown gets you to Flatiron and Union Square where there are loads of decent bars and restaurants. It seemed very safe to stretch your legs up and down Park and Lexington Avenues so taxis weren't always necessary.A great stay in a very good hotel that I would recommentd to anyone not looking to stay downtown.

<Content>Like living in the city! We just returned from an adult (i.e. no kids, they are at camp) vacation in NYC. We had seen the Affinia Dumont before and liked it, but did a lot of research here and elsewhere before booking. We decided on the Dumont and did not regret it. We booked a one-bedroom suite at the Dumont through Expedia, which had a substantial discount on all three nights, for substantially less than most single rooms in other parts of the city. While we did not get the great view of the Chrysler building that I had hoped for, we were in the back of the hotel which is very quiet and still has a partial view of the East River. The TV in the bedroom did not work and they brought in a new one immediately. Staff are great and very friendly. The spa and fitness center are fantastic. We brought our own wine, sodas, and snacks, and got a fantastic takeout meal one afternoon from Guy and Gallard (also has THE best coffee and great bagels and pastries), utilizing the kitchen is one great way to save a few dollars. We had never taken a bus before in NYC, but there are bus lines right at the hotel in both directions and they go places the subway doesn't. We took a bus down to the East Village and walked and shopped all the way across through SoHo and the West Village, then took the subway and bus back for an easy trip. The Murray Hill neighborhood is wonderful - staying in a suite at the Dumont makes you feel like you are really living in the city! A taxi ride to dinner in the Upper East Side was only 10 minutes, so the place really is closer to everything than it looks on the map, and it is so relaxing to get back to a quiet residential area after all the hustle of Manhattan. One note of caution if you stay at the Dumont - it is often hard to get taxis there, and forget it during rush hour. If you have theater tickets, have dinner in the neighborhood and then catch a taxi at about 7:30, you will have less trouble and less stress!! Otherwise use the subways and buses to get around.

<Content>Very Happy Our family of four recently stayed at the Affinia Dumont for six nights in mid-July. We decided to book the hotel based upon the positive reviews that we had read. We were not disappointed with our choice. Everything was just as the glowing previous reviews has stated.The front desk personnel were all very helpful from the time that we checked in until we left they were always ready to serve. The staff is full of useful knowledge about shows, restaurants, tickets, you name it - they were great. Their knowledge of nice restaurants and guidance enhanced our trip. The doormen also gave great advice on anything that we asked them.The room was wonderful- very spacious and comfortable. The walls are very well insulated so that you don't have any noise from other guests next door. Be sure and take advantage of the pillow menu for selecting a preferred pillow. The housekeeping service was top notch. Our request for extra towels was handled very quickly and with a smile.We will certainly recommend the Affinia Dumont to all of our friends. We will also stay at this property in the future. This place is GREAT.

<Content>Highly Recommend the Affinia Dumont Just returned from our stay at the Affinia Dumont. The hotel and our 1BR Suite was very clean and spacious and had everything we needed and more. We were on the 34th Floor with a beautiful direct view of the Chrysler Building and the East River. The hotel staff was great and very accomodating. The doorman always pleasant and not only flagged down our taxi's; but, stopped traffic for us to get across the street. The area was convenient to everything yet a nice fairly quiet area. Our stay exceeded our expectations and if we ever get back to the Big Apple, we're planning on staying at the Affinia Dumont.

<Content>Reasonably Priced for NYC My husband and I have stayed at the Affinia Dumont two years in a row over the 4th of July weekend. The hotel is within walking distance to Macy's and the other stores on 34th Street. A subway station is a short walk from the hotel. The beds are very comfortable and the rooms are quiet because there is very little hallway noise (there are fewer than a dozen rooms on each floor). We stay at the Affinia because there are fireworks at the foot of 34th Street every year on the 4th. A non-smoking room on a high floor with a view of the river was requested well in advance, and although we checked in at 4:00 pm on the day we arrived, they were unable to accommodate either request. We were disappointed. The toilet in our room was making noise constantly when we arrived. We were not as happy with our stay this year and we will probably stay elsewhere the next time we visit New York City.

<Content>You will not be disappointed My sister and I have just returned from a 3 night stay in NYC at the Affinia Dumont. Our studio suite was clean, spacious and included a full kitchen. We arrived about 1:00 pm and checked in immediately. The only negative I can think of was that the bathroom was a little small and could have used an exhaust fan. We had a problem with the phone not working, but within 20 minutes someone came up and reprogrammed the phone and checked all the extensions to be certain they all worked. All staff we had contact with were extremely helpful and friendly. It's located in a quiet neighborhood, but only a few walkable blocks from the hustle and bustle you would expect in NYC. We would definitely recommend this hotel. We hope to return in the Fall.

<Content>What a delight! When I spoke with the manager, Dana, to compliment our telephone reservationist, she asked me a few questions about our visit. Being that it was our first time to stay in Manhattan, and that my elderly Mom had several heath needs, Dana offered to personally see that we were placed in an appropriate room.That wonderful Penthouse suite provided a delightful view of the city! An attendant came to check on my Mom after we had taken our children out for a bit of evening sight seeing, and the attendant made sure my Mom had everything she needed.The beds in our room were the most comfortable I've ever slept on in my life, like settling into a cloud. The wonderful down comforters and choices of types of pillows were an exceptional touch.The suite was clean, clean, clean and every single staff person was smiling and anxious to provide assistance. It was our children's and my Mom's first trip to NYC, and they all commented on how nice New Yorkers are! Go Affinia!

<Content>Good hotel to stay at I stayed at the Affinia Dumont over the Fourth of July holiday and was pleased with the hotel. I was there with three other adults and found the accomodations to be pleasant. The room was clean, it smelled good, had large closets and the kitchen was handy. The kitchen had a stove, range (burner), microwave and fridge. There was glassware, dishes and silverware, however there weren't any pans or such to use on or in the stove/range. You could put the dishes in the microwave, but if you were planning on using the oven to heat lasagna or the stovetop to make eggs, the pans needed aren't there (although I didn't ask the front desk if they were available for use). There is a coffeemaker in the room, too, but if you're going to use outside ground coffee (like from Starbucks), then bring your own coffee filters as the hotel doesn't have them. The coffee they provide comes in those sealed pre-filled filters.The hotel room was quiet, even with the windows open at their max (which was about 6 inches), although we were on the 34th floor, which could account for the lack of noise. The a/c in the room worked great, which was nice after walking around the warm city.The hotel provides shampoo/conditioner and the like, as well as a hair dryer in the room, which was convenient. You also got a complimentary USA Today each morning.The hotel location was two blocks from the 6 subway train and there was a crosstown bus that picked up across the street from the hotel. Very handy. Second and 3rd avenue are packed with restaurants and bars that seemed to be busy each night.The only downside to the hotel was that the front desk wasn't too concierge-like in that they didn't help you plan or book a tour or show. They would provide phone numbers and print outs from the web, but they didn't function as a true concierge would. The other drawback is this hotel doesn't have a pool and they don't have a deal with a nearby facility to use one. They do have an excellent spa, though, that offers the classics like massages and facials. The front desk people are prompt and friendly, though.

<Content>Excellent Hotel This is an excellent hotel. As other reviews point out, the lobby is nothing to write home about, it's fairly poky. But that really is the only criticism I have. While there I put the hotel through a number of tests. The first one was: I'm very noise sensitive, and although they gave me the kind of room I'd requested, very high up, with a wonderful view, it had a connecting door to the next door room, which was a potent and irritating noise source. I asked to be moved to a quieter room. At first they told me the only quieter room they had was on a smoking floor (I'm a non-smoker). When I said I didn't care, I just wanted a quieter room wherever, they found one on the same floor I was on, which was a non-smoking floor. It wasn't a better room, really, and was in some respects less good. But it was quieter, and served me well for the rest of my stay. Full marks on that. The move was executed within half an hour of my initial complaint.Secondly: I ordered a DVD from Amazon, and by mistake Amazon left my name off the package. In spite of that, the hotel staff ensured that it got to my room. The service in the Affinia was universally excellent. The concierge, bellhops and reception staff were extremely helpful at every turn. One word of advice: whatever you do, don't bother going to the Barking Dog, or whatever the hotel's adjoining restaurant/bar is called, for breakfast. For better value, and a more authentic experience, go to the Murray Hill Diner just round the corner on Lexington. The service and the food is much better.

<Content>Very quaint... nice rooms This hotel was great for the price and location. Rooms are huge! Stayed in the two bedroom suite - there were five of us in it. Loved it!Housekeeping issues. I had to ask three times for our room to be cleaned properly. When housekeeping finally got it right, the manager of the hotel sent us up a bottle of wine... on ice!I forgave them!Stay here. You won't regret it!

<Content>Perfect NYC base I loved this hotel. Our room (a studio suite) was spacious (by NYC standards), spotless and very comfortable. The location was great for us, being away from the frantic pace of Times Square but close enough to walk there. There is a multitude of great restaurants and bars within a stone's throw of the hotel. The staff were super friendly. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a mid-priced hotel for a stay in NY.

<Content>Awesome Great stay at the Affina Dumont!!! Very comfortable hotel, large rooms, comfy beds, small kitchenette. We were fortunate to stay in a corner room on the top floor which gave us amazing views of NYC and the East River. A feast for the eyes!The staff was very helpful and full of great information. Always willing to help and jumped to get us a cab when we they saw us at the curb. The location is out of the way for going to the Theatre but everything else about the hotel made up for it. Take advantage of the corner deli for fresh bagels and the corner fruit/veg stand for breakfast in the morning. I highly recommend staying here.

<Content>Awesome Stay Just returned from a 4 night stay at the Affinia Dumont. What a great stay. There were 4 of us and we stayed in a 1 bedroom suite. We had to move initially as I forgot to ask for a non-smoking suite and the smell of smoke was pretty heavy when we walked in. The front desk staff was very accomodating and even though the hotel was fully booked they moved us to a new room. We had the most comfortable king bed in the bedroom and also a sleeper sofa which turned out to be quite comfy as well. Donald, the doorman was great. He brought our luggage to the room, and then quickly returned with champagne glasses so we could get our celebrating started. He was a wealth of info for where to go in the city. The housekeeping staff took great care of us bringing us new towels everytime we called. Most days we weren't out of our room until after 2pm so they would bring us fresh towels and then they'd ask when we'd be out so they could clean without disturbing us. The hotel is located midtown, close to the subway and grabbing a cab couldn't have been easier. A GREAT location! We also used the fitness center at no additional charge. We didn't expect much, but when we got there we were pleased. They had every type of equipment we needed to do a complete workout, anytime of day. Would I stay again? Most definately!!!! Great Hotel, Great Staff, Great Location!

<Content>great mid-priced hotel! This hotel is a rarity in Manhattan- very large rooms (most with kitchens,) great views and reasonable prices ($250+.)The staff was very friendly and truly seemed to enjoy working there. The hotel has a lot of emphasis on exercise/working out/spa treatment as well. The beds are awesome (better than Marriott and Westin) and the higher level floors feature some excellent views. All in all a wonderful hotel!

<Content>Affinia Dumont Exceeded Our Expectations. Being first timers to NY, we went with the recommendation from TripAdvisor. We're glad we did! In the style of a W Hotel but at half the price and twice as big with a suite. Clean, hip, friendly and relaxing. The place smells good when you walk in! We loved it and will definitely stay there again.

<Content>Fabulous hotel, Brilliant location Ok, just got back from a 5 night stay at the Affinia (16th to 21st June 2006). This hotel is fantastic, the rooms are fabulous (we stayed in a junior suite), the bed was huge and comfortable - you even get a pillow menu which is fab. The kitchen is very handy and the fridge is huge and stocked with beer which is always nice. The room was spotless in every way and each night we came back to a made bed with clean sheets and towels. We left things around and it was totally safe. The hotel was also spotless and the staff are brilliant - we left the hotel at a busy time to come home and getting a cab was difficult so the hotel got us a limo to the airport which finished off our holiday in style.The hotel location is fantastic - 5 minutes from the Empire State Building and another 5 minutes to Macys. There are loads of great bars and restaurants just round the corner but the 'Barking Dog' which is attached the hotel is flippin brilliant - the portions are huge and the food is great. We could walk to all of the sights from the hotel because of its great location and it was always a very pleasant (air-conditioned) welcome from a tiring day by the hotel staff. Overall a fabulous hotel in a brilliant location, spotlessly clean and very friendly staff. We would go back to the Affinia tomorrow. But watch your wife in 'Tiffanys'.....been there - bought that :) Oh - quick note : NY is a very very safe place to be at any time of day, try everything and don't worry about anything.....its fantastic. If you want to ask me anything about the hotel or NY just give me a shout - sjj@osfc.ac.uk

<Content>Fantastic room views Spent 6 nights in June '06.Great value for money. We had a room on 30th floor - great views of the Chrysler and Uptown, as well as the East River.Rooms are not THE most modern, but are a good size and very light. The Beds are not only huge as you'd expect in the US, but are really comfortable. The large mirrors are a nice touch also. The little Kitchenette is a bonus as it means you have your own fridge and cutlery - Guy and Gallard on the corner does great coffee and chessecake/ fresh fruit etc.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Location Let me start by saying that we had a wonderful experience at this hotel. The staff was friendly and helpful but not in a phoney, we're out for a tip way. The elevators are fast and efficient and in 7 days, I believe we were only on an elevator with other people twice. We were fortunate enough to get a corner room on the 32nd floor so the views were incredible! Chrysler Building in one direction and the East River in another direction. The room, sheets, towels, bathroom were always extremely clean. We also loved the Murray Hill district where the hotel is located. Everything is within easy walking distance and the area has a real residential feel to it. We will most definitely be back to the Affinia Dumont!

<Content>The Room was huge for New York standards! What more can I say? We arrived in New York a little early before check in and they allowed us in our room at about 1 pm. All of the staff was super friendly and the service was excellent. The hotel room was huge for New York standards. The bed was honestly one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. The kitchenette came in handy also for left overs and to store drinks in the refrigerator. The corner view down 34th street overlooking the Hudson River was also a beautiful site to wake up to each morning. The hotel is located in Murray Hill which is a plus in my book becuase it is kinda quiet, and we didn't wake up to a honking cab each morning! Our flight didn't leave till 9 pm that Sat night and check out is 3 pm, and they gladly stored our bags for us and even allowed us to use the second floor spa to freshen up before our flight home. I would highly recommed this hotel to anyone staying in New York. I know I will definitely be going back myself.

<Content>Fabulous hotel, great staff, super location We stayed four nights here and were very happy that we listened to the good reviews on this site as they proved totally accurate. We were greeted by very friendly and informative desk and concierge staff. The room was great - it had its own kitchenette, a comfortable bathroom and the bed was incredibly comfy. No view to speak of but we weren't there to look out of the window!! The location of the hotel was great - a few blocks down from the Empire States Building and Macys. There were also some really great bars and restaurants just one block away (towards East River down 34th St). Even the bar next door (the Barking Dog) was a relaxed and cool place to hang out after a day's sightseeing. We would highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Affinia Dumont was excellent! My party of 6 stayed at the Affinia Dumont on June 6-11 2006. We originally had reservations at another hotel but read mutliple bad reviews for it so we started looking again with only 2 weeks before our trip. After reading wonderful reviews about the Dumont on this site and others we decided to try and book. When we actually got reservations we were a bit skeptical of any place that had openings 2 weeks in advance (most don't have openings 4 months in advance). But all of our doubts vanished the second we arrived. There's so much to say about this hotel I'm not sure where to start. But we'll start with the first thing you notice..LocationThe Dumont is located at 150 E 34th St. It's 3 quick blocks to the Empire State Building and 2 blocks from the Line 6 subway stop. You can get basically anywhere by subway. The hotel is in a great neighborhood. 1/2 block east is 3rd Avenue which is lined with groceries and restaurants, as well as little shops. It's far enough out of Times Square to be peaceful, but close enough to be considered centrally located.StaffOne of the second things we noticed about the Dumont was its excellent staff. The doorman was very friendly and so were the desk workers. They also spoke to us as we went in and out, and almost seemed like our friends by the end of our stay. They were extremely helpful and courteous at all times. The way it should be!The RoomOur room was a quick elevator ride to the 36th floor. (We never had to wait for an elevator, and it was only about a 15 second ride. When we opend the door to our 1 bedroom/2 queen bed suite we were greeted with spectacular views of the city, especially of the Crysler Building. I bet we stood at the window for 10 min. in awe before we even set our bags down. The view was only the beginning. Our room was HUGE. The living room had a foyer type area with a big mirror, coat rack, and arm chair. To the immediate right was a average NYC kitchen. It had a very large refrigerator, as well as all the other amenities you'd expect in any regular kitchen. It was also stocked with dishes and utensils. The living area had a sofa that made out into a bed, an end table, a coffee table, a big desk with a VERY comfortable chair, and an entertainment center with a TV. I know that sounds like a lot of furniture, and it is! But the room still feels very large. There was plently of room for 6 people to move about, even when the sofa was made into a bed and a twin bed air mattress was being used. The bedroom had two of the best beds I have ever slept on in my life. There's a pillow menu and down comforters. The beds were so nice, we're currently looking into where the hotel got them so we can get some for our home! The bedroom also had an arm chair and an entertainment center, as well as a night stand and end table. Right off ot the bedroom is a dressing area with wooden hangers on clothing rods, a safe, and a dresser. Right next to that is a beautiful bathroom. It was bigger than most bathrooms I ever seen in any hotel anywhere. Excluding the tub, toilet, sink, and other vanity area, there was still 25 square feet of walking space! Amazing for a NYC hotel. Both the living area and bedroom had HUGE windows that spanned the entire width of the walls. Not only was the room very comfortable and functional, it was also very fashionable. There were 2 contemporary art pieces framed in each room, and the lightening was spotlights that were adjusted to shine on the pictures, beds, sofa, etc. Each of the lights could be adjusted to be as bright or dim as you liked. The room was just full of fashionable and great touches that I could never tell it all. While I don't know if all rooms are like this, I CAN testify to ours. Our room was 3603 by the way. You could ask for it when you reserve, we just asked for a room with a view, and that's what we got! I'll try to post some pictures of our room when I get them developed. The Second FloorThe second floor of the Dumont is set aside for fitness and comfort. There is a 24 hour fitness room that's free. There is a lot of equipment, each with it's own personal tv that you can watch (change the channel to yours if you like!) and there is even a dvd player under each tv. The 2nd floor also hosts the Oasis Day Spa. Although we didn't use it, it looked VERY nice. Here's a testimate to how kind our staff was: When we arrived at 1:30 our room wasn't ready.. They were cleaning it. But the staff told us that if we wanted we could just go up and use the spa's showers.. even before we checked in! How nice! Anyway, although the hotel is made for fit business travelers (you can also check out yoga, etc fitness tapes and stuff), it is not overpowering. It is a great hotel for anyone. The desk in the room (if not used for business) is great for laying those NYC maps out and reading those brochures!The PriceFor 6 people to stay in a one bedroom/ 2 queen bed - 1 pull out sofa bed it costed 600 dollars. That would even out to about 300 a night per room anywhere else (we would have had to get two rooms at other places because most hotel rooms can't hold more than 4 people) 300 a night is by no means insane for NYC prices, especially for a htoel like this!! It was WELL worth the price! We looked forward to going back to the room everynight!I hope this review, although lengthy, will help you. And I really hope you consider the Affinia Dumont, you won't be dissapointed!!!

<Content>Fantastic! We had booked four nights here and it was the last four nights of our honeymoon after being in San Francisco, Las Vegas and southern Utah. We arrived by cab from Penn station and the door man, Donald greeted us. He has to be one of the most welcoming door men I have every experienced. Even after we checked in and went to our room on the 34th floor, Donald arrived with our luggage almost as soon as we were in the room and he was so helpful in making sure that we had everything we needed and helping us with the facilities in the room; all without being intrusive. The room was fabulously big and had a view that was equally wonderful; we were presented with a beautiful picture of the Chrysler Building all lit up and to our right was the Hudson river. We had a studio room so we had a reasonably sized kitchen along with all the necessary cutlery etc. that you would expect, along with arm chairs and a foot stool, executive desk and chair and a bed that was simply monstrous. Apparently, the beds are custom made for the hotel and you even get a pillow menu to provide you with the perfect pillow to ensure a good nights sleep. The lobby staff were extremely helpful and did their utmost to answer our questions about the best places to go etc, especially Justin, even if he didn鈥檛 know that the Staten Island ferry was free! Next to the hotel is the Barking Dog restaurant which served food all day. You never left feeling hungry, the food was really good and the speed of delivery to your table was especially fast. Our final trip was courtesy of Moses who provided us with the transport to JFK airport. He was extremely polite and friendly and couldn鈥檛 have been more helpful in getting us and our luggage to the check in desk. Just ask at the hotel lobby for Moses!

<Content>Great location I stayed at the Affinia for a week - and loved it. I had used Trip Advisor to help find a good hotel in New York and was not disappointed. I styed in a huge room with the biggest bed I have ever seen. My parents (in 60s) had another room with two huge Queen beds. Both rooms had great views of Manhattan (26th and 28th floors). We used the kitchens in the rooms for breakfasts. It was great having a huge fridge to keep drinks cold. The rooms were spotless - best maid service ever. There are three lifts which you never wait more than a minute for (a bonus in such a big hotel). The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. There is an added bonus of an air-conditioned gym which residents can use 24 hours a day for free. It is quite big - with great views. You can also hire CD players, weights and yoga mats for free.The location of this hotel could not be bettered. The subway is a block away. Times Sq is just 20 minutes away, the Empire State less than five. There are dozens of bars and restaurants nearby (try Sarges for a real US dining treat) and Kimi for fab Japanese food. The Barking Dog (next to hotel) does great buttermilk pancakes, but beware service is slow and it can lack atmosphere.I plan to stay at this hotel again when I am next in the city. It really is good value for New York with rooms much bigger than many more expensive hotels in Manhattan.

<Content>Affinia Dumont is wonderful. We just returned from NYC. The Affinia Dumont turned out to be a very pleasant experience. We go to NYC fairly often, and this is my favorite of the seven or so hotels we've tried over the last six months. The entire staff was most friendly, helpful and energetic. Our room was enormous by NYC standards. Having a kitchen was great. We were on the 35th floor with a spectacular view (especially of the Chrysler building- a wonderful sight at night). My husband and I are walkers, and found the location to be quite a good base for exploring several NY neighborhoods. We'll definitely be back.

<Content>Excellent Stay in the Affinia Dumont Had an excellent 4 night stay in the Affinia Dumont. The room was fantastic and spacious although we never used the kitchen and did'nt really spend much time in the hotel.Stayed on the 36 floor (King suite) which was quiet, good views, clean and spacious. The aircondition unit was getting on a bit but still effective.Had no problems with hot water or lifts.Plenty of resturants around the area, Thai, Italian, mexican, american etc. Guy and Galland's just on the next block does excellent breakfast fare. The hotel was close to the Empire State building and we had no problem walking to Times square, Theatre district, up to central park etc. You can always catch a cab or use the subway, we found walking the best option so take some comfortable shoes and get ready for a crick in the neck as a result of always looking up. Fanstastic stay and would happily go back to this hotel.

<Content>Would stay here again. We stayed here for our first time in May 2006. We had a one bedroom suite, which was decent sized for New York City. The bathroom had a few problems (the drain wasn't working properly and there were a few scuff marks on the walls) but was impeccably clean. The staff was extremely friendly and sent someone up to fix the drain within 5 minutes of us telling them about it. Aveda products in the bathrooms and fresh apples/oranges in our room upon arrival. There is a spa on the second floor that we did not use but seemed (from our trips in the elevator) to be doing good business. The Affinia Dumont isn't extremely fancy but it is nice, clean and has friendly staff. Murray Hill is a nice centrally located neighborhood. We would stay here again.

<Content>Loved the Dumont Great hotel - the front desk staff were great. Housekeeping brought the specialty pillows and extra towels within 5 minutes of request. Doorman opened doors (which isn't all that common in some hotels in the city!) and ran up to the corner to hail cabs for us!We loved this hotel - we arrived early and they just happened to have a room available. They let us check in early, with no extra charge and we luckily had a room on the top floor. The room was very big. I didn't even know that the room was going to have a kitchen! THe room and bathroom were clean and the soaps/shampoos were very nice. The temp of the room was fine and we found that we could easily control it. We didn't order room service although the menu had a good selection and very reasonable charges. It might have been cheaper to order room service than go out to eat - but then again we wanted to experience some of NYC's great restaurants. We never had to wait a long time for an elevator. They had a 24-hour fitness room and these free spa-kits you could use during your stay. In all, we loved this hotel and would definitely recommend it to anyone who can afford it. I wish I could stay here everytime we come to NYC.

<Content>Great stay at the Affinia Dumont I just returned from a 4 night stay at the Affinia Dumont. My husband booked our stay there off the recommendations of other reviewers on this site. We were not disappointed. We loved it! Our room was large and spacious and clean. It included a kitchen with fridge, stove etc. I balked at first at the location of our room (near elevators and a stairwell) having had bad experiences in other hotels. It turned out not to be an issue at all. We never heard a peep from anyone or anything. In fact, we never saw or heard another guest on our floor the whole time we were there. We were on the 30th floor and had a great view of the city. The staff at the front desk was so helpful and friendly, never tiring of our endless questions for directions and recommendations. We will definately stay here again when we return to NYC.

<Content>Even better than the Benjamin We stayed last year at the Benjamin, another Affina hotel. We loved our experience there (see my 3/24/05 review). We wanted to stay in a different part of town so we went with another Affina property. We loved our stay.The Dumont has a hip but cozy feel. In the two days we were there, I felt that the staff (especially the bell hops) got to know us well. They were very helpful with suggestions about restaurants. We had a lot of luggage and two kids, so when I asked the bell hop what he thought about the best way to get to the airport, he volunteered to come up to our room and survey our luggage. He then made arrangements for a driver and coordiated everything from there. That kind of service was common throughout our stay.Our room was on the 33rd floor and overlooked the river. The L shaped layout of the one bedroom until gave a great view. The room was beautiful and very large. It had a full kitchen with a dishwasher etc. At $369 per night, the rate was lower than small rooms in many other hotels in the area. It was also about the same price as a small room that looked directely into the side of a building at the Westin Times Square, which we had stayed at earlier in the week. The room has a lot of nice touches, such as a stereo, two tvs, a large desk area etc. The hotel has a pillow menu and fit kits, which consist of portable CD players, pedometers etc. that can be borrowed by the guests. The beds were very comfortable. What I liked most was that the room was extremely quiet. We brought our kids (9  12) and never felt like we had to police them as we often do in hotels where the walls are thin.The hotel is in the Murry Hill area, which we ended up liking a lot. Despite it's 34th  Lexington location, it has a smaller town feel. By that, I mean that there aren't any hot dog vendors or packs of tourists roaming the streets. There are a lot of restaurants in the area serving a wide variety of cusine, but they mostly appeared to be filled with regulars. There was a 24 hour drug store right across the street. There is also a Guy  Gallard, which is a fantastic place to grab a quick and economical breakfast.I have nothing negative to say about this hotel. It was fantastic. At worst, being tourists, it was a bit far from many of the sights (Central Park, Theater District, Park Ave etc.) that we were visiting. Nevertheless, we liked returning to the area in the evening, so that we could leave the hustle of our days' adventures. On the way out, we were waiting by the elevator and a familiar looking woman was standing there. I did a double take and then realized Carolyn, Donald Trump's advisor in The Apprentice TV show was standing there. She apparantly stays there from time-to-time. She obviously knows good value, as the Dumont offers an outstanding experience.

<Content>NY's best kept secret I stayed at the Affinia in December 05 with my girlfriend. For NY the studio suite was huge, a great change from the shoe boxes you usually get in NY. Good location on 34th Street so only a few blocks from Empire State and a short taxi ride to Soho or the East Village. Rooms are large, well furnished and they also have a little kitchen. Would definately reccommend for anyone staying in NY who has a bit of style as it is away from all the touristy tack around Times Square. Lots of nice shops and restaurants in the area. I would not consider staying anywhere else in NY.

<Content>Great Room! Stayed here with my partner for 3 days to celebrate our 5 yr anniversary and had a fantastic modern room on the 35th floor. Room was really big and had spectacular views over the financial district and Hudson river. Empire state building and Macys's was just a couple of blocks west. The underground was less then 5 mins walk away. Booked through expedia for about 拢165 a night. Staff were really friendly and happily made dinner reseravtions:) Would def recommend but try and get a room with a view!

<Content>Thumbs up A group of us booked three rooms/suites here. We had a studio, which by NY standards, seemed huge. We had a corner room in the back, which was a) quiet and b) had two big windows! and an actual view, i.e., sunlight, and not a brick wall. Our friends had a suite on a high floor with a great view of the Chrysler Building and other people's roof terraces. (As a former New York resident, I am still not immune to real estate envy.) The galley kitchens are a great amenity, even though we did not use ours on this trip. (Our friends, who were traveling with kids and stayed longer, made good use of theirs.) Rooms were attractive and clean, and the front desk staff seemed very pleasant. The location is convenient. Altogether, a good choice.

<Content>Affinity for the Affinia My boyfriend and I stayed at the Affinia Dumont for three nights and we were very pleased with the property. We got a really good deal on Travelzoo ($179/night for a studio with a king bed). First, the staff - very pleasant, accomodating, definitely schooled in guest services. The room - huge. I couldn't believe how large it was for a NY hotel. The bed was extremely comfortable and the bathroom was clean/large enough to be serviceable. The kitchen could have been better outfitted and the room needs a little table and two chairs for guests to eat breakfast or whatever, so that the Kitch part of the set up is more functional. It was nicely decorated, but a little beat up. It was hotel clean. I have stayed in much, much worse places.The location - We liked the Murray Hill neighborhood. We liked NOT being on top of Times Square. A drugstore across the street. A D'Agostino (grocery) right up the block. Nice shops and restos on 3rd. ( Try bagels from Daniel's Bagels on 3rd between 37 and 38th - awesome.) Barking Dog restaurant next to the hotel was OK. We ate breakfast there once. Good coffee and the house-made biscuits were yummy. Transportation - The Lexington Line (4,.5,6) is at Park and 33rd. The hotel is not at a main transfer point like Times Square, but really, you have to juggle stops/change trains wherever you are in NY, so it really didn't matter. Cabs easy to get. We had no problems getting around.Overall - It was a very, very nice experience. We would definitely stay there again, especially if we can get a good deal on the price.

<Content>Breathtaking views from the 35th floor Have just come back from New York City, Stayed at the Hotel Affinia Dumont on East 35th street. We stayed on the 35th floor of the hotel in a one bedroom suite. THe room contained a well equiped and large bathroom and Kitchen. The room and living area was spaceous with two double beds. The views from the two windows were overlooking the river East and buildings like cathedrals and skyscrapers, the views were amazing. The rooms were evidentally cleaned everyday which was very welcome as this has not always been the case for us in the past. The staff in the lobby were very help and informative helping us plan our visit. The hotel is in a good location close to buildings like the Empire State building, departement store Macy's and the Metro. There are good good restaurants around the hotel, and a five minute walk to the cinema and local supermarkets.(These supermarkets are much cheaper than the shops over the road from the hotel, worth checking this out). The traffic noise was still a problem from the 35th floor, no fault of hotel but would recommend ear plugs to block out the noise (the city that never sleeps).

<Content>Loved NYC.....Loved the Dumont We booked the affinia dumont because of the positive reviews on this site and we were delighted with our choice!We paid a good price from Octopus Travel and when we contacted the hotel direct it couldn't match the rate we had secured.Our room was on the 24th floor looking out over 33rd and so didn't have the Chrysler building but still had great views looking downtown.The room was well decorated in nuetral shades and the bed was really comfortable, the pillow menu was a hit as I have memory foam at home and this was one of the choices. Everything was clean and the Aveda products in the bathroom were great. Two small negatives a bottle of water was $6 (ask for a grocery store and use the fridge) and the corridor did not reflect the quality of the room but then you don't sleep in the corridor!Any requests we made of the staff were delt with very promptly whether it was bringing our choice of pillow, extra tissues (even a heavy cold didn't spoil New York) or fixing the TV remote, housekeeping arrived a few minutes after we called reception. Reception staff were also helpful directing us to the nearest grocery store and giving us advice about the subway which was easy to negotiate.We ate in the Barking Dog two or three times and it was fine nothing special but convenient. There are plenty of places a short walk away on 3rd and hey there is the whole of New York just a walk/cab ride away. The subway is a short five minute walk and the Empire State and Macys about 10 mins walk along 34th. Some other reviewers felt the subway was a little disconnected because it is hard to get across town, that's just New York the subway tends to run uptown/downtown while buses are better for crosstown.I would recommend the Affinia Dumont, good size room, nice furnishings/decoration, useful kitchen, good location and helpful staff. New York is a wonderful city and we would love to come back perhaps near Christmas and we would be delighted to stay at the Affinia Dumont again.

<Content>Great Hotel I cant understand the recent two star ratings of this hotel. We stayed for 4 nights in a Juniour Suite which had King Size bed, Study desk, Settee and Kitchenette. We requested a room with both a river view and City view and were allocated a room on the 34th floor with the requested views! ( Email the hotel prior to departure). The room was huge, very clean, was extremely quiet with only 5/6 rooms on each floor and had all the facilities you would need in a room, Air Con, Fridge, Coffee maker and TV with Pay per view movies including some which are only just in our cinema's! The reception desk were helpful whenever we asked a question of them and the concierge couldnt do enough. In terms of the hotels location, It was 10 minutes from Empire State Building, 10 minutes from Macy's and around 15 minutes from Grand Central station. The subway is around the corner on 33rd Street and a ticket anywhere is $2. The last stop downtown is Brooklyn Bridge which is a great place to get off. In terms of the Bar next door, we didnt use it so i cant comment but there is a great Diner around the corner (on the way to 33rd subway) and Breakfast there was fabulous. In terms of the evening dont miss the opportunity to do as the locals do and head right at the hotel to the junction with 3rd avenue. There are around 10 restaurants and bars within 2 minutes of the hotel including Greek, italian and Mexican. This area was very safe and the majority of the restaurants were open air and pavement dining which was great for people watching. Stay at the Dumont and you will not be disappointed. ( Room 3405 is a beauty so get your requests in!

<Content>A definite must! After reading all the positive reviews on TripAdvisor we decided to stay at this hotel at the end of March for a week - we were not disappointed. Dana Hawkes welcomed us to the hotel and gave us a corner suite on the 37th floor so the views were spectacular and the room itself was perfect and extremely clean. The kitchen was ideal for making breakfast in the mornings as there is a supermarket around the corner that sells everything so this was perfect. The bathroom was a fair size, extremely clean with fresh towels and toiletries and was cleaned everyday along with the rest of the suite. The maid even washed up for us! With regards to the area, it was perfect with a villagey feel - we stayed at Time Square last time which was dreadful so this certainly suited us this time. Although a residential area, we were surrounded by boutique shops, classy bistros, sports bars, etc yet only 5-10min walk to Macy's, so the area is perfect for sight seeing.When we go back next year we will definitely stay here again as Dana Hawkes and Glenroy Brown really looked after us. If you want the tackiness and vulgar side of NYC, maybe stay near Time Square and the Novotel because you certainly would not find that in the area of Murray Hill......take my word for it!

<Content>Excellent location, great value, spacious and friendly We are a couple in our 30's visiting New York for the first time for a week, so we were looking for a good location, good value, comfort and quiet to recover from long days sightseeing. The Affinia Dumont was all of the above and more.The Affinia is centrally located in the Murray Hill/midtown area, 3 blocks away from the empire State and a block away from the 6 train which will take you to the all important SOHO and West Village area in less than 10 minutes. We had a 1 bed king room (actually 2 double beds), and we asked for a high floor on arrival which gave us great uniterrupted views over the financial district and hudson river. The room were spacious, spotless, with tastefull comfortable furniture and decor. The desk and workspace area was really helpfull when planning our days. Lots of nice touches like aveda toiletries and fit kits in your room. The beds are super comfy and our high room meant zero traffic noise. There is a gym and spa, which we didn't use but the spa looked great. All the staff were really friendly, got to know you and very helpful in giving city advice, and booking tickets. We ate in the Barking dog once, and ordered room service from there, food was fine. The only thing that this hotel was missing is perhaps a lounge / bar area to relax outside your room, but we didn't really find this an issue. Absolutely recommended, and would stay there again.

<Content>Affinia Dumont Was My Home Away From Home Stayed at Affinia Dumont April 8-15 with my husband and two sons (9  10). I could not find one single reason to fault this hotel. The hotel exceeded my expectations. I read reviews for many other hotels and it seemed that unless you stay at an expensive hotel, you could not have a comfortable and pleasant experience. Affinia Dumont was a five star hotel at an affordable price. We got a great deal through travel zoo, $179.00 a night, and we stayed 7 nights. Our room had two double beds and a kitchen which came in very handy for drinks and breakfast. The room was huge, which surprised me since in NYC space is very limited. The hotel itself was fantastic but on top of that the location was unbelievable. A short walk to many of NYC major attractions. We walked to the Empire State Building, Rockefeller Plaza, St. Paticks Cathedral, Madison Square, Times Square, and Times Square Park. Once we even walked back from the American Museum Of Natural History. The boys (910) enjoyed the lounge area with ipods and very comfy chairs. They enjoyed the huge desk/work area which came in handy when prepping our signs for the Today Show. They enjoyed the pillow menu, and were able to try the down feather and memory foam pillows. There are tons of restaurants, cafes, delis and shops close to the hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I will stay at Affinia again and again averytime I go back to NYC.

<Content>Would stay here again My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights in March. We chose this hotel based on its tripadvisor rating and were not disappointed.We had a studio suite which is the cheapest room, but it was huge. The beds were comfortable, modern decoration, modern clean bathroom and handy kitchen. The location is good. 5 mins walk from the subway at 33rd street, near lots of bars/delis/restaurtants on 3rd Ave, 5-10mins walk from the Empire State Building, but it is still very quiet.Doormen very (but not too) friendly.The only reason we have not given a 5 is the lack of bar/cafe in the hotel. If you dont fancy a restaurant meal and are too exhausted from all the sight seeing to go and get anything else(!), there is no other option.Overall, we would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Brilliant !!! Stayed at the Affinia Dumont in March. Had an excellent stay, New York is fantastic and the Affinia Dumont was a great place to return to at the end of a hectic day.We got upgraded to a suite (living area / kitchen / bedroom and bathroom ). The decor was tasteful, the room was kept spotlessly clean and we received a bottle of wine on arrival as it was our anniversary. The bed was very comfortable and big.Reception was welcoming and Donald our concierge was excellent.As for proximity to the sights - the Empire State building is 5 /10 minutes away, along with Macys. Grand Central is 10 minutes heading up to central Manhattan. It is easy to walk everywhere from here, although you may want to jump in a cab on your way home after a days walking (we only used cabs not buses or the subway).These are very reasonable about 6 to 10 dollars per journey.For breakfast, there are loads of excellent Deli's around to grab a bacon  egg bagel or oatmeal !Overall the Affinia is close enough to all the attractions but is in a quiet spot on 34th street and therefore does not have the mayhem and noise of times square area.We are desperate to return to New York City and when we do, we would not stay anywhere else !!!!Make a reservation, you won't regret it.

<Content>Drab  I have just returned from a 7 Day holiday in New York City and unfortunately made the mistake of booking the Affinia Dumont. I made the choice after reading other trip advisor member reviews and seeing that the hotel is ranked as one of NY's best. I have always been delighted with previous hotels I have booked as a result of trip advisor but certainly not on this occasion. This hotel is best summed up as drab and dreary. Let me explain. The reception area is similar to that of a travelodge/motel. The carpets throughout the hotel are dirty and worn, the room is dreary, no colour anywhere and the hotel smells musty. There is no bar, no restaurant and no where nice to relax after a day in the city. The Affinia is way overpriced for what it offers. Friends were staying at various other hotels in NY and were much closer to everything, paid much less and had much more facilities. The Affinia Dumont may cater for a business person who needs a bed for the night and the company is picking up the tab but if you are a tourist looking to enjoy NYC then please book another hotel. I met friends at the Novotel and can vouch for the superior condition/quality of this particular hotel. To be fair on the Affinia staff, they were friendly and welcoming and the bed was very comfortable however The Affinia is simply just not worth the money.

<Content>Shabby and depressing My partner and I usually decide where to stay in holiday ultimately based on Tripadvisor ratings and we have been delighted with our choices so far. Because the Affinia Dumont received an overall rating of 4.5 and ranked number 3 of all NY hotels, and because the rooms were described as spacious, we booked it. I should point out that we really wanted to stay at other hotels but because we booked late, they were not available.We simply cannot understand the enthusiasm of the other reviewers for Affinia Dumont - its almost like we were at another hotel! How it could rank as the Tripadvisor third most popular hotel in NY is unfathomable! It compares, at best, to a shabby two-star hotel in UK. The lobby and reception are small and shabby. The porters are friendly, but a little over-the-top (15min of extolling the virtues of the hotel when you've just travelled transatlantic on two filghts - enough!). The room was OK, size-wise, but had not been painted for a long time, was very very dull, and did not smell terribly pleasant. Same with the bathroom and kitchen. The kitchen was like something from a very old mobile home/caravan. The decor was dull and dusty and just did not work. The corridor outside the room constantly smelt of heavy cigar smoke, don't know why. On evening after a long days shopping, it started to rain heavily when we got back to our room and we decided to eat in the Barking Dog- this is not actually part of the hotel; it is next door. The food and service at the BD was pretty bad. Would not go back. The other problem was that the hotel was at least a 20min walk to the action/centre/theatres etc. The nearest metro was at 33rd St,., 5 min away but this station was a little disconnected in that only you can go north/south easily but not east/west.What really nailed it for us was that our friends were staying at Novotel on 52nd St. They paid 800 dollars less than us and their hotel was absolutely gorgeous! The bar area was so nice with a great view of Times Sq, the rooms were same size as ours and the hotel was right in the middle of town, but very quiet. We would give Novotel a 4! It had a great bar and a nice restaurant. Going back to our hotel (no bar or decent restaurant) was a chore after we saw Novotel. Our other friends also had much nicer hotels for less money.Overall, we did not like the dingy dull depressing Affinia Dumont and it is not worth anything like what they charge. We usually like to stay at 4star hotels and if you do too, do not stay at Affinia. Please do not be misled by the other reviews, you could do much better. NYC is brilliant though - firedly, clean, safe, buzzing!

<Content>Lovely I read the Trip Advisor review on this hotel and booked it at the last minute for a business/personal trip. I am extremely happy that I did. The positives; the room (junior suite) I stayed in, 3405, has views of both the Chrysler building and the water. it is very large for a NYC hotel room and the price I paid (which was a special) made it a tremendous value. I am not particularly high maintenance so I had little interaction with the staff. They were friendly and the restaurant recommendations were good. The Morgan Hill neighborhood was a treat to wander through (I prioritize character and color over elegance) and there were many good restaurants within a short walking distance. I am a walker and the distance from the common sites was not a problem for me. The train and subway are close. Taxi's were easy to get. Having stayed in many well known NYC hotels at a much higher rate, I am quite pleased with my experience. My preference was to keep this gem to myself but since I did find it on Trip Advisor, I thought I owed you all :-)

<Content>Our own little NYC apartment! my boyfriend and i stayed at the affinia dumont for 5 nights at the end of march, we picked this hotel on the strength of the top reviews on tripadvisor. we requested a room on a high floor and were rewarded with amaaaazing veiws of the city, with the chrysler building right in front of us. we were given such a massive room which even had a seperate lounge/office area which was great to come back to after a tiring day of shopping!the location was perfect, within walking distance to the empire state, times square etc and the taxis are cheap enough for when you can't walk anymore!the affinia was very clean, the staff were very polite and helpful and the barking dog next door is really good too. overall exceptional value for money.i would reccommend this hotel to anyone planning a trip to new york.

<Content>Great Location, staff, amenities Thanks to previous Tripadvisor reviewers! Hotel within a long (30-45 minute) walk or a short cab ride to downtown  theatre district. 8 blocks from Grand Central. Smiling, helpful, knowledgeable Staff- really made you feel special. Large rooms/suites especially by NYC standards(you can even open the windows a little!).Complimentary Fitness center was also very good - free weights, weight machines, many cross trainers, bikes, steppers, treadmills with individual TV/DVD/CD players  headphones. Good channel selection on TV  a pillow menu (wife liked the buckwheat). Very clean, nicely decorated and a value - we paid $199 Friday night and $239 Sat night. Full Refrig., Microwave, Stove, coffemaker, bowls, silverware,wine glasses etc.Try Dan's Bagels at 3rd  37th for true NYC hot bagels. Other restaurants  bars within steps.

<Content>WHAT A FIND! We just moved away from NYC and came into town for a visit...with our daughter and our 70-lb dog. Now if I'd had $500 bucks to spend per night, I'd have probably stayed at the Gansevort. But we were on a $200/night budget. I really couldn't believe our luck to have found this hotel. We had a junior suite for $199/night. It's was extremely spacious, clean and had incredible views. On top of this, the staff was nice, accomodating and very welcoming to our dog. They even provided bowls and a bone. The location was also surprisingly convenient. We even took a nice walk to Central Park one day...and the East Village the next. Of course, the subway is only a block away as well. I would highly recommend this hotel if you're coming to NYC.

<Content>new york hotel We stayed 5 days at the Affinia Dumont March 23-28th and were not disappointed. We chose this hotel based on previous reviews on Tripadvisor which were pretty much accurate reports.The desk and bellmen were the most friendy I have seen with good recommendations for dinner and sights.We had an excellent room on the 34th floor which was a large studio with a kitchen.We made use of the coffee maker and the refrigerator only but one could make a meal there if desired. The bed and pillows were excellent. The bathroom was small but who spends a lot of time in there anyway. Water pressure was good but the water temperature seemed to vary from warm to hot.The view was unbelievable with a vista of midtown that was spectacular with the lit up Chrysler building right in the middle.We did not make use of the dayspa but it looked very nice.Location was excellent as in a residential part of Manhattan with less noise and neon lights then those closer to Times Square.A lot of restaurants on 34th and 3rd with a deliciuos Spanish retaurant behind the hotel on 33rd called Marbella. There are 2 supermarkets on 3rd avenue and a drug store across the street.Subway 1 block away on Park and 33rd street. If you are going to be there for 4-7 days I recommend buying the 7 day unlimited metrocard for 24 dollars as it was well worth the cost for bus and subways.Three excellent places to eat.1.Cafe Boulud-- French expensive but worth it2. Novita -- Italian on 20th and Lexington for Italian3. Antique Garage--Turkish food in Soho on Mercer street.If you are flying in from JFK consider taking the Airtrain to the Long island railroad which gets you to Penn Station for 10 dollars a person off peak and get a cab from there. It is only about 30 minutes from JFK to central Manhattan using this service.I would definitely stay here again!

<Content>Definitely worth a look This is THE place to stay in midtown. Great location, great staff and wonderful room with views of the Chrysler building and sunrise over the East River. Head north on 3rd for wine shops, grocery stores and Sarge's 24 Hour Deli. I would like to try the other Affinia hotels in Manhattan but fear that I have been spoiled by this one...

<Content>More than I expected I had always heard that NYC hotels are overpriced and small. This was neither. I found a great package deal (booked air and hotel bundled together), which made the room relatively inexpensive for the quality. I was very surprised at how large and nice the room was. Here are the positives and negatives:Positives:* large, nicely-decorated, super-clean room at great price* soft bed/sheets* choice of 3 kinds of pillows (all 3 are on the bed already, just ask for more if you want more of one specific pillow) - all 3 are super nice* full-size mirror on wall* quiet A/C - Heater* regular wooden hangers in closet (not the anti-theft kind - classy touch)* complementary, full-size umbrella in room (only for use during your stay - very classy, plus it is available for purchase for under $10 in case it is raining when you check out!)* digital combination safe* desk with herman miller chair* high-speed internet available* kitchen with large fridge, oven/stove, sink, coffee maker, and dishes (yes, there is also dishwashing liquid)* nice marble counter in bathroom* one adjustable mirror next to sink and another in shower* bathroom fully stocked (and restocked daily) with Aveda bath products and soft towels* strong water pressure in shower* very courteous staffNegatives:* toilet paper is very rough (Scott's brand). If I had though about it, I would have walked to the corner store and bought some Charmin or Cottonelle or something.* shower temperature fluctuated from scalding hot to luke-warm, (not so bad as to make the shower experience unenjoyable though. Just had to adjust the temperature a few times during shower)

<Content>The Affinia Dumont was Perfect We just finished a 4 night stint at the Affinia Dumont and everything was great. The rooms are huge by New York City standards ... and included a very comfortable bed, a large desk/work area, and a small kitchen ... the staff were friendly and helpful ... our room was exceptionally clean ... the gym was fine ... The location is fine - a short two blocks to the subway, and an easy walk to many NYC locations ... I booked the hotel about three weeks in advance, but then found a cheaper rate at the last minute ... for the approximate price of $200 per night, it was a super-bargain !!! we would stay there again definitely

<Content>Great Hotel - Great Service! We returned this week from a 7 night stay at the Affinia Dumont and were totally impressed!Our room - a studio room with king size bed - was absolutely spotless and was cleaned (kitchen  bathroom too) to this standard daily. It was spacious, exceptionally comfortable and the kitchen was absolutely ideal for the few occasions when we just wanted to make ourselves a snack / breakfast / eat our take-away! It's also very peaceful - with only a handful of rooms on each floor, there was never any disturbance / noise from other guests walking the corridor.Location is good - it's an easy walk to Macy's and on to Times Square; ESB is also literally a 5 minute walk away. The service provided by staff was fantastic and we have never been made to feel so genuinely welcome in a hotel - the porters  doormen were just brilliant.We've noticed some slightly negative feedback re. the Barking Dog restaurant next door to the hotel. At the end of the day I suppose it might just come down to the type of food / restaurant you enjoy, but again we could not fault the service or the meals served here. Nope, it's not an haute cuisine restaurant but we didn't have that expectation. Food was served promptly, was piping hot, was as described on the menu and was really tasty! (Portions are massive too -excellent value for money!)We would have no hesitation in recommending the Affinia Dumont and we would re-book in a flash. It's a great base from which to explore NYC with the added bonus of exceptional service.

<Content>Great Hotel Stayed at the affinia dumont for 4 nights. On arrival we were given a room on the 6th floor, with no view. After requesting a room on a higher floor we were reserved the 36th floor for 3 nights. The staff were excellent and our bags were moved for us while we spent the day in the city. This hotel is located on east 34th street. It was a perfect location for us as we like to be close to everything but far enough away to get some peace! It was 5-10 mins walk from The Empire State building, Macy's, 5th ave... The view from our room was breath taking - especially by night!! The hotel is very clean, and the staff were polite and helpful.This hotel is in a perfect location if you don't want to stay in the busy, noisier parts of the city. I would definately stay here again and recommend it to anyone!

<Content>Great Place My family and I stayed at the Affinia Dumont for one night and was pleasantly surprised. The hotel is off the beaten track so be ready to walk or to take a cab to Times Square. The staff was friendly and very accomodating. We were traveling with 4 children so the room needed to be roomy and have enough beds for all. We stayed in a one bedroom suite with 2 beds and a pullout. The beds were very comfortable with down comforters and specialty pillows. The kids loved the idea of ordering different types of pillows for their comfort! The bathroom was large with great Aveda products. Withing 2 blocks is a diner..Murray Hill Diner and Starbucks is on the corner. The price was affordable and we would definently stay there again!

<Content>Thoroughly enjoyable stay! My husband and I arrived in a snowy New York on Thursday afternoon and were warmly greeted by the hotel staff. Check in took only a few moments with our luggage being taken up to the room for us.Our room was on the 25th floor and had a fantastic view of the Chrysler Building and other skyscrapers.The room was almost like a mini apartment it had so much space. The King size bed was extremely comfortable and there was even a choice of pillow. Plenty of space for clothes in drawers and wardrobe. Bathroom was compact, but very clean and had plenty of towels and toiletries.The theme of the hotel is fitness, so if you hadn't time to go to the spa or fitness suite you could hire a kit for your room e.g yoga.The Barking Dog restaurant is next door to the hotel. We ate there one evening.The service was good and I had a lovely glass of red wine, but we were very disappointed with the food. The reception staff and doormen were very helpful when asking for directions etc and always greeted us when leaving or entering the hotel.The hotel is a short walk from the Empire State Building and Macey's etc. But you can't go to a city and not expect to do some walking! We walked miles!I would definitely stay here again as we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.

<Content>Great spot The Affinia Dumont was everything that reviewers said it was. Located on the east side of the city in the Murray Hill neighborhood, the hotel is conveniently located to the subway (33rd Street), Grand Central, the Empire State Building, and the Midtown Tunnel. Neighboring restaurants were great (Thai food at the Lemongrass). The area around the hotel was safe and clean. The rooms were unbelievabley spacious (for NYC)--we had a studio which had a king sized bed, a large desk and bureau, tv, large full length mirror, kitchenette, and nice bathroom. Spacious closet with iron and full size ironing board. The rooms were also very clean. We were on the 33rd floor with a grand view to the south--lots of light. The desk staff and doormen were helpful, as well. I did not notice this mentioned in other reviews, but the Affinia is a health-oriented hotel and provides spa services, as well as a large workout space. We got a good rate from Expedia for this hotel, otherwise it is a bit pricey.

<Content>Gorgeous Hotel We stayed overnight at the Affinia Dumont for our weeding anniversary. After reading the reviews I booked the room online and mentioned that it was our anniverary and asked for a free room upgrade. We received a 2 room suite that was enormous by NYC standards. It was very nicely decorated and would be perfect for an extended stay in NYC. We also were left a fruit basket with a personal note of congratulations. It was very nice. We made good use of the Day spa located in the hotel as well. They were quite busy that afternoon but it was nice. Their linens are fantastic and I loved the pillow selection. I loved the comforter so much I ordered one for my bedroom at home. The bathroom was a little small but the rest of the suite was so large it was hardly a complaint.I would recommend them highly

<Content>Good Stay, Functional Hotel in Quiet Area My boyfriend and I stayed at the Affinia Dumont for 4 nights on the basis of the recommendations on this site. Whilst we enjoyed a comfortable stay in the hotel, I would say the hotel just met my expectations which were fairly high in light of the hotel's no. 2 ranking on TA at the time of booking. However, having stayed in NY before on only one previous occasion (in 5* hotel at company's expense), it would be fair to say that I didn't know what to expect for a 3 1/2* hotel and for the $ we paid. Despite the initial downbeat tone of the review, there were many positives. The hotel room was very spacious. We booked a studio suite which contained a great king size bed, comfy chair, nice work area, good sized kitchen area and an adequate bathroom. The decor was in good condition and neutral, albeit we weren't big fans of the duvet cover. We also changed our pillows straight away as we were initially supplied with feather ones (not good for allergies). The kitchen area contained everything you would need to prepare basic meals but we chose not to use it as there are too many great dining options in the city. We also didn't eat at the Barking Dog for the same reason. The bathroom was a little bit small but this was more than compensated by the excellent shower (constant hot water and good water pressure!). I've stayed at a number of hotels which would have been excellent but the shower let it down. I was glad that the Dumont didn't have the same problem.We also liked the location of the hotel. At first we were put off by the nearby buildings which were residential and looked a bit bleak. However, we soon warmed to it. OK, so the immediate location is unlikely to feature in any romantic movies, but was convenient for us gawking tourists who wanted to explore most of the city on foot. The subway on 33rd Street is very close to the hotel and Penn station is only a 10 minute walk which gives you the option of taking the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) to / from JFK. We took the LIRR from JFK to the hotel and were happy to save the $40 compared to our $60 cab fare on the way back. Our first stop was always going to the Empire State Building so it was great that it was a straight walk along 34th from the hotel as we were exhausted after an early flight. Macy's is also nearby for those who love department stores (too much choice for me!). On the negative side, our room was by no means a room with a view. On booking the hotel I specifically asked for a room with a good view of the Manhattan sky line since our stay was for my boyfriend's 30th birthday. Our view was pretty appalling as it overlooked a car park and some other run down buildings. It was a bit of a shock at first so I immediately went back to reception and asked if we could change rooms to one with a view, ideally of the Chrysler Building (which the hotel is meant to offer). Whilst the receptionist was polite about my request, she didn't really make much of an effort to accommodate it and said that she couldn't offer us an alternative room. I found this a bit unusual considering that the hotel was by no means fully booked . I've also read a number of reviews of this hotel where guests were offered an upgrade but that certainly was never offered to us. Not much I could do though so I returned to my room with a dismal view. I doubt the view would have looked much better even if the windows had been cleaned...We had a couple of other gripes as well. Firstly we returned to the hotel one day to get changed for the evening only to find that our hotel room door had been left opened by the maid. We had left her a tip every day as well! Thankfully nothing was missing but that should never had happened in the first place. Our other gripe was that room service finished at 11pm. For the city that never sleeps we found that a bit early. We went to the basketball, theatre, etc in the evenings and would have appreciated being able to get a meal back at the hotel one of the nights as it was so cold outside to walk around. I appreciate that not every hotel can offer 24 hour room service, but midnight would have been good enough for us. Additionally, while the hotel is of a good size, we got the impression that there was lack of staff as no matter what extension we dialled we got through to the same person on reception! Overall, we had a good stay at the Affinia Dumont and would definitely consider returning, perhaps to the Affinia 50 property. However, I think it is only fair that potential future guests are more aware of some of the shortfalls of this hotel. Like everything else, the hotel represented a compromise. In this case the compromise is between space and ambience as the hotel was a bit clinical (as you would expect from a hotel aimed at the business market). I would still nevertheless recommend the hotel to those who regard space as their main priority when selecting a hotel.

<Content>Very Comfortable I am a very particular traveler and found this hotel to be exactly as described by the many other positive posts on Trip Advisor. The Affinia Dumont is simply a very comfortable place to lodge while in Manhattan. The service was excellent from check-in to check-out. The rooms were large, clean, updated and again, very comfortable. The size of the hotel is also a plus-with only 5 or so rooms per floor, the feel of the hotel is intimate as opposed to anonymous. I am returning to NYC at the end of March and will stay again at the Dumont.

<Content>Great Service, Large Rooms Stayed on business on first trip to NYC. Great location within easy walking distance of Empire State Bldg.-Macy's, Madison Square GardenAttached restaurant is average and cramped, recommend walking down to the corner where there are 10 restaurants/sports bars to choose from (Blockhead Burritos was good for a casual dinner)Hotel is Mod Deco and the rooms are very large with full kitchens and good work areas. Did not use Spa, but the workout facility is clean and up to date.Hotel staff (especially the doormen) were ever-present and courteous.One of my associates had issues with the heat, where the heat ran all night and roasted her. I had a opposite issue, where the heat quit the last night. The night-time manager was quick to send someone up to check on it and tranferred me to another room when the problem could not be fixed.We both received credits the next day on our bill.Assuming the heating issues are one-offs, I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Upper Manhatten/34th StreetAlso, neighborhood is safe and quiet and there is even a Duane Reed drugstore across the street (of course there's a Duane Reed on every corner it seems)

<Content>An excellent stay at the Dumont We are a young couple who stayed at the Affinia Dumont for five nights during February 2006. This hotel is presented as a fitness hotel. This means they offer a gym (No pool) for you to exercise in during your stay. They will also provide, free of charge, an exercise pack for your room or suite. These packs centre on a particular theme such as Yoga or Weight Training. The rooms appear brand new and are obviously well kept. They offer a large room in which to sleep (A major plus against other NYC hotels) with two queen size beds in a studio suite. The bathroom is again large with a bath and shower and a large wall mirror. All the rooms come with a small kitchen with appliances such as: cooker, fridge freezer, microwave and coffee maker. This kitchen is ideal if you have small children and you need to provide food as and when. The view from the windows can be great so ask for a high floor. The television is large and offers several high end channels such as HBO and childrens entertainment, so there is plenty to watch if you decide to stay in. The room also has a small electronic safe for any valuables which is free of charge. They also offer a pillow menu where you can you choose pillows such as Swedish Memory.The location of the hotel is ideal being 4 blocks away from the Empire State Building and one block from 33rd Street subway. If you fly in from JFK the hotel is not far away from the tunnel which leads to the highway towards the airport. Around the hotel there are several bars and restaurants and various grocery shops which are ideal for getting supplies for the room. The staff at the hotel are great and if you need anything such as a restaurant recommendation of how to get to somewhere just ask and they will help. Once a week the hotel has a meet the staff session with free wine, cheese and a massage!To conclude this is an excellent hotel with an excellent location and staff whom bend over backwards to ensure your have a great stay.

<Content>Developing an Affinity for this Hotel Reservations: Got a great rate thru the links at Trip Advisor.Check-in: Efficient, courteous and highly professional.Room: extremely large by New York standards, especially at this price. It was well furnished with comfortable beds, and the rest of the furniture was in good condition. Nice kitchenette for those inclined towards in room dining. The bathroom was large and nicely appointed, with excellent soaps and shampoo. The towels were average BUT certainly not luxurious. The water pressure and temperature was excellent. The television was nice.Check-out: excellent and fast.The location in Murray Hill is convenient to MidTown and most parts of Lower Manhatten.Additional comments: we had to ask twice to have the toilet fixed (it was continuously running) and NO one ever showed up to fix it.The gym was very nice by hotel standards.Like most hotels they still charge about $10 per day for internet access; when will this be included in the normal room charge? Who these days wants to sit in the hotel lobby for free internet access?

<Content>A Greate Place To Stay - Definitely Recommend! We took the advice of the recommendations given on TripAdvisor and boy you were right! This place is a gem in the big apple! We stayed for two nights this weekend and had a fantastic room overlooking the East River on one side and the city skyline on the other. It was a wonderful corner room on the 29th floor. We made the reservation over the internet for a junior suite, and then called up a few days later to ensure we had room with a view. They were very accommodating! We were able to watch the sunrise over the East River - it was quite beautiful. The room itself was quite big with a king size bed, an executive desk, couch, chair, coat rack, and fully equiped kitchen. The bed was the most comfortable bed we slept on in all our hotel experiences. The kitchen was great - it had a gas stove, full size refrigerator, and built-in microwave oven. The bathroom was a good size bathroom, however, it didn't have much shelf space. The hotel had a fully equipped gym and a day spa. We looked around at the gym and the spa but did not have time to use the facilities. They both looked wonderful. The staff at the hotel were quite acccommodating and friendly. They got cabs for us, and gave us detailed maps and directions about the city. We highly recommend this place and would definitely return! Great place!

<Content>Excellent Value! My husband and I spent one night at the Affinia Dumont in NYC on Feb 18th. After scouring the internet for good deals on hotels, we came across this one. For the money, it was an excellent value. The rooms were very spacious, clean, modern. Comfortable beds and pillows. The staff was very helpful and friendly. Parking was easy and not terribly expensive-35 dollars for every 24 hours. The only negative is its not centrally located, thus you spend a good deal of money taking cabs everywhere. I would definitely stay at this hotel again though and absolutely recommend it!!

<Content>A nice stay at the Affinia Dumont My boyfriend and I stayed on Valentine's day and enjoyed the hotel. We picked it based on Tripadvisor reviews, and while I think that there are probably much nicer hotels in New York City, that it was a good value and very comfortable. We stayed in a one bedroom suite. The living room is nice but not spectacular, with a big desk a couch, television, dvd and music players. The kitchen was small but necessary for us, as we decided to cook for ourselves. There were a few pots, some plates, forks, knives, the generally necessary utensils. The bedroom was lovely with a huge and comfortable bed. We loved the fluffy white comforter and the pillows (they have a pillow menu from which you can choose buckwheat, hypo-allergenic, and swedish memory!) I recommend the hypo-allergenic. Everything was clean and just fine in the room.What I loved most about the hotel was the service. We called housekeeping for a sharper knife and they brought it with a smile. The same housekeeper brought us our pillows, and the toothpaste we requested in the morning. The staff was very nice and that matters a lot. Overall, a nice stay, and we would stay there again.

<Content>One word...Excellent! One word....Excellent!!!! I was worried which hotel to pick after booking a suprise 3 night stay away for my girlfriends birthday. The hotel staff were always nice and helpful and the rooms were brilliant, loads of space. If i was to go back to New York i would deffinately be choosing this hotel again. If there was a downside for someone it would probably be that it is 10 min walk away from Times Square but that wasn't a problem for us. Would recommend this hotel to everyone!!

<Content>Perfect Christmas We stayed at the Affinia Dumont over the christmas holiday, 2005 - and through the new york transport strike. it was perfect. the location is excellent - near enough all the sights, and quiet enough for a little rest from the hustle and bustle. because of the transport strike we walked everywhere! the staff were courteous, friendly, helpful... the bar and resaurant next door makes a wonderful breakfast and the treat of having room service on christmas day was great fun. we were there for 8 days and so having a small kitchen made the room seem much more homely. highly recommended. can't imagine we'd stay anywhere else in ny

<Content>Comfortable stay at the Dumont We stayed at the Affinia Dumont after being transferred from the Shelburn. It was for a 60th birthday trip organised by my family. We were given a suite with a view of the Chrysler building. The hotel is ideally placed for sightseeing. The staff were extremely helpful and full of advice. We had a problem with the safe in the room but each time maintenance attended immediately and sorted the problem. It was eventually traced to the fact that we had placed a mobile phone inside, once this was removed all was okay. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone. the Barking Dog Restaurant attached to the hotel is also a great place to eat.

<Content>Honest Assesment Stayed three nights first week in January. Good rate of $249/night through Affinia website. Arrived around 1:30 pm, luggage promtly taken by porter curbside. Check in prompt and friendly. Request for upper floor room w/ a view granted. One bedroom suite 22nd floor with a great view of Chrylser bldg and city. Room was very good size for NYC and spotlessly clean. Aveda toiletries, great beds, small kitchen (which came in handy for snacks/drinks). Noticed heater was making loud rattling noise. Called front desk - maintenance had it fixed in 20 minutes. Suite had a good sized work desk for biz travelers. Showers steaming hot with great pressure. Turn down service was perfect. Some street noise even 22 floors up but hey, this is New York! Decor is contemporary but not over the top so.Location is excellent. Several great restaurants one block away on 3rd. Greek restaurant, Ethos, had the best baby lamb chops I have ever had. Murray Hill Diner, also one block away,awesome for breakfast. Duane Read Drug Store directly across the street very convenient. This hotel is in a renovated former apartment bldg. The lobby is small but fine. There seemed to be not more than 4-5 rooms on each floor. The theme of the hotel is fitness but we did not really use those facilities. There were only two SMALL negatives. First the elevators were a little scary. We actually got stuck between floors once for a minute and they were a little bouncy. Affinia had elevator repair people there during our stay. This was nothing major and shoud not deter anyone from staying there. Second, the doormen were a bit spotty. What I mean by that is that sometimes they were there and sometimes they were not. When we did see them they were courteous and friendly.Overall this is a very nice hotel in a great part of town and is part of a chain that seems to be making quite a name for itself with its various properties throughout NYC. You should not expect over-the-top white glove service as you might at the Four Seasons, Trump, The Pierre, etc., etc., Just a very nice, very clean no hassle stay. Definetly above average, perhaps just shy of excellent. If you can book a room under $200 or a suite under $300, grab it! Would I try one of Affinia's other NYC properties? Absolutely! Hope this helps.

<Content>Acceptable but not #2 in New York Stayed on the basis of TripAdvisor reviews in early December. As others have said, the hotel is very well positioned, the staff are friendly and helpful and the main bedroom large and clean. The bathroom was rather small; the kitchen was fairly useful but could be better employed. The bed was very comfortable and the furniture and carpet OK, but showed wear and tear. The view was unexciting. There is a very small public area.The hotel was perfectly adequate for our needs but it is not first class. In my view, it should only enjoy its premier position in TripAdvisor鈥檚 hall of fame by charging relatively low rates. We however paid 拢322 (about $550) on average per night via expedia - which is about twice the rate that I think the hotel is worth. It was of course Christmas but I believe the room was still significantly overpriced. At half this price, the Affinia Dumont would warrant an 鈥渁verage鈥?to above average rating.

<Content>Was ok We stayed at this hotel for a week over christmas. We found the location very good, great restaurants and bars on third avenue which is a blocks walk away.The staff were extremely friendly and informative. The rooms were big but the bathroom was on the small side. We could not help but think that the kitchen was space that could have been but to better use say a bigger bathroom.Overall we found our stay at the Affinia |Dumont to be pleasant but not as good as other hotels we have stayed in like Omni Berkshire.

<Content>It's the only place to stay! This is a great hotel and I would highly recommend it. The rooms are large, clean and nicely decorated. One of the best features of this hotel if you stay on a high floor (we were on 21) are the views. We had a fantastic view of the Chrysler building. The staff are extremely friendly and welcoming. We will definately go back.

<Content>First Class Stay My wife and I stayed at the Affinia Dumont hotel during a long weekend trip to New York over Thanksgiving Weekend at the end of November. We booked entirely having read reviews on TripAdvisor and were not disappointed. It was my wife鈥檚 first trip to NY and I asked if we could have a room with a good view on a high floor and we were given an excellent room on the 32 floor with amazing views to the Chrysler Building and beyond. The reception staff and concierge team were excellent throughout the stay and went out of their way to be helpful and welcoming to us.Our room was very large 鈥?unbelievably so by Manhattan standards, well equipped and spotlessly clean. The bed was huge and very comfortable, the linen excellent and importantly it was very quiet. I stay in a lot of hotels on business and this felt extremely good. We didn鈥檛 use the kitchenette or the hotel restaurant next door 鈥?there were too many other places to go 鈥?you MUST go to balthazarny in SoHo 鈥?but book before you go 鈥?it鈥檚 amazing. If I had one criticism it would be the size of the bath 鈥?but I鈥檓 6鈥?鈥?and don鈥檛 often find hotel baths big enough 鈥?it was fine for my wife.The location is perhaps a couple of blocks further south than you would choose in an ideal world, but pretty much everything is in walking distance or a quick cab.This is the second hotel we have picked entirely as a result of its rating on this site (the other being the Hotel L鈥橝bbaye in Paris earlier this year) and I would commend it to you.

<Content>Everything We Hoped For We took our 2 sons (ages 12 and 8) to NYC for 3 nights to see the sights and stayed at the Affinia Dumont. It was fabulous. The hotel has a very small personable feel. The lobby is quite small but elegant. It feels like your own personal place. We had a junior suite that we got for $209 per night (I got that special rate directly from the hotel on the phone.) It had a great King bed (luxurious and so comfortable)and comfy pull-out sofa for the boys. The suite was one large room (#1905) set on a corner and shaped like an L -- very large. We overlooked the Chrysler building out one window and the East River out the other. Fabulous views if you can get up to the top 10 floors. We had a nice kitchen complete with dishes, pots, toaster, microwave and oven/stove and big frig. The bathroom was brand new, marble, and worked great -- strong shower, lots of shelves, hooks, racks and counter space -- great for 4 people. We also had a desk/dresser unit with an office type chair. The sofa also had a nice round coffee table and a big stuffed chair. There was also a big closet and ironing board and safe near the front door.The central location was great too. When we arrived by train we walked from Penn Station with our three rolling bags -- just 6 blocks east to the hotel. We also walked back from seeing the Producers at 44th and 8th last night (although my 8 year old did whine a little). The staff couldn't be nicer. They helped us get theater tickets and were great following up with me while I was back home. When we got there they had not made up the sofa bed for the boys so we called down at 10pm the first night. The housekeeping staff had already left so the manager ended up coming up with a really nice comfy down comforter and actually made the bed himself. There were 2 grocery stores within 2 blocks (one a Dagastinos) where we bought bagels and cereal for breakfast each morning and ate in the suite (looking at the great view). There is also a great little bar/restaurant next door called the Barking Dog where we got a wonderful late dinner one night. We also ate a block away at Blockhead's Burritos which had great mexican food that we all loved and great margaritas. There are 5-7 other small restaurants nearby, including a McDonald's and a Blockbuster across the street. My husband also worked out in the gym every morning (there is also a small spa that smelled great). All in all, this hotel is great!! And what a deal!!

<Content>A quality stay at the Affinia Dumont I highly recommend staying here...it's number two on tripadvisor for a reason!As soon as you enter the hotel, you are struck by the relaxed atmosphere and pleasant staff. Nothing is too much trouble and the staff will go that extra mile to ensure that you have a great stay. For example, when we arrived at the hotel we asked for a room with a view, if possible and sure enough we got a fantastic corner suite on the 30th floor that had an amazing panoramic view of the skyline.We got a Junior Suite. It was incredibly spacious. From my past New York experience I was expecting a cupboard but it was impressive in size. The kitchen has a family sized refridgerator, coffee maker, microwave, oven etc...We ate some of our meals and snacks on the sofas in the seating area which had a big coffee table.The bed is huge (King sized and then some!), comfortable and a pillow menu is on hand to guarantee a good night's sleep.The desk area is large and I would imagine great for business visitors although we hardly ever used it except to store stuff on.The TV has all the channels you could want including HBO etc. The only gripe I had was that you couldn't really watch it in bed unless you physically turned it round....The bathroom was okay - probably the least attractive room. The shower had a propensity to go from hot to cold unpredictably and the worst point was that the bath didn't drain properly. However, the Aveda toiletries went some way to make up for that!The hotel also had fitness facilities and a spa. I didn't actually take advantage of these but I imagine that they, like the rest of the hotel, were of a high standard.Next door to the hotel is the Barking Dog restaurant, a neighbourhood place, that serves good standard dishes. We ate there a couple of times and thought it was good value.All in all we enjoyed our stay. Would we stay there again? Definitely.

<Content>Great Hotel, Fantastic Service I stayed here for one night with my husband. We stayed in a studio suite, which was the biggest room I've ever had in NYC. We loved having a full size fridge to store drinks and it was lovely being able to make hot tea in the morning. We had burgers next door at the Barking Dog for lunch and it was really good. The service was a bit hasty as it was extremely busy, but still good overall. The service at the Affinia Dumont is the best I've ever experienced in a NYC hotel. The doormen were so helpful and really knew the city inside and out. The front desk staff were efficient and very friendly. The staff just really helped to make the stay extra nice. Overall, just a great hotel. This and the Westin in Times Square are my favorites.

<Content>Great Location, Great Price Stayed here for our first visit to NY.It's a great location, not far from the empire state bldg, you'll never get lost using this as your landmark !Rooms were lovely. V modern and quite spacious, with great views (ask for a high floor, if you're brave).The barking dog restaurant next door was brilliant. Ate there every morning for breakfast and then walked it off all day.We only stayed 3 days which just wasn't enough. Can't wait to return.You must go to the Rainbow Room Bar/Rest (65th flr Rockerfella Centre) if only for a drink. Very classy, made my trip.

<Content>Fantastic hotel! Great service, very clean and comfortable! We booked Affinia Dumont based solely on reviews from this site and we made the right choice!We had a basic double room and it was fantastic - I can only imagine what the bigger suites are like! The room was big and spacious with a very comfortable bed, comfortable armchair, large desk and chair, plenty of drawer space, and a decent size wardrobe with a safe. The bathroom was fairly small but very clean and well kept, with Aveda products and plenty of towels. Iron and ironing board were in the room as well as a hairdryer. The room also had a kitchen with fridge, cooker and microwave. There is a big TV of course and also a radio with CD player.The staff are incredibly friendly and extremely helpful, and the location of the hotel is amazing - less than 3 blocks from the Empire State Building! We asked for a high floor and got the 25th, with a fantastic view of the Chrysler Building on the other side of the hotel.This is a really great hotel, very comfortable and a perfect base for visiting New York - do not hesitate to book, we were there for 5 nights and we will definitely return!

<Content>Better than expected My wife and I stayed at the Affinia Dumont over the Thanksgiving weekend with our choice of hotel based solely on the recomendations from this site. We were not disapppointed and to be honest the room we had on the 10th floor was even better than we had hoped for.The staff we came across were all very helpful and polite considering their work was keeping them away from their families on thanksgiving and nothing seemed like too much bother for them.The location of the hotel was in a quieter area of the city but still allowed for easy access to what we wanted to see. I cant comment on the restaurant as after the comments here we decided to eat elsewhere. The Frontier diner on 3rd avenue at 37th street was reasonably priced for breakfast and the food was good.If I were to return to New York, I would definitely make this my first choice for accomodation and would advise my friends and colleagues to stay here also.

<Content>huge room Have just returned from a four night stay at the Affinia after recommendations from Tripadvisor. The hotel was all I expected and more! Although we arrived early, not expecting our room to be ready, it was, infact the receptionist askedif we minded being upgraded to a larger room!! Upon entering the room we were treated to the largest NY hotel room i have seen with two queen beds, a large double size desk/ TV area and a fully fitted kitchen.As there are only about 6 rooms on each floor we never heard any noise (apart from the taxi horns downstairs!).Each member of staff we dealt with were friendly and helpful and the lobby, although not having a bar area was pleasant and relaxing. Unfortunately the only thing letting the whole experience down was the Barking Dog restaurant next door where the food was fairly standard fare. Despitethis it definately filled a gap for hungry travellers straight off the flight from London!!The hotel was well placed on 34th Street for walking to all attractions/shops and we only needed to take a taxi once the whole time when we found ourselves on 80th Street after a stroll through Central Park!I will definately be recommending this hotel to all my friends and will definately choose the Affinia again if I return to NY.

<Content>Ideal centre from which to tour NY We chose this hotel for a short break in October on the strength of the recommendations on Trip Advisor and we were not disappointed. It's ideally situated in a pleasant part of town withing two blocks of the Empire State Building. The staff were charming and completely helpful. Our room was really more like a mini apartment with a generous sized bedroom complete with excellent desk facilities for those who need to work while on their visit. It had a generously proportioned, well-equipped kitchen and a very well appointed bathroom with good quality toiletries. The standard of the decor throughout was excellent. This was our first trip to NY and the Affinia Dumont was a major contributor to the best short break we've ever had. This was superb value - 3 nights for 2 people, plus 2 return flights from Heathrow for a little over 拢1000. We had a simply wonderful time. Can't recommended it highly enough!

<Content>Great for the location and service鈥?4/5 Ok so I went in Feb 2005 and am only just posing a review. Main reason been I was unsure as to whether I enjoyed the Hotel for what it was or enjoyed the hotel because I was simply in New York.We arrived at about 10:30pm Local time after a long flight from London. We were greeted at our Cab outside the hotel by a Friendly Gentleman who took our bags and put them on a trolley. I was only 20 at the time and I took my 18 year old girlfriend so upon check in I had to provide a credit card. (I used a photocopy version). We were then taken to about the 22nd floor and shown a room which I was impressed with but had two single beds. I ask for a King and without hesitation was taken to the 33rd floor and sure enough a King size bed with an Amazing view. (Looking out eastwards I think.) Unpacked and went straight downstairs where the same door man (a guy with a mustache and of Asian origin I think) called us a cab to time square.The next day I wanted to check the reservation I made at The River Caf茅 was still ok. But me being me I had booked the wrong date鈥?The young black lad on reception preceded to get us a reservation for the day we wanted鈥nd he succeeded. Overall the trip was amazing and the hotel made every effort in making this a better stay. Sure there are no lavish reception halls or Club Bars but for the price and service I would highly recommend this hotel. 4/5

<Content>Overrated, is everybody reviewing the same hotel? I'm not sure that everybody is revewing the same hotel here. The Affinia Dumont is certainly not opposite Penn Station!I was extremely disappointed with the hotel, aside from the large rooms it didn't really do much for me. Despite a request when the booking was made (several months ago) for a high room with views we were on the 10th floor, they only had high floors available with single beds. No major problem but a little customer care goes a long way. The Concierge was actually whoever was on reception and in this instance was very poor, a request to confirm some restaurant reservations that we had made was noted but not acted upon, we discovered this when the restaurants in question rang to confirm our reservations themselves several hours later. When we requested information on getting to the airport we were pointed to the station and told that they couldn't call us a shuttle bus, we would have to do it ourselves!The rooms were large but old fashioned, the air conditioning units were very loud and I dread to think what it must be like during the summer. Noise from adjoining rooms and across the hallway was especially prevalent, lots of hotels have locked adjoining doors to rooms but the gaps between them left a lot to be desired and televisions and telephone conversations were clearly audible despite not being particularly loud and so much light came through from the neighbouring room that we had to block the doorway with towels.Overall I was disappointed and would have preferred a smaller room with better services. I struggle to understand why this is even in the top ten hotels in New York, let alone ranked number 3!

<Content>A pleasant surprise. This hotel is quite nice and clean, with huge rooms, excellent showers, comfortable beds, and very clean throughout. The gym has many options for however you like to work out. The neighborhood has tons of options for bars, restaurants just around the corner on 3rd. The funny thing is, the breakfast is delivered in a brown paper bag like it was picked up elsewhere, but it was good, just nothing fancy. I usually stay downtown in hipper hotels, which this place isn't, but if you're ok with not running into wannabes, it's fine. However, for the price, around $379 + tax, broadband internet should be included in-room, instead of the $45/week charge.

<Content>A gem We stayed here whilst it was beeing refurbished so were a bit apprehensive. We needn't have been. We entered the reception area and were surprised to find rennovations were almost complete, and was now looking extremelygrand and luxurious. The clerk was most helpful giving us all our special requests and upgraded us free to a suite. The lifts were plentiful and quick.Our room was extremely clean, the linen white and expensive, and the en-suitewas new and obviously recently remodeled. The only down side was no view but being in New York for the first time didn't matter as we were out all the time. This hotel is also directly opposite penn st station so no need for a taxi, just walk across the road. We have told all our friends not to stay anywhere else and cant wait to return.

<Content>Great Hotel I stayed at the Affinia Dumont at the start of October. I thought the overall standard of rooms, service and facilities were excellent. Check in was quick and easy, 4 lifts, all in order, all of the time. I was on the 32nd floor with views downtown.The room was large with two double beds, a kitchen (with fridge freezer, oven, microwave plus pans, cutlery, plates etc), plus large desk and chair, plenty of wardrobe space and decent mirrors. The bathroom was smart with a powerful shower and Aveda toiletries (lovely!).I never heard any of the other guests while there which made for a very peaceful stay. I didn't make use of the spa but would if I stayed again. There's also internet access in the lobby which was useful as I'd not brought a computer. The staff here were extremely helpful. They helped me work out which trains to get where and when I needed to see a doctor they put me in touch with one. Overall I would highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay again. The only criticism I would have is that the phone calls made from the room were very dear (although I suppose that's true of most hotels).

<Content>It doesn't get any better than at THE AFFINIA DUMONT... I have stayed in a fair share of hotels over the years and my whole experience at the Affinia Dumont was wonderful! We had a 1 bedroom suite for 5 people and it was fine. Having a kitchen was terrific! The service was exceptional and the staff couldn't have been more helpful or polite. Especially when you compare them to others in NYC, but that's a whole different story. The hotel even smells nice when you first enter. Kind of like a Spa. The location on 34th Street is great, unless you're wanting to be closer to Time Square. The subway is only 2 blocks away and you are surrounded by deli's and excellent coffee places. Ms. Iris Stacey was the manager of the hotel at the time of my stay, and she was the best! Stay here and enjoy yourself.......it's worth the money!!!

<Content>Affinia just gets it! This my third stay with Affina Hotels. Are these guys anywhere besides New York? They just get it right every time! Affina 50, Affinia Gardens and now the Affinia Dumont. Every time I stay I am wow'ed. The rooms are comfortable and stylish. (stole some ideas for my bedroom at home)The staff seems to know me, (not sure how they do it) and they make me feel right at home. After running aroud the city all day it is great to be able to let your hair down as soon as you walk through the front door.The Affinia Dumont has this fittness theme that is incredible. Stretch of the day, awesome gym, even found time for the best massage I have ever had at their Oasis spa. I cannot recommend Affinia highly enough. Don't take my word for it. Try them. I keep searching for Affinia in other cities. I am spoiled.

<Content>Fabulous! Fantastic hotel. This review is for women who love shopping and hate camping:) We got a deal $318/night CAD and it was worth every penny. The service was fabulous and the room was huge and clean. They even gave you a choice for pillows...buckwheat, hypo-allergenic, and duvet filled:) It was a studio room and came with a desk area that had all the business necessities you need (desk,fax, ups outlet etc.) The room had a sitting area and a kitchenette ~ how great is that! All the bathroom products were aveda...need I say more. The location was great too. It was a comfortable part of town. We were on the 23rd floor and our room faced 34th street/chrysler building. I was looking to book some hotels around times square ~ thank goodness I didn't...that place is a mad house. The hotel has a resturant attached 'Barking Dog'...the food was good and priced reasonably. Right down the street is Macy's - heaven. Tip for all you 'Sex and the City' fans...I know, I know its done and over with - I don't care...I did the tour it and loved it, even my husband who is not a SC fan liked it too.

<Content>Perfect stay We stayed four nights at the Affinia Dumont in October 2005, and found it to be perfect in every way. The Junior Suite was spacious with a huge work table and return (for a computer). The lighting was excellent (so often lacking) and the bed was super-comfortable (although the King bed was a little too bouncy which made it hard for two people to sleep, so we requested a change to two Queens and they also gave us a nice view with the change on our second day). The fully equipped kitchen was a great convenience, to store our wine, cheese, milk, etc., and we even made breakfast two mornings. The kitchen was spotless, including the regrigerator, microwave, dishes, etc. The bathroom was also spotless. The shower was powerful and the toiletries are excellent quality. When this is described as being in a residential neighborhood, that may be true, but it is a plus. There are delis, flower shops, restaurants, even a D'Agostino grocery store, on every block. Everything you could want is within a block or two. The staff were extremely helpful, friendly (see Donald for all your luggage and cab needs - he is adorable) and responsive. Do not eat at the Barking Dog next door; it is mediocre at best. There are plenty of other places. I did not even visit the fitness center or spa, and if I had, I am sure I'd have even more positive things to report. I will stay here again.

<Content>Brilliant!!! Where can I begin. We arrived fairly early and being on our honeymoon we had requested a room on a high level. The room was not quite ready for us, so the porter took our cases and we went and eat next door at the Barking Dog. Just to add, food is superb from here highly recommend it. Getting back to the hotel, our room was the biggest I had ever been in, it was a studio apartment, but the bed could have slept four adults. Reading other reviews saying that new york hotels have the smallest rooms. If you want space come to this Hotel. We also had a kitchen with everything you could need. The views were amazing and the location was five minutes walk from empire state building. We loved New York and would definately go back to this Hotel. The staff were very helpful and would do anything for you ( and I dont believe this was just to recieved a tip either )Its a three star hotel, but I would give it five stars.

<Content>Welcome here any time I could recommend this hotel to everyone, but I want a room here again the next time I visit, so let's keep it a secret. Clean, upscale, modern and with all the accessories/amenities you could want, including free use of a pedometer and CD player while you are there! We arrived late (at 1:00am) and they didn't have the exact room we requested (we wanted a high floor, king bed, non-smoking), but they upgraded us to a Jr. Executive Suite for our whole stay complimentary! Great views, excellent location and comfy beds, Aveda products, a kitchen that you can actually cook in, and never once did anyone bother us, including any noise from any other room! Can't say enough about our stay! Wonderful! Some say that the price can be a bit hig, but we got our room for $250/night including taxes  everything from Northwest Airlines website under their hotel section.

<Content>loved this hotel! my husband and i stayed at this hotel on the basis of the reviews on here.We werent disappointed! it was an excellent hotel. Great location. within easy walking distance of the Empire State Building and surrounding parks/shops. We must have had the best view in the hotel! although i'm sure most views (except maybe the rooms on lower floors) in this hotel are wonderful. Our junior suite had picture windows down two sides of the room and the view of the Chrysler Building was just fabulous.Staff were friendly and the room and hotel were spotless.A friend of ours who stays in New York on a regular basis, usually at one of the more 'upmarket' hotels, came to see our hotel and said he would be staying there from now on.Cant recommend highly enough!

<Content>Made the holiday Everything about this hotel was perfect, great location,great room, great staff.There was absolutely nothing to find fault with, every request was dealt with quickly and courteously by the extremely friendly staff. The room was huge, with great storage space and a large screen television,the air-con worked perfectly,coping with outside temperatures in the high 80s.The room was very well soundproofed,we never heard anything from any other guests,which is one of my pet hates, and we also had a great view of the East river (we were on the 26th floor)The area around the hotel is nice to explore and has loads of good bars and restaurants within easy walking distance, it is also very handy for the centre and is only a couple of blocks from the Empire States bulding.One other thing, my wife was delighted with the Aveda bath products!Dont be put off by a couple of bad reviews, this is a great hotel.

<Content>Brilliant Hotel !!!!!!! I had been planning my 40th birthday celebration and decided that 5 days in NYC was definately a way to remember it. Having booked my flights seperately, I searched through many hotel brochures and was dissapointed by most of what I found. However when I found the Affinia it took 2 mins to book this hotel.The web site was informative and helpful, and the rooms were an exact replica of the pictures on the website.The location was perfect, 1 minutes walk away from Penn station, couple of blocks away from Times Square,right opposite Madison Sqauare garden, couple of blocks walk away from Empire State buildingThe staff were curteous , helpful, cheeful and welcoming. When I needed to get an adaptor for my laptop or needed to request a late check out the front desk were quick to help me.The doorman tapped his cap each time we entered or left the hotel.The room was excellent, I had a junior suite with 2 bathrooms, high speed internet acces, a bottle of wine and chocolates on my arrival,comftable king size bed, commanding views of the skyline,supurbly equipped kitchen,lovely decor, the list goes on !!!!!!.The rooms were spacious and more than adequate from my wife, my 8 and 6 year old boys and me to share.We never felt like we were living on top of each other as you do in some hotel rooms.I have stayed in NYC on 3 other occasions and the hotels I chose were left in the dust by the facilities and amenities at the Affinia.All in all I found the Affinia great value for money. I am planning another trip to NYC and I will definately be booking the Affinia

<Content>Comfort, convenience, great views... Too many New York hotels are legendary for having (a) rooms the size of postage stamps, (b) a surround-sound of constant noise, (c) web sites that bear no resemblance to their reality, and (d) prices far higher than the actual level of your experience. Blessedly, none of these things is true of the Affinia Dumont.This hotel is defined by two physical facts: its location in Manhattan, and its height. The block of East 34th Street on which it's located will never be the culminating scene of a romantic Hollywood movie full of visual cliches about New York. But it's fabulously convenient for anyone driving into or out of Manhattan, since it's a couple of blocks from either the exit of the Queens-Midtown Tunnel or the 34th Street exit from the FDR Drive, and offers a straight shot west to the Lincoln Tunnel entrance on the other island of the island. The location also leaves the hotel out of the traffic crunch and noise carnival nearer the heart of midtown. And it has great access on foot to the Empire State and Grand Central. Walk a little east and south, and you're in the heart of Murray Hill. The hotel's height -- 37 stories -- is also crucial, since that means that its rooms above 30 stories are remarkably quiet for Manhattan. And rooms on those floors also have commanding, handsome views of the Chrysler Building and other skyscrapers to the north, and the East River to the east.Room decor in the Affinia Dumont is comfortable and rather corporate, without being fussy or ornate. We had a junior suite for two nights and found it spacious for two people. Beds are very comfortable, mirrors abound, and high-speed Internet connections are in every room. The staff is faultlessly polite and cheerful, and the in-house spa and work-out room are welcoming and well-equipped.If there's a drawback, it's the absence of any public spaces, shop or restaurant in the hotel proper. The lobby is small and sleek in a nondescript kind of way -- no place where you'd want to linger. The adjoining restaurant, the Barking Dog, is cute as a cafe, but its role in providing room service leaves a lot to be desired, for a hotel that aims to offer luxury/boutique service. For example, breakfast orders are brought to the room in take-out fashion (in paper bags and foam cups), and the food quality is ordinary.But if you'd like a base of operations in New York that can give you the sensation of having your own quiet, attractive, roomy apartment, with classic Manhattan views and a location from which the whole island can readily be reached, this is it...

<Content>Excellent hotel Just spent 5 days in New York and chose the hotel based upon reviews on this website. Felt compelled to write a review to validate other peoples comments on how good this hotel is. The first thing you notice is how huge the room is! At least 3 times the size of 'typical' manhatten shoe box hotel rooms. The inclusion of a kitchen/ lounge made my stay so much more comfortable. The service of the staff was of a very high quality with the room being spotlessly clean every day and the front desk being very helpful with enquiries and reservations. I would recommend checking several websites for prices for this hotel as I found a massive range in pricing as i think they discount the rooms heavily outside of business season. I went in August and as a result got an absolute bargin.

<Content>The Affinia Dumont was great!! I recently stayed at the Affinia Dumont with my family for five nights while we were on vacation in New York. The hotel was excellent in all respects. It is located only a couple of blocks from the Empire State Building in New York City near the intersection of Lexington and 34th in the Murray Hill area. The subway was only a block and a half away and, while it was a healthy walk, we were able to walk to Times Square from the hotel.The room was much larger than I expected. It had a large living room with very attractive and comfortable furnishings, including a couch with a pull out bed, a comfortable easy chair and a very effecient office area. There was a large TV in the living room, a stereo and video game capability but we had little time to use any of those things while we were there. Our room also had a nice kitchenette with a refrigerator, stove, microwave and dishwasher. The bedroom was great as well. We had two queen size beds (real queen size beds not full size). The beds were VERY comfortable and they give you an option of several different pillows to choose from. The bedroom was also much larger than I expected. By comparsion, the rooms were much larger than what you normally get at an Embassy Suites and much larger than I ever expected in New York City.We were on the 32nd floor and looked right out on the Chrysler Building. We couldn't have asked for a better view. Also, there were only five rooms on our floor and everything was very quiet.The staff was very friendly and accomodating. One of the ladies at the front desk helped us arrange tour tickets and the valet helped us with directions on several occasions and travel arrangements to the airport. On our first night there, the air conditioner in the bed room was making a slight gurgling noise that wasn't bothersome but just didn't sound right. I reported it the next morning, and that day they sent someone up to look at it and that night the front desk called to see if the problem had been solved. The hotel has a fitness theme and has a full service spa on the second floor, which I never got to use. But I did use the fitness room, which was great. Each of the stairmasters, etc have a flat screen tv on it so you can watch whatever you want to. Also, in the lobby, they usually have a complimentary herbal tea, which was nice when we got back to the hotel after walking in the city- it was in the mid 90s when we were there.All in all this was one of the nicest hotels I've stayed in with very friendly people working there. I highly recommend it, whether it be for a business trip or a vacation.

<Content>Great hotel, large rooms I have stayed in several hotels in New York City over the years and I have to say that price for value was fantastic here. We chose this hotel because I didn't want to stay in times square... and most of the hotels uptown either didn't have 2 bedroom suites or were way out of our price range. We rented a two bedroom suite for my parents, myself and my 5 month old. We wanted to have a middle area for us all to hang out in, plus more room to walk the baby about in the middle of the night. The rooms are one of the largest I've had in the city (comparable to the Doubletree in Times Square) . I think the studio would be just fine if I returned again. The fridge and sink were a great plus to keep my baby's bottles clean and stored and to keep snacks in, but I can see it being too much for a lot of guests. There's a huge Duane Reade across the street for any late night drugstore/ snack/ baby needs. The only negative (other than having to wait until 4:30 to check in) I have to mention is that we paid $50 more for a two bedroom suite which was just a studio and a queen suite combined. Next time I'll save money and ask for the two room adjacent to each other and just opened the door between them. Overall I loved this hotel. I hope to go back to experience the spa.

<Content>Great hotel... clean..staff very friendly This was our first experience staying overnight in NYC and, it was a pleasant experience. The staff was VERY helpful and friendly. The rooms are clean and comfortable. I had heard that rooms in NYC are extremely small but did not find this to be true in the one bedroom suite. The only complaint was the pull out sofa was not too comfortable. The location of the hotel is great if you are looking to be away from all of the activity. The hotel was a little pricey ($500) but that may have been because we booked two days before.

<Content>Very displeased I decided to stay in this hotel based on the superb reviews it received on Tripadvisor.com, my favourite travel website. This is one of the few times I can say that Tripadvisor steered me wrong. Very wrong.It's almost as though all the reviewers who have written glowing reports were staying at a different hotel than I. The problems were non-stop from my arrival 'til my departure. Just one example... my room was very warm even when I put the air conditioning to its coolest setting. Called downstairs to see if this could be remedied. Waited close to an hour in the room for a gentleman to come upstairs and try to fix it (and yes, I had plenty of other things I'd have preferred to do on a Manhattan afternoon). The maintenance person arrived, glanced at the air conditioning unit, then Opened the Windows! That was his solution. I was on the 5th floor. The sound of traffic was loud even with the windows shut! Of course it was too noisy to sleep with the window open, so I had to close it and sweltered through the night.Overall, this hotel gave me the amenities, service and quality I would have expected from a $130/night in total. Instead, I paid well more than double and feel really ripped off. I will never, ever stay here again.

<Content>Extraordinary Staff Just returned from a great stay at the A.D. We arrived very early in the day and were able to check in. We also checked out late. In both these instances the staff could not have been more accomadating. Our room was large, comfortable and nicely decorated. My only criticism relates to the fitness center which is adequate at best. This hotel is a good value in a good location with a GREAT staff. Thanks- we'll be back.

<Content>Excellent!! People who do not like the Dumont must have had a singularly bad experience. I was booked to stay 3 nights following July 4th. As many have said, the room size was larger than most other hotels I've stayed inthrought the country. The location was convenient to many subway stations, and Times Square was easily walkable. The staff were all super nice and helpful (I was given very specific subway direction more than once). To top it all off, I cut my stay short by one night (due to heavy rain moving in), and after letting the front desk know at 9:00 am the day I was checking out, they not only didn't charge me for the extra night, I also checked out at 1:30 with no problems. The staff never gave me an ounce of grief or ran me an attitude. Even though I'm sure there are many other nice hotels in NYC, I'll be staying at the Dumont in the future.

<Content>Best deal in this category NY hotel rooms are known for being small and nasty until you hit some very premium pricing. This place was a very welcome exception. Great room with amenities, good location, nice and helpful staff. Would highly recommend.

<Content>Great Hotel! On our return from Aruba, we decided to stop off and visit my sister in law who lives in Manhatten. She is around the corner from this hotel and reccomended it highly. We got a great internet rate and were only there for two nights. Upon our arrival we were greeted very proffesionally by the desk staff. The lobby if very small but comfortable. Our room was more than we had anticipated, the bed was very comfortable. There was an Ironing board, hair dryer, a full kitchen. There was fruit waiting for us and it was a treat. The view was spetacular and we really relaxed here. The doormen and porters were very helpful. I would like to add that these folks went above and beyond anything I could have asked for. On our last night, we needed a 3:45 am wake up call. I called down to the front desk and asked for a wake up call. Just to make sure the desk person called me back immediatly to make sure it was for 3:45 AM not PM. I really appreciated this person's attention. As we were sitting in JFK getting ready to depart, I realized I had left my camera charger pluged into the wall at the hotel. I called the hotel and the person at the desk stated that Chris the porter that had helped us with our bags would be getting it for us. He verified my mailing address and told me not to worry it would be mailed out to me. That put my mind to rest! I will be going back in October and will be staying here again!

<Content>Efficient and Unpretentious Booked this expressly due to the reviews on this site. Managed to get a deal on a double queen room and wasn't disappointed. Asked for a high room and was given 31st floor with a great view south.Room size good - Kitchen OK, and came in useful as the 24 hour grocery store is only across the road. so no overpriced mini bar goodies.Not special but clean, efficient, and with that insincere friendliness that you get in such establishments. (But hey, it's better than rudeness).Check out Mr. Cool (Jessie) in the bar, has some great music reccomendations, trip reccomendations, and was everything that I imagined a proper New York bartender to be. Don't lose him Mgt. he's a gem!I wouldn't hesitate in staying again.

<Content>Large room, mediocre staff I would agree that this is a great value hotel in a good location. Seeing so many positive reviews I expected better service from the staff.A friend and I spent a week at a Priceline hotel in a very small room. I booked one night at the Dumont after we had to extend our trip by a day and couldn't get a room at the Priceline hotel (Morgans). Walking into the room at the Dumont was like being in heaven compared to the small room we had been in for a week. We were in a corner room on the top floor with a beautiful view of Manhattan. It was nice to have a kitchen. There was plenty of ice in the freezer. Our stove had one burner that wouldn't light. When turning on the others you kept hearing a clicking sound as it tried to turn on the one bad burner (?). I couldn't stand the noise so I ended up using the microwave to heat one serving of water instead of trying to use the stove to heat up more.The bathroom was alright. It was nice to have a place to soak my feet after walking in Manhattan for a week. I got a surprise when I sat on the toilet seat and it bent underneath me while soaking my feet in the tub. I'm only 185 pounds. The only place to sit in the bathroom while doing your nails or grooming would be on that toilet seat, so they really should have harder toilet seats that can support the weight of an average person without surprising them.I did not find the staff to be particularly helpful. They were average, some staff members were good, some were mediocre. There was no consistency to the service. I found one staff member very helpful, but some others made me wait to get change for a $20 even when no other guests were standing at the front desk. I looked at my $20 bill sitting on their side of the counter while they ran back and forth doing something. It took about 5 minutes just to get change. I'm patient but I thought it odd they would make a guest wait like that for something relatively simple. They seemed disorganized most of the time I interacted with them.I tried ordering some pillows from their pillow menu. It seemed like a nice idea, but even after calling twice over about 3 hours, we never received any pillows. We came back late that night and didn't bother calling a third time. When I mentioned it at checkout the next day, I thought they might offer a small discount on the room. All they said was that I'd be receiving a feedback form by email and that I could fill that out. The hotel is very close to a Starbucks, many restaurants and small groceries. A subway station is a few blocks away. Don't let them send you to Da Ciro, the Italian restaurant around the corner. The food and drinks are over priced, and service is not good. Instead go to Pasticcio on Third Avenue. I would definitely stay here next time because of the size of the rooms. It's a good value if you pay a discounted rate. I wouldn't expect good service from the staff though.

<Content>Very Relaxed We stayed at this hotel for 7 nights starting June 9th. Reception were very friendly and helpful and continued together with the doormen throughout the visit. This hotel is very relaxing and has non of that pompous air which you get in many places which really turns us off. The location is great with easy access to the subway at 33rd street and is busy without being frantic. Room sizes are excellent and give great value if you prefer space to stretch out rather than super luxury. Having a kitchen gave us a great choice between bringing food in (the farmers market at Union Square is superb) or eating out as there are some very good restaurants nearby (Da Ciro and Villa Berulia were particularly good). We would happily stay there again.

<Content>Very friendly, great location, highly recommended Stayed here for a four night holiday. Excellent location, very handy for shopping and the subway, but incredibly quiet - our room looked over 33rd St and while we didn't have the greatest view it was so quiet - quietest hotel I've found in NYC. All the hotel staff v friendly, room clean  well furnished with a handy kitchenette  fridge. The only minor complaint would be that the decor of our room was rather brown and gloomy. But otherwise a real find and would recommend it to any traveller.

<Content>Great View Stayed at the Affinia Dumont for nine nights in May. 1st room had a view that was less than great, spoke with desk personnel and moved to a room on the 25th floor, great view of the city. The next day our new neighbor wanted our room so he would have two adjoining rooms. He traded us a corner suite on the 19th floor which was even nicer than the second room. After all the moving around was completed we enjoyed the stay very much. The hotel was clean, well kept, and the staff was quite helpful. The rooms are not as nice as rooms in 4star hotels in the south but I guess in New York they were excellent. Would gladly recommend this hotel to any travelers. One of the great things about the hotel is that it is not in the middle of an area that is too crowded, noise level was lower than in most parts of the city. This has nothing to do with the hotel but my wife and I were disappointed in the food in New York, as we tried expensive, midrange, and cheap, but were never quite satisfied. I guess being from South Louisiana it is hard to eat any where else and be happy.

<Content>Excellent value I stayed at the Affinia Dumont on my third business trip to New York, and this is the best hotel value for the money in NYC or anywhere else. It's perfect for those wanting to mix business and pleasure thanks to an enormous desk and Aeron chair as well as a lovely looking spa (I just used the yoga room one morning). Also a well-equiped fitness room, which I didn't need because I walked 6 to 10 miles a day! The elements that made this a standout for me were the excellent lighting (including some energy-efficient fixtures)--especially the reading lights over the bed, over the desk, and by the reading chair--and the great mirrors everywhere you could possibly want them. Overall, including its fully equipped galley kitchen, it's larger than some NYC studio apartments!

<Content>Excellent hotel, will stay here again I picked this hotel for our first visit to NYC based on the reviews on this site, and it was pretty much on point with what everyone else mentioned. Lobby is small but comfortable. Front desk was helpful and very efficient. Ballet parking was $34 for 24 hrs but I guess thats the normal price for overnight.The room itself was excellent. I booked a studio suite and it was larger then some of the jr. suites I've stayed at in Vegas, SF, and Hawaii. The King size bed was very comfortable and the pillow menu added to the great sleep we had. Along with everyone else, I do recommend a higher floor (we stayed at the 27th facing the Crysler Building and the street noise was no problem) Furniture had a very modern feel and made the room feel it should have been more then the price we paid for the stay. the aveda products were great and when i called hotel services for (1) extra bottle of shampoo and conditioner, they gave us a whole bag full of everything else too! Location is great in Murry Hill. Within walking distance of most sites. Took a cab the first night we were there because of the weather but the next day, walked from hotel to central park with no problems. Next visit to NY, I would defin. stay at the hotel again. Each floor only has 6-8 rooms so it is very quite and intimate. kitchen a plus to store and reheat food. Bathroom could have been a little bigger but big enough to have a soothing bubble bath for 2 in. all in all, i highly recommend.

<Content>take along written confirmation! Just got back from three nights at the Affinia Dumont. Booked the roomearly January, requested a room with two beds and a sleeper sofa as therewere three women traveling together. I emailed the hotel before I booked the room to verify that we could reserve this particular bed arrangement. I made the final booking thru Small and Elegant Hotels and had them note that we were guarenteed two beds. Called to confirm everything a week before we arrived.At check in the receptionist tells me that they have only rooms available with one king bed but they could bring us a roll away bed. I kept telling her that it was not acceptable. I said that my friend and I did were not going to sleep in the same bed. She kept repeating that there was nothing she could do. She reviewed my written confirmation (so glad I took it!) but kept insisting that she could not accomadate us, did we want to go elsewhere?I called Small and Elegant Hotels and told them what was happening.The manager there called someone at the hotel. They finally solved the problem by giving us two adjoining rooms which had enough beds for all even though they were not suites as I had booked it all worked out.The receptionist tried to blame the reservation center but I emphasized that I spoke with numerous personnel at the hotel to confirm my request.So, in spite of my confirmation and booking six months in advance the hoteldid not have a room available that met our needs.Other than this very annoying problem the rest of the stay was uneventful.Would I stay there again? No.

<Content>Brilliant!!!!! WOW!!! went to new york at the end of april and stayed at the affinia dumont had such an amazing time in new york and the hotel made it even more special! the hotel was nice and the and the staff were brilliant. it was my girlfreind charlotte's birthaday and it was one of those romantic holidays, the staff put rose pettles and champange in our room when we got back from our helicopter ride over manhattan for her birthday which i thought was a nice touch!! the room was nice and modern the location was superb as there were a few bars and restaurants near by and my girlfreind loved the location as it was near macys. the barking dog restaurant was exellent which is next door they do a nice breakfast. i did base my stay on this site as the reviews were very good and if you see bad reviews ignore them this hotel is a must stay hotel. i couldnt beleive the sive of the room it had its own kitchen so if your on a budget you can cook your own food. ive been to many hotels and this one beats them by far. so if your a male and you want to take your girlfreind on holiday take her to new york and stay at the affinia dumont your lady will be very happy indeed!!!!!!!!!

<Content>Great Hotel~Great Location This was my first trip to New York so I did a great deal of research. We chosethe Affinia due to the many positive reviews from this website. We were NOTdisappointed. We booked a jr. suite - which I recommend. The kitchen is tiny,but it is nice to have a fridge to put your leftovers in or store fruit, water,etc. It also had a stove and oven, which we used to heat up our leftovers fromCarmines Italian restaurant in the Theater District - excellent food. Thecheck-in was A service and the room does look like a hip apartment. Theyhave a pillow menu, which for me was a life- saver. I use a buckwheat pillow,which I forgot, but they had it. The bed was very large for a King and was verycomfortable. The bathroom was sufficient, clean, and cute. They use Avedaproducts. The jr. suite has a nice sitting area, which we used. The cost forthe internet service is very high, but I guess that is NY. The sitting area inthe hotel lobby is small but very nice. We did ask for room on a high floor anda view of the Chrysler Bldg. I would also ask for a high floor so you do nothave to hear the traffic/street noise. The hotel location is great. We walkedto 3rd Ave for several restaurant choices. Also, it is a short walk to thesubway or cab ride to anywhere you want to go. I like the neighborhood feel ofMurray Hill. We could go to Time Sq, 5th Ave shopping or SOHO but could returnto a quaint neighborhood. The staff were friendly and the front desk staff(they are also the concierge) gave a few good tips. We would recommend thePongol's for veg Indian food - very good on Lexington and East 27th Street. Wedidn't go to the spa, but I did go to the gym. It was very nice, but I felt I was ignored by some of the staff. I did report this to hotel mgmt. Wedidn't use room service nor eat at the Barking Dog. I would not want to go to ahotel rest. with all the choices in NY. I had a great trip and was extremelysatisfied with Affinia Dumont for my first trip to NY.

<Content>Large rooms, nice staff, good location I've stayed at the Affinia Dumont numerous times over the past two years. I keep coming back because of some basic things: nice room decor, warm staff, great prices, and good location. I usually stay in a one-bedroom suite and love the fact that there is a large living room with a comfortable desk to work at and a kitchen (fridge and microwave) to heat up leftovers. The bedroom is decorated in warm colors with great closet space (two separate closets!) and an incredibly comfortable bed. Dimmer switches for the lights and huge televisions - one in the living room and one in the bedroom. Now, I do love a nice bathroom but that's the one thing missing at the Affinia. This is your basic bath with ok water pressure - but they do offer nice bath toiletries. Need a room with a view - tell them upfront when making the reservation and they'll do their absolute best in trying to get you one. In fact, it's the warmth of the staff and their can do attitude that assures my return visits. NYC can be rather tough on the senses, it's nice to return to a place where the staff cares about you and does everything to make your stay pleasant.If you want one of the largest hotel rooms available at a great price, an attractive and comfortable room decor, warm and welcoming staff, and a good location on the East side (walk to Grand Central, UN, subway) then there is NO BETTER hotel than the Affinia Dumont.

<Content>A fantastic place to stay! This was our first time to New York and the Affinia Dumont made it one to remember. The location of the hotel is superb, a fifteen minute stroll to Times Square and easy access to sub-ways if you prefer. The room, we had a Studio Suite was fantastic, the bed was huge, the small kitchen, modern and the bathroom spic and span. The Reception Staff were extremely polite and helpfull, making you feel at home every step of the way. The concierge' were superb, if you want any advice about where to go, what to do and where to eat, just ask. Would we stay there again.........most definately.

<Content>We will come again This was our first time in New York - all our previous city breaks have been to historical European cities - and whilst we were excited at the prospect there was some nervousness too. Would we enjoy such a densley packed modern city? The omens weren't great when our Taxi from the airport was pulled over by the police for jumping a red light just after we arrived on Manhattan Island.It was a real relief therefore to arrive in the lobby of the Affinia Dumont to be greeted by friendly and helpful staff who immediately put us at ease. We've got a great room for you they told us - and we agree. we were in an L-shaped 21st floor junior studio, with great views of the Chrysler Building and across the East river. The room was spacious, with a decent bathroom and a small kitchen (with a huge fridge). Although by no means the fanciest or newest hotel room we've ever stayed in, the room was very comfortable and we couldn't fault the cleanliness of the room or hotel generally. I'd have to say that the room was great value.The location is great; we walked almost everywhere but it's no problem to catch the subway or get a cab. Although there's no Hotel restaurant, the Barking Dog on the ground floor of the building offered good quality, reasonably priced food and friendly service echoing that in the hotel itself. Having a gym and spa helped us to relax after each hectic day's sightseeing, and our time in New York flew by. Too quickly, in fact - We'll just have to visit again and when we do we'll stay at the Affinia Dumont.

<Content>Magic Location I have to say that I was more than impressed with this hotel. Myself and girlfriend spent a week here at Easter time. The location is fantastic, in walking distance to Time Square and just down the other way is 3rd Avenue where there are plenty of nice bars for late drinks and food.Room was very big and was spotless and had a nice comfortable bed, needed after a tiring day pounding the streets and drinking up all the beers!! Also a great feature was having a little kitchen area with a a microwave for reheating cold pizza and a fridge to keep your gatorade cold for those hangovers the morning after!Seriously though, I would definately recommend this place, okay it doesn't have the big reception area like many of the more well known New York Hotels but what it does have is intimacy and privacy matched with great service and a friendly smile.

<Content>Great Location, Average Stay at Best! The Good - I am originally from New York City, so I am well versed in the offerings downtown. The location of this hotel is outstanding being on the corner of Third Avenue, and 34th street. Away from the hustle and bustle of Times Square but close enough for a healthy walk if you plan on going to the Theatre District. If you are interested in the allure of downtown, including Union Square, Washington Square (NYU), SOHO, Tribeca, and the West Village, also a healthy but doable walk. As part of this downtown trek you will learn to love the offerings of the area between the Murray Hill District and downtown. Restaurants and shopping galore.The price is also right for this hotel having secured a 26th floor room (view not good from our vantage point, but not there for the view) for $215.00 a night. This is the place to stay if you are interested in what NYC has to offer, yet you dont want to pay truly high prices for a room.The Bad - When we stay in NY, the last thing we want to feel like is that we have rented a converted studio apartment and this is clearly what this hotel has to offer. Studio apartment rooms full with outdated equipment in the miniscule kitchen. I also found the bell staff to be somewhat persistent and annoying during our coming and going, and always felt I needed to tip them.The Ugly - For once I would like to arrive at a hotel and be offered a room with a view without having to ask given the fact that the rooms did not appear to be priced based on location or view. On our arrival, once again the staff offered us the typical 5th floor location, necessitating another inquiry into the availability of a room higher up. Initially she said that none were available, but having persisted she checked in the back with a manager and poof one came available on the 26th floor. Believe me, I know how the game is played being a seasoned traveler, but I will celebrate the day that I am offered a room on an upper floor with a view without asking or bargaining for one. This is a hotel not a new car showroomTough to understand how it got a # 3 popularity rating unless popularity is based on it being wonderfully located and reasonably priced

<Content>Fabulous Everything about this hotel shined. The room was superior - large and comfortable enough for 3 adults and beautifully decorated to boot. I loved the location and of course the breathtaking views from the 29th floor were to die for. The hotel employees were friendly, helpful and extremely knowledgeable. I would stay at this property again in a heartbeat!

<Content>Great Hotel and an Amazing Value First off, let me qualify my review by saying that this is not a five star hotel, nor does it try to be. In terms of service and overall experience, I would give the Affinia Dumont a solid 3.75 stars. That being said, because it is such an amazing value and my experience was so positive, I rate my experience as Excellent without reservation.We stayed for four nights in a junior suite in the NE corner of the 28th floor. Views were terrific and traffic noise was a non-issue. The room was absolutely huge. Nice, comfortable couch and chairs. Excellent desk with an Aeron chair. Bed was among the most comfortable I've enjoyed -- very difficult to get up in the morning. Bathroom was spacious, and the shower pressure was excellent. The kitchen was really nice -- much more than we needed, but great to have a full sized fridge. I don't know who would be cooking in their hotel room in NYC, but there was a microwave and four burner stove, too.Everything was kept perfectly clean throughout our stay and the maid never bothered us. Doormen and front desk staff were helpful and friendly, but we really didn't need their help. We didn't get a chance to checkout the spa or gym.Hardly any negatives to report. The room was just strating to get to the point where it might need a minor renovation. Just a tiny bit worn down. The lobby is pretty small and unimpressive, but it gets the job done. Like I said, we didn't need much help, but the hotel might be a touch understaffed if things were really busy. Got room service from the restraunt only once for breakfast -- food was decent, cheap and delivered on time, but was packed in styrofoam, which is unfortunate. Again, this is not a five star hotel.The location is ideal -- lots of good bars and restaurants nearby. 24 hour drug store accross the street. Only a few avenue blocks from Penn Station. We walked almost everywhere, and it was really easy to get a cab when we needed to. Murray Hill is much more quiet than most mid-town locales, which is a big plus.Overall, the Affinia Dumont is a fantastic hotel. You really can't do any better for the price, especially if you like having a room that is bigger than a closet. I will definitely go back.

<Content>Unique Athletic Minded Hotel for Business Travelers! The hotel bills itself as an executive fitness suite hotel, and in NYC, having good workout options is my priority. I also like the convenience of a kitchen when I'm in town for longer stays.The rooms are nice, contemporary and get the job done. And I always need the desk and work space on business trips. I also like that there is a moderately priced restauarant connected. Another convenience.Midtown has lots of health clubs nearby but many don't allow visitors or charge a huge premium, so the small onsite fitness center here is a great deal. I knew before arriving what the club stocked in terms of equipment (my travel guide, The Athletic-Minded Traveler gives details). It's really full service with around 8 cardio machines, dumbbells and stack stations. Again, when in Midtown for business, hard to beat this place.

<Content>I definitely recommend A Ritz Carlton it ain't. But for travelers who do not care much for gyms or bars in the lobby, etc. this is a pretty good place. I came to NY on a last minute trip and was stunned to find that hotel rooms were difficult to come by. I should have checked: it is graduation season in addition to the flux of tourists. I was quoted upwards of $500 per night for tiny rooms at a number of places and settled for this $239 studio suite at a hotel I had never stayed in before. I was quite apprehensive about the accommodations but they are well above average for NY in this price range:+ decent size bed - my suite had two queen size beds+ decent size room+ high-speed Internet access+ lots of closet space+ no rats or roaches, paint peeling off, A/C units that don't work :-)The bathroom in my unit was quite adequate. Room service is certainly a notch below what you get in other places in terms of form. It is more like your neighborhood restaurant delivery (food in plastic bag and styrofoam containers) than a regular hotel room service But guess what? It is fast, and the fare from the Barking Dog, the restaurant next door which is affiliated to the hotel, is quite tasty. Also, who really wants to eat room service in New York with so many restaurants around?The front Desk staff was extremely polite and helpful as were the doormen. I will have to come back to this property to verify the consistency of the service, but as of now, I highly recommend this place if you are not picky about some of the issues I mentioned above. It is probably more appropriate for tourists who have already been to NY and spend most of their time out, those on a budget looking for quality accommodations, and families looking for space rather than name properties.

<Content>Agree that Reality Check needed My wife and I stayed at this hotel from 27 - 30 April 2005. I have to say that the previous review sums the place up particularly well. It is an average 3 star hotel for which you have to pay steep prices. The room was clean and spacious but we never used the desk or lounge area. The TV does actually swivel so you can watch it in bed! The bathroom is small and quite dated - no wow factor! The kitchen area likewise - we only used the fridge. The gym was a bonus but was once again average.The reception staff were pleasant and efficient.My major gripe was the over attentive door staff who epitomised the tips culture! By the end of our stay we were sick of being told to be well! The lack of sincerity from these tip hungry vultures was apparent for all to see. When leaving our bags on check out for collection later we were told I won't be here later by the swarthy suited doorman. His palm was greased. I have a suggestion for the US government and that is to put in place legislation which ensures that those in the service industry are paid an amount on which they can live and that would go some way to ensuring that tips are provided only where merited - i.e. for genuinenly good service and not as a matter of course where weary service industry workers half heartedly put on the insincere smarm! What in effect the US has is a tourist stealth tax.To finish on a positive note I would state that the location of the hotel is superb and the local amanities in third avenue excellent. The neighbourhood does not have a toristy feel which was great and there were some good bars and restaurants.

<Content>Hard to fault It the risk of sounding like a broken record.... I must agree with so many other reviewers in declaring the Affinia Dumont a great hotel. We chose it after reading all the glowing reports on tripadvisor am very pleased to say that the Affinia did not disappoint. Like others we had requested a high floor for the much talked about views but the hotel was very busy and we ended up on a low floor. But the room was huge - plenty of space for my husband and I - and very quiet. We weren't disturbed at all by noise from other guests or traffic outside. The location is superb. Walking distance to everything midtown and the subway is really close by. We used it the whole time. During our three night stay we only had one minor problem with the bathroom sink not draining. One call to front desk and it was fixed within minutes. The staff were very polite and eager to help. The doormen were perhaps a little too eager... all those 'have a nice days' seemed a bit over the top, but I'm just not used to it! Would definitely recommend the Affinia and will be going back!

<Content>Reality check I just thought I'd write a review to try and balance some of the rave reviews this hotel has received. I stayed here and agree on many of the good points mentioned on this website. We requested a room with a view as the last time I was in New York was when I was a child and I love to feel part of the city I am staying in. Affinia came up with the goods and gave us a corner room with a view of the river and the Chrysler building which is spectacular.As mentioned before the rooms are very big and although I haven't stayed in any other NY hotels the general feeling I got when shopping around for a hotel was that rooms are tiny and really expensive. We had a kitchen and a sofa and a huge bed in case we were super-sized by our stay in the Big Apple. The truth is though that although the rooms are pretty impressive, the bathroom was abit tired and needed updating and so did the little kitchen that we had. The kitchen sounds handy in theory but in reality we never used it and I don't see why you would unless you were in NY for a long stay and wanted to cut down on costs. The desk unit would be good for business travel but is no use for tourists unless your planning a marathon postcard writing session, it also looks abit dated. The TV was stuck squarely on the plinth it rested on so that it pointed out into the middle of the room meaning you could neither watch it comfortably on the bed or the sofa and had to lie on the floor to watch it head on. The corridors outside the rooms are abit pokey and tired as well and there is no bar or restaurant inside the hotel although the restaurant attached is good. The staff were very friendly and helpful and said be well everytime you walked in or out of the front door which sounds like something from Star Trek.This is a good solid top end three star hotel in a City that I thought had hugely over-priced accommodation; this place is so good because everything else looks just so pricey. If you've got any doubts about booking this hotel and your on a budget of some kind I'd book it up because I thought it offered the best value for money. However don't expect luxury for what is still pretty pricey. The rooms are large I agree but the bathroom/kitchen are functional at best and the gym is pretty average.I think it's hard to beat this place for value and the location is fine. We walked for hours on end using this place as a central hub. Walking is by far the best way to see this fascinating city that is a caricature of itself. I couldn't live in the place but then New Yorkers seem to pride themselves on managing to survive where no-one else could. It's a great place to visit.By the way on the taxi front I thought prices were fixed to the airport so you don't need to worry about getting stuck in traffic? I could be wrong though.

<Content>Best Kept Secret in New York This hotel has to be one of the best hotels in New York. The hotel is located in the Murray Hill area of New York and although not central it is just a short walk to the subway (2 blocks) and buses stop outside the hotel.The room was enormous and had a separate kitchen area, sofa, computer desk and king sized bed. The view from the room was fantastic as I had a view of both the East River and the Chrysler building.The hotel can arrange for a car to take you back to the airport at a reasonable price. I would recommend this option especially if you are leaving mid afternoon for the airport as the traffic can get very busy and a taxi will charge you even when you are waiting in traffic!A couple of points for those visiting New York1. If you want to visit the Empire State building (which is a 5 minute walk from the hotel) then visit between 6 pm and 7 pm as the queues are at the shortest then.2. Go on the Circle Line 3 hour cruise as you get to see many places you would not see on other tours.

<Content>Beyond expectations This was our first visit to NYC and we chose our hotels purely on the recommendations and views expressed on this website.When we checked in, Iris (the duty manager) advised that our reservation (booked on Travelocity) was for four days from 1 May rather than four days checking out 1 May. {On returning home, we noted it was Travelocity's error and not ours!}. Iris read our note on the reservation which indicated this was our first visit to NYC and a request made for a room on a high floor. She found us a room on 34 (of 36) which faced the Chrysler building. The room was larger than we aniticipated with a moderate bathroom and convenient kitchen.We went to visit Grand Central Station and the United Nations building, both within a short walk of the hotel. On our return, we found a note from Iris attached to a bottle of white wine welcoming us to NYC!! Other hotels please note - small touches like this make a huge impact on guests.On our second night, we returned to the room and were greeted by the nauseating smell of cigarette smoke. Our new neighbours had taken no notice of the fact that 34 was a no smoking floor and decided to smoke. We immediately called reception who despatched security. The guests were moved the next day. Smokers please note - my non-smoking does not affect you, so why indulge in your disgusting habit which affects us? When a room and floor are marked as non-smoking, there is a clue. The dish in the bathroom with a bar of soap on is called a soapdish not ashtray. If you want to smoke, ask for a smoking room.The staff on reception are immensely helpful as too are the doormen. Like most hotels in NYC, there are limos available outside the hotel which obviously pay bonuses to the staff. When we checked out we stated that we were off to JFK. The doorman stated that he could arrange the limo but suggested we take a cab as the cost would be considerably cheaper. Now, how many other hotels would have been that honest?We would certainly consider staying at this hotel again on our next trip to NYC.

<Content>Affinia lived up to expectations Have just got back to Australia after 2 weeks in USA. Spent 4 nights at the Affinia Dumont in New York, and the hotel was excellent. We chose it after reading reviews on this site, and it exceeded expectations. Service was excellent. We had studio suite which was plenty big enough for husband and I, but friends did have 1 bed suite, which suited them for having 2 TV's and separate lounge room. They did have coin laundry in basement, and internet computer in lobby (fairly expensive, but convenient). Expect to do LOTS of walking in New York!! We certainly got lots of exercise!

<Content>Wonderful Hotel We just returned from a two night stay at the Affinia Dumont and can't say enough about this wonderful hotel. It absolutely exceeded our high expectations. When the accommodation we had requested was not available, we were upgraded to a one bedroom suite. It was on a low floor but was totally quiet. The suite was very spacious, well decorated and very clean. We only wished that we had planned a longer stay. The staff was friendly and helpful. We would return in a heartbeat.

<Content>Affinia - Number 1 I was a littler apprehensive from reading some of the negative remarks. Just got back from a 3 night trip(Apr 21-24) w/mother-in-law, this was her first time in NYC. Thanku AFfinia GREAT week-end, my MIL loved the spacious room w/2 queen beds plus kitchen area and OH what a view -Chrysler Bldg on one side - River on the other. Staff were extremely helpful and friendly. They'd hail cabs, suggest things to do, places to eat, etc... Location far enough away from all the hustle and bustle - but still close to subway- restaurants etc, and great shops. My MIL fell in love with a designer shop that we happened upon walking toward the Theatre District area. Barking dog next door is great for winding down and the food is also very good.AFFINIA is #1 in our book.

<Content>Best Stay on Manhattan!! (Keep Secret) Stayed at The Affinia Dumont in for 6 days in April 2005 and we loved this hotel, the location is perfect, you can easily walk to everything from Empire Sate Building to Central Park. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful to accommodate every request we hade. We stayed in the big suite with room for 4 people which was roomy and bright, and don鈥檛 get me started on the bathroom, extremely clean and fresh.To make a long story short, this hotel is really great, if I have to complain about one thing it has to be the price (or maybe that鈥檚 just me being penny-pinching).So lets keep this hotel a secret, I don鈥檛 want it to be overbooked when I鈥檓 going back in the fall.

<Content>We will never stay anywhere else in New York... I hope to see Affinia Dumont reach #1. Best kept New York secret! My partner and I spent one night at Dumont for her birthday. We arrived for an early check-in to friendly, accommodating, and professional personnel at the front deak--after I mentioned my partner's birthday the woman who checked us in sent a complimentary bottle of wine to our room. When does THAT ever happen?Our room was spacious and clean -- the views were spectacular. I read another posting from someone in a room on the 36th floor who recommended requesting a room higher up. Thanks for the tip -- we ended up on the 36th floor as well in a corner room -- incredible skyline!We loved the fitness center, Aveda products in the rooms, and the healthy feel of the place. We'll stay no where else in the future.

<Content>What a delight! We chose the Affinia Dumont because it came so highly recommended on tripadvisor. Well, that reputation is well deserved. The room was large, everything was great. We had a kitchenette, a big bathtub with enough hot water to fill it, a pillow menu and Aveda toiletries. The staff was kind and friendly, they had elixers at the front desk, and a lovely spa. It even smelled good! They offer a fitness kit so you can work out in your room, free of charge! The in-room beverages were really expensive ($2.50 for 1/2 a can of coke!) but everyone knows to expect that. The location was gr8... easy access to everything. The restaraunt is not attached and there is no breakfast buffet. We had a quick check in and check out and no problems with unwarranted charges. A+!

<Content>what a great hotel! Just back from a fantastic weekend in NY where I stayed at the Affinia Dumont hotel with 3 other girls. The rooms are so big which is just as well as we needed the space for all our shopping bags! The view from our room was amazing, overlooking the Chrysler - my favourite building in NY. The staff are really helpful and friendly, couldn't fault them at all.

<Content>Great place to stay My husband and I stayed here following several hours scouring the internet looking for a good place to stay. The room was fantastic - large room, comfortable beds, quiet part of town, great kitchen for making your own breakfast in the morning, Aveda products in the bathroom, great location for walking around the different boroughs of NY. They have a fitness centre and a beauty spa offering massages and facials which I wish we'd visited but we were just too busy exploring outside. The staff are very friendly and made the first visit to NY a treat. I would love to stay here again.

<Content>Fantastic Just got back from a 2 night trip, first time in NYC. Me and my girlfriend stayed at the Dumont and were both really impressed. Here's a quick breakdown on what to expect:Super friendly service - staff were very helpful and friendly. They'd help make reservations, hail cabs, suggest things to do, places to eat, etc... Super clean, spacious rooms - staff keeps the room really clean. Lots of room and great views (at least from the 35th floor where we stayed). Very comfortable bed!!Wonderful Lemonade - They serve lemonade in the front lobby. It's free, I think my girlfriend drank about 20 glasses.The hotel is very very welcoming. If you're snooty and want to be treated that way, don't bother... if you're a down to earth, friendly person who wants to enjoy the best of NYC - try the Dumont.

<Content>Great Hotel This was our third visit to New York and we wanted a hotel that was clean, quiet and well located. The Affinia Dumont fully met all our requirements. Our room was large and well appointed and after two days we managed to move from the 11th to the 30th floor where the views were spectacular. The staff were consistently friendly and helpful. We had one or two minor problems and these were dealt with speedily and efficiently. The Murray Hill area is safe and there are several good local restaurants and the Barking Dog restaurant next door is an excellent place for breakfast.I'd recommend this hotel 100%.

<Content>Fantastic!!! My husband and I have just returned from 5 nights in the Affinia Dumont. This was our 3rd visit to NY and by far the best,thanks to this fantastic hotel!! We couldn't believe the size of the room and had a massive double bed each! The view from the room was unbelievable and the Aveda products in the bathroom were a lovely touch. The kitchen was an added bonus!! I cannot stress enough how great this hotel is compared to others we have stayed in and coming back to such a lovely suite after a hard day's sightseeing made such a difference to our holiday. The barking dog restaurant next dog was great for breakfast! I would highly recommend this hotel!

<Content>Good location, great hotel Very pleased with the hotel for our long weekend in NY.Upon arrival, they told us they had to give us a slightly smaller room (which was still massive as it turned out) but would knock off $40 a night and gave us breakfast and drinks coupon for the bar/ cafe next door.The hotel was very nicely decorated, and the room was lovely. I would expect to pay 拢150- 拢200 for a similar room in the UK. Great view, nice minibar, comfy bed, great service from lobby staff.The location of the hotel is pretty good as well. 5 blocks from the Empire State Bldg, and one block from the nearest Metro stop (on the 6 line). All in all, I was so impressed, I'll be recommending this to anyone I know who is going to NY.

<Content>Great but not wow ! Have just come back from 5 nights at the Affinia Dumont.My first impression was that it was not as upmarket as I had hoped, and I too was a little disappointed, but they had our reservation and had met our request for a quiet room.We had a one bedroom suite - and it was large - by any standard, and we paid $258 per night ( booked via the Affinia Website in January ).However over the five nights I got to like it more and more. I was staying with my husband and two boys, who fought on the first night about sharing the double sofa bed in the sitting room. I mentioned it to reception, and they arranged for an extra rollaway bed to be brought to the room for the following four nights ( and didnt charge for this!! ). We requested extra pillows - and they were there within 15 minutes ( and a call half an hour later to see if we had them and if we needed anything else ).The room was very quiet, and I like the fact that there were only 6 rooms on a floor - so you dont get a lot of noise of people in the hallways. There was lots of hot water and the showers were good and everything was very clean.The weather was awful when we were there, and they provide umbrellas, and go and stand in the rain to get you a taxi, whilst you wait in the warmth of the lobby. The Barking Dog next door did good breakfast and evening meals when the weather was so foul that we couldnt venture further.It was clean, well located, quiet, comfortable, in a 'safe' neighbourhood and a good price. I would definately stay there again, and would recommend it to others.

<Content>Just about right We booked into the Affinia Dumont last week based largely on the positive reviews on tripadvisor -- and we were not disappointed. No, this is not a luxury hotel and for those who might be expecting a more elegant or fussier place, then there's plenty of those in New York. But the Dumont is an excellent value, with spacious rooms and extremely pleasant service. To be sure, there's some evidence of whatever prior incarnation the building had -- some threadbare carpeting and so on. The lobby is small and simply functional. This was all easily overlooked since we had no expectation that we had booked a luxury hotel. We had a corner room on an upper floor with good views of the East River and the Chrysler Building. Let me tell you -- you can pay twice as much in New York for half the space and none of the view. The room itself had a king bed and a queen pullout sofa. There was a kitchenette and a sizeable work area. The furnishings and appointments were contemporary, and the room was spotless. The bathroom was small but perfectly acceptable for a place like this, with hair dryer, phone and Aveda products. We booked directly with the hotel and paid $249 -- probably right on the nose in terms of a good midrange price for New York, and we got good comfort for it. The hotel has attempted to pitch itself as an executive fitness hotel and there is a spa (which we did not use) and the rooms come with his and hers health magazines and a health products basket. But do not be misled -- the room we had would be a great room for a family visit as well as business. In fact, I would recommend the Dumont's suites for a family because of the kitchenette. Although the 34th Street Murray Hill location may not be ideal for some visitors, it is just around the corner from the Empire State building and within walking distance of both Penn and Grand Central Stations. The local east side subway line stops a block away and will get you within walking distance of the major museums uptown or the sights in lower Manhattan, and cabs were plentiful on either 34th or Lexington. The neighborhood has any number of moderately priced restaurants, coffee shops and bars. The restaurant/bar next to the hotel (the Barking Dog) provides room service and casual dining. We had a perfectly good quick meal there once. But for us, the Dumont's chief selling point was comfort and value, at least with the room we had. Plus good service. We would have no hesitation in returning.

<Content>Disappointed Did not think the hotel lived up to the reviews.Slightly shabby entrance and not very welcoming on arrival.The suite while large was dark and the large desk area, while no doubt useful to business travellers, made the sitting area feel like a corporate area and was not inviting.Having paid about $380 dollars per night via expedia, it seemed very expensive for what it was.There had obviously been some effort to smarten the place up but the bathroom needed attention with flaking paint at the foot of the door.Attempts to book restaurants through reception were probably the worst feature. Restaurants being full is fine but twice returning to find no information about bookings was poor. On the first occasion reception did not even call back when advice was sought as to the status of the booking.An extra remote found under the bed made me question the thoroughness of the cleaning regime but the bedroom was clean and by far the best feature.On the final day the sight of someone eating fast food from polystyrene containers in an otherwise pleasant seating area just about summed up the experience. Acceptable if overpriced and would not rush back.

<Content>Great staff, nice hotel A 2 night stay in mid-March, all requests were met (2 queen beds, above 15th floor, late check out). Had gotten a rate of $180/night through Orbitz when several of the other sites, including the hotels OWN site indicated no rooms available. The staff was outstanding. Christopher (bellman) was a delight, full of information and very cheery. The front desk staff was very polite and capable, and quickly responded to one small problem we had. Would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Very Disappointing We have just come back from a week at the Affinia Dumont. Prior to going I had trawled the internet etc to choose the best hotel for our stay. I was impressed by all the reviews here and thought I had chosen well. What a disappointment. On arrival the lobby is really small and dark. Our room was a studio suite which was also quite small. I asked for a view of the East River if possible and got a view of the rooftop car park!. On our first evening there someone came banging into the room and only I had the latch on it would have simply burst into the room. The bathroom was small and the handle on the toilet was broken. The TV remote broke the first day. The walls looked like they were in need of a coat of paint. There was a huge bubble in the carpet as though someone had wet the floor and thus stretched the carpet. On our last morning they sent us up our bill, as well as the bill for a suite several doors down. There is no bar in the hotel so if you want a drink you have to go elsewhere. I know they are pretty small things but overall we were very disappointed. The location is good however for the money I think you can do so much better.

<Content>A delightful experience We recently stayed at the Affinity for a one nights' stay and had the most delightful experience. Upon entering the lobby we were greeted with an entusiastic staff whose main concern seemed to be sure we were satisfied customers - all of my special requsts were not only considered but we were actually upgraded to a beautiful one bedroom suite. We were given a tour of the spa and would have loved to use the services but we had a full schedule of events to do - next time we will certainly avail ourselves to the wonders of the spa. Upon getting into the room - Christopher gave us a wonderful orientation to the services offered and other amenities - we were about to make some tea - only to find one tea bag so we called room service - in 5 minutes we were given a tray full of teas and etc. The choice of pillows for the evening was an added pleasure - the linens and bathroom toilitries were of excellent quailty - all in all I would rate this one of the most enjoyabel experiences we have had in the city and have all intentions of returning soon. I have highly recommended this to all of my friends.

<Content>Lovely Having trawled the internet for accomodation for a 3 night stay with 2 girlfriends, i decided to book the Affinia Dumont hotel. Out of all the reviews on trip advisor, theirs seemed the most consistent. When we arrived we were not dissapointed. The staff are really friendly and helped us out with maps and trains. Room service for extra towels was very prompt. The room was spacious and very comfortable - especially the bed which was bliss. It was important to me to have somewhere to sit other than a bed after a hard day out shopping and the Affinia fitted the bill. We were able to relax in our lounge and use the kitchenette facilities which was great. The whole place was spotless. The bathroom was everything a girl could have wanted - a tub big enough to soak in with lovely Aveda products.The area around the Affinia is great, not too hustle and bustle but relaxed with some good restaurants. We ate at the Barking Dog a couple of times and the food and the service was very good. Also try Blockheads around the corner - great fun.All in all the Affinia was excellent and we have all decided that this is the place that we will return to.

<Content>Great for dogs, but watch out for dust bunnies! My wife, baby, dog, and I spent three nights at the Affinia Dumont (March 7 to 9, 2005) and found the hotel above average and a great place for our dog. First the dog, our American Eskie was well received by the hotel's excellent doormen and front desk staff. A bit annoying was that we were among 3 guests who had to wait until 4pm for our rooms (check-in at 3pm). Our baby had just gotten sick crossing through the Lincoln Tunnel, and it was not pleasant waiting with a sick baby in the hotel's nice, but not extraordinary lobby. Nonetheless, doggie had a nice room on the 27th floor with us, overlooking the Chrysler Building; another faux pas was that the promised dog dish and maps to local doggie friendly restaurants was no where to be found--eventually the helpful staff found a dish but no maps. In short, there is a nice dog run on 26th and Madison in the park near 5th Avenue (we just asked dog owners on the street to find out dog walks). During our stay we met so many New Yorkers with dogs, and had a great time talking about dogs and the city. Kudos to Affinia Dumont, regardless of the oversights for accepting dogs in the property. The dust bunnies, if you have a kid, you know the drill of moving the hotel bed over to the wall to prevent the baby from falling out of the bed. After traveling in Africa, Europe and the US with our baby (toddler), we are always surprised to find what treasures are under hotel beds. Well at the Affinia Dumont, we found a dollar coin, many dust bunnies and tissues of unknown origin. Some other complaints were that the dishwasher was not working well, several light fixtures were missing, and I suspect that a deep cleaning was not done on my room in weeks. But after working in Africa, most places I stayed at there, had not been cleaned in decades. So Affinia Dumont is a great choice for doggie, with a great staff, fastest elevators at any NYC hotel I ever stayed at. The location is great, restaurants everywhere, subway 2 blocks away, the 34 bus within steps, supermarket two blocks down; all in all, you cannot go wrong. My dog thanks you Affinia. But Affinia management, just pay attention to the small stuff; I hate dirty rooms and waiting in lobbies well past check-in time, and at over $200 a night, provide the stuff you promise (doggie bowl and maps) or just don't promise them, I also don't expect to be picking up dust bunnies and tissues upon arrival and looking for dog bowls and maps.

<Content>Good Hotel! Stayed here for 3 nights in January. The room was warm and the windows opened for ventilation. There was a small kitchen which was great for boiling water for tea, storing beer / things in the fridge and gas stove and oven (which was immaculate!) if you fancied to cook! The room was big and the decor was good, although it was a bit dodgy in places, not that it spoiled anything! The bathroom was nice but the water pressure from the shower was a bit toooo much! There is a mini bar, big TV, loads of amenities for business people such as CD player built into the alarm clock, fax, printer, Internet Access etc. We stayed on the 32nd floor, and we had a reasonable view - it was just faciniating watching New York go by :-) The hotel's location isn't that bad - be prepared for walking, although this didn't bother us as we think it is the best way to explore, and is healthy. The BlockHeads Mexican restaurant down the block, to the right of the hotel which is a great place for youngsters llike us to get drunk and eat nice food. I'd come here again - staff were friendly and helpful and didn't bother us at all. The Barking Dog was good for food and drinks, and if you're smokers like us, it wasn't too bad going outside for a sneaky cigarette even though the temperature was -5! All in all, it was great! 6 Stars!

<Content>Terrific My wife and 21 year old daughter just finished a three day stay at the Affinia Dumont. It was a wonderful experience. We arrived early on Sunday, checked our bags and set off to see the sights. We covered a lot of ground by foot, starting at the Empire State Building (go early and get your tickets online, it saved a lot of time). The hotel is within easy walking distance of many things and the subway connections were pretty good (once you find the entrances which are not well mark compared to Paris and London). Going uptown or downtown was easy.The suite was roomy, clean and comfortable. We had a spectacular view from the north east corner of the 35th floor (the only problem we encountered in our stay was the wait for this room to be ready- it was worth it just to see the Chrysler Building at night).There are markets and restaurant aplenty on Third Avenue just a half a block away and The Barking Dog (the restaurant attached to the hotel) offers pretty good fare too. The staff was very helpful and polite. We highly recommend it and we would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Fantastic, Superb, YOU MUST STAY HERE. December 27th - 3rd January 2005My partner and I were moved to this hotel as we had been double-booked by our agent in the UK 5 days before departure date! What can I say we were the lucky ones!!! Our suite was on the 35th Floor overlooking downtown Manhattan, bed was huge and so comfy, room was spotless and to have the use of a fridge to put your personal goodies in fantastic. The staff were superb so helpful and polite. Location of the hotel brilliant, Empire and Macey's on your doorstop, close to the subways. We love walking and so we did!!! Rockerfeller Centre, Central Park and all the way to China Town, Battery Park (you name it we we did it) all on foot and a what a joy. This was my partner's first trip to NY and my 5th. I fall in love with it more everytime I visit. Highlight this trip was walking across Brooklyn Bridge on a wonderful, unseasonally warm sunny day for January and just staring back at the skyline. lunch Alfresco at the Pier afterwards, who could ask for more.Local InfoIf you love a hearty breakfast in the morning try the Diner in the next street 3 min walk, Joanne the Waitress simply a delight and the food, well we didn't eat again until late afternoon. The Italian also round the corner wonderful, full of noisy Italians, made you feel like you were on the set of the Sopranos and the house red gorgeous!!! Also try the Raw Bar (Shelburne hotel) 37st  Lexington, food wonderful, staff  atmosphere wonderful (great value for money too). Try the sweet potato fries with dip, great stuff.In a nutshell, WONDERFUL.Jeanette  John Romford Essex

<Content>Comfort and Space in the Heart of NY My husband and I stayed over one night for this last Valentine's weekend. I chose the Affinia because of TripAdvisor reviews and we were not disappointed. Upon arrival, we were greeted by Patrick. He did a wonderful job welcoming us to the city and upon learning we were celebrating an anniversary, got us a beautiful room on the 28th floor with a great view of the river. From the Aveda products to the unparalleled amount of space, you really cannot find a better value for the money!

<Content>Stop researching. Book it. Spent the last 4 days of January at the Dumont with my lady. It is an outstanding well run hotel. The Affinia group runs a small group of hotels throughout the city. The rooms, as many have attested to, are of outstanding size by NYC standards. The beds  linens are of great quality. Bathrooms are spacious. Great water pressure. Oustanding views. The staff (thank you Christopher) is outstanding. Didn't use the kitchen (it's NYC!!!) but the fridge kept the beer cold. The immediate neighborhood is very safe. It has everything you need - great breakfast/coffee places, great places to get a drink, get your laundry/dry cleaning done in a couple of hours, lots  lots of cabs, all right there. My lady loved the spa. The green subway line at 34th street took us uptown to the Park and downtown to dinner off of Spring Street - don't understand those who have a problem with this line, for $2 it'll take you as far as you want to go North/South from 34th. This is the move. Book the room. Thanks Affinia, see you soon...

<Content>loved my stay! I highly recommend it {stayed Feb 4 - Feb 8} I decided to stay at the Affinia Dumont after reading the reviews. I had actually booked a room at another place, but after hearing the reviews for there I decided to stay somewhere else, so I chose the Affinia Dumont. I am so glad that I did! I was very pleased with my stay there. The staff was so friendly! We arrived early, at about 11:00am, and they let us check in early, as soon as we got there no problem. They were very helpful about helping us around the city, and especially hailing us cabs. We were traveling with our 4 month old son and they helped us put the stroller in the taxi and everything. The room service and room bar is a little pricey, but the room looked exactly like the picture on the internet. They kept it pretty clean during our stay, and even the maid service was friendly. The view out of our room was gorgeous! We were on the corner of the 26th floor, and looked right at the chrysler building. I am so glad we stayed there for our first time in New York. If your thinking about staying here do it! You will be happy you did!

<Content>tourist in NYC I put lots of research in to the perfect place for my girlfriend and I to stay for our 4day stay in NY. THe reviews on the site were spot on. We had a fantastic experience. I totally recommend the hotel. The next time I go to New York, whilst its nice to 'try somewhere new' I shall be do my best to stay in the Dumont.We asked for a view of the Chrysler building, Id recommend this. What a site! The only other point Id make apart from all the other ones on the site are that the Kingsize bed was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. Having a bad back and being 6ft 4 in height, I can be quite particular about the bed. I could have slept for years. Infact it was so comfortable that at times its hard to get up at all! Also I used the gym. Its the first Hotel Gym I have been in that actually provides enough good equipment to work out with!If youre like me and you spends ages researching a hotel online before you book it, stop researching, the reviews ring true. This is a fantastic place to stay.We stayed over the third weekend in January having travelled over from Ireland.Finally theres a great Italian restaurnat on 3rd avenue. Take a right as you go out the door and its just across the street.

<Content>Great value - but wait until you get a bill We stayed at Affinia Dumont in Dec '04, and was quite happy until we checked out. The room is spacious as a New York standard, and people were very friendly. But, we were surprised to find a mini-bar charge on our bill when we were going to check out. In general, my husband and I would never touch on anything from a mini-bar because we always get drinks and snakes from outside before we head back to the hotel. And that was the case for this stay as well. We told them we did not consume anything, and they checked with housekeeping and took out the charge from our bill. Well, a months later when we got our credit card bill, we found another attempted charge!! Of course, we insisted that it has to be mistake, but the person we spoke to said that she had to get back to us, so they have not yet cleared this charge. Be sure you check your hotel bill and the credit card! I would hope that this hotel is not trying to trick their customers, but it is wired that it happened twice for our one stay. Its a nice hotel, but only pay cash so they can't sneak charges to your credit card after you've left!.

<Content>First time in NYC This was my first time going to NYC and the reviews from this site made this hotel sound great. The suite was huge, with a equally gigantic desk to work at. The workers were very polite, but the ones we asked for advice on food and where to go were somewhat clueless. Even simple questions about the subway system seemed too difficult for them. I would have preferred more for my money (+$250) and having to transfer subways all the time was tedious. If I ever go back, I will choose a hotel near the transfer station (like grand central)

<Content>Good Value I have stayed here on 3 seperate occasions. The rooms are very roomy, clean, and modern. We've also been upgraded for free to a suite. Other New York hotels are so small. I preferred the Affinia to the Plaza.

<Content>Great stay at the Affinia Dumont: you get your money's worth I give the Affinia Dumont an excellent rating for its value though I will try not to overstate it as a luxury hotel which to some it would be categorized while others might find it a bit disappointing. Overall, it's a great value.My wife and I stayed at the Affinia Dumont Jan. 19-23 (Wed-Sun) in a Jr. Suite. (we were originally booked for a studio suite but we upgraded because of unavailability). We paid $219 per night for the Junior suite. I'd recommend to check out the (---) website to look at pictures and read about what they offer. This would be better rated a 3 - 3 1/2 star hotel if you are one accustomed to the Ritz, Hiltons and other high end hotels. Overall we were very happy with our stay though my interior design wife picked up on small things the hotel does to keep prices low (veneers on the furniture instead of solid woods, old kitchen, etc.). My wife and I would stay again though I'd recommend a higher floor than our 7th floor suite so you could have a better view and less street noise.My wife and I were impressed with:1. Closeness to the subway: 33rd and Park Ave is just a block west and south of the hotel which makes for a short 2-5 minute walk. The 6 line runs north/south out of this station and it's easy to get just about anywhere in Manhattan and the greater New York area. Penn Station is only 1 mile east of the Affinia Dumont which made it convenient for us to take the AirTrain from JFK into Manhattan (we took a cab ride from the hotel to JFK on our outbound and it only took us 30 minutes on a low traffic day).2. Pleasantness of the staff: everyone from the doorman, bellhop, front desk and maid service were kind and helpful. They tried to meet our every request and did so with a smile. We had a small problem with our heater the first night that was quickly fixed after a couple phone calls. They even gave us an extra space heater for my wife who gets really cold. 3. Quality of the rooms: We had a Jr. Suite that looked just like the pictures online. It was clean, spacious and seemed in good shape. There is a full but small kitchen that is nothing to write home about but we were able to get great use out of it by buying groceries and reheating leftovers, etc. The bathroom is nicely done with hot water and good water pressure. The soaps and lotions are from Aveda.4. Extras: hi-speed internet is offered though we did not use for $10/day. It is known as a health/fitness hotel though we didn't take advantage of that either. A nice touch was their choice of pillows: down, synthetic, buckwheat or memory foam. Nice touch. No real downsides if you are looking for a spacious midtown Manhattan hotel with good service and nice rooms for a fair price. This is not the Ritz but then again, you're not paying Ritz prices either! I would highly recommend it for a weekend getaway, corporate event or any visit where you want to be in midtown Manhattan for a reasonable price.

<Content>Fantastic Experience! The hotel experience was wonderful from start to finish. From the minute we entered the doors, we knew this visit would be special. The check-in was extremely easy, and we were struck by the friendliness and competence of the staff. As soon as we entered the room, we felt like VIP's thanks to the thoughtfulness of the manager, Joe, since he made sure to welcome us with champagne to help us celebrate our wedding anniversary. Joe does a truly wonderful job in making everyone's stay a fabulous experience. The room was beautiful and all our requests were met (corner room, DVD player). Every member of the hotel staff was cordial and knowledgeable. Customer service seemed to be a top priority, something not too common these days in many businesses. The cleanliness of the hotel was particularly striking. The location was wonderful, especially since we are familiar with the area restaurants, the Barking Dog, in particular. We had a great time.

<Content>Best Choice in NY! I just spent MLK Weekend at the Affinia Dumont in NY and was pleasantly surprised that such excellent service could exist in NY!My stay required an early check-in, a late check-out, and a third person staying in a 2-queen room, and the A.D. staff did not charge me for any of these accomodations, which most hotels would charge a fee, or give you attitude for. Our room had a kitchen with stove, refrigerator, and microwave, as well as complimentary coffee and tea. The water pressure in the shower was the best of any hotel I've ever stayed in!The location was extremely convenient to the Empire State, Macy's, Grand Central Station, and the Flat Iron building. Not as close to 5th Ave, Central Park and Times Square, but still just a $6-8 cab ride away.The spa has outstanding staff and facilities. The restaurant below the hotel has excellent breakfast, and is as charming as you can get.I can't recommend this place enough. Check out the specials on their website or try Travelocity for a good price.

<Content>Perfect location, very clean, friendly staff We just got back. We stayed here because of all the nice reviews on Tripadvisor. And they were correct. Everything and everyone is nice and friendly. Rooms are nice (but not that big as some reviews make you believe). The refridgerator can be a little noisy at night for light sleepers. And we did not see any evening turndown service a we read in a review. The location is perfect. Close to third ave where a lot of restaurants and bars are located.

<Content>Exceptional Service and Convenient Location With two kids in tow (ages 10 and 6), we found the Dumont to be extremely accommodating and caring that they, as well as us, had a pleasant stay. The upper floor provided a great view of Manhattan and the location was perfect for either uptown or downtown forays. Highly recommended!

<Content>Nice rooms, nice service! Stayed one week during New Year. I went based on the reviews and everything is true! It is really a good hotel, with excellent service. All people are very kind and polite!Only thing bad was the check in/check out procedures. I somehow felt unshure of the charges made in my credit card. Both recepcionists looked a little bit unreliable during procedures. Appart from that...perfect!

<Content>Great hotel. Great value. Most 4 star hotels we have stayed in are not as nice as the Affinia Dumont which for some reason is only rated 3 stars. The king junior suite was very attractive and roomy... and it has to be one of the best values in New York. Staff was extremely friendly, too. Location is convenient to both uptown and downtown. We'll be back.

<Content>an ordinary hotel I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights based on the reviews, and I would like to say this is one of the over rated hotels out there, for my 190 bucks/night, I don't think this hotel is that great, here is why:* the location is not very convinient: the closest subway station is green line on 33rd st, which was not too far, but you will then almost always need to transfer to other routes to get to major attractions/shopping districts. As for walking, it's a bit ou of walking distance from anywhere*hotel is not as clean as it should be: I found left over peanuts(from the last guest) in my kitchen.*my kitchen creaks, this was particularly annoying at night, I guess this is due to the fact that this is an old building, and renovation was done on the old building on the plus side: the service was goodI would probably give it a 3 or 4 stars on usual bases, but just to alert some of you out there who is looking for a great hotel at reasonable price in NYC, this one may well be under your expectation, for me, if I would make the choice again, I would rather stay in a budget hotel and save the money for some other things.I hope this review(based on my experience) helps.

<Content>SHHHH...Best Kept Secret in the City!!!!! Let's Keep it that way!!!! I visited the Dumont from 12/29 - 12/31/04. I needed to get away from Hotlanta to reflect on the old and prepare myself for the new year. On previous trips to NYC, my hotel of choice was the Millineum Broadway, which is right in the heart of TS. Because of the holiday, everything in TS was already booked or the prices were outrageous. After speaking with Otto (the Affinia reservationist) and having him tell me that if I ever stayed at any of the 9 Affinia hotels, I would never want to stay anywhere else. I had my doubts, especially since the suite room was $179 per night during the holiday season. Well Otto was right, I was completely blown away by the quality of the spacious studio suite, the fully equipped gym, and the kindness of the staff. The Affinia Dumont definitely felt like a home away from home....Affinia Hotels for life.....

<Content>If your hubby snores.. or if you're a smoker... We travel all over the world and normally stay in 5 star hotel suites where ever we go. Because of the high occupancy rate in NYC during the Christmas holiday 2004, we made the choice to stay at the Affinia Dumont based on TripAdvisor reviews.We reserved a one-bedroom suite (smoking.. which is so rare in the city now) and were extremely pleased with our suite (2301)! HUGE! Absolutely over the top for the amount of space for the price! (A comparable room at the St. Regis would be well over $1500 a night at that time of year.) I would recommend a higher floor (38 in all) so you get some view and away from street traffic. (We had no noise in our room; very quiet!)The staff did all our grocery shopping beforehand (I faxed a list before we arrived) and made certain that everything was as ordered. So nice to fix a light breakfast in our kitchen before hitting the town for shopping. Plus, room service for late night desserts and coffee is super quick and very, very good!Christoper the doorman was a true delight to see each morning! He bent over backwards to make certain we had a taxi when needed. And he remembered us each time we saw him. Definitely a great asset to that hotel! Matter of fact, the entire staff was SO ACCOMODATING... very unpretentious! The nicest we've encountered in NYC!!!The beds devine and the staff handled turn down service as well as making up the plush pull out sofa. (My husband snores terribly so this was a great get away sleep space!) Down pillows, comforters and flowers. The gym (a REAL gym) and elegant spa services were great!Never having taken the subway in the city before, we hopped on the No. 6 train and were on the upper east side in minutes and in the midst of great shopping and then hop back on the subway back to a very quiet and very neighborhood feel. Great to be off those crowded 5th Ave. sidewalks!We will definitely make the Affinia Dumont our place to stay in the City from now on!

<Content>The Best Stay Ever! We stayed at the Affinia Dumont for three nights and it was everything I expected  everything that was written as Excellent here on Tripadvisor.com. I really wanted to make sure I was choosing a comfortable, spacious, and not too close to the NYC noise. And that's what we got. We were walkin distance to the subway, a taxi was always easy to get from the hotel, the hotel offered many amenities, the front desk/doorman/housekeeping was superb! It made being away from the kids easy....especially being on our wedding anniversary trip the best couple's trip! :) Also, the Empire State Bldg was only a couple blocks away, along with many shopping...and the blocks around there are short. Even walking to Times Square would have been easy (20-25 min?) I just can't say enough of this place. We would definitely come back here.

<Content>Great hotel, great staff! I picked the Dumont from the reviews on this web site and we were not disappointed.We stayed in a studio room which was huge. It had everything we needed.The kitchen had a microwave, huge fridge freezer, full size oven and hob and plenty of utensils - it was immaculately clean.The bathroom had a marble top sink, great bath and powerful shower. The toiletries were Aveda - shampoo, conditioner, mouth wash, soap, shower cap and moisturiser. Nice and plentiful towels.The room had a huge bed which was extremely comfortable. The room lighting was great and the heating just right(you could adjust it to what you wanted). Massive desk with internet connections. Plenty of storage and an in room safe.The reception area is small but comfy and the staff are really good and helpful - nothing too much trouble.I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.

<Content>Wonderful at the Affinia I met my husband, who was presenting at a conference, for a NYC weekend getaway. Hotel in close proximity to Penn Station. Made reservations at the Affinia based on the reviews of this website - I am so glad we did! The rooms were immaculate and the staff was excellent. We had a death in the family and had to leave a day early, and they took care of everything - even stopping a charge for a spa visit I was unable to make (spa was off site) due to the family emergency.

<Content>Superb stay at the Dumont! My wife and I recently spent a week in NYC and used this board to choose the Affinia Dumont. When we arrived, everyone was pleasant and helpful. The hotel had a small grocery next door, which came in handy with the great kitchen in the room. We were on the top floor and has a phenomenal evening view of both the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building from our window. All the services were outstanding and the price was unreal! We will stay here everytime we return to NYC. The subway is nearby, so getting around town is quite easy once you master the transit map. The is an absolute hidden jewel in the Big Apple!

<Content>Fantastic Hotel, early reviews were right... We've just come back from a fantastic stay in NY over Thanksgiving. From first booking the hotel until we left the staff at the hotel have been fantastic, it seemed like nothing was too much trouble for them. The room was spacious and very clean with great views across the city. The Barking Dog restaurant was great, only $7 + tip for a big breakfast. Try Cinema restaurant (out the hotel turn tight and on the junction) for dinner.Got to know the door staff, met Christopher who was a friendly guy and always welcomed us back to the hotel and even gave info about our flight being delayed etc, they seemed to know who we were, when we were leaving etc. If you want to book a car through them they can organise that too which we did although in hindsight we'll probably use Carmel next time.We're hoping to go back next year and will definitely be staying at the Affinia again, money very well spent, enjoy!

<Content>Pros and Cons Recently spent 5 nights here in a one-bedroom. Chose this hotel because we needed space and kitchen facilities while one of us recuperated from surgery at a local hospital.Pros: spacious layout, very convenient location, well-equipped clean kitchen, very nice toiletries (Aveda), friendly staff, large screen tvCons: hallways and apt. walls really needed painting--starting to look shabby; furniture a bit worn; one bedspread had 2 large holes in it and was stained; tub caulking was moldy; heating in apt. was difficult to adjust; apt. did not have dining table and meals had to be taken sitting on the sofa or at the desk.Would recommend this hotel mainly for those who really need space and cooking facilities--good value.

<Content>Worth More I was lucky to get a room in NYC late October and even luckier when I chose Affinia Dumont. I've stayed in NYC a couple times for fun and I know NYC hotel rooms. They are small and cramped. I'm pretty cheap so I really can't afford nicer, more spacious rooms. I only paid $200 or so per night (for 2 nights) at the Affinia and it should've cost me more. The room was MASSIVE compared to all the other rooms (closets) I've stayed in before. I got the jr. suite. Anyway, it was my boyfriend's birthday present to stay a weekend in NYC and I got major props for choosing this particular hotel. Yes, I got major props indeed. Wink* Wink* If you want to get major quantities of props, stay at the Affinia.

<Content>Big rooms/friendly staff Chose the Dumont as our base of operations for Thanksgiving in NYC this year. We were not disappointed. Our room was large, modern and clean. High speed internet service kept us connected when we wanted to be. The staff was friendly, helpful and happy. They made us feel welcome each time we passed through the lobby area. The location on E34th St. is quiet and safe with all the conveniences around us. We would recommend this property to others.

<Content>Doesn't Get Better Than This!!!! Stayed at Ritzs, The Bellevue in Phila, NY Hyatt, and many Marriots but nothing compares to The Affinia Dumont. My husband and I just stayed there last night. I mentioned via online reservation that we were celebrating our anniversary. We arrived to check in and was welcomed with Happy Anniversary by front desk staff. We were immediately upgraded to a corner suite on the 34th floor, a large room with amazing views of the city, Aveda bath products AND a dozen pink roses compliments of the hotel. This just doesn't happen to the not rich and famous. From the moment we stepped in to the time we left, our stay was phenominal. The spa was great and breakfast at the Barking Dog was tasty. Andrey at the front desk was so helpful. He got us reservations to a great restaurant and hailed us a taxi. We were treated like royalty. Being a people watcher, I noticed the other guests were treated the same way. Many were referred to by name and one gentleman said he only stays at the Dumont when in NYC. Unfortunately, with all the great reviews, it will probably be tough to get reservations but I can't imagine staying anywhere else!

<Content>Great suite with a view After countless hours searching for a good hotel deal for our first trip to New York, and based on reviews here, we choose the Affinia Dumont. Boy, are we glad we did. We booked our trip Wednesday and arrived Sunday for four days. The people at the front desk were all friendly and helpful, holding our bags until there was a room ready (we were early). We had a large suite with kitchenette, large living room, bedroom and bath on the 36th floor overlooking the East River. There were great restaurants and the subway nearby. 34th is a two-way street which made us feel safer walking at night. We did not see the inside of any of the other hotels we were considering but we did see the outside of quite a few. Some were on small dark streets and did not look very appealing. Our room was $370 a night and after comparing prices and size we would stay at the Dumont again in a flash. Great Job done by everyone there!!!

<Content>A pleasant surprise We moved to the Affinia Dumont after a bad experience at another hotel. From the moment we were greeted by the doorman, we knew that we had picked a great hotel. Wonderful staff, quiet, spacious rooms and very comfortable bed. They have a very nice spa as well. Not the most convenient location - especially when you need to get a taxi, but otherwise a nice, quiet neighborhood. With the caveat of location, I would recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Believe the reviews Just got back from a weekend in the City and chose the Affinia Dumont based in part on what we read on tripavisor - some may wonder whether a friendly hotel staff makes a difference - all i can say is stay at Parker Meridian and ask for some help and then stay at Affinia and note the difference - i have - the hotel is quiet and understated with larger than average rooms and yes, an amazing staff - The neighborhood location is perfect for anyone looking to find a nice restaurant of deli that actually services locals as much as they do tourists -

<Content>We were very, very happy! After HOURS of internet hotel shopping, I somehow stumbled upon the Affinia Dumont on this site. Well, what a relief! I wasn't finding anything in our price range that didn't have a horror story or two associated with it. Whether it was dirty rooms, bugs, rude staff, or simply the size, everything I looked at had problems - until I reviewed the Affinia, which had consistenly good reviews! This was our first overnight stay in NYC, so I can't compare it to anything else in the city, but we were very pleased. The location isn't in the heart of things, which we appreciated. But, we were able to walk or take the subway everywhere we wanted to go, up and down Manhattan, and even walked to the hotel from Penn Station when we arrived by Amtrak. (We took a cab back b/c after 4 days of pounding the pavement, we needed the break! With tip, it was $10 in heavy traffic.) Even after a late show (11PM), the subway was great - a big change from memories of the city 20 years ago. As for the hotel, we had a suite that we got for $248/night. I used the price comparisons on this site, and for some reason, tavelocity gave a much lower rate than all the others (the prices were always consistent for other hotels; I think this was a fluke!). I contacted the hotel directly and they honored the price. We weren't able to get a room with a view, but for the price, we couldn't complain. It's still hard to think this was a deal, but I think it really was. And, we were surprised that everything else in NY seemed reasonably priced. As others have said, the suite was huge, clean, and nicely furnished (contemporary, but warm, with fun art and a simple little kitchenette). There were nice extras like a halltree for coats, and an umbrella (which we used!), a velour throw for curling up on the sofa, and a shaving mirror in the shower. Our suite had great built-in armoire, with plenty of closet space, drawers, and a safe. There were beverages and snacks in the room, but as in all hotels, the prices were high. We stopped at the mini-market on the corner for stuff, and there was a real grocer on Lexington and 35th. NOTE: While there's a kitchenette, there's no dining table, so if traveling with kids, they should be old enough to eat on the couch. I used the fitness center, which had treadmills, bikes, and eliptical trainers, all good quality and in great shape, with their own TVs. There was also some weight equipment. The spa looked nice, though we didn't use it. The hotels offers fit kits to use during your stay, which we never did request - for strength training, walking, running, or yoga. They even include a CD or MP3 player. I regret not asking for the walking kit, which included a pedometer. It would have been interesting to know how much walking we did during our stay. As others have said, the staff were all very friendly and welcoming. There were several great places right on 34th to grab a bagel and fresh juice or coffee in the AM or a sandwich, soup /or salad for a lite dinner in your room. (We tried Guy  Gallard, GiGi's,  Austin's - all good). There's also a good Jewish deli on Lexington  36th or 37th. I've written way too much, but want everyone to know this is a safe bet. I know it's tough to plan a trip to NYC, especially if you're not familiar with the area. And if this property doesn't work for you, check out some of the other Affinia properties, all in Manhattan ---------. Some a little cheper, some more spendy. One even accepts pets!

<Content>Best Kept Secret in New York Just came back from spending 4 nights at the Dumont (Oct 4-8), and it was one of the best hotel experiences I have ever had in New York.I got a one bedroom suite that overlooked the east river, the living room and bedrooms were very large, and it had a small kitchen that came in very handy...I felt like I was in my own New York apartment. The bed was heavenly, on the scale of the Westin or W hotels, and the furnishings in the rest of the apartment were modern and clean. The staff at the hotel was exceptional and responded immediately to any little thing I needed (restaurant menus, a vase for the flowers I bought, etc). Housekeeping was there every morning and came back whenever I asked.One day, after walking most of the morning, my tired body decided to just stop on the spa floor and check it out. They could immediately take me in for a massage which turned out to be the best thing I did for myself that day! After the massage, I used the steam room, then took a shower and I was mellowed out for the rest of the day.I especially loved the location... it's in a residential area, instead of the hustle and bustle of midtown or times square, which means the restaurants are less expensive and there are grocery stores, laundries, nail salons all within blocks of the hotel. Yet, it is close to the lexington avenue subway @ 33rd Street.... and the 34th St crosstown bus is right outside the door. It is also an easy walk to Grand Central and Macy's.Would I stay there again... in a heartbeat!

<Content>Giant room by NYC standards at a good price. We stayed recently in a 1bdrm suite and were thrilled to death with the size of the room. Came from the Casablanca and found the Dumont to be super large in comparison and $40 cheaper. Had a full kitchen, living area, bedroom and a nice bathroom with great water pressure in the shower.Room was clean. Staff were friendly and helpful. Many nice restaurants and deli's in the area. We'll definitely be back.

<Content>Family-friendly to a T I'm usually a denizen of grubby, shared-bath hotels downtown, but with the family joining me for a weekend night (and with an expense account to burn) I splurged for a junior suite at the Affinia Dumont for $289 plus tax (which brought it to $329.)Knowing very well what a dollar buys in terms of NYC hotels, I have to say that I was really floored with what we got for our money. The room was large -- not just large-for-New-York -- but large, period. Compare to Amerisuites or Embassy Suites elsewhere. The bed was comparable to the Westin or W, the bath was stocked with Aveda products, and the multiple dimmers for lighting were great. The desk and workspace were top notch and heavily used by us -- the Aeon chair was sharp.I had the presence of mind to ask for a Chrysler Building view, which we got and then some. We were on the 34th Floor in a corner room overlooking the heart of midtown *and* the East River. My almost two-year-old loved climbing up to the windows, looking out and saying Noo Yorchhh!The kitchenette was fully stocked and had everything we'd need to all-out cook if we wanted to: gas range, microwave, large refrigerator, plates, glasses and silverware. It was great for warming up milk for my daughter, at the very least, and handy when we ordered from the nearby Barking Dog and had leftovers.A word about the restaurant -- decent value for money and even a good deal if you ordered it as room service! Room service just adds $2 and a 17% tip on the market prices on the menu. Since I tip 20% in restaurants anyway, that's a good deal. (But since I'm a cheapskate, I called in my order and picked it up personally!)I didn't end up using the gym, but I checked it out and was pleased to discover that there were enough machines for me to do the same workout I usually do at my local Y. Awesome for a hotel gym.All in all, really unbeatable at the sub-$300 level. I'm hard pressed to think how you could do better in NYC.

<Content>Great fitness hotel! The theme for this hotel is fitness (other Affinias have relaxation or location as themes) and it had a great fitness kit that could be used in the room, as well as a very good gym (open to guests 24 hrs.) and a great steam room. The staff were all super friendly and helpful. The rooms (we had a one bedroom suite - 2 dbl beds and another roomw/foldout couch) were reminiscent of the ones at the Sofitel in NYC, but more spacious. Great beds (almost seemed like the Westin heavenly beds!)!! Housekeeping was a bit odd, but ask at the desk if you need anything (or the room done at a certain time) and they'll get it done. Also, I like to walk and found the location just far enough from the theatre area to make a decent walk. Took about 20 - 25 minutes. Also - the Madison Bistro, on Madison, a few blocks up from the hotel, was a great spot for dinner. There's a place called something like GiGi's, around Madison and 34th (on 34th) that's very good for breakfast.Very impressive hotel, overall.

<Content>wow! I stayed at the Affinia Dumont for 3 nights in June, 04. The stay was nothing less than spectacular! We stayed in a junior suite with 2 queen size beds. The staff was extremely friendly helping us with theatre reservations and to book other activities. Although a bit pricy, it was well worth it. Plenty of space! Large bathrooms, kitchen, and the beds were very comfortable. I will definetly stay there again!

<Content>Fantastic I just returned from NYC yesterday after my first stay at the Affinia Dumont, and the entire experience was fantastic! The lobby was welcoming and calming (fruit and juice for guests); the view from the room was spectacular; the suites were contemporary and comfortable; the fitness room actually looked like one (lots of hotels have a few machines in varying working conditions but NOT here: weight machines; free weights; mats; medicine balls; 2-3 stability balls; 3 treadmills; 3 stairclimbers; 3 bikes--treadmills had their own monitors with complimentary headphones) and I simply cannot compliment the hotel's staff enough! Gina, Glen and Alex in particular are outstanding--very personable AND professional. This hotel really suited my needs because I was visiting the city with my parents and two young nieces. We stayed in a one-BR suite. I requested two full-sized beds in the bedroom (which they said were available) but the hotel called me a few days before, saying they only had king-sized beds available. I asked for a roll-away bed and they accommodated me without extra charge (usually a $20/night fee). My parents slept in the BR; my nieces on the roll-away bed; and I slept on the sofa/pull-out bed. And having a kitchen was a lifesaver! I've visited lots of hotels for both work and leisure, but this was far away the best hotel experience I've ever had. When visiting the city, we usually stay at another hotel--but not any longer! The Affinia Dumont will be our new home when we visit the city.

<Content>Wow...phenomenal hotel!! This hotel is the best that I have ever stayed in...and I am a frequent business traveler. I did at least two weeks of research before booking a room at the Affinia Dumont. I really wanted to find a place that would be contemporary, spacious, a great value and a good location. I have very expectations, but since this was my first time, I told myself to not such high expectations. Boy, was I in for a surprise!! The staff was exceptional, the room was amazing and the location of the hotel was outstanding. One of the biggest things that I experienced was a great feeling of comfort. I felt like the hotel was my second home and I have never experienced this before in any other hotel. My husband who is incredibly picky and has a great eye for detail was floored by how much better the executive desk and chair was compared to at home and he especially appreciated the use of lights, extra plugs and dimmer switches throughout the room. The attention to detail in the room's layout and decor was very apparent.Anyways, if you are reading this, stop researching and book a room at this fine hotel...you will not be disappointed!!

<Content>Nice, but not as nice as expected After reading the reviews here on tripadvisor, I cancelled the reservation I had at another hotel and reserved here. I was travelling on business, but with my family (husband and two small kids).I had a few problems. I had requested early check-in so that I could dress and prepare for a business meeting, but this request was not honored. When I asked about internet cables, maps of NYC, and coupons to the Empire State Building, the staff claimed to be out of all of these. They did not offer to accommodate me in any other way. Also, the door to the bathroom was broken and could not close, a problem because we were four people in the room. The bedspread on the bed was stained on the side closest to the bed. The staff did not seem to be knowledgeable about things to do with kids in New York (didn't know where the zoo was, couldn't recommend restaurants, etc.). The front desk, while very personable, was not very efficient. While my small kids and I waited in line for assistance, one staff member spent at least 15 minutes helping a young guest choose a club to go out to that night. Finally, when I called the hotel the week before my stay and asked for concierge help with getting a theater ticket, she said she would do so, but never ended up calling me back. The plusses: The room was spacious and had a wonderful view. The staff was very friendly to my children. The location of the hotel was terrific (near Macy's, lots of shopping, etc.). There was a really good Chinese restaurant right around the corner from the hotel -- go left out of hotel, turn left on Lexington, it's on the left. However, I usually stay at the Casablanca, and I'll probably go back there.

<Content>Great place overall Loved the Affinia Dumont Suites. Desk staff and doormen very friendly and helpful. Rooms were terrific, spacious (NY spacious) and clean. It's in a great location in Manhatten. Easy access to lower Manhatten or Midtown. Our only issue was, we had booked non-smoking and upon arrival there were no more non-smoking available. We were assured the rooms were freshened however, they still wreaked of cigarette smoke, despite the best efforts of housekeeping. I'd definitely stay at this hotel again if I were guaranteed a non-smoking room.No offense but the no smoking restaurant laws should be extended to hotels!Definitely worth a try!

<Content>Believe all the great things you've heard about Affinia Dumont. The Affinia Dumont must be NYC's best value. The accommodations and perks are impressive for the money paid, especially when I read horrible reviews of much more expensive hotels. I recently returned from a three-night stay and can't say enough good things about the Dumont. My husband and I got a one-bedroom suite. The room was stylish, cozy and very clean. We had great views of the city from both the living area and bedroom. The bedroom had built-in storage with plenty of room for clothes and other belongings. We could control the temperture separately for the bedroom and living area. We even had our own remote-controlled stereo. The Thai restaurant next door was great and had very reasonable prices. The Barking Dog, which is in the same building as the Dumont and provides room service, was also good and had a quaint courtyard. (The BD did seem a little pricey to me for what you got, but was probably average for NYC.)With a subway stop a block up, a corner grocery and drugstore, and several restaurants nearby, it felt like our own private neighborhood in the big city.The elevators were always available and very efficient. Also, the staff were extremely courteous and professional.One note: The locals and cab drivers seem to know the place as the Dumont Plaza, which I assume is a former name. This can cause some confusion when taking a cab, so keep that in mind.

<Content>Can't Wait to Get Back! We JUST got back from the Affinia Dumont, and all I can say is WOW! Checking in was easy, the people were unbelievably friendly, courteous, and helpful, and the room was great! We got in early, and Gina at the front desk told us if we could check in later she'd get us a room up high. We checked our luggage in, and took off to do some touring! When we came back, she was true to her word. We were on the highest floor, the 37th, with an unbelievable view of the Chrysler Building! We stayed in the studio suite, with the king sized bed. It was great!! The bathroom had all of the amenities and more, and the room was spacious with a desk area, and 2 comfortable extra chairs!We will DEFINATELY be staying here again!

<Content>Spacious, Gracious and Well Located We just returned from a weekend stay at the Affinia Dumont. Our adjoining 8th floor rooms afforded us over 1,000 square feet of space. Plush bedding with padded leather headboards. Well-outfitted marble baths were compact, but with a plethora of accessories and conveniences. Toiletries were signature blends from the Affinia Spa on the premises. Rooms feature a fully stocked galley style kitchen. I have never seen so much workable desk space in a hotel before, although the faux black leather-look desktop was cheezy. An comfortable Aeron desk chair was a nice surprise. The modern decor featured many unique lighting opportunities, all with dimmer switches. Large screen TVs (maybe 32 inch?) and a stereo system were on hand, as well as Sony Dream Machine bedside alarm clock and CD players. Materials in the room were in good condition with minimal signs of wear and tear. An on site restaurant, The Barking Dog, supplies the room service, which appeared to be decently priced. A total of only 7 rooms on our floor provided plenty of quiet and privacy for our group of six. Street noises were mild and were of the of police siren variety. Heavy cream draperies and mesh sheers were on the wall to wall windows. The bellstaff, especially Christopher, was great. Christopher was most helpful and friendly. The rate for the two suites was $429. In comparison to what you get in a standard hotel room for $250-$400 a night, it was a good value. Parking for an SUV was $42. We kept our vehicle parked and our luggage checked in until 8 PM on the day we checked out. Upon our return, Christopher swiftly gathered our bags and our SUV was waiting out front for us in no time. Just a few blocks from the Empire State Building and Macy's, and with nice restaurants nearby, the Affinia Dumont is a good choice for a weekend trip or a romantic getaway.
