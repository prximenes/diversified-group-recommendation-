<Content>A great 2-star hotel. We stayed at the Sterling because the nightclub we were going to is upstairs in the penthouse suite. We were able to get on an elevator after a night of partying rather than driving or taking a taxi.The outside area, pool and lobby look great but the rooms are just so-so. The bathroom was dirty looking and I wouldn't use the shower unless absolutely necessary. The bed was comfortable but the comforter/blanket had stains on it. Thank goodness I had brought an extra blanket and our own pillows.The staff is friendly though.We will stay here again but I will bring my own sheets, blanket and definitely some spray clorox to clean the doorknobs, bath sink, shower and toilet.I don't think it was worth $89.00 but we will pay that again to be close to our destination.

<Content>Good Hotel, Good Price~ Was a little worried from previous reviews but decided to stay anyways. Was a good hotel at a good price. Not a 4/5 Star hotel but a 2 star for sure. Staff was very helpful and nice. Room was OK! Will stay again when back in Dallas!

<Content>THe WORST HOTEL ever! * Though the hotel advertised wireless AND wired internet available in rooms, unless you had a direct view of the Super 8 down the street AND got the password from the Sterling Hotel manager or owner, you were screwed. Add to that the wireless that you could get in the lobby was pretty worthless and had a cap on number of concurrent connections.* NO service in the restaurant. NO...I don't mean poor... We sat there at breakfast, one of only 2-3 tables occupied, for 10 MINUTES without getting a menu, water or drinks. We spotted a breakfast buffet and went and helped ourselves...never DID get water, or coffee, or drinks... (This happened on THREE different occasions over 4 days where it took over 2 hours once to get sandwiches!)* Elevators constantly going out of service on Sunday and remaining that way for a couple of hours each time...And then...the coup de grace... I bring towels almost everywhere I travel. Not your average towels, but HUGE, thick, DARK BLUE bath sheets. Never once has anyone ever mistaken them for the postage stamp size, white, thin hotel towels...until this weekend, when they disappeared. According to the hotel and housekeeping they must have grown legs.

<Content>Adamar Club I have a friend who has done the extended stay at the Sterling Hotel for the past 2 years+. Frequently we meet at the Adamar Club for drinks, shuffleboard, or Karaoke ( on Friday/Saturday nights). It's a fun place with very relaxed  friendly atmosphere. The staff makes you feel at home  safe.My experience has always been good. They have great hamburgers and frozen margaritas, too.....see what you think!Zeppster

<Content>Safe extended stay home I am a single woman and choose to make Sterling Hotel Dallas my home for the past two years. The staff has been like family to me. I feel very comfortable and safe at this extended stay hotel. When friends and family stop by to visit, we meet at the Sports bar downstairs, as it is considered my living room.Thank you to the fine staff for making your hotel my safe, comfortable home.

<Content>Hate the Sterling Hotel Dallas The pictures on the website are very deceiving. The hotel is dirty, the beds are so old they cave in the middle. They cater to truck drivers. The personnel is very rude. Never ever stay at this hotel. The cost was way above average. Total score -1.

<Content>Most run-down, deceiving hotel ever Horrible place. Awful service. They acted like they didn't care. The hotel is run down. The hot water barely works. Every floor has a different foul odor and had a different nasty motif. There were rooms that you could see inside because the door knobs had been removed, and you could see inside--ripped up wallpaper--looked like a crime scene. The hot tub was so thick with dirt and grime you couldn't see the bottom. The restaurant closes at 2pm. You have to become a member of the bar in order for them to serve you. The sink in the men's bathroom wasn't even attached. I turned it on, and it started spraying water all over me. Some rooms wouldn't lock and others your keys would just stop working. There was no shuttle to the DFW airport. One of the elevators wasn't working. I could go on and on.

<Content>Nastiest place I have ever stayed! Do Not Stay Here!!!!! Vile. Disgusting. Gross. Nauseating.... Are you getting the picture yet? If not, read on...We stayed for New Year's Eve  the New Year's Day game at Texas Stadium. We'd had confirmed reservations for 3 weeks, which had been double-confirmed just before we headed to Dallas, as was our shuttle from Love Field. When we arrived, no shuttle. We called. No shuttle. We called again. No shuttle. We called a third time, and after almost 2 hours of waiting, a van picked us up (but WE had to find the tiny computer-generated paper in the window saying Sterling because there were no logos on the van  they wouldn't take OUR descriptions to look for us - even though we were the only ones being picked up).Ok, next... We check in. Fairly smooth process. We go to our room on the 8th floor. It's somewhat smelly, but we can handle it. It was really pretty dirty, though. Again, we're just going to handle it. There are hairs in the bathroom on the floor, as well as in the tub - and a towel. (And by later that night, hundreds of tiny ants in the bathroom - remember, it's the 8th floor!!!). The 3 parties the hotel offered that night were run by private groups  we wouldn't have fit for any of them, so we used the computer (the ONE computer they have) to look for alternatives. No printing services  the computer is slow as dirt. We find a newly opened restaurant throwing a party in town - roundtrip, it was over $50 in cab fare, because the sterling wouldn't transport us... They would have to the West End, but would've charged extra. No thanks!Did I mention that the front desk staff could have cared less about how dirty our room was? Refused to move us or let us out of our reservation w/o charging us!Oh, and backing up... the ONLY thing around this place is... NOTHING!!! There's a really really nasty dive to eat at across the street, but even it has extremely limited hours. There's a Jack in the Box, if you want to walk down the road a little bit, but it's slower than anything I've ever imagined (we stood in line for over an hour for food!!!!!). There's also a restaurant in the hotel, but it's SOOOOO disgusting that BOTH of us got sick after eating it. Nasty. Nasty. Nasty. There's also a sports bar if you want to call it that - more like a little hotel bar with a couple of tv's and booths - but you let me know if you like it, or dare eat at it after seeing how dirty and unkept the rest of the hotel is. One plus - the beers were cheap! But, the place closes really early.Arcade? Yeah, that's a joke. I think it had maybe 1 machine in it from the early 1980's, and I'm not even certain it was working.But read on if that's not enough....We booked reservations on the shuttle to and from the game at the Texas Stadium. It cost extra ($30 to be exact). Getting on the going to shuttle was no problem. A little crowded, but nothing too bad. Coming back, after the game?? Haha We actually left the game EARLY to find the shuttle. It wasn't there. We saw all the shuttles from all the other hotels, but nothing from the Sterling. We kept being told it would be coming or that the Sterling was borrowing the Marriott's shuttle and once the Marriott was done with the shuttle, it would let the Sterling use it. We waited and waited, along with 100+ other angry people who were quickly gathering as it went on 11, 12... Finally, almost all the shuttles for everywhere else were gone, and we saw a bus approaching.... We RAN as fast as we could  jumped onto it. Fortunately, they were there for the Sterling guests... However, they only had room for about 25 people, if that, and we had to almost barricade the doors to keep the mob of people trying to get back to the Sterling from coming on board, and the driver made promises to them of another shuttle coming right behind him. I'm not sure what time everyone got back, or if they did, but for us it was almost 1am - the hotel is 1.5 miles from the stadium, and we were waiting at the gate for the shuttle at 9:45pm. Hmmmm. I also heard people the next morning saying that they didn't get back until 2:30am. I'm not sure what time the last shuttle rolled in.Oh, and the best is now saved for last:Under our bed, there was a certain kind of toy - use your imagination. I am still cringing at the thought of seeing that there. And, upstairs, there is a nightclub, but BE WARNED - it is a swingers only club. If you don't plan on leaving with another couple, I wouldn't bother. And, you can hear the pounding bass from this club story upon story down very very late into the night (or early morning)! Good luck if you plan on staying here. I wouldn't stay there again if it was the Sterling versus a cardboard box in the worst part of town! When we wrote to them to express our disgust over the way we were treated, the condition of the place, and the game day experience, we never heard back. I've worked at hotels in the past and good ones will respond and USUALLY refund some, if not all of your money for an experience such as this. At a minimum, you would get a huge apology from the corporate headquarters. We got nothing... except perhaps a few very scarry memories!!

<Content>Still a dump! We were at the Sterling Hotel in Dallas for a Today鈥檚 Girl Youth Organization National Competition and it was not a great experience!!! To start we arrived at 7:00, the first room we were given was a wreck. We walked in and the bed linens were on the floor, there was a rack for an industrial dish washer on the bed. It looked like someone had been sleeping in both beds. We asked to move rooms. We were taken to another room. This room was also a wreck. The beds were not made; dirty towels were stacked on the toilet. There were 鈥渁spirin鈥?pills lying on the table. Food wrappers were in the floor and bugs were crawling in the sink. Across the hall we could hear a dog barking. So again we asked to be moved. This time we were move to a room that had not been renovated. It was so dirty. It smelled like urine. Your eyes burned and your nose itched. The head boards were ripped off the wall and there were holes in the walls. Once again we asked to move!!!!! We then took all of our belongings to the lobby and waited. They informed us that most of their rooms were CRAP!!! That is what the man told us. We asked for the rooms that were pictured on the internet and he said they did not have any of those available. By this time it was getting late and the children were lying in the chairs trying to sleep in the lobby. I spoke with the night manager and asked if he would feel comfortable sleeping in one of the three rooms we had already been taken to and he told us that he would not sleep in any of the rooms at this hotel. That should have been a sign!!! Finally at 10:30 we were taken to a room. This room was better. It did have linens on the bed, it did not have a barking dog across the hall, and it did not smell. We had to ask for towels and toilet paper everyday!!! We would not have stayed at this hotel if it were not for the competition! If you can stay somewhere else, do!!! Pay the extra it will be worth it.

<Content>Great for all "types" of fun My boyfriend and I met another couple at this hotel to attend a party in the club on the top floor (The Sans Souci). The staff was very professional and pleasant in dealing with us. We live in the Dallas area and were just staying here because of the upstairs club and the convenience of having a room that we could walk to at the end of the night. Although we arrived hours before the other couple (they were driving in from Austin), the staff knew that we were waiting for them and called our room as soon as they arrived. The room was a newer room and very clean. As a Dallas resident, I can tell you that there are hotels closer to Downtown. But if you need a nice place to stay and want to be out of the immediate downtown area (or close to Texas Stadium for a Dallas Cowboys' game) this is a great hotel.

<Content>5 week reservation at the sterling hotel My son needed a room for a 5 week internship inDallas this summer. We spent all day Friday visitingvarious extended stay hotels in the downtown Dallas area.Example: Budget Suites,Intown Suites, Candlewood Suites,and the Sterling Hotel.Our first stop was the Sterling, the manager on Duty gaveus a key to see a room. I can tell you, I was notimpressed. The carpet was very dirty, and there wereeven holes in it. It was a very poor room, we returnedthe key and left. ( this was quoted for 600 a month).The other two extended stay places,( Budget, and Intown )were ok, really looked nice and clean on the outside, but theinside of them smelled like smoke and urine.The Candlewood was by far the nicest, and cleanest ,but thebest price we could get was 60.oo a night, which wouldbe around 1800 a month.The other suites werearound 850 to 1000 a month. I remembered a review saying they had stayed at a renovated room inthe Sterling hotel, so we decided to go check theSterling one more time. When I asked the desk clerkif they had renovated rooms, she said of course.This time we got a key to a renovated room. The differencewas night and day. This might be the reason thereviews for the Sterling are all over the place, fromvery poor to good. The quoted price of $600.00 was forthe older rooms. We told them we wanted one of therenovated rooms. The desk clerk went and checked withthe manager on duty, and made us a deal. Our son got a renovated corner room. The room was quite a bit smallerthan the first room we saw, but it was updated. We got the 600.00 a month price. If you want thesmall fridge and microwave it was $75.00 a month more,or you can bring your own. We apprecaiated themworking with us. I'm surprised they haven't updatedall their rooms, it would help their reviews.

<Content>Good hotel My man and I spent 3 weeks at the Sterlig Hotel in June 2006, and must say we had a pleasent suprise! We had read the reviews on tripadvisor.com before we left and were a little nervous.This is our opinion on the hotel:Positive: - Most of the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. - They have a great shuffle service at half the price of a cab. - Complimentary shuffle to the Love Field Airport. - Rooms were nice and clean. - No noise or disturbances. - Nice sportsbar with big screen. - The food in the restaurant was okay (not great though).Negatie: - The bar upstairs was sleezy and plain nasty. - The hotel advertises they have Crispy Creme doughnuts for sale in the lobby, however these was only available the first three-or-so days of our stay. - The maid always forgot to give us something (one day towels, the next day toilet paper, and so on) - The food served in the sportsbar was really not good. - At several occations we saw prostitutes in the hotel. - The location is not that great. But if you have a car or don't mind having to use the shuffle service a lot, then I'm sure you'll be okay.Overall we had a good stay at the Sterling Hotel. Actually we're staying there again this year when we're travelling in to Dallas.I've heard people say that the area it's located in is dangerous and so on, however I felt very safe during our stay. Never had any problems.I would recommend this hotel to anybody that is travelling on a budget.

<Content>A Nice Place I recently had a wonderful stay at the Sterling Hotel. The staff was pleasant and helpful. The floor that I stayed on was recently remodeled, and it was like staying in a new hotel. The furnishings in the room seemed new, and the bed was the most comfortable hotel bed I've ever used. I especially enjoyed karaoke night at the hotel sports bar. For an inexpensive hotel, the Sterling in an outstanding value.

<Content>Excellent Hotel and Bar!!!! It seems like nobody has anything good to say about this place...It seems as if a lot of the guests had ONE problem in particular, and because of that they are writing these horrible reviews..I don't believe that one bad thing going wrong constitutes some of the bad things that I am reading. I actually live in the DFW Metroplex and had the opportunity to stay there for a Wedding and we had a great stay!! We had 8 rooms total and everyone who stayed there talked about how nice the service was, the employees were especially nice. For the money and the amenities...it was great!!! As far as to what part of town it's located in...you don't walk in any Metropolitan area alone in the United States at night by yourself anymore. The price was actually great for what we received. I would recommend the Sterling Hotel to anyone that's on a somewhat limited budget and wants to stay close to downtown Dallas but doesn't want to pay the $150-200+ per night. The Karaoke bar on Friday and Saturday nights were a BLAST!! A lot of good talent too!!!

<Content>Please don't I booked into the Sterling for 3 weeks as I am in Dallas for business. The booking was made through the company I work for as they get corporate discounts. However, the discount cannot be worth what I have had to put up with. Let's see:- To get hot water I was told to let the water run for about 10 mins. I wish I knew this before I had to have a cold shower.- The hotel room phone was broken and did not ring so I could not tell when people were calling me. Reception thought it would be a good idea for me to take calls from the lobby instead of my room. I thought that was a bad idea.- I could hear howling noises all night through the window which I assumed would blow in on me.- If the howling noises aren't enough to keep you awake all night, the noise from the heating will.- If the wind and the heating aren't enough to keep you awake, being able to hear everything from adjoining room will.- The wireless internet signal was not strong enough from my room so I could not get online.- Ther were no staff to help me take my bags to the room or even opoen the front door for me in the lobby when I first arrived.Needless to say, I have tried to move hotels but apparantly everything in Dallas is booked out. However, I am moving into the Westin in a couple of days. Can't wait to get out of the Sterling and into a real hotel.

<Content>don't stay here Don't stay here. First of all they advertise coffee and doughnts for sale in the morning, they were never open, the ATM didn't work, they advertise an arcade room, well they had the room, just no arcades. The shuttle service to be used to transport you to and from the game, were never there when they were suppose to be to buy tickets from them, then worst of all, they dropped you off at the game, but never came to pick any of us up from the game to return us to the hotel, two other busses had to take all of us back. I won't recommend this hotel and we will never stay there again.

<Content>Worst experience ever!!!!! Go to Motel 6! OK, the thought is good. A night鈥檚 stay, free shuttle transportation to and from the Cowboy game, and free breakfast the next morning. The idea is good, but the reality is HORRIBLE!!!! First off, when we arrived it looked nice for the mere $100.00 that we were paying. Check in was very slow, and our rooms were not nice at all. It was a very basic Motel 6 room, and I would not even dare my worst enemy to get into the shower. GROSS! But, we start with a few drinks down at the Sports Bar (which was the best part of the whole trip)! So we鈥檙e watching another game on the big screen, having a few drinks, and my husband orders some food. We are planning to take the 6:00 shuttle over to the game. Well, at 5:00 (just after my husband ordered his food) the shuttle organizer comes to the bar and tells us that we need to get on the shuttle now. I told them that we were waiting on food and that we were planning to take the 6:00 shuttle. She said that we were the only ones scheduled for the 6:00 shuttle so the bus was not going to come pick up just the two of us. Soooo鈥︹€he bartender goes and rushing my husband鈥檚 food into a to-go box, then we鈥檙e boarded on a tiny overcrowded shuttle with standing room only! Needless to say, my husband couldn鈥檛 eat standing up! So, we鈥檙e taking it all in stride. We arrive at the game and we wait outside the game so that my husband can eat his $8.00 hamburger. The game was fun, had a few drinks, and when it was over we headed out to gate 8 for the shuttle to pick us up. This was around 10:30! Marriott shuttles kept coming and going for an hour with no Sterling Shuttle in sight. By this time an angry and tired MOB of people have formed waiting for the Sterling Shuttle. My husband calls the hotel to ask what the issue is, and they tell him there is a shuttle there and to go find it. Obviously there wasn鈥檛 a shuttle there so about 45 minutes later he calls the hotel back and the guy screams at him and hangs up! Finally I push our way through the crowd, board a bus that wasn鈥檛 ours and begged for that driver to take us to our hotel! HE DID! Wonderful man! And guess what time we arrived鈥︹€?12:30AM!!!! 2 hours after the game was over! We could see the stadium from our hotel so it鈥檚 not like it鈥檚 a lonnnnnggg drive! When we arrive at the hotel there is a HUGE mob of angry people trying to go up the elevator to their rooms. There鈥檚 only one working and it鈥檚 barely working. So, after another 20 minutes we get up to the room! The next morning we鈥檙e still optimistic and are geared up for the free breakfast. When we arrive downstairs, we find out that breakfast was only served from 7-9! Ok guys, lets get realistic. A late night at the Cowboy game where you鈥檝e been drinking, how many can get up, get showered, and be ready for breakfast by 9:00??? WHAT A JOKE! So, for our $100.00 that included the room, shuttle and breakfast, we only received the room! I would definitely recommend the Marriott (because they seem to have it together) or stay at a different hotel and call a cab! It will be less hassle!!! We will never go back to the Sterling EVER EVER EVER!!!!!! My husband jokes that we may buy it next year because with service like this, it鈥檚 sure to go under QUICK! Save yourself the headache!

<Content>Do not even consider.... This place makes Motel 6 look luxurious. My wife and I had made last minute reservations, so that we could be in Dallas for 2 days on buisiness. We tried to make reservations at more dependable hotels, but they were full for that week. We accepted what we could get. BAD MISTAKE!. We would have been better off sleeping in the car, under a bridge! When we arrived the first thing noticed was the stale, dank air in the hallways leading to the room. Later, when we were dressing to go back out for dinner, we found that housekeeping had given out only 1 wash cloth and two towels for 2 people. Then, when preparing to go to go to bed, pulling back the sheets we found human hair in the bed. The next day, again when housekeeping cleaned the room, and now knowing better, they left only 1 wash cloth. Three request and 3 hours later, we recieved 1 additional wash cloth. That evening as we were preparing to go out to dinner, we noticed loud music and hollering coming from outside of the hotel at the pool. It was obvious that a party was preparing to start. That was at 6:00 pm. Later when we returned, it was obvious the party was in full tilt. The music was so loud the room was vibrating. To try to drown out the niose we put the room A/C on high and turned up the TV. At 10:00 PM we placed a call to the front desk. They told us that we were not the only ones complaing. but the party would go on for a while. The person said that the manager would go out and tell them to start to wrap it up. It did not happen. At 10:30 and 11:00 two more calls were placed. They finally got tired of accepting calls and would only put us through to voice mail. We ended up calling the Dallas Police Department, to see if we could get them to stop the loud noise. I finally was able to confront management, where he took the attitude, and stated that the partiers would be allowed to continue and that the room guest would have to toloerate the loud noise. We immediately packed our bags and left. We are now trying to get our money back for the last nights stay. DO NOT STAY AT THIS PLACE!

<Content>Trip from The Twilight Zone My friend and I stayed at The Sterling Hotel in Dallas for her birthday in March 2004. The hotel was not even close to full yet the room we were assigned was on the one floor that rennovations were being done. Because of this loud hammering woke us up by dawn in the morning. We were also awoken several times in the early morning by phone calls asking for someone who we did not know. As well as a key being issued to a person not listed on the registration who tried to enter the room while we were sleeping. The lights in between the beds did not work, and the air conditioning went out...then suddenly the lights mysteriously come on. Which calling a maintenance man to repair the air conditioning ruined the $10.00 movie we paid for. And as if this couldn't get any more unusual we went to the top floor which has a night club and bar to have a few birthday drinks...little did we know what world we were entering. After a little while we were informed that what we thought was an average hotel lounge was frequented by couples seeking other couples. This could make for an extremely uncomfortable situation for the common traveler. All in all it was a totally mind warping experience out of The Twilight Zone.

<Content>Your Car is Better Than This Dump My brother, a friend, and I stayed here for 3 nights when we went to a football game in Dallas this weekend. I'm an easy going guy and not much bothers me. This place bothered me.1. My room did not have internet access nor a refrigerator as I specifically requested and paid for. 2. The renovated room had a view of a garage. 3. There were only 2 beds for 3 guys and the hotel did not provide a cot. 4. The water was lukewarm at best. 5. The fitness center was locked until Monday as the GM had taken the key home with him. 6. On Monday, when we got access to the fitness center not a single piece of equipment worked. 7. One elevator did not stop at the 5th floor which is where we stayed. 8. The other elevators worked when they felt like it. 9. The walls are paper thin.10. The Sports Bar closes at 10:00.11. The picture on the tv was actually fuzzy. This actually fascinated me as I'd never seen a fuzzy cable picture. 12. When I checked out the clerk didn't even ask how we enjoyed our stay. I guess he knew.DO NOT STAY HERE !!!!!!!!!

<Content>The honeymoon suite is great!! On March 5, 2004 we stayed in the Honeymoon Suite for our 10th Wedding Anniversary. It was great. The room service was wounderful. The food was not all that great but the HOT TUB in the room was worth it all!!!!I recommend the HONEYMOON SUITE to couples that just want to get away from the kids and spend quality time with your spouse.The room and hot tub says it all! Make a Reservation today and find out for yourself. Surprise your loved one today!!

<Content>Decent, but a little frayed around the edges This hotel is an old Ramada. They have replaced the carpet/drapes/bed/chairs recently so the furnishings aren't dated. Some of the furnishings look like they've been refinished but not replaced. The mirrors in the bathroom were losing their reflective surface around the edges. The refurb job brings this hotel up to two star standards - do not mistake this for a luxury hotel, but it's not a dump either. If you can get in here around $59-69/night you'll get your money's worth. Check-in is fairly easy and the lobby is well kept. The rooms could use some brighter lights, especially the bathroom. The marquee out front says high speed internet access, but I didn't find anything in the room, but you can get 52.4 on a dialup - not bad for a hotel.

<Content>I would NOT recommend!! I was in Dallas on business and stayed at The Sterling Hotel. Some problems that I encountered were: no hot water in the shower area the last 2 days of my stay (i was there for only 3 days). There was hot water in the sink but not in the shower. When I reported the problem, a man came up and played around with things in the bathroom but the problem was never resolved. His solution was to run the hot water in the sink and maybe the hot water would eventually work in the shower. Result: no hot water in the sink OR shower. There wasn't one garbage can in the entire room including the bathroom. When someone finally brought the garbage can, it had no bag in it and the can was stained with all types of disgusting colors. It took 3 hours for someone to bring extra towels and washclothes. I had to call twice. Lastly, in the elevator, in order to get to your floor you have to continuously hold your floor number until you get to your floor or the elevator won't operate. It was a pretty scary experience. Please don't put yourself through that torture.

<Content>We were surprised when we walked in....!! We recently went to Dallas to see a Cowboys Home Game. The Hotel we were supposed to stay at, sold too many rooms. We drove around to look for another hotel near the Stadium. We found the Sterling Hotel Dallas, and from the outside, we weren't very sure. When we walked in, we were surprised, to find a Full Service Hotel. The Rooms were nice and made you feel like home, and the staff treated us very nicely. We ended up staying 3 nights, and having a great time. We have stayed at hotels, that were brand new, where the service was not as good. The pool area looks great, and that Lobby Coffee Bar, came in handy. We hope to make 3 Home Games next year, and will make the Sterling Hotel, our Cowboys Home away from home.

<Content>Sterling Hotel Dallas, Best Value, Great Service I stayed at the Sterling Hotel Dallas during Texas/OU Weekend. The Hotel was sold out during this time, as there was also a Dallas Cowboys home game the next day. The Hotel is located next to Texas Stadium. What I witnessed was a staff that did their best to accomodate all their guests. This is the second year in a row that I have stayed at this Hotel, and they have clearly made improvements from the previous year. Rooms were clean, staff was friendly, food in the restaurant was good. Even though this is an older hotel, the renovations made, put this hotel a cut above some of the others in the city. If you are looking for a Full Service, Best Value Hotel, the Sterling Hotel Dallas, is the place to be. I will stay there this year, and I will also recommend it to my friends.

<Content>Worst hotel stay I've ever had My friend and I stayed at The Sterling Hotel Dallas Oct. 10-12, 2003 and it was the worst hotel stay we've ever had. Once you stepped off the elevator (4th floor) the carpet did not look like it had been vaccumed. Our room smelled like dog and the carpet had a damp feel to it. This was before and after the room had been cleaned. You could clearly see that the bedspread had not been washed (stained). The maid only left 1 washcloth and said she couldn't leave any more than that. After 4 unsuccessful calls my friend finally went to the front desk and got some. Upon check out we were told that they had run out of clean washcloths. No compensation or restitution was offered. Not even an apology.

<Content>Sterling Hotel We stayed at Sterling Hotel the night of 6-20-03. We had made a prior reservation 5 days before-hand, and confirmed the day before that we had paid for and would stay in an Upgraded 1 King room. It took us approximately an hour to FINALLY get the room we had originally reserved and pre-paid for...when we should've originally had it when we walked through the door. What we did get at first was a Standard (non-upgraded) 1 Double (small/handicap) room. By this time, it was a Friday night, we had traveled half the day, hungry, tired, and late for a party. We felt rushed, and it made both of us in a frustrated mood until the party (and even after, when thinking about it). When we called for more towels and shampoo, I had to call back 2-3 times and nearly an hour to finally bring us more towels, because we had to take a shower/bath before our party that we were then late for! And when I called, the lady sounded bland and bothered. The towels finally came, but no shampoo (which came later).Ontop of all of this, NO ONE offered us any sort of compensation or restitution for the mix-up or long wait!!
