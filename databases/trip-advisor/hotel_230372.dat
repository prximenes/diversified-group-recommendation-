<Content>wouldn't come back We had one night in Frankfurt and chose this hotel because it was convenient to the train station, and we had a flight out the next morning. Our first problem was finding the hotel, because we when exited the train station out the center door of the train station and looked up and down the street, we must have seen a dozen hotels, but no Savoy. I thought I had read on someone's Trip Advisor post that we should turn left when we exited the station (but that turned out to be the wrong direction.) We tried asking for help in the train station, but no one had heard of the Savoy or could even tell us where the street was located. Since turning left hadn't produced the hotel, we turned around and walked in the other direction, and did finally find the street and the hotel, which is located on a sidestreet and not visible from the front of the train station. We should have gotten off the train, turned right and exited the train station at that end, in which case the hotel would have been visible on our left.Our double room was fine, but our triple room was unpleasant- something stained the walls and the third bed (a couch) had not been made up. We were told that would be done but when we returned from dinner, there were still no blankets or pillow for the couch when we returned hours later, so we were given a single room at no additional charge, which was fair.This might be fine for a traveller who needs close proximity to the train station, but we found nothing redeeming about it otherwise. Certainly wouldn't want to walk around the streets at night.

<Content>Great location, hotel could have been better We stayed in the Savoy in June. The hotel is in a great location, 2 minutes walk from the train station and an easy stroll to all the sites. The reception looked nice and the staff were good. However, we were disappointed with our room, firstly the interior was quite shabby and the shower leaked all over the bathroom. We had to move rooms on the second day as the tap broke off the bathroom tap and could not be fixed, our new room was slightly better but still not what I would call a 4 star hotel, still it wasn't bad for the money we paid so if you can get the hotel for a cheap price it is fine, but don't pay a lot.

<Content>Disappointed We stayed in the hotel 2 nights. We were disappointed with our room and the view. We had a triple room and my son slept on the sofa bed. Most other hotels we stayed in where a triple was booked had three beds in them. I rather think it was a double with a sofa thrown in there. There was barely room to walk around the room. The lift is also very very small. We booked this hotel because of it's location being across the road from the railway station and the price was reasonable. As we were traveling by train both mornings this was convenient for us. The full breakfast was very good and the receptionists were very helpful. We were able to get around the city easily from here but probably look at staying elsewhere if I went back to Frankfurt.

<Content>Great Value, Location The Savoy is located virtually across the road from the Main Train Station. It takes 3 minutes to walk to the entrance of the station. It is across the road from a Tour Operator ETS. So getting city tours is a breeze. It is very convenient to walk to the The shopping areas. It is also very close to the Red Light district, so there are some sleazy looking people on the street around the corner from the hotel. The Hotel Room wwas very cleean and comfortable. I had them include Airconditioning at Euro 5 extra per day. Well worth it. The Breakfast at Euro 15 per day was adaquate. More than enough and I had them make me a Cheese and Mushroom omelete each day. So all in all I would stay there again. The Staff were very helpful and the Bar is open in the evening.

<Content>Excellent Hotel I've stayed at the Savoy a couple times when I have flights in/out of Frankfurt airport and have never had a problem. The location is excellent - right across from the main train station in Frankfurt and within walking distance of the downtown area, historical and pedestrian zone.The rooms are clean, the beds comfortable, and the front desk staff are friendly. What's also nice are the shutters on the outside of the windows to completely keep out the light in the room, though having a room with a window facing the front of the hotel you're bound to hear a bit of street noise and trains.Breakfast is typical European - meats, cheeses, breads, yogurt and fruit and there is also a small bar to have a drink in, though there are plenty of other nice spots in the area to grab a drink. I can't say anything negative about this place, and will continue to book here anytime I'm in Frankfurt.

<Content>Not a fan since there is only limited A/C The location cannot be beat for convenience but that is about the only thing is high priced hot box has going for it. The on-line site made no mention of the hotel only having A/C on a couple of floors. As such, it was a very hot night in Frankfurt. The location is great with easy access to the train station via underground tunnel. Good cheap eats and shopping in the underground area at the train station. The hotel bar is very over priced even on beer which is usually cheap everywhere in Germany. The staff was not very friendly or helpful. They did not want to honor a non-smoking room request without more money.

<Content>Fair choice if you get a decent rate I'm only giving this hotel a 3 rating because of the price paid. I left it for the last minute and there must have been some sort of exhibition going on in Frankfurt and most hotels were fully booked, and the ones that were not, were asking for extortionate prices. I chose the Savoy because of the proximity to the station. Unlike most station hotels, I didn't find the area to be particularly rough, I went out for dinner in the evening (young female alone) and didn't feel unsafe. I must also mention there are not many restaurants near the hotel. The room itself was pretty average, I Paid 275 euros for it but I think it was worth about 120 maximum. The breakfast selection was very good, the only problem is that all the tables were taken and their staff didn't seem very keen to help me so I ended up leaving my plate in there and having breakfast at the station.I would only recommend this hotel if you can get it for less than 150 euro any more and I'd go somewhere else.

<Content>The Savoy certainly won us. We travelled through Europe by Eurail and we originally chose the Savoy because it was close to the Deutchebarn (main railway station). We had read reviews to say the breakfast was excellent but after staying in 3, 4 and 5 star hotels throughout Europe and the Middle East over a period of 3 months we have to say the best breakfast we experienced was definitely at the Savoy.What an absolute delight! Big congratulations to the Savoy.There is no question we will definitely be staying at the Savoy whenever we travel to Frankfurt.

<Content>Lovely hotel That's an amazing hotel. The outside is just terrible, it looks very ugly, but the inside is amazing: a huge and clean hall, with staff speaking a perfect English. Rooms are not that big, but the bed is very large and confortable. At the top floor there's a swimming pool, a beautiful steam bath and a lovely sauna (I would have loved to spend all my stay at the hotel). Breakfast is incredible, there's a vast selection of food (German and British breakfast) and it tastes really good. Price is absolutely cheap for what it offers, but make sure you do not book it in a trade fair period, as prices rise incredibly (+ 150%).I did not pay for it personally as I was there with a customer of mine, so he paid for it, but I'd recommend it (very easy access to the main train station and to the bus stop for ryanair buses).

<Content>Not bad We booked into this hotel for a night whilst attending a trade fair. It is right beside the main train station and only about 10 - 15 minutes by taxi from the airport, so very convenient.The hotel itself is nicely decorated with a relaxing reception area and a comfortable bar. There are three lifts servicing the multi-floored building. We had booked into a superior room. By paying a little extra we got a room comparable to a standard 3 star hotel in Ireland. So I'm guessing a standard room is pretty basic.Overall the hotel is more than acceptable and I would stay again.

<Content>Excellent value for money! My husband and I had just come back from the Hotel Savoy Frankfurt (October 2007) and have to say we were pleasantly impressed. The hotel is located just opposite the Frankfurt Mainz central station the 鈥淗auptbahnhof鈥?which is very convenient. The hotel reception is friendly and speaks good english except for their porter - a bit stern looking. We were given a room located on the first floor, clean but built next to the lift shaft and was very noisy when the lift was in operation. The room itself was not accommodating for a twin bedded room as the two beds were in an L shaped room, so one of the beds was unable to see the other person or the TV etc. (which is fine with us). Shower and toilet facilities were fine. The only down side is there is no tea making facilities in the rooms (ie kettle, etc)The breakfast buffet is really good with lots of choice to choose from 鈥?cooked breakfast like scrambled and fried eggs, bacon, sausage, meats, a big selection of cereals, breads, rolls, cheese, yogurts, chocolate croissants, toast, fresh fruits, and more. The waitress was attentive and always quick to offer a refill of our coffee or tea. There is a basket full with fruits and free pastries in the reception lobby throughout the day. They also served us free drink at the bar as we were waiting for our room to be ready before they could check us in.Overall we found this hotel excellent value for money. Would stay again but would demand a different room location definitely. Would score it a 7/10. Highly recommended!

<Content>Ok and has a pool The hotel is located just opposite the central station which is very handy but not very scenic and there is a some background noise. We didn't find any good restaurants/bars nearby and you are near a number of seedy sex shops. The hotel is reasonable though for the price we paid. The rooms are a good size and comfortable. The breakfast buffet is really good with lots of choice and there is fruit and cake in the reception throughout the day. The reception staff were really helpful and were able to answer all our questions. There is a small swimming pool, sauna and steam room at the top of the hotel which overlooks the bright lights of the Frankfurt skyline - perfect if it's raining outside.

<Content>The best value of my entire trip! I'm generally not picky when it comes to hotels - so long as it's clean and safe, I'm usually happy. The Savoy, however, made me reconsider my standards!My final night in Germany I left completely unplanned. I arrived in Frankfurt and dropped in to the Savoy based on a short review in a travel book. I stayed in a single room for 50EUR which was the LEAST I paid for a room during my entire stay, and the Savoy was far and away better than any of them.The room, though small (who cares) was fantastic. Large bed, very modern bathroom, safe, fridge - and exceptionally clean. It felt like I was the first person to stay there! The front desk staff spoke perfect english and was very polite.The hotel has wireless internet - but for a slightly expensive additional fee. It was fast, though.The included breakfast was amazing - even if the room had been abysmal, the breakfast would've made up for it! I wished I had left myself more time to enjoy it before I needed to get to the airport.

<Content>Great Hotel! Great hotel would go back again just for the breakfast! When we went the hotel was classed as 4 stars some advertise it as 3 stars. The main reception it outstanding and decor is well worthy of 4 stars. Same with the breakfast room. Although the rooms were very lacking in 4 stars department, the decorwas very old, the fridge was falling to bits and in general it neededupgraded (except the bathroom which had been upgraded) to make it near a 4 star room. Overall we found this hotel excellent value for money. The breakfast room has everything you would want for breakfast from basic toast to full fry up and you get to go back as many times as you want! Staff are very friendly and always there to help. The hotel is directly outside the main train station and only a shortwalk into town.

<Content>Dishonest hotel There are much better hotels for better deals out there. Don't stay here.Biggest problems: hidden charges, combined with a very rude front desk. You think you get a good deal, but then you find that they will charge you for things which they never disclosed upfront. And no air conditioning.For example, I know some hotels charge for local calls, many don't, so before placing a call, I went through the which their in-room hotel information which tells you all about how to dial an outside line and place calls, and it does not list any charges or fees for such calls. I was shocked upon checkout, when I found a huge bill for the local phone calls I made. I wouldn't have dialed them had I known they would charge me such ghastly amounts! When I asked for an explanation, or to see the hotel fees in writing, the rude retort I recieved was We are in Germany, Not America. We don't have to disclose our fees. Now pay or I will call the police.Anyhow, it felt very underhanded, luring people into services and then charging them fees that were undisclosed beforehand, and then their attitude about about what they did was OK. They brag about being 4 star, but are far from it. NO AIRCONDITIONING. I had to choose between stifing heat or opening my windows for everyone to peer in and for mosquitos to fly in and have a feast. The rooms are small and cramped, the showers don't even have a full shower curtain- the bathroom was soaked after my shower.

<Content>No air conditioning and noisy We arrived at the hotel and were allocated a room which was above the busy roads (and tram track) after requesting a quiet room. Thinking they had misunderstood our requirements we requested another room - unfortunately we got the same just on a different floor. The room had no air conditioning and was like a sauna. If the window was opened the noise was excessive. I eventually resorted to sleeping on the tiled bathroom floor to cool down. Not a place to stay if you want a quiet or cool room.

<Content>The Savoy recommanded ! I stayed in the Savoy from April 28 until 30 for two nights in a single comfort room. Found everything to be of a very good standard : room was rather small, but the bed was big and comfortable and everything was new, clean and working properly. The airconditining was perfect even with the very high temperatures outside. My room (720) was quiet even though it was opposite the elevators. Breakfast was extremely good. Overall a good 4 star hotel.I booked directly over the hotel website and only paid EUR 49,00 per night (bf included).

<Content>Christmas Markets at Frankfurt - Savoy My boyfriend and I had arranged a 5 day break to see the Christmas (2006) markets in Frankurt. Having booked the flights we got onto searching the internet for hotels in Frankfurt. Our first searches brought back quite pricey hotels until we found the Savoy hotel. With the hotel booked I later carried out further searches into the hotel - I was devastated at the hotel reviews for the Savoy. So I decided to go with an open mind.When we arrived - we were surprised how nice the reception area was. The reception staff spoke very good English. We got a 5th floor room which must have been recently renovated. The doors were still old, but I couldn't believe that the bathroom was brand new. There was no sign of a really old, cracked sink  a bath that was too deep (which was explained in other reviews). I admit that the hotel was not worth 4 stars - but it was pleasantly good, clean and very central to the city and right beside the train station. The breakfast was great, plenty to choose from - cooked breakfast, fruit, yogurts, cereal and toast.On the top floor there was a small pool which had a great view especially at night time when the city lights were lit. There was a steam room, sauna and gym equipment.We had a great time at the Christmas markets and sight seeing. The bus tour booking office was right opposite the hotel which was really handy as we were first time visitors at the City. So please don't be put off by the bad reviews - we certainly had a pleasant stay at the Savoy.

<Content>please take away a few stars! I arrived at the Savoy hotel with an open mind. After reading the reviews on this website I wasn't quite sure what to expect. It is very central there is no doubt about that. Check in was average and the reception area is nice. Corridors to the bedrooms are in need of a lick of paint and the carpet is quiet worn. Bedrooms are v small the handle was missing off the wardrobe. The door into the bathroom is a sliding one which looks v strange, kind of reminded me of a mobile home/caravan! The Sink and Bath are v worn and yellow looking, bath is quite high so you do have to almost jump up into it...would hate to see what an elderly person would have to do in this situation! Once I got into the bath I was literally too tall for the shower which is not securley attached so therefore water sprays everywhere unless you hold it with your hand.. After recovering from the bathroom experience my partner discovered that the bed was actually two single ones pushed together with the oddest lightest looking mattresses I have ever seen. With much annoyance I made my way to reception and enquired if there was a possibility of changing rooms. I was met with a cool forced smile that told me  All the rooms are the same . that night the traffic was horrific and the room was so hot that a window had to be left open.. The worst though was the visible springs that were nearly up through the material of the so called mattress. I had the worst nights sleep so on my way to breakfast I made my way to reception and asked for the manager on duty who I have to say was v nice and efficient. After hearing my story he informed me that there was no problem in changing us to a newly renovated room on the 7th floor and explained that they were going through major renovations at the moment. It was a pity that the girl that checked us in didn't inform us of this!The new room was much more pleasant, new and modern. If we had gotten this room the first night we would have really enjoyed our stay as the breakfast room was excellent and had a nice enviroment.I work in a 4 star hotel myself and I really feel that the hotel savoy is nowhere near the required standards here in Ireland. So if you are going to stay there don't go with very high expectations and if your not too fussy and just going for a bit if shopping then stay here but by all means ask for a room on the 7th floor!

<Content>The worst hotel I have ever stayed in Myself and my family went to Frankfurt last year for the Christmas Markets. We thought we'd found a bargain at getting some cheap rooms in this hotel....we should have thought again. I'll admit upon entry to the hotel I was impressed by the marble floors and the christmas tree in the reception area. It actually looked somewhat nice. We happily got the key to our rooms and got into the elevator to go up to our floor. This is where the nightmare began....As the door of the lift opened I stared out in confusion. The hallway had a musky smell, stains on the walls and I practically had to sidestep my way to the room as it was so narrow. When I got to the room I was disgusted. There was blood on the sheets of the bed, a bottle of complimentary water (of which someone had already drank a glass) and the toilet was missing the seat, not to mention a disgusting amount of hairs in the sink. The door to the room would not lock properly and there was some sort of arguement going on down the hall.It was 1am and as we were so tired we reluctantly pulled the sheets off the bed and slept on towels which we had placed over the dirty mattress. When I say slept I mean that I closed my eyes for a few minutes at a time as I could not allow myself to sleep in a place as filthy as this..Needless to say we booked out the next day (we were due for 2 days) and after a screaming match with the manager, got a refund on the night we had stayed.If you want to remember your stay in Frankfurt as a nice one, then please avoid this hotel like the plague. The staff are ignorant and rude, the rooms are absolute filth and you may as well be throwing your money down the drain. I do not see how this hotel could even call itself a 1/2 star let alone a 4 star.

<Content>The breakfast of champions! OK, I'm gonna skip the room review for a sec and go straight to the breakfast - it was awesome! After spending the first week of our trip eating cornflakes and yogurt for breakfast every morning, this was a welcome change. The breakfast buffet, which was included in our price, offered scrambled and fried eggs, bacon, sausage, regular and chocolate croissants, fresh fruits, cereals, rolls, meats and cheeses, yogurt, and more. The wait staff was very attentive and always quick to offer a refill of our coffee, tea or juice. Our room also did not disappoint. We had a triple room (three twin-sized beds). The room was large by European standards, and offered amenities such as air-conditioning, a minifridge, and a TV. The bathroom was a bit small - you had to step up to get into the tub and there wasn't much head room once you were in there! The hotel's location was excellent - just across the street from Frankfurt's main train station (you could cut through the plaza under the street if you preferred), and about a 15 minute walk to the river front. There were also scores of restaurants, bars and shops in the surrounding area.

<Content>great hotel but not a 4* Have just come back from the Hotel Savoy and have to say I was very pleasently surprised. Some of the reviews I had read led me to believe I was going to a hovel but I found the hotel to be quite charming although the 4 star rating is a bit of an exaggeration - 3 star would be more accurate.Location wise you can't ask for better. The hotel is right across the road from central station and is within walking distance to a huge choice of bars and restuarants. We travelled with a child so had a triple room which was a fairly good size. The rooms were a bit run down though - the carpet was worn in places and the walls could do with a lick of paint. The bathroom was perfect - the bath was really deep though so watch it with young kids.  I only had breakfast in the hotel so can't vouch for dinner but the breakfast was amazing. Such a hugh choice of foods to suit every palate - even my fussy 8 year old was happy!The staff were excellent, really helpful and great for information. All in all for the price I paid I was really happy but if you are looking for 4* luxury - forget it!

<Content>Great hotel I can't understand some of these reviews. I thought the Savoy was fantastic. I got a great rate 66 euro/night by emailing the hotel directly. Lovely little lounge. Breakfast was delicious with the first hot and cold food we had seen for breakfast since we arrived 10 days earlier to the region. Free pasties in the lobby and free drink at the bar. Within walking distance of the Museums on the Main and to Romerburg if you have stamina. All staff were pleasant and helpful. I'd definitely stay here again. Could have used another pillow on the bed though.

<Content>Run Down 3 rd Rate Hotel The Frankfurt Savoy Hotel located downtown 2 blocks away from the main train station 7 or 8 years ago used to be a good hotel [ 4 star ] under different management. I stayed there a couple of times in the past. I picked that hotel because it is close to the train station where the next day I could take the train out to the airport when it is time to return to the U.S.A.  June 28, 2005 I checked in late afternoon and rented 2 rooms for the night. I believe they were on the 3 rd floor, we dropped off our baggage and then went out for a walk and dinner. Returned about 11 P.M. and went to bed. I renember it was very hard and uncomfortable, the next morning I looked at both single beds in the room and found that there were NO MATTRESSES on either bed, only the box spring. The white sink in the bathroom was scratched so badly that the bowl was scratched down to the brown underbase. When we checked out, I asked my cousin to see her room, again neither bed had a mattress and her sink was also scratched totally down to the brown base.  And yet they have 4 stars on their stationary, you would think they would be ashamed I mentioned it at checkout time at the desk, the manager was not there and the employees could have cared less. The rooms were $ 150.00 each. I wrote them, E-Mailed them and faxed them after I returned to the U.S.A. thinking that they might deduct 30 or 40 % from the bill. they never even responded. Visa said that they could do nothing about it. Even the Salvation Army [ Heils Armee ] I am sure has mattresses on their beds.  The Frankfurt Savoy Hotel does not even qualify for a 1 Star Hotel .

<Content>Nice hotel The hotel was fine, not as bad as expected after reading the reviews. It is directly opposite the train station and about 15 mins from the airport by taxi which cost 20 euros each way. The lobby bar is nice as is the restaurant with breakfast. The breakfast was great, there was a very big selection of cereals, breads,  hot items.The rooms were a reasonable size  the bathroom was clean but could perhaps do with a new sink as it was very scratched.Around the hotel is not really any bars, there are a number of kebab shops, a chinese restaurant  several a few adult shops, well it is in the redlight area but we didn't feel unsafe. We went to the Irish bar which was good. We went for the christmas market  it was about a 15 minute walk from the hotel - highly recommed it!Overall the hotel is perhaps more of a 3* but was fine for us.
