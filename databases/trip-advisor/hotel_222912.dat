<Content>Ok - nice place hotel is in a very nice and convenient place near Latin area (where you can find plenty of restaurants). 5 min walk from notre dame.the breakfast is ok but I would have liked to have more choices, e.g more type of croissants, biscuits, cakes (none...) (breakfast costs 11 euro extra).the room is not very big but comfortable. overall a good choiche if you spend few days in Paris.

<Content>Great location Stayed here for 3 nights late December. Very easy to get to, 8 min walk from the RER (train) station. Hotel staff were very nice and happy to speak English.Room was smaller than I expected but I think thats the case in Paris! All very clean, nice bathroom also.Lots of restaurants in the area, walking distance to Notre Dame etc.I would stay here again.CheersAndy

<Content>A great find We very much enjoyed our stay here. The staff were friendly and helpful, room was very clean and the hotel is in a great location. We particularly enjoyed the abundance of restaurants and bars in the locality and the fact that everything was within walking distance. We would definitely go back again.

<Content>Great location and staff, not so great rooms I stayed at room 307 for four nights early December. It was a twin with a view of the lovely church! The location can't be beat. It's 10 minutes to Notre Dame, 5 minutes to the Pantheon and about 25 min. walk to the Louvre. I really loved the Charcuterie St. Germaine and the Fromager right as you come out of the Maubert metro station. Eric Kayser boulanger was awesome for breakfast and treats for afternoon snack. The front desk staff members were always friendly, polite and professional. I really love everything about this place except for the beds. The twin beds were smallest I've ever seen. The width of the bed was the same width as my pillow. If I was any taller, I think my feet would be hanging out. I didn't have any issues with the bathroom, the heater or any other facilities. Unless you sleep like you're in a coffin, avoid booking the twin. We booked a shuttle for 17 Euro each to go to CDG. It took about 45 minutes to get there, but we also picked up several passengers along the way.

<Content>Charming little neighbourhood We really enjoyed staying at this hotel, which is situated in a lovely part of the Latin Quarter. Only a short walk from the Notre Dame, this area is full of lovely bakeries, creperies and little boutiques. We ate breakfast at the Eric Kayser bakery each morning. The staff at the hotel were lovely. They allowed us to check in two hours early so that we could sleep after our long flight from NYC. The room was small but had modern fittings throughout. We were situated on the 1st floor overlooking the courtyard - great because we could walk the stairs to our room but not so great for the noise we could hear from upstairs rooms (like when someone had a bath at 2:30am!). We got a good deal on this hotel by booking directly through the hotel website. Would definitely stay again!

<Content>Absolutely Sensational I stumbled across this hotel due to some really great reviews - and this hotel really delivered. The staff were really friendly and helpful. I arrived early in the morning from an international flight, and they managed to have my room ready by 10am (WITHOUT me even requesting an early check-in - they just did it!!!). Good variety of food for breakfast (quite unusual for Paris!!)... Great location - so close to Notre Dame - close to the Metro, and all great cafes along Blvd St Germain. Would defiantely recommend this hotel to anyone and stay here again on future visits!

<Content>Nice and central stay at Agora St. Germain We have been in Paris several times and stays normally in cheap or middle class hotels. If you only want to have a good sleep and don't need to stay in the room for long period, you must choose this hotel.The location is central in the latin quarter few minutes walk from Notre Dame.The room was clean, unfortunately carpets on the floor but nice anyway. Good service, pleasant employees.

<Content>Great location  The Agora is a great little hotel. It is very central but on a quiet street. I got exactly what I expected and a more. It is newly decorated with a more modern d茅cor than some other Paris 3 star hotels. The staff was super friendly and helpful. The beds were comfortable. For a Paris 3 star hotel I really can鈥檛 fault it. Notre Dam is a stroll away; the Metro is nearby as are some good restaurants and shops.

<Content>Great Location, Very Helpful Staff This was our third time to Paris and the Agora Saint Germain was a wonderful choice in the Latin Quarter. Kayer bakery is just around the corner as is Victor Cafe for great beef bourgione. The location is just off St. Germain within easy walking distance to the Notre Dame cathedral. On the weekend there is a wonderful open air market within two blocks. Very easy metro stop as well.The staff was most helpful with restaurant reservations, Moulin Rouge reservations and a shuttle to the airport on the day of our departure.There is a cathedral one block away and the bells do chime on the hour. This can be a little bothersome, but not a real problem.The elevator is small but very wonderful as some Paris hotels do not have elevators.I reviewed this hotel before booking and the reviews were all very right on and most helpful. I would definately recommend this hotel.

<Content>Quiet and well positioned A well positioned hotel near to the Maubert Metro stop and only a short distance from the centre of town. Like many hotels in Paris the rooms are on the small side but perfectly adequate. The whole hotel was scrupulously clean and the beds very comfortable. An excellent night's sleep could be had since the hotel is located on a very quiet side-street. Breakfast at 11 euros was a good buy with plenty of drinks available and an adequate range of cold items, although you could have items cooked for an additional cost. We stayed for four nights and have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anybody.

<Content>Beware Non-Smokers! My wife and I stayed at the Agora for 2 nights over her birthday.Location and staff we could not fault. We had 2 great meals within 5 minutes walking distance from the front door and there is also a lovely wine shop just around the corner next to the Metro.The rooms were adequately sized and nicely decorated, our issue was with the fact that none of them were classed as non-smoking despite that being an option on the website we booked through.As a result we had to stay our first night in a room which STANK of stale cigarette smoke as there were no other available rooms. The chap on reception very kindly moved us on the 2nd night and we had a much nicer smelling room but you could still tell it had been smoked in.Why some of the rooms are not just designated as smoking rooms I don't know like every other hotel. PEOPLE WHO DO NOT SMOKE DO NOT WANT TO PAY TO SLEEP IN A ROOM WHICH SMELLS OF IT!! Either that or it should be made very clear on both the hotel website and to the booking websites.

<Content>A Tough Time at the Agora I spend a lot of time in Paris so I'm used to small rooms, but the one at the Agora was not only small, but hot and too noisy to open the window, which overlooked a dark, dank courtyard. The walls were painfully thin and noise from other rooms echoed in the courtyard, so I could hear a neighbor coughing, burping, and allowing other random bodily functions to reveberate throughout the silo of the courtyard. The bedspread was stained, the carpet was stained, the towels were old, rough and scarce - no wash clothes. There also was no safety chain or bolt on the door, and the key confounded me on every occasion. Just a pain to deal with. Internet was extremely expensive so I didn't use it. I loved the staff, they were absolutely wonderful, the location was great, the breakfast was tasty, but I was thankful to be leaving after 2 nights and I really can't recommend this hotel to anyone. I'm disappointed about this because the staff really was terrific and the one saving grace of this hotel.

<Content>Super for visit Paris This hotel perfectly gave us all needs what we expect for our trip. Hotel is perfectly located, we were in hard of old town, around thousands of restaurands and bars are ready to spend our time with pleasure. It is only one, what is not like at home - too soft mattress and one cover for our couple, but we know that this is standard in western Europe and maybe we are strange that we need something else.

<Content>The Agora was a great place to stay We had a lovely six day stay at the Agora Saint Germain! The hotel was located within walking distance of Notre Dame, and situated in a very nice neighborhood with a delicious bakery right around the corner for a morning coffee and croissant. The staff spoke English, and they were very helpful with all of our questions and requests. The room was very clean and comfortable, and the bathroom was newly remodeled. My only complaint would be that stepping out of the tub/shower was a very long step. However, that would not be enough to keep me away. I would definitely return to the Agora in the future.

<Content>Great place - clean, well located and well maintained The hotel is in a great location on a quiet street just a few blocks from the Pantheon. The rooms were very clean and the beds very firm which for Paris is unusual! The bathrooms were exceptionally clean and very modern. There are a few good bakeries close by, Eric Keyser was my favorite - lines for bread each morning so obviously popular with the locals. There is a local market most days where you can get fresh fruit and vegetables as well as meats and cheeses. Everything that you need is very close by. The rooms facing the interior courtyard/garden are very quiet, highly recommended for people who are noise sensitive. The day staff could speak English, the guys who worked at night were not as helpful but did try their best to accommodate requests.Really good value for the money. I highly recommend this hotel for people who are looking for a clean, well located hotel in the 5th.

<Content>Great Location Perfect location (good neighborhood, restaurants and Metro nearby), smallish room but extremely clean and good bathroom. My only complaint is that the A/C wasn't working (they instead provided a small portable unit) and due to city noise (and the church bells!) you had to have your windows closed. If we had been in Paris when it was hot this unit wouldn't have provided enough cool air in order to sleep. Management must have known about the problem with the room (an upgraded room that we paid for) or else they wouldn't have provided the stand-alone unit.

<Content>great location My daughter and I recently spent 3 days in Paris. We had a very pleasant stay at the Agora St. Germain Hotel. First, it appeared from the reviews and what I have been told that hotel rooms in Paris are small. This was my first trip to Paris so I'm not sure how to compare our room with others. The room was neat, clean and nicely decorated although, as I said, on the small side. The room had a desk, television and nightstands. The beds were very comfortable. The bathroom was actually large by comparison, although I think that we had the largest bathroom on the floor. I did reserve the basic room and there are more deluxe rooms available. The front desk was very helpful. It looked like the inside of the hotel had recently been redone and was very pleasant. There was a small but nice sitting area in the foyer. Of note, the church around the corner rings bells at about 8 every morning - however, there is so much to do in Paris we were up anyway! The location was perfect - a 3-minute walk from a metro stop, a 10 minute walk to Notre Dame, many, many excellent restaurants within walking distance and the greatest Bakery (Boulangerie Kayser) around the corner. This hotel is in the Latin Quarter. I had looked at several hotels more in the Saint Germain neighborhood (fancier); however, I'm glad we stayed here - it felt like staying in a small Parisian neighborhood slightly away from all the bustle of Saint Germain but easily within walking distance of everything. Overall, I would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Loved it! You can't go wrong with this hotel! Helpful ccommodating staff and awesome location! Hotel is a very short walk to the metro station Maubert Mutualite. The lady on the front desk went out of her way to help us. We had a very important package coming from US Embassy and she made multiple calls (the operator spoke in French) as well as tracked it online for us.Room was very clean and not tiny as we had expected from the reviews about European hotels. Comfortable king bed. Great view from the 5th floor balcony. Try to request higher floors for better views.On some selected days there is a street market - Marche Maubert by the metro station. Great for picking up fresh fruits and picnic lunch supplies. Awesome bakery called Eric Kayser by the hotel. Pantheon and Notre Dame are a short walk away. For dinner we went to Saint Michel area almost every night during our 6 day trip which is a very lively neighborhood with street artists performing on every corner. I would definitely stay at this hotel again!

<Content>Location, location, location The best part of this hotel is the location, right in the heart of the Latin Quarter. Lots of tourist attractions are within walking distance, including the Louvre, Notre Dame, Pantheon, Sorbonne and rue Mouffetard. There are also numerous great restaurants and cafes nearby, and the metro is close, too. All in all, the location really can鈥檛 be beat.Our twin room (#19) was quite tiny, though I suppose the norm by European standards. Still, we weren鈥檛 even able to open the small closet without first moving the nightstand next to one of the beds, which was a bit of a nuisance. The bathroom was clean with a larger than expected bath/shower. The hairdryer looked like some sort of odd vacuum contraption, though, and blew out such little air that it took forever to dry our hair. Recommend packing your own. We never needed to request a wake-up call as there鈥檚 a church at the end of the street and we heard church bells throughout the day and night. It wasn鈥檛 terribly obnoxious, but it quickly became less charming and more annoying.My reviews on the staff are mixed. The woman who is at the desk during the day is very pleasant and helpful. The one time we asked for dinner recommendations, though, she gave us a card for a place around the corner and noted that it was open on Sundays, which it wasn鈥檛 鈥?not a big deal, though. However, the man on duty at night is a lot less friendly and a lot less helpful. Our first night there, we returned after a fairly late night out and were somewhat alarmed to find him sleeping on the bare floor behind the desk! He jumped up, clearly startled, when we came in. Very strange! Also, we requested a cab to the airport very early in the morning the day we checked out and specifically requested ahead of time a cab that would accept a credit card. Asking for this in advance was useless, as the guy at the desk simply went outside and asked the cab driver if he took credit cards after he arrived, which he didn鈥檛. I could鈥檝e done that myself. One other thing that I found bothersome is that the hotel requests that you leave the key with them any time that you leave the hotel. I鈥檝e experienced this before in Europe but it鈥檚 a practise that I鈥檓 not comfortable with, so we didn鈥檛 abide by the 鈥渞ule鈥?and luckily were never asked for ours when we left.Overall our stay was fine and the location was great, but I鈥檇 likely opt for another hotel in the same area instead next time.

<Content>Charming Hotel-Great location! This hotel was everything that all of the previous reviewers said and more. I couldn't have asked for a better location. I could walk three blocks and I was at Notre Dame and the River Seine. If I walked a bit further, I could visit the louvre and the Musee d'orsay. The restaurants that were within walking distance were great and there was always a spot to get a crepe chocolat! Around the corner is a bakery (kayser??), cheese shop, and wine shop...perfect for long walks along the bank of the seine:) I am a female and was traveling alone, but felt very safe here. The room itself was really cute and the bathroom was amazing! There was a flat screen TV and the A/C worked beautifully. When I first arrived, my shower was draining slow and they had it fixed within an hour. I will definitely stay here again on my next visit to Paris!!

<Content>Fantastic location This was our first trip to Paris, we were only there for two days, so location was very important to us. The Latin Quarter was a fun place to stay, and we were within walking distance to everything we wanted to see. Our room was small compared to those in the United States, but it was very comfortable, clean, and quiet. The internet was also free, so that was a nice bonus. If you are interested in seeiing Paris in a different light, we took a bike tour with Bike About Tours and that was a great. We were also told we could have gotten our room cheaper if we would have contacted the hotel directly. This hotel is definetly a place we would stay again.

<Content>Friendly and convenient Friendly, English speaking staff.Safe, quiet side street within walking distance of Notre-Dame but sufficiently away from the main tourist drag to have a interesting, authentic boulangerie, cafe etcRoom and en-suite shower room were small, but modern, clean and with air conditioning and flat-screen TV.My room was quiet, but faced the back with no view. Try to either face the street or the internal courtyard garden.I'd be happy to stay here again.

<Content>I will recommend the Agora St Germain to any friends going to Paris We had a wonderful stay at the Agora St Germain. The location is wonderful...right in the heart of everything and very convenient to the metro. We appreciated the free wifi. The price seemed reasonable for Paris. I'd return again. The staff were very helpful.

<Content>Excellent value, great location, great room! Had heard horror stories about Paris hotel rooms so I researched this one a lot. The hotel exceeded expectations. The room was renovated with a lovely bathroom, comfortable bed, and with a little lcd tv on the wall. The location was perfect - so close to the Notre-Dame. As this was our first trip to Paris, and we were only in the city for 2 days, we used the hop-on-hop-off red tourist bus as our public transport from the Notre-Dame and saved quite a bit of money this way. Would definately recommend the Agora Saint Germain.

<Content>Good base for a left bank weekend Very good basic hotel which proved more than adequate as a base for our weekend in Paris. Comfortable and clean room. Well equiped and clean bathroom. Air conditioned. Bonus of a small balcony.Velib station (Paris bike hire) just round the corner - very handy. Short walk to Metro.Easy walking distance to the Seine and Notre Dame.Ate breakfasts out so can't comment on quality or value of hotel breakfast.Reception staff speak good English if your French (like mine) isn't up to it.No complaints at all.

<Content>Quite good hotel - Excellent location The hotel was quite good and the location magnificent.We booked a twin (double) room and stayed 5 nights. We got room 64 which was located on the 6th floor looking at the back alley of the hotel. As a result the room was very quiet (we did not even hear the bells of Saint-Nicolas du Chardonnet church which was located right opposite to the hotel - something that seemed to bother other reviewers in Trip Advisor). The bedroom had double-glazed windows and air-conditioning of a very good quality.The bedroom was relatively small but it was very clean and recently refurbished (note: not so small though by Paris or London standards). The bed mattress was excellent. The bathroom (with shower) was exceptionally clean, good in size and fully equipped.Service was excellent (we got in contact with five different employees at the reception - everyone of them spoke English and were very helpful)The location is magnificent to say the least.Very near there are shops, caf茅s, bistros, brasseries and restaurants etc. Also it is very near or near to Paris' main attractions (Notre Dame, the Louvre, Latin Quarter, Boulevard Saint-Germain, Muse d' Orsay, The Eiffel Tower etc.).There is an excellent boolangerie (bakery) only a few meters from the hotel (it is called Eric Kayser and is located at 8 rue Monge: turn left as you go out of the hotel and a few meters down turn left again and you are in rue Monge). It has excellent croissants and other goodies.Try a stroll through Rue des Ecoles [fist street as you turn right getting out of the hotel] - and try La petite P茅rigourdine on 39, Rue des 茅coles for some excellent and rather cheap French food - beware though the menu is only in French and written on a whiteboard).You can also try some of the numerous establishments found on the nearby Saint-Germain and Saint-Michel boulevards (most of them have English menus).For an excellent dinner at quite good prices you can try Le Petit Prince de Paris it is located at 12, Rue Lanneau (quite near to the hotel - 3 to 4 blocks away and off Rue des Ecoles - better to find it on a map though or at http://maps.google.com/).The metro stop is only two blocks away from the hotel (station Maubert - Mutualit茅 at Boulevard Saint-Germain).Tickets can be used also at buses and RER trains cost:1,60 Euro per ticket, but is a better idea either to buy a carnet of ten tickets at a price of about 11 euros (that is 1.1 per ticket) or even better to buy a Paris-visite card (unlimited travel for 1, 2, 3 or 5 days at 8,50 - 14 - 9 or 27,50 euros per person - see details at: http://www.ratp.info/informer/anglais/paris_visite.phpAll these tickets can be bought at all Metro stations (in every station there are employees where you can buy them - besides vending machines).Try to use the buses if you can (they have an excellent online system of letting you know the itineraries and the waiting time in every bus stop). Buses are quite fast and you can also see a lot of Paris by traveling on them. Otherwise try the Metro.In concluding we had a very comfortable stay, at a good price an in an a more than excellent location.I would strongly recommend this hotel to everyone.

<Content>A great little hotel! This is a great hotel! My daughter and I spent five days there in June. The rooms, the hallways and the elevator are really small, but the location is great. Two blocks from Notre Dame! And it is close to two excellent bakeries. Also, there are two easy to use laundromats within a block of the hotel. Don't worry about the church bells, never a problem at night. The day staff is excellent! Don't hesitate to book this hotel.

<Content>My 5th time at this great little hotel! I first stayed at Agora St. Germain in 2002 and have stayed 4 times since. It is a block from Maubert-Mutualite Metro stop and easy walking distance to Notre Dame, Jardin du Luxembourg, and many other attractions. The street market is held twice a week right at the Metro and the shops for wine, cheese, meats, fish, fruits and vegetables are all in a line. Between the Metro and Agora is the #1 ranked boulangerie in Paris, Erik Kayser. As you walk from the Metro to the hotel you feel a sense of neighborhood as you join the line at Kayser's for your hot baguette or fruit tarte.The rooms are nicely decorated, comfortable beds and linens, flat-screen TV, and a newly-renovated bathroom -- all can been seen in the hotel website's picture gallery.The interior rooms with windows opening into a small interior courtyard are very, very quiet.For the past 2 1/2 years I have seen the same staff at the hotel and always greeted with a cheerful, Bonjour. Each of the staff was helpful, courteous, and gracious.I highly recommend this hotel and will be back as soon as I can get to Paris again!

<Content>Gets the job done Overall, I would say if you are just looking for a place to sleep  shower, the hotel served its purpose - clean, quiet and comfortable with easy access to the metro.Once we got past the spartan interior, the overall hotel room was clean, the staff helpful and the beds comfortable. From what I understand the tight accomodations are par for the course in Europe offering two twin beds, shower over tub, etc. . The Boulangerie next door was awesome and provided a way to save on breakfast costs. However, I could do without the noisy student element and the dirty streets in the surrounding Latin Quarter.

<Content>Love the neighborhood We've stayed in the Left Bank several times and by far the Agora St. Germain was the best. We would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a reasonably priced, comfortable, and friendly place to stay in the Latin Quarter. All of the staff persons were pleasant, helpful, and spoke English. We will likely stay there again the next time we're in Paris. The room was little larger than expected, nicely decorated, comfortable soft bed (we had two twins pushed together), and a good sized bathroom for the price. It's scale and location really make you feel like you're staying in a neighborhood. The Mutualite Maubert Metro is very convenient, as is the market and shops at Maubert, one of the Left Bank's better bakeries (that's saying something) is just around the corner, as are a small grocery and laundromat. Maybe a 8-10 leisurely walk to Notre Dame. Whereas some previous reviews mentioned the church bells, our window overlooked the church and the bells typically did not start until 8 and even then weren't that bad, rather atmospheric actually. Bottom line is if you understand the difference between a small well managed neighborhood hotel and one of the bigger boy chains, and you want the former, choosing the Agora is a good option.

<Content>Great location, small but adquate The hotel is well located, clean and friendly. No real problems with the stay but the room was small even by Parisian standards - just enough around the side of the bed and it had a tiny wardrobe. Although worth noting that there was a mini-bar with space to keep our own drinks cool.Our room was on the ground floor, looking into the inner atrium and straight across to the reception and the street outside. There were curtains/blinds for privacy. Overall, the room was quite gloomy.Having said that it was very comfortable and quiet so we slept well and the bathroom was recently refurubished with good facilities organised into a small space.We didn't eat breakfast in the hotel as there was a great locals cafe a few steps away and this was one of many choices nearby.It was simple to find and walk from the metro and easy to walk to just about all the places we wanted to visit.I would probably stay again because the location was great and the staff were helpful. I'd make a point of asking the hotel for a better room - the tariff in the hotel itself has different rates for various rooms so it is possible that for a few euros more we could have had a better room (had they been available at the time of booking).

<Content>Lovely small Paris hotel Stayed for a short Paris break. Small hotel with friendly staff within walking distance of many tourist attractions, bars, patisseries and excellent restaurants.The rooms are not large, but better than most Paris hotels of the same price and location. The bath/shower rooms are modern for Paris! The lift failed on one day and it was a bit of a climb - take note if this happens when you have heavy luggage as happened to some new arrivals.The inclusive breakfast is simple Parisien fare with cooked extras having to be paid for. If you want a good, comfortable hotel in central Paris that is value for money, this is it.

<Content>Pleasant Stay, Friendly Staff This hotel was great - friendly staff, great location to subway, and really close to Notre Dame. As a single female traveler I felt really safe in the hotel and the surrounding area. I would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay there again. A minor problem was the air conditioner was leaking and the dripping was a bit noisy, however this was promised to be fixed.

<Content>Clean and comfortable Just returned from a two night break in Paris, staying at the Agora. I found the hotel on the Eurostar website and then looked at reviews on tripadvisor.The reviews were good and the hotel didn't disappoint.We wanted friendly staff, a clean room and a location near the river.All the above were spot on.The river, with a breathtaking view across to Notre Dame was a brief ( approx 2min) stroll away.Very clean room- small but an excellent base.All the staff were helpful and friendly.We chose not to have breakfast in the hotel- more of a Paris experience to find one of the many cafes.

<Content>Great location! Just got back from a weekend at the Agora - as a frequent visitor to Paris I've stayed in several properties but this is by far the best. Staff were all, without exception, very welcoming, which makes all the difference! Location is perfect - a five minute walk to the banks of the Seine, ten minutes to St. Michel and Notre-Dame, and five minutes to the nearest metro station. Lots of restaurants and cafes nearby. Rooms are fine, ok a bit small, but not a problem at all - how much time do you spend in your hotel room anyway? I mean, this is Paris! We overlooked the street and church opposite, and it was great to wake up to the church bells every morning. All in all, the perfect location and brilliant staff. Will definitely go back.

<Content>Just Right Have been back around 3 weeks and have been meaning to write. Stayed in this hotel based on reviews that we read and by location and price. We too were not disappointed. The location was perfect very deverse and with easy access to all that we wanted to do. The shops, cafes, street market and metro are all within walking distance as was the seine and all the attractions around it. All the little streets were wonderful and made you feel more like a local than a tourist which was what we wanted.Took the eurostar to London and a day trip to Giverney, both were a great experience. The room was small, as expected, but perfect for us and was kept neat and clean, the staff was pleasant. We enjoyed having a balcony and we found the church bells charming and not bothersome at all. Also pictures we found posted on this site are exactly what it is like. Had a great time and would easily go back and stay there again (tommorrow would not be to soon!)

<Content>Loved the neighbourhood I booked this hotel based on the comments that I read from Trip Advisor and I was not disappointed. The hotel web site is very representative of the hotel and our room was exactly as the photos and it was kept very clean. Yes, the rooms were very small, but we had every convenience that we could want. We were on the first floor with a nice window looking out onto the church.The neighbourhood was not in the highest tourist area, and you were able to get a feel for the local comings and goings. It was noisy in the daytime with the window open, but we did not spend much time in our room.The church across the street was charming, especially with the church bells waking you each morning! The location was perfect and everything was within walking distance from tourist attractions, local markets, great shopping and fabulous restautants. We did not take the breakfast in the hotel. There was a fabulous bakery just next door (Kayser bakery) and the croissants, pain au chocolat and cheese bread were amazing. The local brasserie (Brasserie Barnum) was serving everything from breakfast to lunch, dinner and the most amazing creme brul茅e. Everywhere we went the service was very friendly. The staff at the Hotel Agoral Saint Germain were very friendly and consistently provided great directions and recommendations for dining. Le Petit Pontpoise was definately a memorable dining experience, not to mention Toustem and Le Buisson Ardent. Coming from Montreal, we had high expectations and were not disappointed. Expensive mind you but worth every morsel. It was a most enjoyable sejour in Paris and I would definately stay at Hotel Agora Sainmt Germain again!

<Content>Perfect little hotel in Latin Qtr I was very pleased w/ the Agora St Germain, great location in the Latin Qtr just off Blvd St Germain, walking distance to river/Notre Dame. Recently renovated rooms, nice bathrooms, very clean, small as I expected but very comfortable and quiet. Staff was very helpful. You must get a baguette from the little bakery on Rue Monge around the corner, best in town! Overall it was completely worth every penny I spent and found it very reasonable compared to other places I researched.

<Content>Absolutely Fantastic Stayed at this hotel for a weekend break with my boyfriend. I decided on on this hotel because of the location and reviews.What can I say, it was perfect! Rue des Bernardins (the street on which the hotel is situated) takes you straight down to the Seine and the Notre Dame. We used the Batobus to navigate the city and there is a stop at the Notre Dame which was so convenient. We took the boat to the Champs Elysees and walked to the Eiffel Tower (although you can take the boat directly to the Eiffel Tower if you wish). The St Germain area is great with loads of different cafes, bars and shops within walking distance. We came across Tunisian, Japanese, Greek, Indian, Thai, Chinese, Vietnamese, Turkish and of course French cuisine all in the vicinity. There are also designer clothes shops close by for those who can afford it (window shopping only for me!).Our room at the hotel was very modern, clean and comfortable. The minibar is reasonably priced (for a minibar in Paris) and contains a range of soft drinks. I don't know if our room was well sound proofed or the guests were quiet because we didn't hear a peep the whole time. There are TVs in the room with a small range of European channels and CNN and BBCWorld for the English speaking, not that a TV is needed whatsoever as we really only used the room to sleep.We had breakfast at the hotel once and it was fine, a normal continental breakfast as you would expect. We tended to visit the many patisseries, boulangeries and delis in the area!The staff at the hotel were very friendly and helpful. People said before we went that we would find french people rude, but this is rubbish. Even though we spoke little of their language we found that everyone appeared kind and patient (bar 1 moody woman who worked at the metro station in Marne la Valee).I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone, I couldn't fault it in anyway.Paris is definately one of the most beautiful cities I have ever seen and I will go back one day.

<Content>Loved the Agora St. Germain We just got back from a 4 night stay at the Agora St. Germain. We were very pleased with the hotel. The location was fantastic, very central, close to most of the neighborhoods, metro and RER train station and in a less touristy area. (which we always prefer). We were amazed with how quiet it was considering it is in a fairly busy area. There was also an excellent bakery and patisserie right around the corner where we had breakfast and bought bread for our picnics on the Seine (only a few blocks away). The hotel front desk even had a cork screw to open the wine we bought for the picnic! Everyone on the staff was very helpful and friendly.The room was clean , nicely decorated, and well kept by the housekeeping staff. It was also well laid out for a typical smaller sized European room with big closets on each side of the bed.We would definitely stay there again!

<Content>A Gem We stayed here for 2 nights on a Paris get-away using a EuroStar package. The rooms clean and nicely finished, the staff were very pleasant and helpful and the location was wonderful, a short walk to Notre Dame, close to the metro, and good restaurants. We had a fantastic dinner at the nearby La Meree Verte. I absolutely will recommend this hotel.

<Content>Mixed feelings about the agora If we had not stayed with friends in this hotel - one of which lived in Paris for 18 months and told us that it is an above average hotel in Paris then I would probably rate this hotel at average. The room is small to say the least. It was hard to get 2 people and 2 suit cases in this tiny little room.The recent reviews on the church bell in the morning are also accurate however it only rang on 3 of the 5 mornings we were there so we must have been lucky because the mornings it did ring we were awake from 6am.As far as the facilities of the hotel - The room is so small that you an not get an ironing board in your room - You have to go to the laundry in the basement to iron your clothes which is a little odd and inconvenient.The bathroom is small but clean.The LOCATION is great - very close to 3 or 4 Metro stations, 5 mins walk from the Latin Quarter and Notre Dame. Cheese shops, Laundromat, wineshopes, supermarkets and Bakeries all very near by.In summary - if this room was any where but Paris I think you would pay a maximum of 75 Euros for the room and that would be fair, but Paris is an expensive city and if you want to stay there and not have to pay over 200 Euros a night, you have to make comprimises - I think you could do a lot worse than the Agora but go with realistic expectations and you will not be dissappointed

<Content>Disappointing We had quite high expectations due to the rave reviews previous visitors had posted, however we were quite disappointed with our stay at Hotel Agora St Germain. There were serious renovations being undertaken while we were there which no one advised us of- (painting, which stank out the whole floor- , floor coverings removed, doors removed, drilling and constant noise)- and even a tradesman who came into our room for 15 minutes without asking, to change the door lock- while we were resting in there!), the hairdryer was broken, the shower did not have a head which could be attached to the wall, making it impossible to wash your hair, and the constant entering of the maids without knocking became really annoying. When we politely approached the desk staff, they were unresponsive. When we asked for a reccommendation on somewhere to eat (traditional, simple, french) they sent us to a gross hollywood themed bar. The location is good- but there are plently of other hotels in the area i would stay at next time instead.

<Content>pleasant stay at the Agora Just come back from a three night stay at the Agora St Germain. The hotel is in a pleasant location and only a short walk from the metro. The hotel itself is clean and well kept and we had no complaints about the standard of the rooms. The beds were comfortable but you could tell they were well slept in, clean linen but the bedspeads looked a little tired. Generally the furnishings were fine however. The bathroom was lovely but my mums was older and needed updating. One thing I would recommend is to make sure that you do not get a room overlooking the rather dingy courtyard as there is no view at all and the rooms are very dark. My daughter and I had a room on the outside on the 6th floor and the view was nice and typical of Paris. We went round the corner to a small bar and had delicious coffee and croissants for half the price of the hotel breakfast.

<Content>A great experience for insomniacs! This hotel always seems to get great reviews. It is both value for money and benefits from wonderfully helpful staff. It is off a main road, so slightly protected from Parisienne traffic noises although it is close to a popular church which gives you no peace whatsoever with loud bell ringing sessions.The rooms are pretty small but refurbished and whilst the bedrooms are pretty middle of the road, the bathrooms have been given a pleasant modern twist.However, beware being allocated a room at the rear of the hotel. These look out on the blank wall of an internal well shaft, so absolutely no views and the rooms are dark as a result. Noise tends to travel up the well. You are shielded from the city noises of the front facing rooms though. All rooms have a problem of paper-thin walls, so if you don't mind hearing your neighbours ' baby crying all night or early morning drinking sessions as friends catch up on their days out - this is for you.It is a great area for food - brilliant boulangeries/cheese shops, restaurants and cafes and it is literally 5 minutes from Notre Dame and the Panthenon.All in all a good experience if you are not looking for pampering or a night's sleep!

<Content>Would definitely stay here again I stayed here for 7 nights this past April. I would consider staying here again. The location was the best. It was conveniently located near the metro. There was also a street market near the hotel that was quite fabulous.

<Content>Great location We stayed here for 3 nights the week after Easter, having read the reviews on this site. It was a lovely little hotel, and somehow very familar after all that I had read! The corridors were still being refurbished but the room itself was great - very clean and comfortable, and a lovely bathroom. We had a room on the front of the hotel that had french windows and a small balcony. The church bells at 7.40 in the morning are quite a shock but it all added to the charm! Great location - five minutes to Notre-Dame. The Ile St Louis is a lovely little area with very charming little streets and cafes. We didn't bother with the hotel breakfast - there are several boulangeries around that do a great pain au chocolat! Would also recommend a stroll down the Rue Mouffetard on a market morning and a stop in the Jardin de Luxembourg.Would definitely recommend this hotel in terms of comfort and friendliness - one minor niggle was that the walls seemed to be very thin and we could hear our neighbours quite clearly, but that is more the nature of Parisian buildings than a fault of the hotel's!

<Content>Great hotel in a fantastic location Stayed at this hotel as part of a mid-week break to Paris. I used Tripadvisor to pick a Hotel and travelled on the Eurostar. It was cheaper to book direct rather than as part of a Eurostar package. Bedrooms very clean with good bathroooms. Hotel location is just brilliant, being minutes from the Boulevard St Germain and the Ile de la Cite. Fairly small rooms which is typical of a boutique-style hotel but you are only there to sleep right? What really made it for me was the helpful attitude of all the staff. Everyone made us feel very welcome and they were always eager to help, which has not always been my experience of Parisians to the 'rosbifs!' Make the effort to speak some French and you will be well rewarded! Lots of places to eat and drink nearby.

<Content>Great Location I stayed in the Agora for three nights the start of March and must say I was very impressed with the hotel.. They were renovating the corridors when we were there so things looked a bit messy, we don't spend much time in corridors so we didn't let that upset us too much!!!!! :-) Rooms were small but perfectly formed, I think when your in Paris you don't spend too much time in them... The best thing about the Agora is it's location you can walk to many of the major tourist sights without too much stress.. Metro is really convenient and must say very easy to work out even for me!!! We had breakfast included in our package but as others have said this is 11 euros, I don't think it would be worth it so if your paying for it you might want to think about not including this.. Reception staff were always very pleasant only people we found a little bit rude were the kitchen staff at breakfast.. Only a small complaint, would definatley recommend the Agora and will definatley visit again..

<Content>Small but perfectly formed We picked this hotel cos it got such a high rating on tripadvisor and are glad we did. The room was very good and the hotel was in an excellent location. Our room was small but had enough storage space that it didn't seem cramped, was very chic and completely spotless. I've stayed in higher star-rated hotels that have had worse rooms. Our room overlooked the courtyard, so didn't have much light, but also no traffic or church bells noise. That said, we could hear quite a lot of noises from the rest of the hotel. The hotel is also undergoing refurbishment, so the corridors were 'works in progress'. The bed was very comfortable and we had the smallest bath in the world in our room, but at least it was a bath! Staff were very helpful. The location really made the Agora, it was within seconds of the metro and minutes of the Seine and Notre Dame (and the RER). What's more, all the little cafes and restaurants locally were great for breakfast or a nightcap. The Latin Quarter was our favourite arrondisement and seemed slightly cheaper than the rest of paris. The Metro is excellent and so fast and the RER is even faster, if a little less attractive. You're not really in Paris to stay in a hotel room, but if you choose the Agora, you won't be disappointed.

<Content>Fantastic hotel in a great location Just back from a 3 night stay in Paris and a 3 night stay in the Agora Saint Germain. Unless you go luxury, nearly all hotel rooms in Paris are tiny, however this is an exception. While not huge, the rooms did afford a little walking space between the bed and the wall. Bathroom was small, but again, a little bigger than most hotels I've stayed with in Paris. But the main reason you should chose this hotel is location. It is in the Latin Quarter about a 5 minute walk from Notre Dame. Back behind the hotel (another 5 minute walk away) are all the bars and restaurants that make up The Latin Quarter. We ate here a few times and most of the restaurants are pretty reasonable and serve good food. There is a great vibe around this area, which is full of students having a few drinks. The hotel was being renovated when we were there, mainly aesthetics, paint work etc., but there was no noise at all at night or early morning. We had breakfast on one morning and it was fine, pain au chocolate and croissants. One person did ask for the bacon and eggs (that was advertised), but was met with a very curt, c'est fini. The only complaint I would have about this hotel is that there are no hooks on the back of the bathroom door to hang your towel and if that's all there is to complain about, then it must be good.If you are flying into Paris and staying here, take the train from CDG to St. Michel Notre Dame, then look for the Orange coloured line 10 (about a 2 minute walk), which will bring you to Cluny La Sarbonne and from there, it's just one stop up to Maubert Mutualite. Hotel is about a 2 minute walk from the Metro (it's easier to ask when you get there, rather than me trying to explain it).If I was going back to Paris, I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Nice little hotel Just back from a week in Paris, where we stayed at the Hotel Agora. We were, overall, quite pleased with the hotel. All of the staff at the reception were friendly and helpful, and spoke perfect English. Our room, on the fourth floor, was definitely not large, but was sufficient for what we needed (a place to sleep after long days of sightseeing!). Everything seemed clean, the beds were comfortable enough, and there was some storage space for clothes. The bathrooms had been recently renovated, which was nice, and were a good size, although it was a little bit of a challenge to avoid getting water from the shower on the bathroom floor! Unlike a previous review, my difficulty with the shower was that the temperature was hotter than I like, so they may have modified that.The location is excellent - about two blocks from a metro station, and 5 minutes from the back of Notre Dame. Also in the immediate area are several cafes, and stores selling cheese, wine, baked goods, meat, etc. We took advantage of this several times, having a picnic dinner one night, and buying baked goods several evenings to eat for breakfast the next morning. We never had the hotel-provided breakfast, which at 11 euros didn't seem like enough of a deal to try with so many other, cheaper, options. For dinner, we found a couple of little streets within 5 minutes walk of the hotel, which had very good restaurants at decent rates.We had just a couple of minor negatives. One was the church across the road - we had read on TA that the bells ring early, but thought that since we were there in winter, and would have the windows closed, they wouldn't be a problem. Don't think this - the bells go off (with a nice little melody) at 7:40 AM 6 days a week. They will then go off on the hour and half-hour. Just be aware of this; it is definitely not the worst thing in the world, but if you are hoping to sleep late in the morning, they will make it more difficult. Also, the rooms are not perfectly soundproofed - one night, we had a group of teenagers in the hotel, and we could definitely notice the noise through the walls.Overall, this is a nice little hotel. It's nothing fancy, so if you are looking for an exceptional experience don't choose it, but if you are hoping for somewhere relatively inexpensive in a good location, this is a good option.

<Content>Great little hotel Just returned from Agora Saint Germain. It is a lovely little hotel in a fantastic location. The rooms and lobby are very clean. I stayed for 4 nights. On my first night, I had a room on the first floor that faced a courtyard. There was no light. I asked to be moved and the next day, a room on the 4th floor with a picturesque view of a church was made available. The room was a bit smaller (hard to imagine since all the rooms are small), but the light and air made all the difference. Waking up to a view outside your window really makes the trip special, notwithstanding the church bells ringing every hour or so.The breakfast does not come with the room. I didn't know that until after the fact. At 11 euros, it is not cheap. There are croissants, bread, cheese, yoghurt, hard-boiled eggs, cereal, juice, coffee. Everything was very good and very fresh. If you don't want to think about breakfast, and money is not an issue, the breakfast is the way to go. Around the corner and in the neighborhood are plenty of places to go for breakfast if you want to venture out.The hotel recommended several good places nearby to dine for dinner. I especially liked the husband/wife team at La Maree Verte. They don't speak English, but, are lovely hosts. The hotel is undergoing renovation. The hallways are being painted and are a mess. Each weekday morning, plastic is laid down on the carpeted floors and each evening, the plastic is lifted and the floors vacuumed. Even still, there is plaster dust in the halls. The renovations did not interfere with my use of the room. When in Paris, who spends time in their room? If you are someone who hangs around the hotel during the day, you may want to wait a few weeks (until the end of January 2008) to stay in the hotel. Otherwise, I whole-heartedly recommend the hotel to anyone looking for a quaint small hotel in a great neighborhood.

<Content>Brilliant location We stayed at the Agora in early January 2008. The hotel is in a brilliant location - a couple of hundred metres from a metro stop, a bakery, cheese shop, wine shop, green grocers... and only a few blocks from Notre Dame. The room was small (as all are in Paris), but had everything that we needed in it - a tv with BBC World, good heating and a small fridge. The hotel was in the midst of renovations, and our bathroom had clearly only been done recently, as it was all very clean and shiny. The only issue was that the water temperature in the shower was not hot enough (the cold tap didn't work, so I guess they set the temperature low so that no one gets burnt).

<Content>Good Place! Stayed here from 11/15-11/23/07 during the transportation strike.Good hotel, good location, nice people  good prices.Post any questions you may have for specifics.Note: an American Breakfast in Paris (Roadside Diner) is about a block away in case you get homesick for American coffee (a bottom cup of joe) or tosted bagel with Phili cream cheese. Very nice servers here, from Canada.Our departure cab already had $11.50 euros on the meter when they picked us up...thought that was too much! Taxi fare at seven (7) am with NO Traffic to CDG was $60.00 euros (with no tip and he didn't get one either).In general, a good time!

<Content>Perfect location! Chose this hotel because is it located in the same neighborhood in which we lived back in 2001, so it was a little like coming home.We arrived by train from Florence (another review on that!), so we actually took the bus to get to the hotel, which was just fine.Hotel was very nice; staff was very friendly and helpful. No Internet access available, though (no big deal as by this time, we didn't want to check e-mail!).Breakfast was good, not perfect, but okay--we missed the baguette, so having this as part of the breakfast was great! Hotel room was small, but okay. Bathroom was smal, but that was okay, too. Both were clean so that was very important to us. Location again was excellent--within walking distance of the Seine, Notre Dame, etc.

<Content>Great Location.. Great Hotel! My boyfriend and I just arrived from Paris two days ago and we just had to share our great experience with our HOTEL. Agora Saint Germain is located in the heart of restaurants, grocery stores, churches, etc. It's approximately three blocks away from the Notre Dame and the Metro station was right around the corner (though we had difficulty catching the metro since there was a strike going on.) The staff at the hotel were very friendly and attended to our needs at all times. Our room was always clean with fresh towels everyday. Right on the corner of the hotel is a church that rings every hour and I actually enjoyed listening to this. Our room was located right in the front so we had a great view of the church and the street and I loved how both windows opened up and you can just people watch. There is an A/C and a heater in the room and the heater worked great. My boyfriend actually got sick on this trip and the staff assisted us in finding a doctor the very next day. The staff took the time to call the doctor's office for us and book an appointment. 11 EUROS per person is kind of a lot for breakfast but there are great pastry and croissant places right around the corner for breakfast. Overall, we really really enjoyed our stay at this hotel and would definitely stay here again... You really can't beat the location and the friendliness of this hotel. Thank you for making our stay a memorable one!!!

<Content>A little Gem This Hotel is lovely. The staff are friendly (the front desk open 24hrs) and the decor very elegant without being overdone. The room was clean and tidy and the decor is modern. We had a standard room.The rooms are not big but fine and there was a small wardrobe if you plan a longer stay (we stayed only 1 night). we had room 69. it is onthe top story and overlooked the street and other buildings in the area. The images on their website are accurate as to what you get, soonly pleasant suprises. The only downside was the elevator was brokenwhen we arrived from a long walk with all our luggage. So we carried it 6 flights. it was repaierd overnight so that was a relief! the breakfast was nice too, usual french fare- coffee/tea,croissants, cheeses, jams ,yoghurt, bread, boiled egg, cereal etc. Convenient location. Would stay here again.

<Content>wonderful staff We stayed at this hotel for 9 nights in September and was incredibly pleased. For 169 euros a night, we got a lovely small room looking onto the street with double french doors that could open. The bathroom was tiny, but newly done over and had everything we needed. What I actually want to mention is the staff. Aline, Eric, Raynard were all extremely helpful. They assisted us to check train schedules, directes us where ever we wanted to go, made and cancelled reservations for us and never once gave us the impression that is was a drag for them. The front desk is manned 24 hours a day and the night staff were always quick to respond and friendly (even in the dead of night).The only problem we had was a bit of noise from the street at night, but if you can bear to close the french doors, you will not have the same problem. Great stay!

<Content>Wonderful hotel We stayed here four nights and we will stay again when we next visit Paris. The location is great: a very short walk to Notre Dame Cathedral, the Pantheon, restaurants on Blvd. St. Germain and the Seine. The staff was very helpful and friendly, the hotel was immaculate and the room was new and comfortable. We had read other reviews mentioning the small size of the rooms and elevator and were prepared for the worst, but we found the room to be of average size and the elevator accomodated us quite nicely. Breakfasts were ample and of good quality, served in a lovely room on the floor below the lobby. We were pleased with every aspect of our stay here.

<Content>Clean, comfortable and convenient! I stayed here back in March as a solo female traveler. (30)I lived in Paris years ago as a student, so I'm very familiar w/the city.The hotel is in a great neighborhood, and if you've got your walking shoes on, you're really in a great spot for walking almost everywhere. Between walking and the metro, this is a great location. You're also not in a heavy touristy neighborhood, so that's great too (not noisy). There are good shops, boutiques, the open-air market as many have noted, tabac, cafes, etc. You're also close to the Seine, which is very helpful while navigating the city! After being out late for a few nights, I walked home or took the metro with no problems, this is a safe area for those concerned about that.The lobby is small and modern, and they were finishing renovations while I was there. The hostess also told me that I was the first to sleep on a new bed in my room, so that's great! There's nothing like old uncomfortable beds....ugh...and mine was brand-new and super cozy. Yes the rooms are small, but if you've travelled in Europe, it won't surprise you. This isn't the USA folks, where buildings are just a few years old....they are centuries old, and who cares, if you are staying in Paris and spending all day in your hotel room, you're nuts! Granted if you are spending big bucks, I'd want a big room too, but not at this price range. My room faced the courtyard, so it was very quiet. I used the alarm on the TV, worked brilliantly. And the bathroom? Super modern, clean and worked very well. And yes, a funky small shower, but again, typical in small european hotels. The water pressure was great--that's usually all that I ask for! But yes--small bathroom, but well-lit, functioned beautifully and it's very modern.I did not eat breakfast there (I think 11 Euro? that's definitely overpriced) And you should do what the parisians do....go out early, get some bread or pastries and then go for a cup of coffee at a cafe and watch the world go by. I think this is a good hotel for single travellers, perhaps mom and daughter getaways, and couples. I'd probably want some more space if I had children, and there are a handful of family-friendly hotels in the area, so I probably would choose another over this one for a family getaway. I also wouldn't call this a romantic hotel, but if you want something basic for a honeymoon or a good, simple base for a couples' getaway and you don't want to spend a lot, it would be fine. But I could think of more romantic areas in the city to stay in other than here. I'd probably love the hotel more if it were slightly closer to Saint Germain des Pres/Quartier Latin, but it's still a good location. And it's quiet---it's not in the rowdy, touristy student areas. Again, very convenient to the metro and a great spot to venture out all over the city. I would also highly recommend staying in the Marais or in the 7th. When in doubt, choose a hotel somewhat close to the Seine, (for navigating purposes) or on a main line/stop of the metro. You'll be glad you did. There are beautiful areas a bit further out, like the 18th and 16th, but if you're not that familiar w/the city, and in Paris only briefly, I would recommend saving those areas for another trip.Also, mgmt was fine. They were helpful and courteous from reservation to checkout, and I a got a good rate. I went online andasked for the lowest rate and I got it. When in doubt ASK for the lowest rate! They want your business and you want a good rate.Clean, comfortable and convenient. A solid choice for a hotel and I would stay here again.

<Content>Great hotel, great location. My extended family (10 of us in all) stayed here for 4 nights and it was wonderful. From check in to check out the staff was friendly and helpful (even though between the 10 of us we speak almost no french). The tiny elevator added to the romance of the surroundings, and the lobby was an fine meeting place for us. my wife and I stayed in room 38 and had a great view of the church across the street. Having been warned about the small rooms, we were pleasantly suprised with being able to walk all around the bed, and plenty of room to store our luggage and accumulated shopping bags! The small cafe around the corner serves amazing croissants and cafe, and there are cute shops nearby, including a toy store we bought gifts to bring home for our kids. As noted Notre Dame, the Pantheon are both a few blocks away, and we walked to the Louvre, Orsey, and Pompadou. Not short walks, but lots to see along the way. My wife and I had to catch a 6:50 am plane on our return, meaning leaving the hotel at 4:15am. Our wakeup call came at the correct time, and the taxi was waiting when we got downstairs. This was my first time in Paris, and I will definately be visiting again, and staying at This hotel!

<Content>Don't expect miracles I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights with my Mum in early October. I had booked a twin room with breakfast via a travel agent. When we arrived the receptionist surprised us saying that they ran out of twin rooms and could offer us only a double room. We were willing to pay for an upgrade but all rooms had been taken. It wasn't a great start. The room was a shoe box size and smelt heavily of cigarette smoke. Luckily, the house-keeping was quick to react and in the evening when we came back, it was all fresh and pleasant. The best part of our double room was the bathroom. It was clean and modern although petit. The reception staff was always very friendly and happily offered advice on how to use public transport and taxis. Breakfast was also sufficient with a reasonable selection of pastries and bread and rolls. The cheese board was OK. We loved the location and proximity to a Metro station, lots of shops (bakery, grocery shop, cheese shop, etc) and more importantly to the Notre Dame. I'm not sure if Agora St Germain hotel was the best value for money. Well, it was a busy period in Paris due to the Rugby Cup so many hotels were fully booked and other put up the prices. Given the overall experience, I will consider another hotel in the area in the future.

<Content>Beware of this Hotel This hotel got my credit card information when the hotel I booked with couldn't get me a room and without my consent charged my credit card as I didn't show up. I have emailed but the answer is that the owner is out of town so there is nothing they can do and asked my original hotel to contact them as they were the ones that booked for me (without my authorization) and they told me they are really sorry but the hotel is not willing to reverse the charges and the only way I can get this resolved is filing a credit card fraud claim as I did not sign or give my credit information to this hotel. Be careful with your credit card information when dealing with this hotel!!!!

<Content>Fine enough, a pleasant stay Stayed here for two nights on tripadvisor recommendation. A pleasant enough experience. Reception staff professional, room adequate, very nice location. Starting each day with a less than two minute walk to Notre Dame and a leisurely stroll down the Seine is pretty blissful. Amazing pastries served in the hotel breakfast room -- make sure you try them!! I'd most likely stay here again when I visit Paris.

<Content>lovely boutique hotel Our stay at Agora was comfortable and a great location. We had minor problems with our door key but after mastering the technique it added to the charm of this hotel. It was clean and the breakfast room was very lovely, with breakfast being reasonably priced. The staff in particular, Aline was very helpful in suggesting restaurants and giving us directions. We would recommend this hotel, a great 3 star stay.

<Content>Good value hotel The Agora hotel met our needs perfectly on this trip.Without repeating too much of what the other reviewers have said, the Agora was:-In a quieter area of the Latin Quarter, just enough away from the really touristy part but still with enough restaurants, bakeries and metro stop (Maubert) in close walking distance.-Enhanced by extremely friendly and helpful staff. Booking for both the dinner cruise and shuttle bus to the airport were efficient and without any problems.-Very clean! the bathroom in particular spotless and very modern. Room was small (even in our superior room) but there was a nice view and adequate space for our needs.All in all a very nice boutique hotel which was value for money. I booked directly via the hotel and found that price to be the cheapest.

<Content>Agora-phile After reading good reviews here, booked the Agora well in advance for a 2-night stay. Location excellent, stone's throw from Maubert-Mutualit茅 metro station and St Michel RER for train to/from CDG. Sites on doorstep: Panth茅on, Sorbonne, Notre Dame, Boul. St Germain...Staff very friendly. Room small (c'est Paris, n'est-ce pas?) but comfortable. Very clean. Super-modern bathroom. LCD TV. Street-side room can be noisy at night - tip: turn on the a/c for a while before bed, then turn off and leave window closed before sleeping. Eric Kayser just around corner on Rue Monge great for breakfast. Recommended!

<Content>Nice quiet hotel My boyfriend booked this hotel as a surprise for valentines day this year so i was a little sceptial as he booked it without seeing any reviews. We arrived and the check in desk staff were so helpful showing us where our rooms were. The room was lovely , plasma tv on the wall, comfy bed and a really nice bathroom. The woman on the check in desk recommended restaurants and places to visit all of which were wonderful. We were within walking distance of the notre dame and there was a bus stop about 100m from the hotel which took us straight to the effiel tower. The breakfast was wonderful and didnt finish until nearly midday. We only stayed the one night in paris and were given a little room to put our bags in while we went out for the final day. i would definatly go back here.

<Content>Superb location Small hotel right in the centre of Paris a few minutes walk from the Seine and Notre Dame. The hotel is in a quiet area surrounded by local shops and restaurants. The staff spoke excellent English and were very helpful. The hotel was very clean and is good value for money. I would recommend this hotel for those who like to explore on foot due to the proximity of all the major sights or for more independant travellers.

<Content>Lovely Agora My husband and I have just returned from a 2-night stay at this lovely hotel. We booked the hotel on the strength of the positive reviews from other travellers and are happy to now add our own endorsement. The room was a generous size (by Paris standards) and spotlessly clean, as was the modern bathroom. We would have preferred a duvet to blankets, but that would be our only criticism.

<Content>Loved our stay I booked directly on the hotel website, after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor. They were not wrong. My husband and I stayed at the Agora for 6 nights. Just returned. The staff was pleasent and helpful, the room was, though small, quite ample for the 2 of us. The bathroom was great. Newly renovated. We booked a twin superior (beds pushed together) and had a lovely balcony that faced the church. The neighborhood was lovely and so close to major tourist attractions and the metro stops. Paris was just steps away! I highly recommend this hotel to anyone going to Paris.

<Content>fantastic hotel and location My daughter and I stayed at the Agora Saint Germain for 2 nights and 3 days. The hotel is in the latin quarter with plenty of fine restaurants, bistros and bakeries. The service is excellent and will surely stay there again the next time we visit Paris. I highly recomment this hotel.

<Content>Definitely a great place to stay We spent two nights at this hotel. Originally, we were supposed to stay 4 mights, but the hotel did not have our reservation in their system. The staff was excellent in terms of finding us a room in a nearby hotel. Then, one staff member walked us to the new hotel so we wouldn't get lost. OUTSTANDING SERVICE!The Agora is very comfortable, and it has air conditioning - a real plus in Paris!!!! The staff is excellent and all spoke very good English. The location is terrific with lots of cafes nearby. Close to Notre Dame the river. I would definitely stay at this hotel again. We highly recommend it.

<Content>This hotel is a great choice for singles, couples or families. This hotel is in a great location in the centre of the Latin Quarter. It is very safe, quaint, clean and has very pleasant and most helpful staff!I did not book in advance but just happened to be walking by when I decided to take a look at the rooms which were lovely (but small as most are in Paris) and decided to stay. The next time I return to Paris I would definitely return to this small hotel.

<Content>Great service, lovely hotel After some pretty ordinary experiences with Latin Quarter hotels, this was a delight. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, the rooms were well equipped, clean and comfortable (with good air conditioning), and it is in a great location.After indifference at other hotels, they were attentive here - for example, one day I walked in with a bunch of flowers and they immediately offered to get a vase - at the other places they would have thrown up their hands and shrugged if I had dared ask!Thoroughly recommended!!!

<Content>Loved the Agora St. Germain This hotel is a find, not only because of the friendly, helpful staff and comfortable accommodations...but the location can't be beat! Just around the corner is an ATM, the most amazing bakery in all of Paris (stop by Eric Kayser for great breads, pastries and desserts...despite his fame, the line moves quickly...try the pistachio brioche and chocolate croissants!), and a quick walk to numerous bistros, cafes, and museums. The room we had was #49 and it was quiet (soundproof, actually) with a comfortable bed and the bathroom was outstanding for anyplace in Europe...The nearby church bells will serenade you but we did not find that to be bothersome...it only added to the charm of this hotel, which is as clean as can be. Will definitely stay here again. The only downside was that the room was small and there was very limited space for unpacking clothing but this certainly was not a showstopper by any means. Try this hotel...you won't be disappointed.

<Content>Terrific experience My daughter (age 21) and I just returned from an overnight stay in Paris. We were so pleased with the Agora and would highly recommend it. We booked through the hotel website and the price was under $200. We did not eat breakfast at the hotel but instead went to the cafe around the corner and had a lovely breakfast for 5 Euro - tea/coffee/hot chocolate, croissant or bread and butter, orange juice. Our room 67, had 2 twin beds pushed together, a clean bathroom with bath and shower, and a street view. The hotel is on a very quiet street in the Latin Quarter. The church bells do ring throughout the day, but we really couldn't hear them with the window closed. There are many great cafes nearby, as well as an outdoor market. The metro stop is very close. The front desk staff was so friendly and spoke very good English. The elevator is very tiny. This was our first trip to Paris. We traveled on the Eurostar from London. I would definitely want to come back again to this beautiful city and would choose this hotel as well as recommend it.

<Content>Highly recommend the ASG We lucked into this dependable 3-star hotel for our first trip to Paris, and highly recommend it. Staff was very pleasant and helpful, all good English speakers. Room was quiet, clean, bathroom pretty large for big-city 3-star hotel. Great location on Left Bank just off Blvd. St. Germain surrounded by ATMs, bakeries, small food shops, restaurants. About 3-4 minute walk to Metro, maybe 10 minutes to Notre Dame, 15 minutes to Internet cafe. No issues.

There is an outdoor market open almost every day within one block. There are many bakeries and deli's in the area. The breakfast at the hotel is very good. French croissants and great french bread with very good cheese.It is close to the Metro, money exchange and ATM. We enjoyed our stay and will stay there again when in Paris.

<Content>Great Staff at Hotel Agora Saint-Germain After a particularly difficult experience at a nearby hotel, my entourage sought accommodations at the Hotel Agora Saint-Germain. Not only were we accepted, the management allowed us to check and get our rooms while appropriate changes were being made to change our accommodations from one hotel to another. The hotel was centrally located and within walking distance of the metro, computer access, McDonald's, and many very good eateries and shops. The staff was always courteous, respectful and went out of their way to call our shuttle connection to the airport upon departure. The front desk staff minimized the language barrier as well by speaking English fluently when applicable. Overall, the six night experience at Hotel Agora Saint-Germain was great and I would recommend this Hotel to American travellers.

<Content>Great Hotel for Basic Needs I just got back from a 5-night stay at this hotel. I booked it via their own website, which had much better rates than any of the big travel sites. First, I should state that I was looking for a good value hotel, nothing fancy, but with a clean room and in a great location. The Agora definitely satisfied those needs for me. With their internet rate, I was able to get a superior room here for less than it would have cost for a standard room at what I believe to be comparable hotels in the area.So I booked a superior double room for my boyfriend and me, but when we got to the hotel our room (17) was unavailable because of a problem with the air conditioner. No other superior rooms were available so we took a standard room for the night (room 15) until one opened up the next day. They were very nice and apologetic about this, and we were also understanding and just looked at it as a way to save a little bit of money for one night. Room 15 faced inwards to an air shaft- which they decorated at the ground floor to make a sort of cute little garden- and had a double bed, with barely enough room to walk around especially if you have a lot of luggage. The bathroom is very nice but opens up literally right at the bed, so there is really hardly any privacy even with the door closed. The next day we were moved to room 29 (superior), which faced the street outside, had 2 twin beds pushed together (which I wanted, becuase I think you get a little extra bed that way), and was set up more like any hotel room you'd see in the US. The bathroom was separate from the main room area, and there was a desk. Both rooms had a 19 inch or so plasma tv, which was nice. Both also had a mini-fridge/minibar. I'd say for the extra little bit of money (maybe $50 a night), it is definitely worth it to stay in the superior room, because we would not have been comfortable in the standard for five days. There was just not enough space for us. Both rooms were a little stuffy, but we usually left the windows open while we went out for the day, which the maid closed during her cleaning, and then it was fine when we got back. Housekeeping was good and made up the rooms really nice. Hotel is in a great location- even closer to the Maubert Mutualite metro station than I thought from looking at maps. The 10 metro line definitely isnt the most useful one, but it's just one stop or an extra 5-8 minutes walking to a big transfer station. RIght down the street from the hotel is a strip of food stores- cheese store, wine store, butcher, fish store, bakeries.... literally anything you could need. We went to Maison Kaiser a lot for croissants, baguettes and sandwiches. Very good bakery. Most days there was a nice little market that opened up right there as well. Really great to walk through. If you walk straight up Rue des Bernardins you'll end up at the Seine within a few minutes, and the street turns right into a bridge to Ile de la Cite so it is really a great block to be on. We ate dinner every night in the area- 3 great ones in walking distance, Les Bouquinistes, Le Petit Pontoise, and Le Coupe Chou. We also ate a couple nights in a very touristy area off Rue St. Jacques by Notre Dame... both meals were horrible (in one you'd hear the microwave beeping every couple minutes when people's meals were done!). We should have known. But those other 3 restaurants were truly amazing.Overall, I was pleased with this hotel because it met my needs (which were, admittedly, somewhat basic, but I think similar to what most people look for in a Paris hotel). I wouldn't necessarily go there on my honeymoon, but for a trip where you'll barely be in the room it was a nice place to end the day. We liked that it was very close to the center of things but still a little off on a quiet side street (besides the horrible church bells every 30 min in the morning) and we kind of felt like we were going home every night. Get a superior room and you should be pleased with the quality of the rooms.

<Content>Really liked this hotel I just returned from another visit to Paris and enjoyed my stay at the Hotel Agora. Katrine at the front desk is very helpful and all the staff members speak some or quite a bit of english if you need help. The room was not huge for a single but it was just fine for one person. Bathroom was great with lots of hot water and it was very clean also.Breakfast is also very adequate with cereal, bread, cheese, juices and coffee. No hot food but it was still good and fresh.Location is great. Near to 2 metro stops and there are great restaurants and cafes all over the place as you are very near (1 block away) from the Blvd. St. Germain.

<Content>Agora Saint Germain Stayed at the Agora Saint Germain for 3 nights in March. Great location - 5 minute walk from Notre Dame and close to lots of restaurants and bars. Nice clean rooms (altho. on the small side but that 's the way it is in Paris). Staff very friendly and helpful. Had breakfast at the Best Monge (turn left out of the hotel and left again) good continental breakfast juice, croissant, jam and coffee for 5 euros - really nice guy (Zirro). Only had good experiences in Paris - everyone was very friendly - definitely will be returning and would stay at the Agora St. Germain again.Easily accessible from the RER (just over 8 euros) from Charles de Gaule (follow instructions at airport to RER) take the blue line to Notre Dame/St Michel then about a 10 minute walk.Most people on the station speak English (we did try a little french and I think they were pleased about that!!)

<Content>Above average at the Agora My Fiance and I stayed at the Agora for 3 nights in the beginning of March 2007. We found the staff very pleasant and helpful. They recommended shops, tours, places to eat and attractions. They booked our Moulin Rouge trip and ensured that our car turned up to take us back to the airport on the last day. The elevator was a bit compact and the Hallways/Stairwells were a bit narrow. Our room faced onto the internal atrium. At frst I was disappointed that we did not have a view, but in retrospect, I am glad that we had peace and quiet away from the street. Our room had comtemporary decor and attactive furnishings, but again, it was quite small. The En Suite was fully tiled with a power shower. The room was clean and in good condition. Continental breakfast was included and was as expected. We found the location very good. St. Germain area is lovely with it's own outdoor market, an abundance of shops and places to eat. Very close to Maubert Mutualite metro station. Would stay here again if I am ever back in this lovely city.

<Content>Perfect base for Paris vacation The Agora was a lovely hotel with a clean, albeit small room and new, modern bathroom. We were there in October and didn't need either heating or air conditioning. There were lovely french doors that opened onto a small balcony for when we wanted some fresh air. The room itself, while small, had everything we needed. It was clean and had enough closet space to put away our two suitcases and hang up our clothes. The king sized bed was actually two twins pushed together and made up separately. The TV got BBC and one other English channel which was more than we needed. The bathroom was spotless but small but had a tub/shower and hairdryer. The whole room was regularly cleaned. There was a small in-room fridge which came in handy. The front desk staff was helpful with making restaurant reservations and giving directions. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel and instead opted to go to one of the many cafes in the area for our morning cafe and crossaint. The location is idea with Notre Dame a 5 minute walk away. We walked to most of the sights. The hotel is in the Latin Quarter but not the sleazy, tourist-ridden part of it. There was still an authentic Paris neighborhood feel to the area and we loved it! There is a Metro stop right around the corner but we more often used the RER Metro stop (C line, I think?) a 5 minute walk away which seemed to have better connections/direct stops. Ask for a room tha overlooks the street and the quaint church across the street; however, be aware that the church bell tolls regularly and loudly. But we loved it and can't wait to go back!

<Content>Great hotel and location Excellent location - easy walk to the river with spectacular views of Notre Dame at night. Very convenient to Metro and bus stops or a pleasant walk to Cite.Room was very comfortable, bathroom spotless. Staff very friendly and helpful. All spoke very good English. Pleasant breakfast room.Wonderful bakery and market just around the corner. The Fromagiere will vacuum pack your cheese for easy passage through Customs.We were on top floor on street - nice view with little balcony. Only complaint was room got a little warm and we opened balcony door to cool, but a lot of traffic noise until 1 or 2 am.

<Content>Very good value for money Stayed there with my family (4 persons in the end of October 2006) for two nightsLocation is very good, next to the local Metro station. Rooms and bathrooms are renovated and clean, the former though are quite small. Breakfast choice is rather dull, much better try the boulangerie round the corner, with freshly made French delicacies and excellent coffee. Staff is friendly by French standards.Overall very good value for money, considering also the time one spends in the hotel while in Paris!

<Content>Ideally placed  The Agora St Germain is ideally situated for a weekend break in Paris being only a short stroll away from Notre Dame. This was our third trip to Paris on the trot and we were looking to visit on a reasonably tight budget without going too down market. Although the Hotel and rooms were smaller than previously experienced, they were found to be very clean and comfortable. The hotel staff were all warm and friendly from the reception, maids and restaurant. The locality has everything on the doorstep from cash machines, bars, restaurants, cafes and tourist attractions to suit everyones pocket. If you want 4* plus luxury then the Agora St Germain is not for you. If you want value for money and a clean, friendly well located base then it definitely is.Martin  Caroline BoothWest Yorkshire

<Content>Very clean and well furnished We had a twin bedded room on the 5th floor with a small balcony (Room 57) which overlooked the street. It was surpisingly quiet except when the church bells rang at 7.30 or 8.00 am. The room was small but well furnished. My partner thought the bathroom was superb. We used the breakfast room only once which was also attractively furnished. The breakfast costs 10 euro and there is a limited but adequate choice. There are plenty of places to eat nearby. For breakfast Kaysers is good althought a bit expensive.For evening meals if you turn right after you leave the hotel and turn right along the next street there is a variety of restautrants. The hotel is a few minutes walk from the Maubert Mutialite metro station and is convenient for Notre Dame. We did have a bit of difficulty working out where we were when we arrived at the metro station in the dark and the way to the hotel. I suggest you ask the hotel for directions.

<Content>Ideal 3-star, great location Booked an air  hotel package thru Expedia during one of their sales. I wasn't sure what to expect, but this hotel completely met our needs - clean, safe, and centrally located. The staff was always very pleasant although we didn't really ask them for much. The room was small, but all hotel rooms in Paris are small. Bed was comfortable, room was spotless and the bathrooms were nice. We were in room 24 which overlooked the courtyard. It was very quiet at night - not sure if that goes for all rooms or just ones facing the courtyard though? We had croissants and coffee every morning at Eric Kayser - cheap and easy. All in all, a great stay.

<Content>Very pleasant hotel We spent 5 nights at Hotel Agora Saint Germain in Paris in mid-November, 2006. The hotel is not fancy, but very clean, quiet and in a great location. It is a short walk to the Seine and Notre Dame. There are lots of good and not outrageously expensive restaurants within walking distance. The staff speaks English well and were very helpful with all our questions. We would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to be in this part of Paris.

<Content>Solid hotel Spent five nights here with my wife in October. Overall it was fine. Encountered only minor frustrations - for example, the hotel advertised that they run a shuttle for 18 Euros per person to CDG airport but claimed there weren't enough people to justify the shuttle when we asked for it the night before our departure. They called a taxi instead and promised a rate of 40-50 Euros, although the taxi charged us over 60 Euros. C'est la vie, I guess.Stayed in two different rooms - one with balcony, one facing into interior courtyard. Preferred the balcony room. Both rooms had very nice washrooms. The hotel was quiet. Breakfast was nice, but you could probably put the Euros to better use elsewhere. Perfect if you want to be in the lively Latin quarter.

<Content>super friendly staff Hotel Agora St germain is extremely well located,near Notre Dame,in a quiet side st,close to the Pantheon. The staff is very friendly and helpful. If you do not want their breakfast the little boulangerie right around the corner offers a wonderful breakfast, coffee,juice and yogurt. Try to get a room with a window on the inside courtyard, you won't hear a sound. The hotel is listed as a 3* but really should be a 2*, the rooms are very small but the bathrooms are new and very cleaned. ATM unit right across the street, very close to a metro stop.We probably would stay there again or in the same vicinityFrom Boston,Massachusetts

<Content>Fabulous! We had such a fantastic 3 nights in the Agora Saint germain.Being only a 2 minute walk from Notre Dame, the location was fantastic. There was a lovely cafe around the corner that did breakfast for a reasonable price, around 15 euros for 4 croissants and 2 Orange Juices.The hotel was clean, with friendly staff working at the reception.I must admit, we laughed when we saw the lift, it is quite small.The rooms looked as if they had been recently renovated with a very 'funky' 21st century style bathroom.If we went back to Paris, I would definately book to stay here again! Dont hesitate to contact me if you want any further information!

<Content>A Hidden Gem Although seasoned visitors to France, it was our first time in Paris.Booking the hotel though Eurostar, it was, consequently, pot luck. . . . but we needn't have worried.The hotel was spotlessly clean and - not knowing the ropes - we had a room ending in 5 (see previous review) . . . . but it was excellent. Admittedly, the room size - while more than adequate - was a tad on the small side, but so what? You don't go to Paris to sit in your hotel room!It had obviously recently been refurbished and was spotless - as for the bathroom, I wouldn't mind one like that myself!The lift was interesting - I almost killed my wife trying to shoehorn both of us and our luggage in - we nearly had hysteria.A typical, small, family run hotel.But the real clincher was the staff.They were friendly, courteous, helpful and spoke far better English than my plume de ma tante French.Situated in a quiet road no more than 100 metres from the Boulevard St Germain, it is superbly placed - especially near the Latin Quarter with its multitudinous bistros  restaurants.I would recommend it to anyone as superb value for money.Unfortunately for our bank account, my wife is already talking about when we go back!

<Content>Excellent We booked this hotel as a package via Eurostar and it was excellent. The staff were, without exception, pleasant and helpful. The rooms were clean and the bathrooms wonderful. The only adverse comment is, no mirror in the bedroom, even a small one for make-up would have been good.We did not have breakfast in the hotel but used the excellent cafe round the cornerThe location was just right for all we wanted to do.We will definatley go back and will recommend to friends .

<Content>Good value, great location We have just returned from Paris after a two-week holiday in France. We stayed at the Agora St Germain for three nights and found it reasonably priced, well-positioned, clean and sufficient for our requirements. The room was spacious enough for two people, and the bathroom was attractive and quite big for Paris. We had a room facing the courtyard, which was both private and quiet. The staff were most helpful and very friendly, and both receptionists we dealt with spoke English. The hotel is a hop, skip and jump away from the Blvd St Germain and the Seine, and is also very near Rue Mouffetard, a great area for wining and dining (try Robert's Le Pot a Feu restaurant for great food and great value -- 14.90 euros for a three-course menu!). All in all a very positive experience.

<Content>Great location! The hotel is lovely, clean, and tastefully decorated, but the best part is its location -- a short walk to Notre Dame and all the restaurants and bars of the Latin Quarter. Avoid breakfast -- definitely not worth the fee.

<Content>What a great hotel! Agora St. Germaine was refered by a relative as a wonderful place to stay and visit Paris. After staying there myself, I felt compelled to write a review. The hotel is very clean and neat, well air conditioned and in a great location. You are a short walk from Notre Dame, the Pantheon, the Louvre, and numerous metro stops. There is excellent food in the Latin Quarter, which is much more fun than the areas that seem geared to tourists. We were even able to find a Starbucks nearby - how lame!There is a bakery just around the corner from the hotel that makes THE BEST CROISSANTS EVER - no contest! You can get an espresso and a croissant for under 2 euro and start your morning off right. That being said, there is no reason to eat the breakfast at the hotel, although they do offer one.Overall, it was a great place to stay. It was far more attractive than any of the hotels near the Eiffel Tower (which cost more) because there is little else in that area except the Eiffel Tower. I would not consider staying anywhere else in Paris.

<Content>a great 3 star my husband and i stayed at agora st. germain for 6 nights (8/2-8/7) for our honeymoon. i did extensive research before i chose a hotel and i was satisifed with this one and would return again. i was apprehensive at first about this place because my husband stayed at a 5 star and a 4 star in london for the first leg of our honeymoon, and i was afraid that after staying at such nice places i would be disappointed with a 3 star. however, i was pleasantly surprised! yes, the elevator is tiny and the rooms are small, but there are a lot of great points: the bathrooms are really clean and modern, and the bed was sufficient for my husband and i (he's 6 ft. 180 lbs). we had a good view of the street outside our hotel, and my only complaint is that there was construction going on (as there is in a lot of paris) so the noise level was pretty annoying in the mornings. you should call/email them ahead of time to request a room with a view and balcony. we got the view but weren't able to get a room with a balcony. we made our reservations through the hotel website and got an awesome deal.the desk staff was friendly enough but they weren't too helpful with questions about tourist attractions, etc... but then again, they weren't a concierge desk.my husband and i went to a little place to pick up croissants every morning called les delices du forneil (i'm sure i butchered the spelling). they were friendly and their croissants are heavenly. there's a closer place to the hotel called eric kayser that just moved 2 doors down from its previous location and their croissants and pain chocolat look incredible, but they're not so good. but maybe i caught them on bad days. their desserts, however (esp the one with raspberries on top) are amazing. if you get a chance, hit up a gyro stand. they top the gyro with french fries and it's so good. and at 4 euros, it's the cheapest meal you'll ever get in paris.as far as location, the maubert metro stop is really close by. i loved being so close to notre dame and we would often picnic there while gazing at the flying buttresses. the luxembourg gardens are also beautiful for a picnic. i really liked the location of this hotel because it's not too touristy (like the hotels on champs elysee) but it's still close enough to the main attractions. btw, check out saint chapelle. AMAZING.my advice for first-timers: go on the fat bike tour in the evening. it's operated by americans and you get to bike through the city, take a boat ride on the seine, and just have a blast. my husband and i went on the bike tour the day we arrived in paris and i would say that my favorite memory of our trip is riding my bike through the courtyard of the louvre at sunset, seeing the larger-than-life pyramids for the first time with my husband. wow.all in all, the agora st. germain was a great 3 star hotel and we would definitely return.

<Content>Good Paris Hotel I think this would be a pretty typical 3 star hotel in Paris but you might find one for the same price that is not as far east as this - The Agora St Germain was about 500m from Notre Damn metro stop, there are 2 others stops closer but Notre Damn is on more lines so we felt like we walked alot to get to and from the hotel from here, the walk along the river is lovely but we were usually exhausted from a full day and just wanted to get off the metro and be home!! I would definately stay on the left bank again but would look for a hotel slightly more central.The rooms are very small but modern - the smallest rooms we encountered on our 4 week trip through Europe. You really wouldn't want to spend much more time in your room than sleeping  changing. The bathrooms although tiny are very modern and clean.The patisserie around the corner is fanastic for breakfast (Eric Kayser). The hotel stored our bags while we went to Loire Valley for 2 nights which was very convenient and it looked like our bags hadn't been touched at all while we were away. Our air conditioning didn't work for 2 nights and it was very very hot, we asked for a discount becuase we had double checked that the hotel had air con' before we confirmed our stay but the manager wasn't on and we have since emailed and they will not offer us any credit - except one free night next time in Paris - we are in NZ which is 24 hours flight from Paris so I dont know when we will be back!! We didn't find the staff overly helpful when we asked questions about tourist attractions but they were friendly enough. We didn't experience any of the French rudeness that we had heard about, we had a phrase book and always tried our best in french and most people would reply in english laughing at us!! Plus the beds are not full sized doubles my husbands feet were over the edge (he is 6foot1) and we were very squashed and are not really big people!!

<Content>c'est manifique!! Have just returned to England from a sweltering Paris absolutley thrilled with the Agora. Very modern, almost boutique style lobby and room and fantastic bathroom ( room 47) Air conditioning was excellent and much appreciated!Couldn't be better situated; one of the best patisseries in Paris around the corner ( Eric Kayser) also try their violet ice cream but maybe not for breakfast!, a little supermarket open selling ice and bottled water, very handy in the 99 degrees! Quickest way to the river is left out of the hotel and straight down Rue Bernadins , about 3 minutes. The lovely cheese shop on the square near to the hotel vacum packs cheese to bring home and 4 lots just about fit into our room refridgerater. On the last day, we couldn't handle dragging our cases through the streets and couldn't get the airport shuttle from the hotel as you have to book in advance. However, we hailed a cab from outside the hotel taking us straight to Charles d Gaulle and it cost only 2 euros more than the shuttle!All in all a fantastic stay, yet again tripadvisor gets it right and I will recommend this hotel to anyone!

<Content>Clearn and affordable hotel in a great location! My wife and I stayed at this hotel for 6-nights. We had a room on the 6th floor. Details of our room:- Modern looking room - Double-bed. A little hard but comfortable enough (you'll do enough walking in Paris that you'll sleep fine at night)- Room size was small as expected, but they did a great job utilizing the limited space with shelves, closets, etc.- Rooms were very clean.- A/C was a portable unit, which required a hose to be stuck out the window. This meant the window had to be propped open. I was a little concerned that noise would be an issue, but it wasn't at all.- Bring a electric converter (if from the U.S.). If you forget, you can get one at BHv, like we did.- Small flat screen TV, which has the alarm clock built-inDetails of our stay:- The staff was extremely friendly, but unfortunately were not overly helpful. We had asked about places to eat, where to get the Paris Museum Pass, and which metro stop to get off when going back to the airport. None of those questions could be answered (perhaps we just happened to ask the wrong staff member).- You leave your room key at the desk every time you exit and just ask for it when you come back. Convenient not to have to carry it with you during the day.- We arrived early in Paris, but unfortunately weren't able to check-in until 2pm. Hotel let us store our luggage until check-in, so it was fine.- Yes, the elevator is small, and it took about 2 seconds to get over that fact.Location- Great location! There's a wonderful bakery around the corner if you take a left out of the hotel, then a left at the first street (Rue Monge). The pain-au-chocolat was our favorite! Also, you're in walking distance to Notre Dame, Saint Chapelle, Ile St. Louis (eat ice cream here!), and Hotel de Ville (has shopping nearby). There are also a ton of restaurants and cafes open late on the way to Hotel de Ville. Also, close to the Maubert-Mutualite metro stop.- The brasseries nearby on St. Germain right off of Rue Monge are only so-so. If you want great crepes, you need to continue north on Rue Monge (towards the river), which will turn into Rue LaGrange. There's a wonderful crepe place across the street from the Chinese Restaurant, with a friendly staff (and they speak English).OverallWe would definitely stay here again. The location is great, the staff is friendly, rooms are clean, and the price is affordable. I can definitely see how this is a 3-star hotel, however, I think it ranks above most 3-star hotels.

<Content>Love room 58 Lodged at the Agora Ste Germaine from 6/29-7/2, second stop on our Honeymoon. First assigned room 45 and requested and received room 58 with balcony and view for next two evenings, Rooms ending in 7 or 8 have nice view of church accross street and higher up you can see towers of Notre Dame. Request not to be assigned room ending in 5, only view is other side of building. Location is just wonderful, Place de St.Michel is about five minute walk as is Notre Dame. Rooms are small but typical of Paris, rooms are spotless and bathrooms bright and just updated.Fantastic Cigar shop at 3 rue Lagrange, stopped by to pick out a nightly Habana each night. Found the front desk to be very helpful, especially Guillume. Take a walk down the Rue Des Ecoles and sample some of the outdoor cafe's away from Ste Germaine crowds.Walk up the hill and visit the Pantheon in the morning and have your choice of pastry shops to sample coming back. Nice outdoor market by Maubert Metro on Saturdays.Take a taxi from train station to hotel 18 euros and have the front desk reserve a shuttle back to CDG for 18 euros per person. Would return to property.

<Content>A lovely little hotel Hotel Agora St-Germain is a lovely, little three-star hotel in the Latin Quarter. The closest metro is Maubert-Mutualitie. The lobby is vaguely art deco and the room, though small, was comfortable. As is typical in Paris, there are tall windows. Ours faced the street and a typically Parisian street scene: church, flowers, trees, rooftops. Breakfast was a little expensive--10 euros--but fresh and delicious. We had it brought to the room and ate with the windows pushed open and the sun streaming in.The staff, especially a woman named Aline, was very helpful and knowledgeable. Although it's a little far east, it's only a few blocks from Notre Dame and the river. We booked online in advance and felt we had gotten a good deal. I will definitely return.

<Content>Great Location and Helpful Staff My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights earlier this month. The very best thing about the hotel is the location and the second best thing is that the air-conditioning in the rooms works quite well. (Having stayed in European hotels where this is not the case I was very grateful for this - it was very hot when we were in Paris.) I would also be remiss if I did not mention the helpfulness of the front desk staff - especially Aline. She gave us great info about the immediate and went to great effort to help us find whatever we needed! On the down side, the rooms are small and a bit shabby - but quite clean. The elevators are TINY and the hall is narrow. If you anticipate spending much time in your room you might want something larger. The TV was fine - I did not anticipate English-speaking channels and we had fun trying to follow the storyline with our very limited French. We would certainly stay here again.

<Content>Loved the Agora St. Germain! I stayed at the Agora St. Germain by myself for my first trip to Paris from May 10-16. This hotel was the perfect choice for a good 3 star hotel. Simple but with everything you need. All of the staff were extremely helpful and pleasant, especially Aline. And the location could not be more perfect. It's located on a small street just around the corner from St. Germain Blvd. The Maubert Mutualite Metro stop is just around the corner, as well as a taxi pick-up. It took me probably 3 minutes to walk to Notre Dame (San Francisco fast walk) where you can catch the Batobus. It's a great central location for exploring Paris. I walked just about everywhere or took the Batobus.There is a small market just around the corner 4-5 days a week where you can buy fish, cheese, spices and plenty of jewelry and clothes. The are tons of cafes nearby and it's an easy walk down St. Germain Blvd. for even more.I fell completely in love with Paris and booked another trip for this year just 3 days after I returned home. And I was so pleased with the Agora that I am staying there again. This isn't luxury, but a perfectly comfortable place to lay my head and call home base.

<Content>Perfect hotel! So glad we chose it!!! We just returned yesterday from a one week stay in Paris to celebrate our 25th anniversary. I had spent 2 weeks reasearching hotel reviews as I wanted something special, but couldn't afford the likes of the Ritz Carlton. And we couldn't have been happier with the Agora! It was super clean, fresh soft sheets, newly remodeled bathroom, (very modern) We got a room (#49) with a view of the beautiful old St. Nicholas du Chardonnet church across the street. The room was sound proofed and very quiet. And we just loved hearing the gentle peal of the church bells in the morning. It was so charming!!! The staff was terrific (especially Elaine) and there's air conditioning in the room to keep you comfortable, along with a flat screen plasma t.v. and built in blow dryer (which was great not to have to bring our own and try to find electrical adapters to use over there.) The elevator is tiny as others stated. But so what! You are always free to take the stairs next to the elevator. That's what we did going down. Taking it when going up to our room, and wasn't a problem to have to stand close to each other for 60 seconds. The hotel lobby was nicely appointed, and comfortable, with a morning paper in English to catch up on world news.  The breakfast room downstairs was very nice, and yeah, 10 euros apiece seemed a bit high for the breakfast, but we did eat there twice in the week, and it was kind of nice having as much coffee as we needed without having to pay 5 euro for one cup elsewhere. There's fresh baked croissants, Pain au chocolate (chocolate croissant), baguette, cheeses, butter, jam, cereal, juice, tea, coffee, yogurt. And the french yogurt is REALLY good. Different than we get in the U.S. Much creamier! So while you can certainly go to a local pastry shop or cafe for breakfast, there's times when it's pretty convenient to just go downstairs and enjoy your fill of coffee, and plan your day out in the peace of the breakfast room, rather than on the busy sidewalk. You've got room to open your metro and city maps on the table.  The location is PERFECT! You've got an ATM machine just outside the hotel, a 5min. walk to Notre Dame Cathedral, 5 min. walk to shops, metro station, farmer's market, restaurants, etc. A note to anyone who's never been to Paris: buy a one week pass for the metro, and at the same window, also buy the one week museum pass. A MUST!!! this way you don't have to wait in the long lines at the Lovre, (over 2 hrs wait otherwise) or Musee d'ORsay, or Palace at Versailles. You can just go to the front gate for reserved tickets. Well worth the money spent. You can get all over the place with the metro, it has good connections. And the pass also allows you to use the trains or buses within a certain region. If you do go outside your area, then you'll just have to pay a couple euros extra to exit the station. No big deal. I'd recommend this Agora St. Germaine to anyone, and wished I hadn't wasted so much time looking at all the other hotels. I'd go back in a heartbeat, if we ever go again!

<Content>Perfect location We've just returned from 4 nights at this hotel and can thoroughly recommend it. The surrounding area is delightful - clean and safe, quiet at night and with a great bakery/patisserie a few steps away for breakfast. A very short walk leads to the river, the Batobus stop, and the most stunning view of Notre Dame. An equally short walk in another direction will take you to the fascinating Latin Quarter, Cluny Museum, Luxembourg Gardens, etc. I have mobility problems, and I can't imagine a better location, as there was so much of charm and interest nearby.As others have said, the lift is small, and so was our bathroom, but everything was beautifully clean, and our 6th-floor room had a juliet balcony and french windows looking onto the street. The staff were very friendly and helpful, and we enjoyed our stay enormously.

<Content>Good location This hotel is in a wonderful location as detailed in previous reviews. It is a small hotel with small rooms and bathrooms and an extremely small lift - be warned! This lift held two reasonably slim people with small weekend bags - I can't imagine what it would be like for two large people with full sized suitcases, I think probably you would have to go in shifts. Also might be a problem with someone with a lift phobia or claustrophobia. Thankfully we didn't have that. The rooms were small, clean and the refurbished bathrooms were lovely but again very small. Your early morning wake-up call is the local church whose bells starting ringing at around 7.00 a.m. The breakfast room was nicely decorated but the breakfast was definitely not worth 10 Euros as evidenced by the relatively few people who were eating there on our first morning. The other two mornings we spent around the corner in the bakery which was really good. The staff were very pleasant and helpful and we really enjoyed our stay. However, I have stayed in 3* hotels in Paris on three other occasions and this hotel did not quite match up to the standard of the others.

<Content>cestboncestbon completed a 6 night stay in Paris at the Agora St Germain (March 23-29)and found the hotel met all expectations and then some....getting the nits picked first...the hotel lobby was being renovated and was unusable for anything other than collecting your room key (you had to turn it in when you left)and the hotel stored material in the narrow hall (we had rooms 4  5) this was some remedied by the time we left and the lobby was pleasently comfy for a small group to meet in. The staff was tremendous. Period. They went above the call and helped one of our party confirm airline connections and aquired a taxi during a general strike day....and everybody appeared on cue!..always pleasant and helpful for eating recommendations and help avoiding the protestations...the location is wonderful for jumping off into old Paris being two blocks from Notre Dame and Ile de St. Louis and Blvd St Germain a main street for bus connections and good restaurants. We had a double (5) and a triple (4) that were very comfy though for the same price I would reequest the triple..(double bed and a single). Each room had a small refrigerator and a simple closet for clothes and room for a suitcase under...two simple chairs..a very nicely appointed and apparently newly remodeled bathroom...large by European standards. We had some difficulty regulating the heat in the rooms.(too warm) and we had rooms that looked across an interior courtyard into the lobby....had to make sure the drapes were closed getting dressed... there was no problem with noise that doesn't occur in any hotel. Around the corner was a small neighborhood outdoor market that occurs on tues/thurs/sat that had a little of everything. At the same place was a cheese shop, mini grocery, pharmacy, bakery, and small cafe for your pleasure. ATM's and bank branches are very convenient. I would recommend this hotel and will stay there again.

<Content>Cosy, Comfy, perfect location !! We have just returned from our 3 night stay at this hotel. It more than fulfilled our expectations for a 3 star hotel in a perfect location. Check in was swift and pleasant, and the room was so cosy and we were on the top floor. The bathroom was lovely, and this like many other Paris rooms was small but that just added to our overall experience. We would return to this hotel in a heart beat. The breakfast was included in our nightly rate, but at 10 euros each I doubt we would have paid this amount for it had it not been included. The staff at the hotel were very friendly and always helpful with any questions we had.As a previous reviewer said  a safe bet  A great hotel :-))

<Content>Ok but slightly disappointing We enjoyed our stay here overall, but going by the previous reviews were hoping for something a little better. The reception area was undergoing total renovation at the time which didn't help (disruption, noise etc) but even allowing for that, the hotel had a slightly sad air to it - somewhat cramped and dull. The basement breakfast room was however very pleasant (but 10 euros seemed a little steep) and the staff and service overall couldn't be faulted. Our bathrooms seemed to be brand new so no problem there, and the location was first rate. I think it may be just that 3* hotels in Paris are a bit hit and miss and it depends on your expectations. Having said all that, we would stay in this hotel again.

<Content>Tout Good What a nice place! Staff, room, and service are all great. First time in Paris, we wanted to be on the outer edge of the Latin Quarter, this was a great location. Pretty area; we came out of the metro and into the open air market for added culture shock. The rooms were clean and pleasant, quiet and comfortable.Bathroom was quite nice, the room had a window. There was AC we didn't use. We were in a Double room which seemed plenty big for us. Walls not totally soundproof, but it was quiet. The front desk staff was very helpful and spoke excellent English, open 24 hours. Reservation worked with emailed inquiry then faxed cc #, also they are on laterooms, etc. Highly recommend the off-season! It was cheap and the mood in Paris seemed quite cheerful, with a hint of holiday spirit in the air. The bakeries all had special gallettes to celebrate Epiphany. We had a light dust of snow the first night. Near dawn (jet lag helps sometimes) the first day we were at Erik Kayser around the corner, fresh warm bread kept us warm while we walked to the Louvre. Got there 15 minutes before open and no line. At night, there were people on the street, and we had some fine meals with great Parisian atmosphere: La Boussole, Le Volant, Le Reminet. A city-wide sale on clothes started January 11th or so.

<Content>Great location, friendly staff, lovely rooms This hotel was an ideal choice for the budget-minded traveler, though we truly didn鈥檛 feel as though we were staying in a 鈥渂udget鈥?hotel. The location, just a block from St. Germain, with interesting shopping options and a plethora of cafes, and 5 minutes from Notre Dame, made it the perfect jumping off point for touring Paris for us, first-time visitors to this city.The bedding was comfortable, the temperature controls were excellent, and rooms were tidy and well-maintained during our stay. The bathroom was impeccable and an unexpected surprise 鈥?very modern in such an older-style building. Would suggest the breakfast if you are in a hurry, or don鈥檛 feel like venturing along St. Germain for another option. While the food was good and the coffee was delicious and piping-hot (and since you pay anyway), there are so many other options offered just blocks away 鈥?and you aren鈥檛 stuck in a basement without the activity of Paris 鈥渃af茅-life鈥?Two experiences that will ensure our return to this charming hotel I鈥檇 like to share with my fellow travelers:-We were here on Christmas morning, which was our first morning in Paris and we were admittedly a bit starry-eyed with awe and anxious excitement. Just wanted to grab a cup of coffee from the breakfast room, and when I ran downstairs to inquire, the wonderful woman watching over the area offered a tray, a large pot and all accoutrements. It was a lovely gesture, and very appreciated. [Perhaps I am mistaken, and I somehow missed that they offer room-service, but I don鈥檛 believe this was an option and I so appreciated her making me feel like I was treating my mom like a queen on Christmas morning!]-Realizing we still had some postcards from our previous journey in London, and that they were already bearing UK stamps (not friendly to French post, or so I was told) 鈥?the front office staff took personal interest and offered to help find another guest traveling to or through England to mail them. Much to my surprise and delight, all 6 of the postcards have already reached their intended recipients!Would highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Perfect for a single woman I stayed at the Agora in July, after being moved from their sister hotel (I arrived to find I had been moved, so I never stayed at the other). No problem, and they were very polite and courteous about the switch and greeted me by name. I had a single room, which was small but just right for me (I am small!) and it had everything I needed. It was quiet and cozy with a comfy bed. The A/C leaked water, but I really didn't need to use it. I found the room very clean and the area incredibly convenient. I was traveling alone (I am a youngish single woman) and found the staff to be very helpful and they always recognized me as I came and went, which put me at ease. I really enjoyed the breakfast room every day, and by the end of my stay the Agora felt like home. Also, I was there during the London subway bombings and had to extend my stay as I could not travel to London, my next stop, for a couple of days. They were very accommodating, and extending literally at the last minute was no problem at all. Also, my rates were excellent. I have traveled to Paris a number of times, and I will stay at the Agora, no question, on my next visit.

<Content>The Most Friendly Hotel in Paris After staying several nights at Hotel Agora, I can say without hesitation, I was home The comfort of the rooms to the outstanding staff especially at the front desk made my Parisian experience come to life!Especially sincere, helpful and knowledgeable, the young woman at the front desk helped guide me to the best restaurants, easiest routes to museums and gave me the sense, I was her primary customer.I always recommend the Agora to my friends who are travelling to Paris.Without a doubt, the location, staff and comfort rate 5 stars for a 3 star price.

<Content>Good clean hotel not very responsive with email confirmations My husband and I just returned from stay in Europe (London/Paris). We stayed at this hotal Nov 21-26, 2005. We booked this hotel through American Express Travel, the same as with our London Hotel. Before leaving for our trip, I decided to contact the hotel via email to confirm our room reservations for both hotels. The hotel in London, had a toll free number so I called and confirmed my reservation. The Hotel Agora St. Germain did not so I decided to email the hotel directly. Well, needless to say, I did not receive a reply back before leaving. I was a little concerned but since the hotel in London saw my reservation made through Amex, my husband just said don't worry about it and we went off on our trip. When we arrived at the hotel and en route to the hotel on the chunnel I was thinking about the reservation. Well, guess what.... they didn't have our reservation. Not their fault, in all fairness, it was travelocity whom sold the rooms to Amex... Amex thought everything was confirmed and passed the information to us. So, we felt confident about the choice but we were wrong. The woman at the checkin counter gave us a room anyway but said she wasn't sure if we could stay there the entire trip.... and we would have to take care of it with American Express. Lucky for me I had taken my cell phone and was able to contact American Express. Althought the call cost me .99 cents a minute, it was well worth it since they faxed over the confirmation and called the hotel directly to confirm receipt. This was taken care of within the hour of our arrival. However, starting out like this didn't really leave a good feeling... especially since the lady kept telling us that now she has a problem with people checking in on the 24th Nov. and seemed very frustrated that this happened on her watch. That didn't make things better... to be honest it added to my frustration. My husband had to calm me down of course and reason with me not to lose my temper since it was not really her fault. However, I did email them directly and at a minimum would have expected an reply email with .. we don't have a reservation for you... etc. I mean they did have a PC with internet access at the front desk. My husband did notice there was a fax on the floor. It is very possible that their carelessness could have caused this confusion and inconvenience. As for the room.... we stayed in room 69. The room was facing the street on 6th floor with a little balcony.. too little to step out but could open window/door and peek out. Heard very little noise. The bathroom was very clean when we arrived and the daily maintenance of same was pretty good. The bed was comfortable. They have a desk with a chair and a small ottoman. Heating in the room was fantastic. lighting was proper. The closet could have been in a different location.. Although the closet was big enough for Paris standards, to get to it and access clothing was a bit tight since it was right next to one of the nightstands... The luggage was easily stored under the closet... unless of course you have monster luggage. We like to travel light so our standard carry-ons fit fine. The room had a very delightful and clean aroma after it was cleaned daily. Oh... and great hot water and water pressure.What I didn't like was that they didn't provide you with shampoo soap and conditioner as separate items. They had a dispenser by the sink and in the shower stall with their so-called combination soap/shampoo/conditioner which really stunk if you asked me. We used it as soap since we had brought our own shampoo. No shower cap, no sewing kit, no other perks except for lotion. They have a mini fridge in the room with refreshments and a beer bottle opener and they do have corkscrews at the front desk you can borrow if you buy some wine.The rest of the staff was very friendly and helpful.All in all is what we expected.... small, clean, tastefully decorated room. My husband just fell in love with the bathroom so I'll give them kudos for that. If it wasn't for that reservation snafu and the front desk person's indifference maybe our rating would have been better.Remember, confirm your reservation by phone with hotel directly. Faxes may end up on the floor below one of their counters/furniture. Oh and don't bother with the Breafast... There are plenty places you can buy a coffee and a croisant for under 4 Euros nearby or do as the parisians do... get a crepe to go... Cheers..and buon voyage

<Content>Great stay at the Agora St. Germain I stayed here, when I was in town for business. I鈥檝e been to Paris often, but this is one of the better hotels for a reasonable price. We arrived late at night, but there was a night watch at the reception, which let us in without any problems. The rooms were small, like in every hotel in Paris, but they weren鈥檛 too small. The interior was fine, the beds were excellent. More importantly the rooms were clean and were cleaned every day. With fresh towels and new sheets. The bathroom was fine as well, with a good warm, powerful shower in it. Breakfast was excellent, typically French breakfast with fresh bread and cheese.The location of the hotel is excellent, right in the center of the Latin Quarter, with many nice restaurants and caf茅s nearby. Also the subway is right around the corner, as is the Notre Dame.I would definitely come back to this hotel, either for business or with my girlfriend for a nice weekend in Paris. I can recommend it.

<Content>Charmed by the Agora! We just spent a fabulous six-night honeymoon in Paris at the Agora St. Germain Hotel in Paris! Only three blocks from the Maubert-Municipalite Metro and Notre Dame, this charming hotel made the stay perfect. The staff, particularly Eric, was friendly and helpful, the breakfasts were great, and our room was kept clean every day. We had a large (for Paris), modern bathroom and even thin-screen, wall-mounted TV that allowed for more space. There are many Bistros and Brasseries just around the corner that serve excellent meals, and one can stop at one of the several patisseries for sandwiches, breads, and desserts any time of the day--there's even a small grocery nearby. I've been to Paris twice before, both times in Montmartre, but from now on will only stay at the Agora. We even walked to the Eiffel Tower on the first day, as the weather was perfect the entire week. Our tip: take the dinner cruise on the Bateaux Parisienne, and on another night, see the show at the Moulin Rouge. The Lido was only OK. Take the airport shuttle to and from DeGaulle Airport (18 euros)--the RER-to-Metro and hike to the hotel is tiring!!! We booked through Expedia 2 months in advance after reading the reviews in Tripadvisor.

<Content>Great little spot to stay I was worried about going to a 3 star hotel in Paris, expecting tiny rooms that you wouldn't be able to 'swing a cat in' and possibly a bit grotty. However, I think we had a deluxe room, as it was a decent size, clean and seemed to have a newly renovated en-suite (bath with a shower). The breakfast would be expensive (12 Euro) though if it hadn't been included, so if it's not included just go around the corner to what looked like an amazingly popular patisserie. While we were there someone had complained about a room (I don't know why), they were moved to another room and got a night free. It is close to a number of Metro stops, the lively eating area of Saint Michael, the farmers market nearby which is amazing and to view the queue to the bakery on a Sunday morning is unique. The staff were friendly and it was a great spot to stay in and we would go back.

<Content>A+ Hotel Stay We rate this hotel a 4+: a useful Metro line, two convenience stores, a farmer's market, and two bakeries are within 1-2 blocks. The hotel was pristinely clean and the service friendly and helpful. The church bells across the street are charming, but reconsider staying here if you are a late riser--they ring for Mass at 7: 40 and then every hour after that. The street noise was also a bit loud on some days, but just a smidge noisier than other neighboorhood hotels we've stayed at in Paris. We did not get the 12e breakfast in our package, but would consider this on a future stay as coffee, tea, etc. outside the hotel is routinely 5e; add a crossaint and tip and you may as well have spent the 12e for a full and hearty breakfast. This hotel does include a refrigerator, which really is a plus. Stock up at the 8 Huit around the corner (I recommend the myrtille yogurt). Have a wonderful time in the most beautiful city in the world.

<Content>Shabby My husband and I just returned from Paris with our daughter and her husband. We booked this hotel (two rooms, 4 nights) based upon the positive reviews on this website. When we arrived we were so disapointed by the appearance of this hotel. It was shabby and bordered dirty. There was a bad smell in the rooms and we simply could not stay there. We lost over $300 since we had booked in advance, but it was worth it to go to a nicer hotel. Perhaps this hotel has other nicer rooms since apparently there were many people happy with their stay here, but our rooms were not acceptable.

<Content>What a location! - What service! The Agora St. Germaine was a great value. Located justa block off of the Bvd. St. Germaine, and within blocks of the Pantheon and Notre Dame. Just about any service you could need is right around the corner, including a laundromat just 1 block away. The staff was friendly, breakfast downstairs was nicely done, and the room was thoroughly cleaned every day. We had a great neighborhood view, including an interesting old cathedral across the street. Nice bathroom, as well. I wuold definitely stay here again.

<Content>Would stay here again Just got back from a week in Paris and was very pleased with this hotel. The room was small with 2 single beds pushed up together but separate bedding. It was clean, towels and bedding changed everyday, and I guess it had been renovated recently. The bathroom had been completely redone and all the fittings seemed brand new. The shower worked very well indeed (just the job after a hard day's sightseeing). There was even an LCD tv on the wall and there was also air con, though it didn't work brilliantly (poss because it was very hot when we stayed there and I think everybody had theirs on full blast too). That's the only criticism really. Breakfast in the basement consisted of croissants, cereal, coffee etc but would also like to mention the patisserie round the corner which turned out more expensive than the hotel breakfast but is well worth at least one visit so you can eat like the Parisiens do. Receptionists were always very helpful, spoke good english, and organised a shuttle for us to CDG for total 36 euros for two of us (not bad considering we had to go at 5am!). But I think it does help if you make the effort to speak a bit of french. Nearest Metro (Maubert Mutualitie) only 5 mins walk away and restaurants? Well take your pick. Recommend the Beouf Bourgignon at Chez Rene on Boulevard St Germain. Unbelievable !!

<Content>updated bathrooms give it superior rate Third time to Paris, first time on the Left Bank. Stayed at the Agora for 7 nights in a 'superior double/twin room'. What makes it a 'superior' room is the newly renovated, modern bathroom. Great shower! The decor is no different than the standard rooms, nor is the size and you don't get 2 chairs. The linens are standard but the carpeting could certainly use a steam clean. Very small twin beds so if you are a tall person, be prepared for your feet to hang out (I'm 5'3). Oh, and the beds are put right together but with separate bedding. The room was very small but standard for Paris - no place to put your luggage so you have to do the two-step around the beds. Only on the top floor do you get an actual balcony and they don't cost any more than lower floors. The rooms are somewhat soundproof, we didn't hear any voices, just the doors closing and the water running from toilets and showers. Although, our neighbour pounded on our door to ask that the TV be turned down - and in all fairness, the tv was probably a little loud because of the air-conditioning which worked great! My 3rd floor room faced the front of the street and was a little noisy at night with students and the neighbourhood teens partying it up. Breakfast is not elaborate and costs $12euros. There is a patiserrie around the corner that is very pleasant and you can sit in or out - it closes for the month of August!The staff is friendly and helpful, not rude and they speak english. For a special rate of $135euros, it really is okay, but if you take the chance of walking in off the street for a room it's something like $90euros at the same hotel! In the summer there is no difficulty finding a room in Paris so take your chance when you get there.The neighbourhood is okay, there is main stream shopping up the street and high end boutiques on St. Germain de Pres. The Luxembourg Gardens are within walking distance as is Notre Dame. I prefer staying on the Right Bank - it's more exciting/pleasant and closer to the main attractions and the food is way better, and the the men are better looking.

<Content>Charming Hotel The location,cleanliness,morning croissants,pastries,and coffee were superb!The staff especially Martine,Eric,and Aileen were incredibly friendly and helpful.If you don't mind a small room but appreciate a comfortable bed in a charming hotel on a quiet street in a quintessential parisian neighborhood for a modest price-the Agora St.Germain Hotel is for you!

<Content>Loved the Agora Saint Germain What a great hotel. It is small, not your American big city Hilton, but at its reasonable cost it is perfect for the modest Paris traveler. The location is perfect- we walked from it to Notre Dame in 10 minutes and either walked or took the Metro (station 5 minutes away) anywhere in Paris in 20 minutes or less. And that bakery around the corner......cafe, croissant, and hand squeezed orange juice each morning. Saint Germain is a fun street with lots of cafes, bakeries, cheese stores, and more within a few blocks. The rooms were very modest but comfortable, the bathroom clean and very functional. The front office staff was helpful (though the weekend and evening staff were not quite as familiar with the area). I have no reservations in recommending Agora Saint Germain unless you want to pay more to get more.

<Content>Better avoid My friend and I stayed at the Agora St.Germain in June and were quite disappointed. The woman who welcomed us was simply rude and unfriendly, although the rest of the staff was friendlier. Our room was small, with barely enough space to walk around the bed. Furniture was tasteless and not adequate (no single drawer, the closet was very small, only one chair). The bedspread looked like it hadn't been washed for a long while. The hotel has also larger and probably more comfortable rooms, more expensive than our standard double room (still, I don't feel that in a three-star hotel I should move up to the category superior, to get two proper chairs in a double room). The bathroom met the standards of a three-star hotel more than the rest. Still, it was very small (never been in a french three-star bathroom that didn't have a bidet); the door couldn't be locked, showering would produce a flood on the floor, and we experienced at least twice a sudden shortage of warm water, while taking shower. It was clean, but one couldn't call it spotless, as we could spot a variety of other guest' fingerprints on the door handle and towel hangers, and they were still there after one week. The location is of course very good, as other TripAdvisor users pointed out, but there are many other hotels nearby, and if you make your reservation well in advance (which we didn't do), you can have plenty of choice and definitely pick a better option.

<Content>Not so great WE stayed at the Agora hotel for 2 nights then found another hotel which was 15 euors less and much nicer. The Agora rooms were shabby and a very small bathroom and room and the AC did not work. It was a nice location and the staff was very helpful but the hotel is not worth what they charge, there are many hotels in the area much nicer. I would not stay here again.

<Content>Pleasant Stay My husband and I just spent a week there. The location was great. The staff was friendly and helpful. The room was nice. The bed was comfortable. The bathroom was beautiful. We booked through Expedia and got breakfast with the price of the room. We had a room at the front of the hotel with French windows overlooking the street with a really fun view of the neighborhood. There was a little street noise during the day, but we enjoyed it ! The nights were peaceful and quiet. Sound proofing was really good if you closed the window. Great bakery around the corner. Would stay again.

<Content>Quintessential Paris Perfectly located in the Latin Quarter near Notre Dame, Jardin des Plantes Quarter, St. Germain Quarter. Staff is friendly and helpful. Rooms are nicely decorated with above average new bathrooms. Around the corner is a marvelous bakery and just a couple blocks from a wonderful open air food market, cheese, wine, and butcher shops. Easy to get to from the airports as well as pick up transportation for getting around Paris.We loved it.

<Content>Agora Saint Germain just perfect We are a family of 4 and made our first visit to Paris in December. The location of the Agora Saint Germain was great. We walked every where. Breakfast was a delight every morning. The rooms were clean. We could open the double doors to let in fresh air. Fantastic bread shop and Fromagery right around the corner. We loved our visit.

<Content>Great location by the Metro/RER and Notre Dame We stayed for five nights in the spring. Clean small room with refrigerator. CNN was the English channel. We were in the front of the hotel which had a good deal of traffic noise, but the french doors were a nice touch and offered views of a historic church down the street. It was nice to have breakfast included in the Expedia rate, but there are plenty of inexpensive options very close to the hotel. We had terrific meals close to the hotel at Petite Pontoise, Atelier Maitre Albert, and Au Gourmand. I'd stay again.

<Content>Good Hotel, Great Location We stayed at the Agora for two nights at the end of January. The hotel was good (although not exceptional), with the rooms being comfortable and the staff very friendly. The real plus is the location - the hotel is just five minutes walk from the Notre Dame and there are plenty of restaurants nearby - but it's on a fairly quiet street itself so doesn't suffer from much road noise. The Agora is definitely somewhere I'd recommend to someone who wanted to stay in a reasonable hotel in a central location.

<Content>Great hotel, great location We (a party of 10) stayed at the Agora St. Germain in February. A room was given to us to stow our bags and freshen up (we arrived in the AM, before check in). It's a lovely hotel, the staff is very nice. There is renovation going on (our room smelled very much of paint, but we did get used to it -- our room was post renovation and lovely), but it doesn't start until 9ish and we were already up and out by that time. The breakfast is adequate, fresh croissants and bread, decent coffee (of course one can do better going to a cafe, but no one in our party complained about breakfast at the hotel). As a plus (for European hotels anyway), breakfast is not automatically included in the hotel bill, so there is no check out haggling over whether or not you had breakfast. The elevator was out one evening, which made a long, circular walk upstairs for 2 in our party (they didn't complain much -- it was their first trip to Paris and had carry-on luggage only, but it might be something you want to consider if you're traveling heavier). I would stay here again in a heartbeat!! A GREAT value -- in August I stayed at a hotel near the Louvre for almost double the price per night and the room was only a tiny bit larger and the bathroom was not nearly as nice. The Agora has a very nice location in what I felt was a safe neighborhood. One thing -- while I found the church bells (there is a church across the street) charming, they might wake a light sleeper.

<Content>Very nice hotel in great location I have just come back from a long weekend in Paris where I stayed in the Agora. It was a wonderful little hotel, the staff were all very polite and could not have been more helpful. The location was superb with lots of local caf茅s and restaurants. It is also only a five minute walk to Notre Dam and only 2 minutes to a metro station. I will definitely be staying here again in the future.

<Content>Christmas week in Paris at the Agora Saint Germain Our week in Paris was wonderful and I (and my husband and son) were more than pleased with the hotel. We read other reviews of this property and based our decision to stay here based on those reviews - we were not disappointed. The room was small (as warned) but clean and more than adequate for the amount of time we spent in it. The bathroom was spotless -linens and towels were changed daily. The desk staff went out of their way to help us with our many questions and offered helpful advice. The location is excellent - walking distance to Notre Dame and really just about anywhere. Metro stops close by as are many restaurants, bakeries, open air market (the best). I would recommend it to anyone who is not looking to stay at the Ritz and would definitely go back myself.

<Content>It's great...but maybe not right now! The hotel has a lot of great points: super location, friendly staff, clean  well-kept rooms. Also, if you can get a free breakfast included, it is very filling (baguettes, croissants, cheese, jam  yogurt). The rooms are also a good size for Paris.But, keep in mind that the hotel is currently undergoing a major renovation. Since the hotel is small, the construction is very loud (we're talking hammering and drilling), which starts every morning during the week at 9 AM. It's especially unbearable if it's being done in the room next to you. Also, due to the construction, the elevator was broken during our stay, and sometimes the toilets wouldn't flush right away. Once again, these are all just temporary issues.A couple of extras: if you don't get a free breakfast at the hotel, don't pay for it. While it's filling, you're in Paris, and it's worth shelling out a few Euros for a much better baguette or croissant in the morning. In fact, there's a great boulangerie right around the corner from the hotel.Also, the hotel directions from CDG instruct you to take the RER B train to Cluny Sorbonne. This is very easy, but keep in mind there's no Cluny Sorbonne exit on the RER B train. The train exits at St. Michel/Notre Dame, and there is an underground tunnel that connects you to Cluny Sorbonne. If you do exit at St. Michel, no worries, you're still close enough to the hotel to figure it out.

<Content>Stay Here! I spent four nights here with my boyfriend. Though the bath is small it is beautiful and I enjoyed taking a bath everynight after walking around all day. Breakfast is great and included in the price and the staff is friendly. Extremely clean hotel, excellent location right around the corner from some wonderful wine, cheese and bread/pastry shops. Did not want to leave! Will stay here next time. Remember when going to France: make at least an effort to speak French, it is very easy to order food in french and greet people in their own language--they will really appreciate it!

<Content>A Clean and Comfortable Pied A Terre I recently spent a most pleasant week at the Hotel Agora St. Germain in the Latin Quarter. Eric and the rest of the staff are very welcoming and helpful, and Martine's bountiful continental breakfast affords an excellent start to the day. Though my room was quite small, it was very clean as was the beautifully tiled bath. The sole negative is that the room (#16) is next to the staircase and the foot traffic can be heard. I look forward to my next stay at the Agora, and Eric Kayser's remarkable breads just around the corner!

<Content>great location, friendly staff and nice breakfast! I stayed at this hotel at the end of Nov04 for 4 nights, the location was excellent, easy to find and near to local metro stations, mini supermarket, local outdoor fresh food market and lots of places to eat/drink, but the hotel is just off the main road so there is no noise to worry about. The room was lovely and warm, clean and comfortable. The room had a satalitte TV (all french speaking chanels apart from CNN) and was cleaned daily.Reception staff were very helpful and friendly. This was my first time in Paris and I would definatly stay here again.

<Content>Treated very well at Agora Saint Germain Stayed 8 days at this hotel in October 2004. Everything was very good. Room had a nice view to a small plaza with a church, (room 29) and was very clean and looked neat. Everything worked well. Breakfast is nice, with fresh Parisian baguettes every morning and good coffee, tea or chocolate. Also cheese, honey, cereal, yogurt. Martine will brighten your morning with her pleasant words. Breakfast is included in the price. Very convenient, between 7 and 10:30. Location is awesome, being VERY close to Notre Dame and the Seine. Front desk was always very helpful, although it is nice to try a few words in French, like bonjour when you enter, and au revoir when you leave. French people are very fond of their language, and if you try a few French words, they will go out of their way to help and make you feel at home. Loved the stay, and I would definitely return here again. I had no complaints whatsoever.

<Content>Great Location, Friendly Staff and Clean Just spent three nights in Paris at this hotel after reading reviews on this website. The hotel could not be better placed, just 3-4 minutes walk from the Notre-Dame on a quiet side street. It is also in easy walk of the heart of the latin quarter - for a very wide selection of cafe's / bars and clubs. The restaurant recommended by the hotel (Maree-verde) was not cheap but the food and atmosphere were great. The room (35) was on the small side but was clean and quiet. We had three good night's sleep, so the bed must have been OK. The bath was small but I undertand this is not untypical in Paris.Breakfast is in a nice well laid out basement. It is expensive for what it is (10 Euro) but plenty of cafe's in local area.Staff very pleasant and helpful.

<Content>Pleasant 3-star hotel on the left bank I just got back yesterday. Stayed at the Agora St. Germain for 5 nights. It was a very nice little hotel and I would recommend it to those on a budget. I paid 112 Euros for my single room. My single room was very small but manageable. Desk, chair, bedside table, mini bar, good lighting (often lacking in Paris hotels), comfortable single bed, two pillows, adequate closet space. Room was well cleaned every day. Bed very comfortable. Room was on an air well so very quiet at night. Staff was friendly and spoke pretty good English.The bathroom was very nice in marble and modern appliances. But it had that situation often found in Paris - no shower curtain. Nice thick towels.Had breakfast the first two mornings. It cost 10 Euros, which was a lot for what they offered: baguettes, croissants, butter, jam, juice, so - so coffee, packaged cheese and canned fruit cocktail. If you go out the front door of the hotel, turn right and go to the corner, there is a small cafe where you can get a terrific coffee au lait and a nice croissant for 3.80 Euros. And the lady who runs the place is extremely pleasant. She will also do eggs if you wish. The location of the hotel is great as other reviewers have pointed out.

<Content>Great location, nice staff, mattresses are soft. Just back from a 4 night stay in early September at the Hotel Agora St. Germaine. This is a fabulous neighborhood, with a great location. Near to a Metro stop, shops, boulangerie, food kiosks, ethnic food restaurants. Several internet cafes nearby. The best part of the hotel was location. Desk staff speaks English competently, and can help with hotel and neighborhood info, but does not provide full concierge service like getting tickets to events. Room was adequate, not too small by Parisian standards, clean and well serviced by the maids. There is a tiny room safe capable of holding a couple of passports and not much else. Elevator is small and slow, but it works. Room air conditioning is a bit anemic on the hottest days, but otherwise quite adequate. Beds are double mattress sized in double rooms, and are lacking in firmness and support that many North Americans are used to. Not a bad value for the price of 130 Euros.

<Content>Loved The Hotel, Neighborhood We stayed at the Agora Aug. 13th-Aug. 19th. I absolutely loved this hotel. I will stay there again the next time I visit Paris. The room, No 48, was smaller than the average American hotel room but there was plenty of room. There was a double bed, a desk with 2 chairs, a closet with shelves, a few hangers, and enough room to store small luggage. There was also a mini bar which was large enough to hold our own snacks. The A/C also worked great. The bathtub/shower was a little tricky but overall the bathroom was ok. It was very clean, lots of hot water. Housekeeping came everyday and left clean towels, etc.. There was also an in-room safe which was helpful in storing passports, etc.. The breakfast was cereal, croissants and jam, yogurt, orange juice, coffee, hot chocolate, and tea. It was light but filling. The neighborhood was great as well. The hotel is close to Notre Dame and the Pantheon but it was very quiet and felt like a neighborhood rather than a part of touristy Paris. There is a metro stop right up the street, as well as a post office and internet cafe which came in handy to check bank balances. The staff was helpful in giving directions, etc.. I wouldn't stay anywhere else on my next visit.
