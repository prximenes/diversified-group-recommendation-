<Content>Good find ! We have just returned from a cruise and had a pre and post stay at this hotel. Having read previous reports we were slightly concerned about the place, but this proved to be unfounded. Five of our party stayed at this hotel which meant one was a single traveller.....she had as good a room as the rest of us. The fact that she resides in the States where comfort and cleanliness are of a high standard, she was very pleased with her room as were we all. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and went out of their way to assist in any way possible. During the day walking about the area is not a problem, but we would agree with others who advise not walking in the back streets at night....but this is no different from any other big city. We were not hassled by street sellers/beggars etc and did not feel threatened, but then again we did not display jewellery or carry bags. The hotel has a safe in each room and we decided that the security in the hotel was satisfactory and that the safe was the best place for items such as passports etc. We ate in a couple of restaurants opposite the hotel as we did not want to wait until after 2030 hrs to sit down to our evening meal. The Pizzeria and August restaurants were friendly and the quality of food very good, freshly made, and at a reasonable price. Las Ramblas is an interesting place to walk but very expensive to eat and drink.The Rambla de Mar on the waterfront is a lovely place to walk and sit during the day and expect it a good place to eat at night as long as a taxi back to the hotel is on the cards. We would certainly use this hotel again as we like walking during the day and there are plenty of places around the hotel at night to sit and have a drink and a meal without straying too far from base. The breakfast buffet was adequate and offered a good choice from a selection of cereals, breads, cold meats, cheese, fruit and sweet choice as well as juice and teas or coffee. Once again we do not understand how some people have complained about this hotel, but they are entilted to their perceptions.

<Content>What a Fab Hotel!!!!! Me and my husband have just spent a couple of days here for our 10th wedding anniversary and it was absolutely brill. The hotel has spared no expense on decor, furnishings, etc., and the soluarium with the hot tub was an absolute treat.The staff were very friendly and helpful [the reception staff were all attractive men dressed in very smart suits which made a nice change!]The hotel is about two blocks [10-15 minute walk] from Las Ramblas and there's a supermarket across the road which was handy. The room had a minibar which was filled with all you could need in drinks and snacks.Would highly recommend this place.

<Content>Much better than expected We arrived early evening for a one night stay prior to a cruise . The staff made us very welcome  provided us with a city map  details on how to keep ourselves  our personal belongings safe. Our hotel bedroom  bathroom were spotlessly clean, and we found several very useful accessories had been left for us, e.g. travel toothpaste  brush, shower cap, soap, shower gel. comb, shoe clean kit etc. There was no outlook from the window, but this was not a problem. Stepping out into the street we found several bars  restaurants  enjoyed a nice evening with very little interference from street sellers. We enjoyed a very good hotel buffet breakfast which was priced at 15euros each, plenty of choice  served in an immaculate dining room.The hotel is situated within a short distance of La Ramblas  we walked there the next morning. (Would not recommend walking through the back streets at night). We were able to leave our luggage in our room until midday so we found this very convenient.Having read poor reviews for this hotel we were delighted to stay in such a comfortable and well run establishment  can certainly recommend it. We will be happy to stay here again when next in Barcelona.

<Content>I cannot see why people are complaining about this hotel I have to say that after reading some of the less than complementary comments on here I was expecting a dirty hotel with muggers on every corner about a hostel level.The hotel may not be a 4 star standard Dubai standard but I have to say I have stayed in 4 star hotels in London that would never compare to this lovely hotel. Reception was inviting and as one person pointed out the bar does close at 9pm but what is the problem there are many lovely restaurants nearby. In fact the receptionist pointed us to a lovely place that was not expensive at all.Rooms are comfortable, clean and well maintained. We met up with friends who came back to the hotel for a drink and who had brought us a bottle of champagne to celebrate and the bar staff put it in an ice bucket even though we had not purchased it there.Would definitely recommend this hotel and have to say never saw any muggers or prostitues in this area and only had a beggar hassle us in Ramblas which I would expect.

<Content>This is rather a two star hotel ! 1. The first room they gave me was too noisy from apparently water flowing in pipes. Also it was not properly cleaned as there was a long woman's hair on the wall of the toilet.2. The second room they gave me was even worse. TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. The towels they provided were obviously not clean, as I found two long woman's hair on them!! Also the water in the bathtub could not empty easily !3. The hotel was way too noisy, mainly from noise created by the cleaning staff !

<Content>Average to say the least We arrived to find that the hotel had no hot water on the first floor. The hotel advised that they would pay for a taxi to a sister hotel (Hotel Splendid) and back the next morning. I asked if the other hotel was the same rating. They said it was, but they lied! It was a 3 star, whereas we had paid for this 4 star.Whilst the staff were apologetic  we acknowledged that we would rather know about the problem, than check-in to find it, they only seemed to do what they had to for us.We were offered complimentary breakfast for each morning, but we pointed out that we had already paid for this with our booking. We ended up in a very small room at the Splendid Hotel for the first night - the bed was against the wall and you couldn't walk around the foot of the bed, so you could only climb on from one side. We were charged 拢120 for the privilege! (we were told to pay both hotels directly). Breakfast at the Millenni was good. La Rambla is a brisk 15-20 mins walk away, which takes you by the red light area! We didn't have any trouble with pickpockets, but we were mindful not to carry a bag or show belongings.Its worth walking everywhere, We only used public transport to/from Girona airport.La Barceloneta (beach) is a bit of a trek, but worth it. As is the port which you would walk through to get there. Off La Rambla is a really nice square called Colon - its about half way down, on the other side of the road from La Boqueria market. We had a lovely evening there. Palm tree lined, open air restaurants, with good food  reasonably priced.

<Content>Great hotel, ice staff! Was a little worried abut the area after reading some reviews... HOW WRONG THEY WERE! The hotel was lovely, the area is fine and the staff friendly and helpful. Its a 5 minute walk to the Ramblas and main square down the back streets which were fine in the day (apparently a bit dodgey in the evening so we avoided) and about 15 minutes if you go down the main road. If you dont fancy the walk there's a tube just outside that you can take for 1.3 euros or 10 euros for 2 days unlimited travel( Well worth it if you want to see the whole city!) Anyway book in confidence you'll have a great time!

<Content>Really nice hotel for weekend break My husband and myself stayed at the Apsis Millenium on the 31st Aug - 2nd Sept after reading the reviews on here I was slightly aprehensive about the location of this hotel. On arrival we were impressed with the hotel and the location seemed fine, it's located in the Theatre district so is quite busy in the evenings. We had been told to watch out for pickpockets in Barcelona and the hotel receptionist gave us an information sheet on ways to keep safe in and around the city which was vey heplful, and as when visiting anywhere you just have to be sensible and not take short cuts or walk down little side streets at night, although we did feel safe doing this during the day. Getting to La Ramblas took about 15 minutes and that is sticking to the main route going to the roundabout by the port turning left then just a short walk on another main road and you will be at the bottom of La Ramblas. The rooms in the hotel are not massive but adequate and very clean and comfortable, maid service and towels changed everyday. Air conditioning worked fine for us and as in most spanish hotels the only english channel on the TV was CNN, but who comes to Barcelona to watch TV..... It is worth getting a taxi or walking to Port Olympic as there are some lovely restaurants especially if you like seafood, it's also quite lively late into the evening although some bars can be very expensive. the bus tour of Barcelona is also worth doing 19 euros and you can get on and of as many times as you like until 9pm, also 3 different bus routes, so definatley worth the money. Overall an excellent weekend and we would definatly visit this city and hotel again

<Content>Worth a visit but.... My wife and I stayed at the Milleni between 21st and 23rd July. Overall, we found the hotel to be of a good standard with extremely helpful staff who spoke excellent English - would we go back? Probably. The rooms were clean and pleasant (we stayed on the 5th floor and had no problem with noise from the traffic outside) - and the air conditioning (essential given the temperatures) worked well. Apart from CNN, there were no English language channels on the TV but, to be frank, we spent relatively little time in the room.The breakfast was pretty good, offering a varied selection of excellent quality. There is a rooftop sun terrace and also, it is claimed, a bar but it didn't seem to be open during our visit (not a problem given the proximity to plenty of decent places near by - do try Moritz directly opposite, which does very good tapas). The only problem we had with the hotel was that for the first night we were in close proximity to another guest who was extremely loud, aggressive and seemingly drunk. Luckily, he departed on the second day and the hotel staff were very apologetic. For the rest of the time it was an oasis of calm.The hotel is located in what could best be described as a fairly mixed, residential neighbourhood - not particularly picturesque but with the advantage of making you feel part of the local culture rather than a tourist. The big plus is that is only a 10-15 minute walk from the old port and La Ramblas with other main sites also within walking distance but.....and here is the problem....the shortest direct routes to La Rambas go through Raval which, though better than it was, can still be pretty unpleasant. For example, if you come out of the hotel turn left and walk along Carrer Sant Pau (home to Barcelona's oldest church - worth a visit), particularly near Rambla del Raval, you rapidly realise this is a far from salubrious area with drug addicts and prostitutes visible even at midday. One kindly local warned us as we walked to watch out for muggers! At night-time, I could imagine tourists are easy targets. So, some words of advice - don't carry a bag or have a camera on display and, if walking, go down towards the port and then up La Ramblas from the Columbus monument or take the longer route, via Ronda Sant Pau/Ronda Universitat and come down Las Ramblas from Placa de Catalunya. A couple of other tips - the Bus Turistic offers superb value, allowing you to hop on and off and visit all the main sites. The nearest stops to the hotel are at Place de Catalunya and the Old Port. Barcelona is full of bars and places to eat - for the former, we particularly liked the famous Boadas (just off the top of Las Ramblas); for the latter, Taller de Tapas (Placa Sant Josep) where we could have stayed all day. Also, if in the area of the Old Port, avoid the quite expensive places on the front and visit the top floor restaurant in the Museu d'Historia de Catalunya which has fantastic views over the harbour together with reasonably priced (for the quality) food and drink.

<Content>Dangerous area The Apsis Hotel is situated quite conveniently to the Ramblas - about 10/15 mins walk. Unfortunately the room we had was right on the road and they had no other twin rooms. We booked from 7th June to 11th (Fri - Mon) We are young 50s women and used to travelling. One an ex air hostess, the other a model and dancer. When we arrived as we got into a taxi outside the hotel my girlfriend was mugged viciously. She was pulled back to the pavement and a young man around 23 tried to take her bag. This of course ruined the holiday for us. Another woman in our party was staying in a different hotel The Principal in calle commerc. When she walked up calle Ronda san Pau towards our hotel she had a similar attack and also clung on to her bag.I just think for a 4 * hotel they should at least have some security outside and sort out the double glazing. I could not sleep as most Spanish people appear to come back from night clubs at around 4am in the morning and the trucks and ambulances go all night. However the bedroom was nice and clean with a modern appearance.Breakfast could have been better and was indeed on the Monay of our departure with all items replenished on the buffet.Next time we will stay closer to the Ramblas in a 2 star hotel and take no handbag. Difficult to carry cameras and mobile phones but body armour might be good.

<Content>Nice hotel This hotel is fairly decent, I'd say it's a 3.5 star.Hotel staff was helpful.Rooms were pretty good. No complaintsLocation isn't too bad, just watch where you go, just took an aimless stroll one night and ended up in a crappy neighborhood.Train station is a couple of blocks away.If you need a drink or light snack at night when the stores are closed, hit the mini bar and replace it the next morning. Otherwise there's a gas station not too far away.

<Content>Nice location but... We had a four-day trip in Barcelona and we stayed at Apsis.This hotel is renovated and decorated very well. Nice facilities including sauna and a jaccuzi if you make reservations.Great location to the metro station Parelel which covers two metro lines and a ferry to the mountain.Very cute and informative young receptionists (all men)The bad thing is they made terrible mistakes during our stay by giving keycard to strangers who broke into our room at 3 am.Air conditioner does not work according to the temperature you adjust to. It is overwhelmingly hot in the room if you turn on the conditioner all night long!

<Content>Mmmm not bad We stayed here in the first week of Jan and found it to be reasonably well placed in the city. To be honest I am sure there are other hotels in the area that are better located and even cheaper. The rooms are fine and nicely presented- we had a nightmare on the first night as the aircon/heating system was insane, it must have been about 45c all night and it was making a terrible noise, wow i was hallucinating! Tv was rubbish so dont try to watch it, CNN was the only english language and that almost killed us! Wolf Blizter- is that a made-up name?Each night we had to walk along from the hotel to La Rambla and while it was only a short walk the shortest route was through a weird and dodgey ally that had several intimidating parts- no hassle mind but if you are a paranoid person in a city renound for thieving etc then this is not a walk for you. I kinda enjoyed being away from La Rambla and heading off into it for dinner etc. One good thiing about the location is its simple walk to the main port and the waterfront, a nice walk down there during the day is refreshing. Facilities are not bad here, simple but comfortable bathroom and toiletries provided, good electronic safe for passports etc and it's free for a change. they have lovely spa area downstairs, sauna jacuzzi etc- no pool- but it was a booking system that to be honest we didnt bother with as there is so much to do in Barcelona. There is a great roof top solarium that you can go out to in the sunshine with reasonable views around the city. Didnt even see the bar area but why would you, plenty of places more interesting near by!Only other thing is we never saw a single other guest, which was kinda weird.Enjoy though, a great city so you cant go too wrong.

<Content>Good base for exploring We stayed here late December 2006. This hotel is a great base for exploring the delights of Barcelona being close to the metro and in easy walking distance of The Ramblas, the Gothic Quarter and the harbour area. Like others we were a little unsure of the surrounding area, however, on our many walks to and from the hotel at different hours of the day we encountered no problems. The hotel itself was nothing special, I would agree that it perhaps is not deserving of its 4 star status. Many rooms are quirky in shape (and small), inadequate bathroom ventilation, the heating/air conditioning leaves a bit to be desired. The room service menu consists of half a dozen sandwiches and on the occasion we tried to order we were advised we couldn't have anything as room service was off sick. We never saw the bar open and the rooms do not have tea/coffee making facilities. We didn't use the TV - we found it only showed Spanish speaking programs, if travelling with children beware. they have pay TV - this includes films and adult films - as you flick through the channels you get a full show for a few seconds before it asks for your confirmation. Think of this hotel as a travelodge (somewhere to put your head) and you won't be disappointed.

<Content>Good value but... the location is not that good and has been said before the road facing rooms are v noisy. The Spanish have not yet learnt the need to ban sirens and horns at night.The reception desk staff were all extremely helpful and we changed to a room on the backside which in hindsight may have been a reference to the view, but it meant we could sleep.The bar was hardly open during our trip including New Years which was annoying. But the hotel is well placed for the excellent Metro system which is needed to get around to the far flung attractions in Barcelona.It is clean, friendly, well priced and good as a base - which is why I've given it a positive rating.

<Content>good value - pity about air con and elevator noise we stayed here on the first few days in January. The room was fine and clean but very warm. We asked about the air conditioning and were told they didn't have any. We also had a room beside the elevator and it made a bit of a racket at night!On the upside the staff were friendly and helpful and the hotel is located very close to las ramblas and metro stations. The area around the hotel is a bit dodgy and we did get taxis back at night. Fine during the day though.

<Content>Hotel was OK, but not great We were a party of 5 staying in 3 rooms at the hotel between Christmas and New Year, December 2006.The hotel is well located being about 5-10 mins walk from La Rambla. The cost was an average of 鈧?15/ night for a double room including breakfast which was pretty good considering the city centre location. However I would definitely rate the hotel as 3-star rather than 4-star. The local area is a little seedy but no great problem and we walked to and from the hotel both day and night without any problems.The rooms were OK, spacious, modern and clean though one room was constantly very hot and on our last morning there was no hot water available throughout the hotel.The buffet breakfast is very good but quite expensive at 鈧?2 (reduced from 鈧?5 if pre-booked) but be warned that if you do pre-book it for your stay you get charged for the breakfast even if you don't take it.There is a tiny bar which we found to be hopeless - not open a lot of the time and not staffed for the remainder.The hotel staff were fine and spoke good English.All-in-all it is an OK hotel but I would like to try somewhere else if I return to Barcelona.

<Content>this is a winner Has a brandnew feel to it. Nicely sized rooms with extremely clean modern marble bathrooms. Wellness center, business center and a good breakfast room. I didn't have breakfast but other guests said it was very good. The hotel has a positive vibe and makes you feel right at home. I have stayed at other places in Barcelona and this was the cleanest and most welcoming. Staff at reception is extremely helpful. They made loads of reservations at restaurants for us, recommended great places and had an answer to every question. They truly made an effort to please. I have stayed in many 5 star first class hotels around the world and even though I dreaded and expected this to be basic, I couldn't find fault with anything here. It isn't the Park Hyatt or the Mandarin Oriental but on a budget is truly the next best thing to it.Everything is brand-new, fast, roomy elevators and good marble staircases in well lighted hallways. The Metro is 200 metres away and the Ramblas in short walking distance. There are cafes and a Kentucky Fried Chicken on the very same street, but why bother when the city is full of delicious Tapas restaurants.All in all Barcelona is choc-full of unfriendly taxi drivers and shop staff who'd rather chew nails than serve you, but the Apsis Milleni was a wonderful place to come home to. It might not be a design hotel and the furniture and carpets in the rooms were a bit dark, but everything else was light, clean and modern. I have paid far more money for other hotels in Barcelona that were nowhere near the standard of the Apsis. Unless I will treat myself to a Design temple next time I will be returning to the Apsis Milleni again and will recommend it to anyone going to Barcelona. It is great value for money and everything looked exactly as it did in the pics. This is a good choice for any trip, may it be business or pleasure.

<Content>Great value Apsis Milleni Myself and my fiancee have stayed twice at the Apsis Milleni (once in 2005 and again in 2006), and on both occasions have found it to be clean and efficient, with very helpful english speaking staff.Obviously everyone wants something different from a hotel.I wanted somewhere that was clean, modern, safe, central and cheap! And the Milleni ticks all of those boxes. We didn't take breakfast (鈧?), but why would you when Barcelona is so full of great little restaurants  cafes.The rooms (I can only speak for the 2 we've stayed in) were very clean and modern, and serviced to a high standard. The only complaint I have (and I really am scraping the barrel here) is that the rooms at the front of the hotel are a bit on the noisy side (they front a main rd, and I dont think the windows are double glazed)Some reveiws posted previously have mentioned the hotels location.OK, its not on the Ramblas - Its 1 stop away on the metro (1 min walk) or a 5 min walk. And the safety of the area? All I can say is that it feels safer than central London or Cork city on a sat night.

<Content>Clean, Central, Good Value Helpful staff who spoke excellent English. When we first arrived we had a problem with our sink which was blocked and the toilet which would not flush. We immediately complained to reception and we were moved immediately. The only thing I would say is to make sure the shower works when you turn the water on - the pressure of the water made the shower head bend over and hit the wall -not very useful! But apart from that the hotel was clean, good value for money and again the staff were very helpful. A 15 minute walk from the La Ramblas. A supermarket within a 2 minute walk. All rooms have a mini-bar. We had gone to Barcelona for my brother in law's 30th birthday and the hotel had left a Happy Birthday note in their room together with a bottle of Cava. A nice touch we thought. Would higly recommend.

<Content>Good Location, great service, nice room, strange shower This was a great location. 1 Block from the Barcelona Metro which also was the stop for the Tram to the Mountain where the Miro Museum is located.They had a marvelous breakfast and was a good value - about 60% of what we paid in Italy (venice and Rome).Guests are entitled to a free day at the jacuzzi and gym in the basement but we didn't have time for it. It was a 15 minute walk to the Rambla and I would have preferred a shorter walk, but you could take the metro if you needed.

<Content>An excellent hotel for a short break - great value Having read the previous reports I was a little unsure as to what we had let ourselves in for - 10 in party.We need not have been concerned at all.The staff, who all spoke very good English, could not have been more helpful - the rooms very clean and individual - we were fortunate in having a room overlooking the road, some of our party had windows facing bland brick walls - but that is an issue with almost any hotel anywhere.I would suggest that the area btween the hotal and Las Ramblas is not an ideal area to walk through in the evening - much better to stick to the main road, which is still a very nice walk.Very good food - our party had no difficulty finding restaurants to cope with 10 with no delays.I would happily recommend the Millenni Hotel.

<Content>Good price, good location. We were pleased with the level of accommodation provided by this hotel. I always want to find hotels clean, tidy and with a reasonable bathroom and of course well furnished. This hotel met with all of those. The staff were most helpful and gave very good recommendations of good restaurants... and by this you could deem that quite pricey at over 拢80 for 2. The hotel is well located, approx 5 minutes walk from Las Ramblas and 10 mins from the port. Compared to the much pricier hotels on Las Ramblas I was quite happy to be a short walk away. The only downside to the hotel is that they don't serve restaurant food in the evening. However, you can cross the road to bars / restaurants where you could have tapas dishes of an evening and if you want to get away from hotel breakfasts there are plenty of restaurants open for breakfast too. All in all, a good place to stay in a fairly central location.

<Content>Good rooms, questionable location Hotel itself was modern and clean with excellent breakfast. The only drawback was its location, fine by day but, slightly concerning walk home after dinner in the evenings. We paid 拢75 per night including breakfast which I would say is well worth it. If you are concerned about the location there is a metro station about 50m away, from where you can get anywhwhere in town easily for E1.15.Other recommendations for barcelona:- the Airbus in from the main airport costs about 3 euros, leaves every 9 minutes and goes to Espanya or Catalunya squares, both of which are on the metro line from the Parallel station, at the hotel. Probably pretty cheap taxi ride from these spots.- go on the Bus Touristic, as well as getting a great overview of bacelona you'll get a book of vouchers for entry to the main tourist attractions, which you can use on later days, if you use them all the bus trip will pay for itself.- resturants: 4 Cats great, Taxidermiste great, seafood ones at History museum at marina great, the Quinze Nits in PLaca Real - overhyped, dont wait in the long queue, its just like posh fast food.

<Content>Lovely Hotel - Great Stay I travelled to Barcelona with a group of friends and we stayed in The Apsis Milleni. We weren't sure of the location in comparison to the main attractions, but we were surprised that it was so close to everywhere we wanted to go. Las Ramblas is a walk away, and personally did not find any of the area's unsafe - we walked almost everywhere. We also used the very close by metro station which will take you almost anywhere you wanted to go.The hotel rooms were modern and basic, could not fault them!The breakfast, whist slightly overpriced, was excellent with a wide range of cereals, fresh fruit, meat, cheese - beautiful!The staff were very helpful and friendly - we did not make use of any the other hotel facilities - spa etc, so cannot comment.

<Content>wonderfull stay The apsis milleni is a lovely hotel, with a very helpfull staff that speaks english.The rooms are beautifull and if you're lucky you'll have french windows.The hotel itself is very clean and modern.It will take you 8 minutes to get to the Ramblas by foot, and the metro is only a minute away.Don't take the shortcut to the Ramblas because it isn't very safe, but the main street is in front of the hotel, so if you don't want to take any risks, just take a cab, because they are very cheap.We had a wonderfull stay in Barcelona thanks to this hotel!!It is a great place to start from, and see all about Barcelona. By foot or by metro!! Even for my mother, who is 63 years old and is allergic to dirty places, so that says enough about the apsis milleni!!

<Content>Great Hotel.Beware petty crime in the locality The Apsis Millenni was very pleasant indeed...clean,comfortable,good rates,free phone internet access in the business centre.However,our enjoyment of our stay in this hotel was severely dented by the fact that my bag was grabbed from me in a bar/restaurant on Ave.Parallell just 5 mins from the hotel.The hotel management said that we should have been given a security leaflet on check in warning us to be extra vigilant in the area.Unfortunately we werent .Also,one of the senior managers I spoke to (in a state of high distress) seemed only to be concerned about how we were going to pay our bill,since all credit cards had to be cancelled!

<Content>No problems with this hotel My wife and I ave just returned from this hotel on 8th February 2005 and after reading some of the earlier reports I was slightly apprehensive.We paid 拢75 a night for a family room and it was well worth it.The room was large enough for the money we were paying and it was clean.The hot breakfast was excellent and I found the staff helpful.I would recommend this hotel especially at the price I paid

<Content>Very dissapointed, very expensive and dirty The hotel looks fine from the outside, the staff have a smattering of English which is useful, there are lifts to all the floors. But when you get to your room, which i was paying 拢130 a night for, i was severely diaappointed. I should not have been paying more than 拢60 a night. The bathroom smelt because the drains were dirty and were obvuiously not cleaned. The room was small, just big enough for a double bed and a desk for the TV and thats it. The location of the hotel was fine, the breakfast was ok, but i would not go there again. We didnt get a chance to use the jacuzzi or sauna, as apparently it was out of order. This is a 4* hotel and i have slept in much better and cheaper 3* hotels. Please do not disregard these comments when you are looking to go to Barcelona, dont waste your money here.

<Content>Sadly Disappointing My mother and I stayed here from 08-11 Mar 2004. We were extremely disappointed with the standard of the hotel compared to hotels in, say Rome or Paris in the 4* or so category. Would certainly not go there again. Room was smaller than expected and shower not very powerful. The breakfast was sad, the hot one was actually cold, and coffee tasteless and we gave it a couple of tries to be fair. I did try to complain about a number of inadequacies, however heard nothing from the management, so even customer relations is not important to them. The Spa and Sauna are 'do it yourself' so hope you can work it out, my Mum is 79 years young and would've had problem, but I'm pretty practical. It is also a health and safety nightmare, with no emergency button, slippy floor, etc. I did not find that the staff at the Apsis could recommend restaurants, in fact they suggested we walk to the harbour and avoid the surrounding areas as not very safe (20 minutes away). So perhaps after my letter to them suggesting more information for guests, the comment above applies, and they did take my suggestions into account. It is a shame though that the management could not even just say 'sorry', which after all costs nothing. However, we did enjoy Barcelona as a city for a short break, suggest the Hotel Universal around the corner looks good and could have better customer relations perhaps, it is also on top of the metro so very convenient. Give the Apsis Millenium a miss though, if you want to avoid disappintment. My mum was very surprised at the lack of response to both letter, form in room and email, so you can't say I didn't try.

<Content>Excellent base to explore the city We visited this lovely hotel 17-21 March 2004 and found it a perfect base to explore the wonderful city of Barcelona. The young staff spoke excellent English and were extremely helpful, recommending restaurants, sights and travel hints. The rooms were clean and modern, with a lovely bathroom and excellent power shower. Only small downside is it perhaps is not in the best location as it is on the edge of El Raval, but it is an easy 10 mins to La Ramblas and we did not encounter any problems at all. Recommended for Barcelona would be a Bikini (ham and cheese toastie) and cafe con leche (milky coffee) on a pavement terrace for breakfast, visiting Park Guell and lazing in the sunshine, sharing a bottle of Cava on La Ramblas, Tapas for a relaxing lunch, dinner at La Gavina (harbour) and exploring the maze of streets in the Bario Gotic. Cannot wait to go again!
