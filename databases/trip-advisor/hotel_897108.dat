<Content>Great place. A few problems, but taken care of. Hi Floks,Just got back from the Edenh on Dec. 20th from a week of a wonderful vacation with very few exceptions. Here we go with my review. Great things:1. The resort is absolutely beautiful.2. The staff is perfect (I'll go into that later).3. No bugs or mosquito's.4. Beach is excellent. No problems at all with chairs, etc...5. Pools and areas are cleaned every morning and are great.6. Rooms are excellent.7. Medical staff: Excellent! FYI. Stay away from the dogs on the beach!!! I got bitten by one but the Doctor took care of me in a heartbeat.Staff:The best I have ever seen. They do everything possible to take care of you and any problems you have. You have to remember that this is a new resort and its like moving into a new home. You are going to have a few problems but they respond quickly and take care of everything. I spent the first couple of nights sleeping on the beach because of air conditioning problems but once I talked with PC Mike he immediately moved us to a suite (beautiful).A special thanks to a few folks. When you check in, look for Hector. He acts like he is from PC but actually he is from New Jersey. Fluent in several languages and really takes care of you. Felix: Do I need to say anything! The best egg/omelet chef I have ever met!Romon (bar tender) No need to say that he's the best! Just watch him and you won't believe it.PC Mike (Mike Bryant): Without a doubt the best public relations manager I have ever met. If you have a problem with the establishment and need to escalate it, just ask for him. If you are just having a bad day (such as with your significant other) don't bother him. But if you have a real problem, he'll take care of you.Problems/solutions:1. Air conditioning. Make sure your room is cooling or contact customer service. It won't get better but they will take care of you.2. If you eat at the grill in the Asian restaurant please understand that they have a set menu. If you want the a regular menu you have to sit a table (we had a couple of folks sitting with us at the grill that had dietary problems and could not eat the food).3. Ice machines. They have services on all foors but they had a problem with them (I think it must have been with the clean water system). However, just call and they will immediately respond with ice delivered to your room.4. Even though it not on the room service menu, You can request the American breakfast that inculdes scrambled eggs, bacon, muffins, potatoes, and juice.Hope this helps. Great resort and we will go back.Herb and Lisa Matherly (hmatherly@yahoo.com)

<Content>Amazing Resort, Clean Hotel, Great Staff, Gorgeous Beach........ Hi There!I think the title of my review says it all. I visited the NHRA from December 4 - 18, 2008. I travelled with my Mother (we are 38 and 58 for perspective). As frequent visitors to the Caribbean I can say without doubt that the Staff and Management at this resort have their acts together. From the moment we arrived, our private check in was prompt, professional and quick. Service is always pleasant and with a smile. Any request we made was attended to so promptly we found ourselves chuckling with disbelief. I was impressed with the number of supervisors and managers visible on the floor, assisting with service. We were on the VIP package via Air Transat Vacations and were delighted with our room assignment. We think that the upgrade is worth it for the room location in itself...not to mention the jacuzzi tub on the balcony....it was amazing and such a treat after a hard day at the beach! The resort is well planned out with everything you need during the day within close proximity...beach, pool, VIP pool and bars, showers, lunch grill / buffet etc.... I adore this about the property because I really dread having to walk 5 minutes to the pool from the beach. We found the food services to be extensive and of very good quality. Not one issue with upset tummy or anything of the like. Bottled water was replenished daily in our room and is refillable, self serve style at the bars...we really like this idea. We are pretty low key and did stick to the buffet most nights even though we had guaranteed reservations at the a la carte each week. We opted to book the Shore Grill and Senses A la Carte. Both were excellent! The table side Caesar salad was very tasty and the tenderloin steak (ordered and enjoyed at both restaurants) was quite possibly the most tender cut we've experienced...I don't know how they do it!!!! We cannot find any fault with the food and beverage services. The buffet rotates weekly and there is something for everyone. If you can't find something to eat....well....not sure what to say about that with a pasta bar, a grill with fresh assorted fish and different cuts of meat cooked to your liking, two sides of a buffet offering at least 10 different items, soups, salads, fresh fruits, abundant desserts and a different side of meat being freshly carved....not sure how you get by when not on holiday if you can't find something edible here? We skipped breakfast and enjoyed lunch beachside and dinner accordingly. Each room is equipped with a mini fridge, coffee machine and coffee grounds replenished as needed. We really enjoyed our in-room coffee. Room service had no trouble providing us with litres of boxed milk which was kept fresh in our fridge. The room is also equipped with an ironing board and safe programmable by number. The rooms are VERY clean, not one bug and the beds are incredibly comfortable...the duvets are divine!!!! I could go on and rave about this resort, we were that impressed. Read these reviews with a grain of salt, factor in what is important to you when travelling and don't sweat the small stuff. You will not be disappointed with the NH Real Arena. Feel free to PM me if you have any questions.Bubbygirl and her Mother

<Content>WONDERFUL - Please read ... Ok. I was SCARED before I left because of all the bads reviews this Hotel had.. I did not encounter any problems during the whole trip... NOTHING to complain about - People who wrote bad reviews are frustrated and very hard to please. Chek-In took 5 minutes (we took the Paradise Club upgrade which I recommend because you have the private chek-in)Paradise upgrade: nicer room + spa on balcony + lobster dinner in your room + fruits + bottle of Rhum + slipper that you can bring home + bathrobe + beach towel aready in the room + private pool and bar + better alchool + free room service + 1 hour of free bowling + rebate on massagesThe food is GREAT - you will always find something different to eat every day. And for those who are fussy - there is a PASTA stand. Dessert are not so good but that is pretty much it. We were there for X-mas and on X-mas eve they had a beautiful buffet with seafood.The wine is awful - please bring your own !!! The drinks are good, and they were never out of alchool - the only drink they could'nt make was the Mojito.4 restaurants 脿 la carte - which you have to make your reservation upon arival - it took us about 15 minutes in line before we could book but then everything is settle for the week. I think that since this is a 4 1/2 * that restaurant could be a little bit more fancy. You can only book 4 nights per week.Asian- If you take the Hibachi table - you dont have a menu - they grill in front of you chiken - shrimps - rice - veggies. I would give a 4/5Cirque Terre - (Italien) - I would also give a 4/5 Grill - This was my least favorite but it was edible. Dont take the ribs. 3/5Sense - This was my favorite - 5/5Beach is beautiful - LOTS of chair - the hotel was booked at full capacity and we DID NOT have to get up at 6 am to reseve some chairs. The chairs are comfortable + when you are Paradise Club, you get your drinks served on the beach. Pools are also great - cleaned every morning.The sand is cleaned every morning also.The rooms are nice, and they were done every day. Mini-bar was always filled up with water Coke and Sprite- I did not have to ask once for anything. Please think of bringing some old clothes of 1$ gifts to the chamber maid - they will be very happy and you will be getting a good service. People who work there are always smilng and very plesent. Of course they dont speak very good english - but do you speak good spanich ???? Dont forget you are in Dominican Republic.Bowling and Pool was fun. Security on the beach is ok thank God they are there because if not you would get bother by Dominicans wanting to sell you something.If you walk on the beach (both ways) you will find littles stores. You can deal at leat 50% off the price they suggest you.This is not a place for night life - THERE IS NO DISCO. Its a place to relax and enjoy the sun and beach. Its very ZEN. There is a little animation at night in the main place and it was different everynight.Beside upgrading the 脿 la carte restaurent. I think this place is a paradise.

<Content>Edenh is perfect!! We went to the Edenh from December 13th to 20th 2008, it was our first trip down south and we absolutely loved it!! The hotel is super nice , very modern and zen, the beach is perfect very clean, they clean it at least twice a day to keep it sea weed free. The food was fine,a la carte restaurant are better than the buffet but it`s all good. THE STAFF IS VERY FRIENDLY!!!!! We had so much fun with Danny at the VIP Pool bar, he is the best !!!! very nice and he makes the best drink and on top of that he is an entertainer!!! also at the Alisios Bar Luis, Dery and Julio and also very nice we had lots of fun with them. We didn`t want to leave!Our room was always super clean, they cleaned the floors and everything everyday!The only little thing is that the shows are a bit late they start at 10h pm, We didn`t mind at all, because we had fun at the bars but we heard some people talking and that was their complaints.The Pools are also very nice and very big, always clean.I wish we could go back, we feel like all the staff is now our friends!!! Especially Danny and Luis!!!!Our trip was perfect, and the weather was really nice and hot!

<Content>Beware of problems One week stay at EdenH Real / Punta Cana = Beautiful beach/wonderfulstaff. Food is horrible and loaded with salt. Beach and pool chairs are uncomfortable/main areas ( reception and night entertainment) are closed in and not ventilated = hot, smelly and stuffy. The hotel is architecturally beautiful - plantation style. There are serious plumbing problems throughout - walls and floors and ceilings leaking all over the hotel. There is virtually no nightlife - consists of ridculous shows in an auditorium type setting that is not ventilated. The only public place that has ceiling fans is the  outdoor lunch  area that is already open to the elements and does not need fans. The enclosed spaces that are not ventilated have NO ceiling fans! Go figure !Honorable mention goes to the following staff members : #1=Orlando - busboy - went beyond the call of duty#2  3 = Robert and Dariana - bartenders / beyond wonderful people / sweet,kind, helpful, fun#3=Akon - entertainment staff - friendly, great exercise instructor, good person all around#4=Eddy - Food service - friendly, kind, pleasant#5=Felix - Chef - made great egg-white omelettes and was kind and friendly#6=Luis - Guest Services - Attentive and willing to listen and help#7= The rest of the staff - food and beverage, entertainment, and general - most kind and helpful.

<Content>Beautiful Resort Stayed there first week of Dec. 2008. Weather was wonderful. Not too hot, plenty of shade and chairs at the beach. The beach vendors were not too aggressive. Do bargain with the vendors, the necklaces started at $40 and came down to $12, even the vendors that sell the excusions you can get them to come down in price with a big smile and telling them its too expensive. Do learn some common Spanish phrases. You are their guest. So be polite and don't act like a snob or look down on them. The morning aerobics, dance lessons were very nice. The staff of the entertainment team, Alex, Geronimo, Jhon, Akon, and Naomy are worth mentioning for all their hard work and efforts to entertain you. The evening shows are very good. The dancers and singers are excellent. The negative part of this trip was having mosquitoes in your room. Since they leave your door wide open when they come clean your room, the mosquitoes get in your room and they buzz around at night. Make sure you complain and ask for the bug spray. Spray the room before you go out for the evening show. We got bit several times even with the spray. The speciality restaurants are where you want to go eat. The food is of a higher quality than the standard buffet restaurant. Everyone works hard there, from the morning egg chef, the restaurant workers, the bartenders like Carlos and Maria, to the grounds keepers. Please tip them a few dollars each day. They will remember you and greet you like a famly member. Do go on the excusions, visit the country side, go out on the boats, they are loads of fun. I took some tennis lessons with Eddy. He will definitely help you improve your game. The only thing that I would want to change for the future, not to wear those plastic wrist bands. They are a royal pain. Other than that, I would go back for the relaxed atmosphere and the speciality restaurants.

<Content>Beautiful resort.... has some issues So鈥? We had fully expected to be able to write a great review on this resort, however this is not exactly the case. I would like to preface this with saying if you have stayed at more upscale resorts you may find yourself disappointed, you get what you pay for. On this trip we opted to spend less and are now rethinking that choice.THE GOOD: The resort was beautiful, the grounds were very nice- palm trees everywhere and it very clean. The pools were great, the rooms were decent. Aesthetically it was good. And the beach was perfect. Lots of room, and chairs/huts to sit under.THE NOT SO GOOD: Food was the biggest problem and the reservations process. Beer selection (only two kinds of beer both Dominican) and liquorWhen we arrived to the resort we checked in and went to our room. The benefit here of booking a paradise club was there wasn鈥檛 a line whereas we had to wait about 25 minutes. We got to our room to our dismay had a horrible view or basically construction. AND we had two double beds. We turned around and went back to lobby and said we had paid for the second upgrade (there were 3 levels of rates when we booked and we did the middle one) and were not going to stay in that room. They were kind enough to get it changed for us. We then went to our room where we had a king bed and a nice view or the pools and such. I believe we were supposed to have the champagne bath robes/ slippers etc but like most others did not receive. It doesn鈥檛 matter, we were just glad they were able to switch our room however they should not advertise things that continuously don鈥檛 happen.Our next disappointment was the reservations/restaurants. We immediately went to book reservations and found out that we could only secure 4 of the 7 nights in the restaurants and would have to eat the buffet the other nights. Now, if we had known this it wouldn鈥檛 have been so frustrating but we didn鈥檛. In addition, we could only book the Italian once while we were there because it was only available ONE night. I guess the restaurants are not all open every night. I usually prefer to eat buffet anyway however my boyfriend was not happy about this at all. Staying at other resorts we never had this occur and were not expecting it. Now, as for the food itself. Overall not good. I have never been on vacation whether it is a resort or cruise where I eat less then I do at home. But yes, this did happen. And my boyfriend, was even more disappointed then I was. I know you can鈥檛 please everyone all the time but I would find it hard to believe there are more people who enjoy the food then not. The buffet seemed to always have the same things over and over and it just wasn鈥檛 good. Also, there needs to be more of a variety for vegetarians, especially in the restaurants. I am not a vegetarian however I don鈥檛 eat a lot of meat or seafood so it was a bit frustrating. We had figured it was just that it was Punta Cana however we ran into three other couples/people who said it was different and better at other resorts in Punta Cana. We did speak with Mike the manager to express our concerns about not being able to eat in the restaurants every night and he was very nice and explained that is common.Also, expect when you go to eat for it to take a long time- hours so don鈥檛 go starving. Like others, it took us from start to finish almost 3 hours at Japanese restaurant. And overall it just seems like they are understaffed? It is also really annoying when you go to the buffet and get your food and sit down and have to wait for a coke for a long time. Almost every time we ordered soda it took the whole meal to actually get one. Maybe they should have a machine out like they do at the beach buffet to eliminate this problem. Most of the employees try hard however it is just extremely slow!Then there are the drinks鈥? So they only have 2 beers to choose from that鈥檚 it unless you want to pay for something else. And of course no top shelf liquor unless you are paradise club so Captain Morgan was out of the question. Live and learn- guess we should have done the paradise club鈥?.There are a few other complaints we have small but relevant. You have a card to get beach towels everyday and are only given one each. Some days I would have liked to been able to get more then that. I am sure if we would have asked they wouldn鈥檛 deny us, it鈥檚 just silly.I think that wearing bracelets on vacation stinks, again at other resorts you don鈥檛 have to and we much prefer this. Not to mention the idea that there are different levels鈥?paradise vs. not paradise club. One guy at the bar was asking for bottled water and the bartender told him only Paradise Club people get bottles of water. The mini fridge is 鈥渟tocked鈥?with two bottles of water two beers and two sodas everyday鈥? Could have been more for sure that would have been nice.There aren鈥檛 any hot tubs or at least not with hot water. They are cold tubs! It is always nice to soak in a hot tub鈥? So I just did that in my room. I just haven鈥檛 ever seen what appears to be a hot tub with cold waterThe music they play at the pool and some days the beach are the same songs over and over. It is very annoying, sorry but it is. I am not old (32) and love to listen to music but sometimes would really like to enjoy the peace and quiet too! Or at the very least more a variety of music!We booked through Apple which was a good choice, our Apple rep Evelyn was great! She told us about the Saona excursion we ended up doing which was great. It is a 3 hour journey to get there and 3 back but Saona Island is amazing!!Overall I would never truly complain about being on vacation鈥? It is time away however as I said we have decided that for us at least spending the extra money to go other resorts is probably worth it especially if you are experienced travelers and have been to other more expensive resorts. Otherwise if you are just going to get away and none of these things would bother you, go and enjoyI would be happy to answer any questions anyone might have!

<Author>blondie1240
<Content>Very Disappointed!!!!! Where do I start? Quite lengthy but please read!!! I have travelled to Dom Rep 5 times and I have to say this is the worst experience I have ever had. When we booked the trip we researched this hotel and saw many good reviews on the property so was looking forward to going. We booked with First Choice, the flight was on time and pretty good as we upgraded. On arrival in Punta Cana we went through to arrivals were there was over 300 people standing around waiting to get on coaches, as the flight had landed early First Choice/Thomson had not sent the coach information across so we were asked to wait, which is fine, I'm not one to moan when on holiday. After an hour the people started to filter out to the coaches, there were 4 of us in our party and we still were being told they didn't know which coach to go to and were asked to follow a gentleman outside into the coach park (and blazing heat) to be shown were to go, we were basically dumped in the coach park and left for half an hour, finally we were put onto a minibus which wasn't intended for us but they hadn't sent our transport. We arrived at Edenh eventually and was somewhat disappointed, the front of the hotel has a large white double glazed door, more like an office block than a caribbean hotel, we were the only 4 to check in which was good or so we thought. Hector was on reception and I mentioned I had heard many good reports of him, we asked for rooms close together with a nice view to which he replied he had given us a lovely room and also 1 hour free bowling, we were told the rooms weren't quite ready so go have a drink and come back in half an hour, again we didn't mind even though we had been travelling over 18hrs by then. We went to our rooms after 1 hr and were pleased on entry until we opened the curtains to a building site non of which we had been notified of, so much for a nice room. We all went back to reception stating we were not prepared to stay there and was promptly moved to another room, which overlooked a wire fence, again we went back to reception stating this wasn't acceptable, we were told by Hector this is what we had paid for, I don't think so!! He told us there were no other rooms available so we said we would sit in reception all night if we had to but we weren't accepting these rooms, Finally after 3 hours we were given a nice room with a pool view, strange really as they claimed to have no rooms. We didn;t receive our luggage for over 3 hours. We decided to go eat while we waited, the restaraunt is only what I can describe as Butlins, brightly lit, very clinical and no atmosphere, we didn't feel we were in the Caribbean at all. We had to ask over 5 times for a drink and all the staff look like they really don't want to be there. The food, well it looked like something you would get in prison, I am not a fussy eater at all however I never found anything I liked to eat or liked the look of. Asian restaraunt, what a joke, we had 9.00 reservation and finally got the food at 10.50, they forgot my husbands meal, which was brough out when had all finished and was stone cold, we walked out at 11.00 tired and hungry as the food was dismall. The final straw was 2 days into the holiday, I went swimming in the sea and my husband popped to the loo, his snorkelling flippers were stolen from the sunbed. I went to Customer Services and although I appreciate there is a language barrier and don't expect people to fully understand English, the girl didn;t understand a thing I was saying and was basically told well you did leave them, am I supposed to take everything into the sea with me to avoid it being taken? When I asked what they were going to do about it she shrugged her shoulders. At this point we called First Choice and asked to move hotels as we weren't prepared to stay there 1 more day which they promptly did. All this happened in the first 3 days of our holiday, anyone who thinks this is a nice place must be easily pleased, it is the worst hotel I have stayed in for food, service and bad manners, would I recommend it - NEVER!!!!

<Content>Amazing Vacation! I've been meaning to write this review for a while now.. My husband and I took a late honeymoon and booked the Eden H for the week of November 6th. We were a bit hesitant and so was our Agent since this was a fairly new resort. All in all, I am so glad we booked. Although there are a few things they have to perfect - everything about our vacation was wonderful. Pre- Arrival : Before the trip, I had emailed PC Mike requesting a few things, such as private room and a higher floor since it was our honeymoon. We also brought a bag of items to give to a local school. Arrival/Paradise Club: Paradise club was very worth the upgrade for us. It was only approx. $80 more a person and we had great service, internet access, upgraded drinks and a stunning room. Check in was quick and easy. Room: Our room was gorgeous. Beautiful, modern decor. Always clean and we thoroughly enjoyed the 'turn down' service at night. Although they didn't turn down every night. Since we had the paradise club, we had a jacuzzi outside on the balcony. This alone was worth the upgrade for us. Pool: The pools were amazing. Always clean, great temperature. Lounge chairs were so comfortable and I enjoyed the 'loungers' inside the pool. We had a access to the Paradise club pool - but since we went during off season, it wasn't busy in the main pool.Beach: Beautiful. Always clean. I'd suggest more garbage cans though - so people could have easy access to them. More than enough umbrellas and chairs. Bars: Pool bars were SO MUCH FUN! The bartenders know how to have a great time and really get to know you. My drink was ready before I got there! Inside bars were just as fun, great music, great service. Entertainment: We were on our honeymoon, so we barely saw any entertainment but the people we met there said it was fine and what they expected. Service: We met some wonderful people, Mike went above and beyond what I've ever experienced at an all inclusive, so thank you Mike. The waiters were great. We did run into a few people who could have been a bit friendlier, for sure. But we shrugged it off because it was rare. We did break a glass in our room and it took about 1.5 hours to get it cleaned. Maybe because it happened at 11:00pm. Only dent in our trip.Food: Buffet food was good, not great but good. Different themes most nights, which was great. Restaurants were great! Beautiful decor and service. Desserts were not so great. Okay, alot longer than I thought it would be. All in all, amazing vacation. Weather was great. I'd go back there and would recommend it to anyone. I'm sure if it keeps moving in the direction it is, it'll be perfect in a couple years.

<Content>Paradise on earth Stayed at EdenH Nov 17 for 2 weeks. Loved it! The beach is awesome. Plenty of beds and umberellas for shade. Two skips and a jump from the beach is the beach bar. Alexis and Ramon.....what can i say. Superstars; will deliver your drinks to you on their heads, riding bikes...anyway you want. Where do they get their energy from?! Pools are spotlessly clean. In fact i haven't seen cleaner pools anywhere in the world on my travels.Food is good. Not fantastic, but you will always find something you like. There were 12 of us, and none us were ill or hungry. Special mention though for Felix the omelette man...what a great guy! The staff throughout the resort were so friendly, right down to the gardeners. Everyone of them had a smile and a hola.Rooms were the best ever. Outside bath! Maids came in every morning to clean and change the towels and then came in again in the evening to turn the bed back!!Would recommend EdenH. Also try and visit the Jelly Fish....i don't eat lobster but i was told by our friends that the lobster was superb. Steak was pretty good too!

<Content>Loved Edenh Where do I begin .... I loved it. The check in process to the rooms to the location of the pool, food and beach was great. I have two sons ages 5 and 7 and they loved it just as much as my husband and I. They did not have to walk very far to get to the pool, or the beach or from the beach to the food.The service was great at the resort I thought most of the staff was friendly and helpful. In the buffet, by the time we were ready to leave we had friends.The guys and gals who did the workout routines on the beach and in the pool was marvelous very frendly and helpful. I felt they knew what they were doing.The watersports section was great. The staff there were great Filipa, Luis and Freddy. We actually went snorkeling with Freddy and felt very confident that he knew what he was doing. As with all good things there was a few negatives. I would agree with some of the reviews we did have to wait even though we had reservations for some of the restaurants. Up to even 2 hours for our food. My kids were sleeping at the table at times. Piece of advice, if you are travelling with kids make your reservations early. There were a few mosquitoes, but nothing that a little bug repellant could not solve. I think the worst part was the people who approach you on the beach to go their booths. I think they were obnoxious and irritating. I decided to go to their location and was absolutley disgusted. It is not a place to go with kids or even by yourself.All in all I had a wonderful time and is already looking into my next trip to EDEN

<Content>Wounderful Property We where at Edenh (now NH Real) Nov. 10 to 17 with a group of 11. We have been to Punta Cana many times and this is are 2nd time at EdenH. Our group had a wounderful experience. The beach is the best, and our location on the beach was great. Staff always looking to respond to your requests. Food was good, they even had bacon at breakfast, I've been at many all inclusives and you may get bacon once per week. We really enjoyed the a-la-cart restaurants, especially the Asian-order an appetizer while waiting for the chef to make your food on the hibachi. Make your reservations as soon as you can at the Sports Bar.Upgrade to the Paradise Club, free access to the internet, better rooms, closer to the beach and more variety with drinks. Make sure you get a room looking over the pools. If you like to play tennis, the courts are super they're new, like the resort. Small casino, sometimes they have match play coupons at reception-could help double your win. Make sure you connect with PC Mike, he's a great ambassador for DR and the property. If you have any issues he will do his best to help you out.DR is an incredible value for money, and this property was truly great. Its located relatively close to the airport. Remember the locals come in on the weekend, make sure you book your a-la-carts for Friday and Saturday. Normally we like to try different properties but at least for now we will be returning to NH next year.

<Content>Great Vacation We needed a vacation desparately - wanting to relax and this was the best!We did book the LeMirage as it was only a big more than the regular room. Travelled with Air Transat - actually left right on time and our trip to the hotel was easy. Arrived later in the evening and unfortunately no one to tell us where to go for our VIP check in - no nice drink either. Once we found out where to go then all was ok. Not anywhere near our friends but that was ok. Requested a king bed but it was not to be. We knew we had to get that fixed right away and not wait unil the next day as we knew that would be a waste of time. Tried the over the phone fix with our bellman and finally gave up and back to the check in we went. Click, Click and found our room - ground floor and not the 3rd as we previously had..that's ok too. By this time it was midnight and we were tired. After that, we were not disappointed at all. We have been to PC many times and knew the beach. The hotel is fairly new but the grounds were really nice - pools beautiful. Dinner reservations were easy. Nightly entertainment typical but at least one good show. Restaurants: The Grill has the best beef - certainly not what you'd expect in the Dominican! Cuts with a fork! The Italian was decent, the Asian was excellent and Senses was fine although the beef there wasn't the same as the Grill. All restaurants are all quite warm as there are not open - new style I suppose. Service was good. The Sports Bar was very good - smaller pool table but in decent shape. Bowling was fun - not expensive - $10/hr. Lanes are not what we are used to but that adds to the fun. Tennis courts are clay and in wonderful shape - located about a 5 minute walk out the lobby. Gym is smaller but nicely equipped. Buffet food was good and the beach grill burgers were just like homemade. All in all we had a great vacation- had no problems with language, food, service.

<Content>Change your mind: book another one! I usually don't write reviews, as I think each experience is unique and not everything can be rated. But in this case it was all so consistent throughout that I had to. I'll start from the high pointsBeach (4/5) - The best part of the hotel, and what actually saved our holiday. The beach is nice and clean, especially when compared to resorts nearby. They have nice umbrellas and chairs. The beach itself was not great in Punta Cana, but it could be because of the particular season.Pools (4/5) - Nice pools as well. There's plenty of space for everyone. I didn't like too much the Jacuzzi's they had there: air was too strong and not uniform. Rooms (4/5) - Rooms are nice. Furniture is new, the bathroom is very good and spacious. Try to avoid external rooms on the Punta Cana building: there is a construction site which is quite noisy during the day and makes it difficult if you want to rest in your room.Cleaniness (4/5) - Nothing to say about it, if not that a few times they came to make up our bedroom after 6:00 p.m.Bars (2/5) - Nice bar tenders, but drinks are quite bland. One major problem is the fact that most of the staff don't speak English. The only bar with a menu is the Sports Bar. In all the others you have to know in advance what to order: if, like me, you are not expert in drinks, you'll end up ordering the same thing over and over again. Once I tried to ask two bar tenders if they had any coconut-based drink which wasn't a Pina Colada or a Coco Loco. After 10 minutes I gave up and ordered a Pina Colada and a Coco Loco.Food (2/5) - Food quality is just OK. A the buffet, variety is an issue: maybe 90% of the dishes are the same all the time, or just a slight variation of the previous day. Most of the food is not properly labelled, so if you have specific needs (e.g. vegetarian, like my wife) it will be a problem. Pizza is very bad (I'm Italian, I know what pizza should be like). The beach buffet is terrible: fruit is very scarce and they have the same things every day. Trays are open and eaten by insects all the time. Fruit was surprisingly bad everywhere: in the UK you can find much better quality fruit at Asda, and that says it all. A la carte restaurants are a bit better quality.Entertainment (1/5) - Just some fitness and dance lessons on the beach in the morning. In the evening there's literally nothing. Super-boring!Service (0/5) - The worst experience of my life in a hotel. The only good guy we found was a waiter who helped us with my wife's dietary needs in one of the restaurants. Other than that, I'll just mention the main things. When you land in the Dominican Republic they will start filling you head up with this story that a dominican minute lasts 120 seconds, which would have been great if it was true. They say don't rush, you're on holiday! That's correct, we are on holiday, others are supposed to work. Even tips don't make things faster.Our check in took one hour. We urged them to deliver our suitcases immediately, since we had been travelling for 20 hours and we needed a shower. After 40 minutes the luggage was not yet there: we rushed back to the reception and found our suitcases lying out of the entrance, nobody attending them. We picked them up and carried them ourselves. Our room was on the cunstruction side. We asked to change room, and that operation took another 1.5 hours. The situation again was solved by my wife who picked up the new keys at the reception, after the guys told us we have sent them half an hour earlier.Reception only gives you a map of the hotel and a poor-quality photocopy (text only) with a list of bar/restaurants and main activities. There's nothing in the rooms (no brochures, cost guidelines, etc...). Dressing code is a question mark: people walk in bath suit by the reception (where there is a reminder to dress properly) while we were almost kicked out from the Sports Bar for the same reason (no indication whatsoever about dressing code there).Most of the times at the buffet we would end our meal without getting any drinks: waiters are too slow, and sometimes they just don't come to your table. Again, tips don't help.A la carte restaurants are terrible: half of the tables are empty and there are 20 people queuing up out of the door for 40 minutes after their booked time. In the italian restaurant we waited 45 minutes before getting a starter (some simple salad).The best of the best happened the last day. We asked for a late checkout at 2:00 p.m.. Again, we had to go to the reception 3 times to understand how to do it. They eventually told us to go there at 7 (!!) in the same morning we were leaving. Of course when we got there they told us it was the wrong time and we should have come later. Anyway, we finally managed to convince them, and they kept a complimentary 5 dollars tip without asking. We pretended not to see. At 1:00 p.m. (one hour before the check-out) we made our way towards our room, only to find it locked! Our stuff still inside, we still needed to prepare everything! And, of course, we were absolutely certain that we needed a lot of time to solve the situation. And in fact I had to run twice to the reception to try and get new keys (which weren't working). By the way, the reception was maybe 300 meters away from our room! We called each and everyone and they just didn't seem to bother. I had already decided to knock the door down when a man showed up and opened it up for us by tweaking the electronic lock. 45 minutes, just 15 minutes away from the checkout!These are just the few things worth mentioning in a weeks stay. Basically everyday we had issue after issue with the reception or the service in general.Overall I have to rate the hotel with the lowest score, even though it does not reflect the average of the other scores: service is always the first thing in a hotel.Change your mind if you're thinking to book this hotel!

<Content>Middle of The Road Like many reviews on here, some are great, some are poor. I think this resort and area are a 3 out of 5. The beach is probably the best stretch of beach in the area. There is a bit of seaweed but it is cleaned up on a regular basis. The location of the resort is nestled with other resorts. It is close to the airport and a few other amenities but I must say, there is not much to do around this area. There are some excusrsions that can be done, but most require you to travel some distance to complete. Keep in mind, most roads are dirt roads that are not looked after very well. We went on the outback safari which paints a very good picture on how people live and survive outside the resort, trying times to say the least for these people. The Real Playa shopping center is very expensive but does offer some amenities.Our experience at the airport was very pleasant. The check in and check out at the resort was very good. The staff are great and are very friendly. Special thanks to Maximo at the front desk, Alexis and Ramon at the swim up bar and Anthony who is a young bartending helper and server. They are special staff who go the extra mile. The egg and omelet maker, Felix always remembers your name, is always smiling and does great eggs however you prefer them. Richard is the wine expert and works in the four restaurants, buy your wine through him for the best selection as the house wine is very poor.There are 3 pools that are nice, various fountains that are on timers but need to be on more to make the ambiance more appealing. The entertainment staff do there best with what they are given but I feel more investment in this area is needed if they want to compete with other resorts in the area. The casino is small and limited, many people seem to agree that the card tables are very hard to win on.The rooms are a good size but there are issues here. The amenities provided each day were not consistent. One day you would get hand towels and face cloths, the next day you wouldnt. Sometimes your fridge is replenished, sometimes it isnt. Sometimes your room is washed and swept, other times it isnt. We had a coffee stain in our bathroom for 4 days, we left it on purpose to see what type of attention to detail there was by the maid service. We had to take our sheets off to get them changed for example. I would have to say, the maid service is the poorest I have experienced at any resort I have been at. Poor supervsiory skills at hand or they would of picked up the inconsist maid service. There are tiles that are cracked in the bathroom, some along the hallways and other general areas throughout the resort. Lights burnt out in the elevator for days, plus the elevators smell of something that we just couldnt put our finger on.The gift shop is average at best, limited sizes and over priced. Ensure you bring all the amenities you need for your trip or be prepared to pay full price there.There are a few bars located throughout, certain beverages seem to have run out on a regular basis such as sprkling wine, lime magaritas, gin and tonic water.Of the 4 restaurants, Senses is the best, the others are average, all have the same menu and the food seems to be generated from the same kitchen other than the Hibachi at the Asian. The buffet offers lots of food, it just doesnt change up very often so you can see the same routine early in your trip.We had some friends who had the VIP status, it is not worth the extra charge and what you get overall.We had the chance to visit other resorts and specifically the Melia, which is next door. You can tell the difference in class right away. I have tried to cover most areas and in summary, this resort is a 3 out of 5, middle of the road and 3 stars out of 5. The best part is the staff and the beach.

<Content>Great Holiday Had a great holiday at this hotel. Staff were polite and always helpful, I never felt that I had to tip. None of the drinks seemed watered down, infact some of them where a bit too strong if anything. I drunk cocktails all the time and they were yum! I found the buffet better than the a la carte restaurants. I tried lots of the activities such as aqua aerobics, beach yoga, snorkling and diving, and thoroughly enjoyed them all.I would have given this hotel a 5 but I was sick one night which left me with an upset stomach for a couple of days. This happened in the first week, so by week 2 I had pretty much forgotten it and it made little impact on my holiday.I would definitely recommend this hotel. I have never been to an all-inclusive resort before but would say that we got great value for money, so much so that I'm aleady planning to go back.

<Content>Fairy Tale Wedding and all around Amazing vacation!!! My (now) Husband and I, like any engaged couples nowadays, hummed and hawed about a wedding down south and finally decided to go with it. We ended up choosing the NH Real Arena in Punta Cana (Formally EdenH Real Arena) which was the best choice I think we have ever made! We have been on many all inclusive trips to the Caribbean and this resort out shines all of the rest! The resort was beautiful and very elegant inside and out. We stayed for 2 weeks while our group stayed for 1 week. So, we got our wedding and honeymoon all in one!Our group consisted of 40 people and one baby (1yr old). Larger then most destination weddings, but we were completely accommodated, and made to feel special with the staff going above and beyond the call of duty, even with such a large group. To provide guests with service like we received, is the norm for them, but considered immaculate service to us! And, we know that other guests, outside our group, were feeling the same way. Everyone was very happy and fully content the entire time!Being somewhat of a new resort (opened in Jan. 2008, I believe), I will admit, we were a little nervous at first. Not after visiting there!! We did not encounter anything that stands in the way of this resort shining! I would say for not being strictly a couples resort, it is still a very romantic getaway for couples. It is a large resort, and you dont have to be around the families all the time if you want more of a quiet stay. If you get the right room it can be very romantic. I would definitely say it is worth it to go with the Le Mirage, concierge package. The rooms are great and have jacuzzi's on the balcony. However, it is great for families as well, they do have a kids club and there were kids there.The wedding itself was my dream wedding! My husband was even impressed with ceremony and reception, and for a man to actually have an opinion that says a lot on its own (Ha ha jk)! Elizabeth, the wedding coordinator, for the resort is absolutely incredible! She is such a special person with a heart of gold! It is hard when you are planning a wedding by email and crossing your fingers that everything is communicated properly. Once we got to the resort and had our meeting with her, I realized I should never have worried, she had everything completely under control! She is fantastic at her job. She told us it was our special day and she wanted to do everything she could to make it that, and she meant it! I absolutely know I could not have planned anything better myself! The dedicated employees in the wedding department took care of the flowers, setting up and decorating and the reception dinner. Everything was so beautiful and better then anything we had been expecting! We had our wedding ceremony on the beach, and went barefoot, for fun! However, there are other locations you can choose from!The ENTIRE staff was incredible! Even the 1yr old with us got plenty of attention, the staff was great at keeping her entertained! Everyone, from the serving staff in the buffets/restaurants/pool/beach, to the cleaning staff, to the concierge and customer service representatives! Even the behind the scene staff you do not get to see, go out of their way to make your stay the best possible! The management treats the staff great and rewards them for jobs well done! The happiness in the staff shows and reflects in the management.Alexis, Ramone and Christian are bartenders at the main swim up bar. These guys are awesome! They kept us fully entertained all the time! We were always last to leave the pool becuase we were having so much fun with them! Go see those guys! Carrying drinks on their heads, Alexis and his crazy animal impersonations! (Ask him to do the Donkey! - And tell him lady and Mr. Honeymoon say hi!) They will definitely take care of you, they know how to have a good time and are all amazing! We actually were served by Ramone about 5 years ago at another Punta Cana resort, and he had been our favourite part of the trip! Now paired up with Alexis and Christian, they are an irreplaceable team!! Also, go for breakfast every morning in the festival buffet, there is always lots of food to choose from and they even have an omelet station. Felix is the omelet man! He has an incredible memory, he remembered our entire groups name and even remembered my father's name from years ago! (Or if you dont like omelette's, Felix will make you sunnyside up etc.) He is the man! They even have a fresh, made to order, fruit smoothie station. I have to give a shout out to Frederico, one of the servers in the festival buffet, he always saw to it that we were fully taken care of. He did this amazing good luck blessing from his home town to us when he found out we were getting married. It was so sweet.In summary, The sun, sand and beach, is what you expect from any resort. What was unexpected, was the immaculate service and memories due to the outstanding staff and management at the NH Real Arena that made our trip incredible. My husband and I look forward to visiting this resort again as well as other NH destinations.

<Content>EdenH is great until 8! We went 11/14/08-11/22/08 for our honeymoon and had a blast! It's such a beautiful resort and overall, we loved our trip. Below, I will put my honest, long (sorry) review from start to finish...remember, it is a new resort that is going through some growing pains, but don't fall for the bad reviews on here - those ARE NOT ACCURATE! EdenH is an awesome place with an amazing staff. :)...Arrival - quick and easy at the airport, we went right to the travel agent/tour desks, found Fun Jet and they sent us on our way via AC van. It is only a 15 minute drive from the airport, which is really nice!Check in was a breeze - we were Paradise Club and Gabriel and Daniel were always taking great care of us. From what I could see regular stay check-in was easy for arriving guests too.Room - we were in 1438 (you're the man PCMike) and our view was incredible - of the entire resort pools and beach - gorgeous! I see why some people would hate that hole in the wall depending on who they are with at the resort, but for our honeymoon, WE LOVED IT! LOL!Room service - Club sandwhich was awesome, we got one late night every night and shared. Housekeeping - perfect! We left a few bucks daily, I wrote in spanish (limited spanish) for 4 towels and 4 waters daily, it was done. On days we wanted our room cleaned earlier or later, I called and asked and it was done.Spanish - you don't need to be fluent, but come on guys, it's a spanish-speaking country and let's just say my 4 years in school came in handy. I remembered the basics and my husband who doesn't know spanish caught on quickly. The resort even gives you a cheat booklet in your room for translation.Food - buffet was good for breakfast, excellent for lunch, decent for dinner. A la carte dining was the best, except for the Asian - not my favorite. The others were really good and Senses is amazing - Eddy and Edward are great! Be sure to book your reservations right away in the Sports Bar around 10:30AM.Bars - Alisios and Tahntra are great and fun most nights. One is cool on the roof with an open air/relaxed feel, the other is more upbeat with fun dancing! Casino SUCKS! Sports bar - fun to catch the games and bowling is lots of fun. We played a lot of pool there in the middle of the day to cool off because the AC in that bar is always super high.Gift shop is way to expensive, vendors come on sight on Friday nights and try to rip you off, but can be talked down to next to nothing. I, personally loved that - I love to barter and it kept me from having to go off site for shopping.Pools - are unbelievably nice - there are 5 and we spent most of our time at the Paradise Club pool on the left, facing the beach. Carlos was the man and kept the drinks coming and I loved laying my head back on the in-pool pillows while reading my books in the sun.Main pool bar is the best bar though - most action and RAMON IS THE BEST!!! Order a wazzuuupppp and tell him the Vans sent you! We loved him.The poolside food was good, burgers, hot dogs and great rotisserie chicken. We ate there often - great pizza.Alcohol - I wish they had gingerale for my rum, but no and you have to ask for limes for your rum and cokes. Wine was really bad, but after a few I forgot. El Presidente the beer, not bad. Lots of coke and sprite and bottled water.Beach - this was the best and our favorite part - it's long, beautiful, you feel safe walking down it, even past our resort. There are vendors up and down the beach who offer activities and items, but a simple no gracias sent them away no problem and they were never actually allowed onto the resort. The waves aren't that rough, the sand is a beautiful color and it's always breezy. The individual huts are great with chairs and tables. There are always some available, but get there around 7AM for the first row, they go quickly, for obvious reasons.Activities - during the day, this place is a lot of fun. Akon is great and he and a few other guys teach stretching classes, water aerobics classes and dance classes on the beach. They are so much fun and can coax anyone into dancing, including my husband which is a miracle! At night however, it changes. The place seems to shut down outdoors at 6PM - it literally just dies. Then, most are eating dinner, showering up, etc. Then around 9PM, people gather in the courtyard for the 9:45PM shows. The shows, to be honest, are really bad. They are pretty quick, never start on time, usually don't make sense and always seem to make you want to leave after the first 10 minutes. That does need improving. But, we just overall took advantage of the earlier nights and caught up on sleep - :)Off premises - the Outback Safari is the best excursion ever - it's all day, fun, you learn a lot, you see a lot and our guides Omar and Papi were the absolute best! The only other excursion we did was Bucaneros mini speed boat and snorkeling. That sucked. Not worth the $150 - they were 45 minutes late in picking us up, it lasted only an hour and a half and our boat didn't work properly. The snorkeling was beautiful though and we really loved that. DR has some of the best snorkeling I've ever seen. These excursions though aren't from the resort, but they have tour desks there to book them with the companies.Anyway, hope this helps. I tried to be honest. Overall, a 9 - just improve on the nightlife and you have a perfect 10!

<Content>never agin I was at the edenh the week of 11/14/08 thru 11/21/08, first of all I just want to say my complaints are not going to be about my opinion just facts. The building is not up to a five star, the workers try their best but it is just not a good experience at this resort. The beach bar would run out of beer and most alcohol on a daily basis, at least one of the days they were out of most food at the beach snack bar when I ask if there was more on the way I was told no, this was three in the afternoon and the snack bar is open to six. We tried to make a reservation for dinner at one of the four restaurants and could not because they were booked you are told you will get three or four dinners at these restaurants but you can鈥檛 because two of the four were closed on a given night. The mini bar at the room was never stocked until we complained this was on Tuesday and we arrived on Friday and then they only placed I can of beer in the mini bar no water or pop. One of the couples traveling with us had a problem in their room the tub from the floor above leaked into their room when they called the front desk it took a day and a half to have anything done about it. In our room they cleaned the room took the dirty towels away and did not replace them. This is an all inclusive resort when one of my friends ask for a glass of wine at the snack bar he was told no, thank god for Ram贸n he went and got it for us. My wife ask for a vodka and orange juice and got rum and orange juice not a mistake because some with the pink up grade bracelet ask for the same and got it from the same person. I do not know why but six out of eight of had got sick and many more we spoke to at the resort also did, my wife is still sick today and is going to see a doctor a.s.a.p. I know there have been good reviews on the edenh but it seems these people have never been any other place to compare. I know we will never go back even if it was free, there were many other things wrong but I do not have the time to list them all.

<Content>Great Vacation We stayed at EdenH from Nov6-13 and had a great stay. I must say we had good experiences and bad experiences throughout the week. The good: the beach, some staff (Alexis, Ramone, Felix, Hector-front desk, Darling, Andreiws), food at the al- a- carte restaurant, beautiful resort itself, many beach chairs to choose from.The bad: Service (except for the few mentioned above). When we checked in on Nov 6, we were not greeted at all. The lady checking us in did not talk to us at all. I understand there is a language barrier although not even an attempt was made. I did not let this episode affect my stay....There also seemed to be a lack of communication between employees. (ie. one employee telling me a service was not available to me, while another employee said it was fine) The food in buffet was disappointing. I found there was a distinct smell walking into the dining room, whether it be for breakfast, lunch or dinner. We did not care for the food at the beach grille. The selection and food itself was not very good. The drinks at the resort were disappointing as well. My husband and I are not big on drinking, but like the occasional mixed drink. Each time he would order a tequila sunrise, it would something different. We enjoyed our stay despite all of the things mentioned. It would have been nice if the staff could communicate in english, although going to the Dominican, you have to prepare for this. I would definitely return if I were to go back because I like the size of the resort (not too big ) and the staff that did make it a memorable vacation.

<Content>Horrible Food  We travel with a group fo 15-30 people about every 18 months. We have had several wonderful vacations. This time there were 19 in our group. We arrived at the EdenH on Monday, November 10 at about 1:30 p.m. we were told that check-in was 3 p.m., so we went to the buffet. When we went back at 3 p.m. we were told our rooms would be ready in 30 minutes. When we finally go into our rooms at 5:15 p.m. we were totally frustrated, little did we know that would just be the beginning of our frustrations.The buffet had a distinctive odor when you walked into the restaraunt. Very little of the staff could understand any English, including the staff at the front desk. We turned in all of our dinner reservations at the same time and when we received our slips we were booked in restaraunts beginning the day we were leaving the resort. Even though they have 4 restarants for dinner, they only have two restaraunts open each night so it is very hard to get reservations. Several people in our group called for towels and got them six hours later. One person went to the front desk at 10 am to get change for a $50, was told to come back at noon, was told to come back at 1:30, was told to come back at three, never got change.Out of 19 people 10 were very ill while we were there and the rest of us have been sick since we got home. The food was the worst we ever had.It is so sad because it was one of the beautiful resorts we have ever stayed at. It is large, great beach, nice rooms. They need to send their staff to hotel management school. Even the restaraunt food was not good. They need better food and improved service. I can tell you it makes me never want to return to Punta Cana.

<Content>At the NH Real Arena Now, and Loving it, thanks to Mike Bryant My Wife and I arrived at the NH Real Arena,(they are in the prossess of changing the name from EdenH, and what a gorgeous place this is. Ten seconds after we arrived at the resort, Mike (best PR man in the business) introduced himself to us We talked about the resort and he repeatedly thanked us for choising the resort. As we checked in for our room, Mike assisted us throughout the short process. We were then transported to our top floor suite overlooking the pool and Ocean. I believe Mike had something to do with our accomidations. The room is perfect. The bed is nice and firm, there are tons of lights, and the view is to die for. The mini refridge had 2 waters, 2 beers, and 3 (20oz) bottles of coke products. Our surprise is that we had Presidente beer We were upgraded by the hotel to a Paradise room for unk reasons, but we are not complaining. As far as the food,, so far we have eaten dinner at the buffet,and st Senses,and the food was great. IF you go hungry here, we know whos fault it is. The employees are all trying their best and are doing a darn good job. I will write again after the week is over, but for now we couldn't be happier. I want to again thank Mike for all that he has done for us and for what he has done for the resort. He is such a big part of the resorts success. If there is any doubt about this resort, feel free to write me. As far as all you whiners, this is a country that is trying real hard to be a travel destination, and no, everyrtng is not perfect. But this is your vacation, and enjoy. I don't think anyone who wants to relax, or wants to do everything will be disapointed. Time to go bowling. or is it watching the Steelers in the sports bar........Toledosfinest.

<Content>Plusses and Minusses PLUS: Gorgeous Beach, Large Rooms with patio and private jacuzzi (Paradise Club members), bowling alley, casino, spectacular pools and grounds, friendly staffMINUS: Food was absolutely terrible (what there was of it). Difficult to get dinner reservations at restaurants. Definite language barrier with staff...although friendly and helpful, they do not understand English. No top shelf liquor as promised at pool bars. Just returned from a week at EdenH. Great location (20 mins from airport). Just loved the beachfront area...plenty of lounge chairs and shade and the water is spectacular. Loved the room although housekeeping inconsistent at best. No towels one day, no bottled water the next, leaky toilet one day, sink stopped up the next...NO HOT WATER FOR THREE DAYS!! Cold showers only!! Biggest issue was that we paid extra to be Paradise Club members and were not able to take advantage of amenities such as top shelf liquor (they ran out and never replenished), or dinner reservations (we asked for 6:30-7 time slot but were given 8:30 PM reservations even though restaurants were only half full. Didn't matter much since food all around was just terrible. No variety and lots of island food, not American. We did complain to the manager but nothing changed. Talked to lots of people that felt the same way...none of us would go back which is unfortunate because the location is just perfect.

<Content>Nice Resort I stayed at the EdenH for four nights with my boyfriend. I would give this resort an okay rating. There was NOTHING terrible, but nothing exceptional either. We arrived and we upgraded to a Paradise Club room - I would reccomend these rooms, because then are rooms WITHOUT the whole in the wall from your bed to the bathroom. There are also two seperate small pools right by the beach for people staying in the paradise club rooms - and that was nice to have the option to use those pools. The landscape, still needs some work. During the day, it looks very bare and desert like. For me, I do not mind that - but for people who want lush and tropical - this is not the resort for you. At night, however, all the palms and greenery have spotlights on them, and I have to say it was very beautiful. The food was okay. The first day, I had a hard time finding something I liked. I did not care for the beach grill buffet, but the main buffet was just fine. We tried to make dinner reservations and could only get in two of the four nights during our stay. The Hibachi dinner was FANTASTIC and the romantic resteraunt (gourmet) was just okay. The staff are VERY friendly and willing to try and help you all the time. Not very much english spoken here, and it was hard to communicate - but we are in another country - so no big deal - but if you know Spanish, it will sure help you here. The beach is wonderful! Very soft and clean and well kept. The pools are also very clean and well kept. We were in and out of the water all day long - which was nice. I would never say this is a bad resort - but it is not the best either. If you get a good deal, absolutely I would reccomend this resort! It is good for couples, and families. Nice layout of the property and good size of pools and beach. We never had a problem getting a chair. It was just fine.

<Content>Great Staff Hotel experience was wonderful. Its the staff at this hotel that makes the vacation a great experience. The activities team is wonderful and a shout out to Naomy, John, Jose, Geronimo and Akon for always having a smile and keeping the energy levels up. Food at the Asian was excellent and the breakfast buffet is highlighted by Felix, who has a remarkable knack for remembering everyone's name and where they're from. Great ommelets Felix!

<Content>Friends in Paradise Let鈥檚 see, where do I begin? I guess from the beginning. Many reviews I鈥檝e read start with the flight and airport experience, and somehow correlate it with the resort. So here goes nothing鈥?Flight was an hour early, with smooth sailing the whole way. The airport was as beautiful as I remember it, and within 15 minutes of de-boarding I had my luggage, transfer bus assignment, and 4 cold Presidentes for my wife and I. Thanks EdenH! I owe that all to you! Ok, seriously now, resort controlled stuff only. Check-in. Upon arrival, Henry greeted us with a smile, grabbed our bags, and sincerely asked us how our trip was. After a quick chat, he opened the door and with his tremendous smile said 鈥淢y friends, Welcome Home鈥? We then went to the front desk (forgetting we were Paradise Club) and were politely told where we needed to go. The Lounge is very nice and comfortable and everyone was great. We were assisted by Daniel, who honestly words cannot describe. The few that come to mind are intelligent, articulate, kind, and amazing. Needless to say, check-in was a breeze. Since our flight was an hour early and we were about 3 陆 hours before the actual check-in time, we had the opportunity to meet Mr. PCMike himself. His reputation precedes him and his character backs him up. An incredible man that is not only an asset to the resort, but honestly, the world is a better place with him in it.  Room. After about an hour walking the grounds and having a drink or 3, our room was ready. Henry escorted us to our room and brought our luggage in. It was nice- room to walk around, comfortable. It overlooked the pool and had a great view of the beach and ocean. Had a small problem with the toilet making a loud noise, which was promptly taken care of by the maintenance man that Daniel sent up. That鈥檚 about it for the room. I loved it, but didn鈥檛 go to paradise to sit in a room. Restaurants. Since tastes are so different and subjective, I鈥檒l say this鈥?Ate at all of them, no favorites, liked them all. I think they did a really good job keeping variety in the buffet and offering a nice selection. Obviously there were repeats, but a few different dishes every time I went (2 dinners, a few lunches, and almost every day for breakfast). The lunch buffet near the beach also provided a decent selection if you didn鈥檛 want to venture too far from the pool. I was impressed with the filet mignon at Senses, the spicy shrimp soup at Asian, the veal at the Italian restaurant, and the service at all of them. My only problem was with the reservation system. I know why they have it, and it was by no means a deal breaker, but I鈥檇 rather wait to get into to a place that is serving what I have a taste for that day than preplan my meals. This also prevented us from getting into Senses on our anniversary. We booked our reservations for the last few days late, so it was our fault, but the restaurant we went to ran out of filet which was kind of a downer. Our waiter, Rafael, really felt bad and did an excellent job not only serving our food, but making us leave with a laugh and ear to ear smiles. The very next night, he was our server again at a different restaurant, and as soon as he saw my wife and me we all had a chuckle. Needless to say, we had a great dinner.  Bars. The bars were great. The lobby lounge had a great feel to it, and different entertainment certain days. Tahntra was incredible, with great views of the complex, a nice breeze and was aesthetically pleasing. The sports bar was a great place for us to pop in to grab a drink for the walk back to the room, or when we first entered the courtyard from our room. By far our favorite place for a tasty one was it the private pool bar, for no other reason than Robert. Robert was incredible! He made the best drinks, was quick with a refill, and was able to keep up great conversation while never missing a beat on serving the other patrons. By the end of my stay, Robert seemed more like a close friend serving drinks at my local pub than a stranger 2,000 miles away. I was also very happy with the service from Christian at the other Paradise Club pool bar. Carlos was entertaining and extremely helpful, but we ended up seeing more of Christian- just kinda worked out that way.  Grounds. The gardens and fountains are simply beautiful, and the courtyard seems like it could be equally set in a centuries old Mediterranean villa. I loved sitting in the courtyard in the evenings, sipping a cocktail and feeling the warm breeze under the tropical foliage. Of course the beach was amazing, really don鈥檛 need to go into detail here, perfect sand, calm seas, and well kept. The resort itself, just adds to the ambiance and enchantment of your holiday.  I had a great time and found EdenH to be a top notch resort. Its feel and beauty are only outmatched by her incredible staff. I went there for a vacation and left with friendships. This is a place that those that make it work truly make you feel at home.

<Content>Can't Say Enough About It Just came back from a 1 week stay here. It was wonderful. The grounds were gorgeous, the staff friendly and helpful, the rooms were great, and the food was above average.Check in was simple and quick. They took us by golf cart to our room and brought our luggage in for us. The buffet staff got to know each of us individually, so that we didn't have to ask for drinks, they just knew what we liked and brought it to us. If language was a problem, the staff person would run and get someone right away who could speak the language.My only complaint was that the entertainment was rather cheesy, but that's really not an issue. You could be entertained in so many other ways.

<Content>Great Service and Beautiful Resort I just recently returned from the EdenH. We stayed there with a group of about 40 people for my friend's wedding. The resort was beautiful and service at the bars was excellent. Thank you to Ramon, Alexis, Carlos at the Paradise Club pool, the 2 Carlos' at the restaurants and Luis Carlos and the Sports bar. They are the ones that definitely made our trip fantastic!! The beach was nice, a bit of seaweed but not a deal breaker. The food was okay, we always found something to eat. We were in building 2 room number 2369. The room layout was really nice and the beds were very comfortable. There is not much in the way of night life at the resort so singles might be a bit bored. We did enjoy bowling and the guy in the bowling alley (sorry, can't remember his name) he was fantastic!! Above all the service was amazing and in my opinion, the service is what makes a resort stand out. We never had any problems finding chairs or umbrellas by the pool and the beach, plenty to go around. I would recommend this resort to people as it was great.

<Content>not quite a paradise As we麓re speaking i am sitting in the check-in area fuming. not only do they have no entertainment here, but no night life either. Not enough umbrellas for everyone. if you go horse back riding you have to have a very mature group. Oh and did I mention that our luggage was rumage through and we had our cell phone stolen from a bag within our suitcase. Making us feel violated and unsafe in our own room. The management staff could give two flying hoots about it, and when they said they 麓d help they were not true to their word. The weather was nice and thas all I have to say.

<Content>Super relaxing vacation, excelent service The hotel is in a great location. The hotel is a year old. I was amazed by their service super friendly people. There are 4 a la carte restaurants and the food was very decent. The only thing I was not impressed by was that we had to make reservations and there was a limit of servings per plate. The entrances are super small so would not bother to even order them. There is also a buffet and a beach restaurant that are great. Overall the food was good. Room service was very prompt as well. For those that are looking to have an out of control vacation no way Punta Cana is not for that. Is very relaxing and there is not much to do. Is not recommended to leave the Hotel since is not really safe and the city is not prepared for tourists. This is why the Hotel is so important. Eden offers nightly shows in the theater also have casino bowling pool bars and a small nightclub. There is really no need to leave the hotel. I was really impressed with the entertainers. Excellent group of people. They made our days in the hotel very fun. They make sure everyone is busy and having fun with volleyball and gymnastics in the water games in the beach painting classes and more. I would definitively come back to Eden. Everyone in the Hotel was super professional and friendly. The water was warm and the beach beautiful.

<Content>Gorgeous Hotel We just got back from staying at Eden H from Oct 12-19. The hotel itself is so nice the decor is fabulous. I really liked how it felt more like a boutique hotel than a Caribbean resort..No ugly flowered bed sheets or porcelain tiles. It was so clean and well maintained grounds!There were many ups and downs to our stay...so let me start with the upsBeautiful resortAmazing entertainment staff especially John Akon and Nadia..these guys were so much fun to hang out with..they went above and beyond to get people involved and constantly entertained guests to ensure everyone was having a good time!Felix the omelet guy..was incredible. This man has such a nice calm demeanor and the patience he had for making omelets for line ups of people everyday for 12 hours is respectable!The fruits were lovely!The Asian Hibachi was the best that I have had in a while...so good that we ate there twice.Alexi the bar man was so much fun...you could definitely tell the difference when he was on his days off...his donkey laugh and straw throwing tricks kept us entertained for hours...All of you 5 really made our trip so memorable and enjoyable!The beach was AMMMMMMMMMMMMMMAZING...the water was so clear on most days. The seaweed would dry up on the beach everyday but the hotel staff ensured that it was cleaned up on most days...the beach was much nicer than some of the other parts that we walked thru.Now for the cons:The food was not yummy!There was no spice or herbs to anything....the only thing that kept me going were the omelets in the morning and the fries at lunch....the breads tasted old.Do not trust wake up calls!Out of 7-2 were on time-3 were no shows and 2 were late...pretty pathetic since it is an automated system.The night shows were so bad I was embarrassed for the staff....the effort was lacking! You would think that with such a nice outdoor court that the management would ensure that there was something to bring people out every night. The shows were indoors mostly in a cold hall which is a nice facility but waste of space. The Tanhtra lounge would make millions if it were in Toronto but it is not being used to its full potential-the music is slow and depressing and there is nothing that keeps you entertained!In general I enjoyed this resort your vacation is always what you make of it...we met some super great people and would not have wanted to be anywhere else!Oh and seriously the upgrade is NOT WORTH IT! It comes down to this would you really pay $60 extra per night to have a robe and slippers ion your room. Your bed sheets turned down at night. Maybe a Jacuzzi on the balcony that you鈥檙e probably would wear your bikini in because everyone can see you. Access to 2 pools that are not the main ones and premium drinks (that u can tip to get anyways) it really is a waste of money!One more note is that yes there are some vultures on the beach that try to lore you into their shops but just be polite and walk by. Shops to the right of the beach are nice they are a further walk but very clean.. The prices are a joke whatever they offer divide it by a minimum of 3...I bought a bracelet and necklace for $12 in less that a minute of him saying $65 LOLI would go back to this resort for sure because I loved 5 of the staff members and the immaculate hotel!I will post pics in a few days!

<Content>loved the employees Just came back last night ...I had to write a review about the employees ...they are all eager to help and always smiling..I would also like to especially thank Naomi, she is so sweet and adorable you can't help but to love her...John and Akon made my morning on the beach a must...Jose is so funny you didnt know what he was going to do next and Geronimo was a great MC. I would also like to mention, the Executive chef Jose was so nice. I was surprised each time he saw us he would stop to say hello and ask us if we need something to just ask. Considering how busy the man was he always found time to say hello. I would have to say my favorite show was their latin night in the courtyard

<Content>Great hotel but inconsistent service We returned from the EdenH October 12 after a one-week stay. Overall, our experience was very good -- you cannot reasonably complain about a new hotel, its amenities and quality. The rooms are very modern in their design, functional, yet appealing. We enjoyed being part of the Paradise Club (having reserved our Mirage Concierge package) which included a jacuzzi on our balcony (this alone sold us on this hotel!) and of course a separate pool and swim-up bar. The buffet was decent in terms of choice and quality given the low-season occupancy (no higher than 20% in my opinion). The a-la-carte restaurants had good menus but the service was inconsistent, as was the presentation and quality of the food. We visited the same restaurant on different nights and had totally different experiences! Senses was by far superior to the others. The bar/lounge near the lobby is great; the sports bar/bowling alley is nice. The hotel lacked snacky-foods, and had none in the sports bar. There is a casino on site we did not visit. The gift shop charges a small fortune for sunscreen so bring lots of it (seriously, it was over $30 for a small bottle). This is the case in Punta Cana everywhere it seems to beware. Near the hotel there are flea markets with the usual Dominican peddlars, many of whom are remarkably annoying, but the deals are good if you're a tough negotiator (always counter-offer with 20% of what they ask, and work your way to a compromise). Everyone sells the same thing so visit many shops until you get what you want at the price you want. Finally, the biggest problem at the hotel was just inconsistencies of every sort... be it in terms of level of service (you'll feel treated like a king one moment and then like you're in a motel the next) or in terms of new arrivals receiving a drink and face cloth upon check-in, and others not, even if they all end up in the same paradise club, or in terms of some people getting rum in their rooms, others not; or in terms of some nights we would get turn-down service and other nights we would not. So, just watch out a bit and don't be afraid to ask around to other guests. In any case, it was a great hotel and I would recommend it to others without hesitation. In time I suspect their staff will become more experienced, more consistent, and more bilingual!

<Content>Just back and loved it We just returned from a seven day stay in the Paradise Club section. The size of this resort is just perfect- not overwhelming by being attached with any sister's properties. The front lobby and Plaza house all the restaurants. The middle of the property houses the buffet and the water fountains. Remaining areas on each side provides the buildings (1 and 2) with the rooms...the closest rooms to the beach and bars is known as the club section .Long strip of beach with chairs and palapas covering their territory.Let me start by stating that we did a issue or two upon our arrival. One of the VIP staff lacked customer service skills and did not provide us with adequate information regarding the perks of being part of the VIP package. We felt a bit rushed thru the process. After our first night- we decided that the accommodation were lacking for various reasons and we wanted to be moved. My husband returned to the front desk looking for a manager and spoke with Alex(front desk staff) who calmed him right down. My husband assumed that he would have to speak to upper management in order to get moved but Alex listened to his concerns and gave him a another room key to go view before moving us.He diffused the situation and provided the solution very quickly in a calm manner. We were very happy with the new selection and faced both the pool and ocean from our deck which was very large. Room 1348 always had air conditioning....hot water....stocked mini bar without leaving any notes. We came back to the room around 1 or so and our room was cleaned.Turn down service was provide just one nite- not sure why. I had researched others reviews and made sure that I brought along some novelty items for Housekeeping. So each day we left two or three dollars along with candles,hair accessories and candy. It is just alittle something to thank them for the hard work and their support.The Entertainment teamwas a big part of our day. Teaching us dance lessons followed by water aerobic. Staff provided a HIGH energy to get you moving in the morning. Thank you Jose,John and Akon! My only complaint with ET was they lacked the ability to assemble more activities in the afternnon- perhaps a volleyball game in the pool or some sort of games that could accommodate individuals to come together to meet and socialize.This could be helpful to the guests so that they feel comfortable to mingle with others in the plaza,shows or at the bars in the evening. Also would have liked to go out to the Club offsite midweek- maybe Tues or Wed.so that there is something to doin the beginning of the week before the weekend actitivies.I was amazed at the food selection in the restaurants and buffet. (Thanks Felix for the omelets and yes there was bacon EVERY day) When reading those others complaints remember that those individuals are just expecting TOO MUCH. Each restaurants had a good selections and it was delicious- we loved the asian but also sampled the Italian and the Shore grill. VIP package also allowed for room service. We called them for ice or the American Breakfast which was a nice treat on the mornings when we just want to relax . Club sandwiches, hamburgers and fruit was the way to go when returning back from the bars..... The staff from each category was ALWAYS smiling and went above and beyond to serve us.So for those of you that are still sitting on the fence and deciding which resort you should pick .....rest assured that the EDEN will not disappoint you. Punta Cana Mike is a quiet presence thru out the resort. You will see him making the rounds. If you encounter a problem or just have a concern- seek him out. He will listen to the issue and follow up with you after he has researched it. We found him to be helpful and a man of his word. Special thanks!!My last piece is the lack of tipping that is done. I realize that all inclusives absorb the need to bring or spend alot of money once you are there. But we were amazed at how many people did not tip or even thank the staff for services they provided on a daily basis. We went thru the $130 in singles and $60in five's that we brought. Could have used more!The staff is one of the main reasons why we want to return!! So please feel generous and incorporate some extra money for them during your visit. They truly work a long day and deserve the recognition of being tipped for their good service.Finally -please pack three or four notebooks for the Dominican children.There is a real shortage of paper down there and kids have to take one notebook and split it between 3-4 of them in order to do their class work. You can drop off your supplies at Steve' Bar or with Punta Cana Mike.Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or concerns...would love to help.

<Content>Loved Edenh Real We recently returned from our honeymoon and spent an entire week at the Edenh Real. A beautiful resort with outstanding food, relaxing activities and beautiful views of the beach. The only downfall I would say we encountered was arriving at the resort at noon and not being able to check in until 3pm. However, upon arriving to our room we were greeted with a plate of fresh fruit and a bottle of Dominican Rum. The Staff was amazing from the Omelt cook who remembers everyone's name. To the Beach Entertainment of Geromino, Johnny and Akon. They made our mornings very enjoyable and taught us some great Dominican dances as well as games to start our days off early in the morning. Lastly because we spent a large part of our day in the pools, Alexis made the week especially enjoyable from the pool bar. His antics and personality always made our day enjoyable. And it was nice to speak to him about the country and his family.We would definately return to this resort.

<Content>wow!!!!! best place to go Superb Hotel! The entire staff was amazing too. Especially, Richard the wine taster, to whom i say thank you for everything, Frederico, who was our waiter for breakfast and lunch, whom through my eyes deserves a promotion for excellence in what he does, and last but not least, Danny, the bartender at the pool bar.This hotel is very clean. Our room was 2463 with an ocean and pool view which was extraordinary. The animators were great too. The pools were exceptional. The beach was very nice and spacious containing an abundance of chairs. The food was delectable. The buffet contained a variety of cheeses such as blue and many more choices as well. The Asian and The Grill restaurants were our favorites, however the others were great too. Due to the fact that we were in the paradise club, we had bottles of beer and water as well as brand names concerning the alcohol. We are the type of people who voyage several times a year and never go to the same place twice, however this time, i believe things will be different for that i will definately return. At this moment it may be a four and a half star hotel but sooner or later it will go up to five or more since it literally has no flaws. I loved it, and would definately go again to this flawless resort. Thank you Edenh Real Arena for a stupendous trip.

<Content>EdenH Punta Cana Review Don't let the reviews of this hotel scare you! My friends and I had a great vacation at this property. We were there Sept 17-27. I am a frequent business traveler and work as a corporate trainer. I am accustomed to staying at very nice properties, and I liked the Edenh. If you are going there soon, I would recommend that you stay there. My review may seem negative at times, but my husband I liked it so much that we extended our stay three days. We had fun. There were many things that the hotel can improve upon, but nothing that I would consider a deal breaker. We booked our trip through American Express Travel and upgraded to Paradise Club. Our pink bracelets got us access to the VIP concierge lounge, 15 minutes of free internet service per person per day, a room closer to the beach, two VIP pools, better (but not top shelf) alcohol, a room that had a private bathroom (without the cut-out mentioned in other reviews), and an outdoor bath tub (which we loved). Our room was on the first floor, which we also loved for convenience. We had a view of the beautiful pool grounds. Paradise Club guests that had booked through other vacation tours also received a lobster dinner, two free 20-minute massages, and a free hour of bowling with their upgrade packages. I'm not sure why the increased ammenities were not consistent. It didn't irritate me enough to complain. We added round trip transportation to our trip package between the airport and resort through Prieto Tours at $20/person. We found the Prieto Tour transportation to be exceptionally poor and would have preferred to pay $30 each way for cab fare. We waited almost an hour in the van at the airport on our arrival for the Prieto Tour Representatives to get their act together. Then we had to stop at other resorts to drop off other passengers. It was a hassle. Arranging our transport back to the airport was equally frustrating. We had to go to the lobby to meet their representative, at a time that they specified, only to find that the representative was not there. This happened 3x. Pay the $30 for cab fare if you value your time!!! The hotel looked amazing at first glance in the dark. The property is gorgeous! However, the construction is about as poor as it gets. The exterior paint job is horrible. They didn't use primer. The hot sun has caused the paint to bubble up everywhere. There were lots of places where you could see that they painted only as far as they could reach. The electrical work would never meet US or UK inspection standards, and the roofing job was a joke. They obviously didn't use the proper leak resistant roofing material because there are leaks everywhere. While we were there, the roof in the main dining area was leaking so badly that the ceiling started to fall down. They closed the main buffet for two days to patch it. The concierge lounge had an area of its ceiling collapse. The fallen material laid on the floor and on the furniture for 45 minutes before they cleaned it up. Our room was really nice and always clean. Our refrigerator was stocked every day, but I had to leave a note asking for coffee. I always left notes if I wanted additional things, and my requests were always honored. I left a note asking for wash cloths, and they had them there later that day and every other day that followed. I do suggest that you put all valuables in your safe. We did not have a problem with theft, but the housekeeping staff left our sliding glass door open on many occasions. This resulted in mosquitoes entering our room. If you do have a mosquito problem, ask housekeeping for some spray. They delivered a can to our room. We used the whole thing in ten days. I am allergic to mosquitoes and got eaten alive. My husband barely had a bite. If mosquitoes bother you, bring repellent. The beach is spectacular. The sand is white. There was seaweed washing ashore most days, but the grounds staff cleaned it up every day. The water was warm and clear. There were plenty of chairs and really cool beach umbrellas made of palm leaves, which leaked less during the heavy down pours than the hotel's roof! We loved laying under them during the rain storms. We brought our storkel gear, but only saw a few fish. We also brought our kadema (smash ball) racquets. That provided us a little exercize and was fun. I recommend that you bring your IPOD. The techno/salsa music played at the beach got very repetitive. We made friends with other guests from all over the world. None of us were wild about the music at the beach. My IPOD made a huge difference. If you can bring speakers, even better. Several of the other guests had them. Also if you're nice to Robert, one of the bartenders at the Paradise Club pool, he may play your music on his bar's sound system. He played mine! His customer service was excellent in every regard. I highly recommend his homemade, spicy Bloody Marys with Absolute Peppar! He also made excellent espresso drinks for us in the morning. The pools at the hotel are beautiful. We loved the shamu shelf with the built-in lounge chairs. There is a really nice volleyball court in the pool, and there are swim-up bars at the main pool and at each Paradise Club pool. Like Robert, the bartenders at each pool were fantastic. Danny was happy to deliver drinks to us at the beach. I would consider myself a food and wine snob. I thought the food at the resort was okay. Felix made great eggs and omlets to order. I also liked the mashed potatoes at breakfast and the fried plantains. The rest of the stuff was below average. It wasn't ever hot enough. The orange juice was fresh squeezed, and the coffee was good. The staff at the buffet was attentive. We hardly ever ate lunch, and when we did, it was always at the Beach Grill, which was below average. We always ate eggs at breakfast and were usually too full to eat lunch anyway. Also, we didn't want to get dressed to go inside to the buffet.We had no trouble booking restaurants during our low season stay. The concierge would have done it for us, but I preferred to do it myself. Other reviews mentioned that the woman booking the reservations was rude. She was very sweet to me. She spoke no English, and my Spanish is very limited, but we got by. The Dominican people in general are very nice and easy to communicate with, regardless of what language you speak. We think that Senses is the best restaurant at the resort and ate there three times. The escargot appetizer was top notch and the filet was perfectly cooked and delicious. We also liked the Hibatchi although the food there was too salty and overcooked three out of the four times that we ate there. We chose to eat there so often because we loved socializing with the other guests around the grill. It was fun. We usually ordered wine from a wine list at dinner. The wine list was very limited, and we were usually told that the bottles that we ordered were out-of-stock. If you get to know Richard, the sommelier, he'll take care of you. (We also bought a very good bottle of wine from the hotel's gift shop at a reasonable price.)We thought that the Italian and the American restaurants were blow average although some of our friends thought they were the best. If you eat Italian, order a pasta dish. They were better than the first course dishes. One night, we really enjoyed lobster dinners delivered to our room. The preparation and presentation was fantastic. We also enjoyed the wine tasting event that was offered by Richard on Sundays at 4:00 PM. His class on tasting wasn't so good, but we had fun drinking and socializing with him and the other guests. Night time activities could have been better. We really enjoyed going up to the Tantra Bar. It's a really cool hang out, and the service there was excellent. The inside bar was too smoky and when our orders were taken by a waitress, they were usually wrong. The bartenders were good. We loved the concert videos that they showed on the projection screen. Also, they have karaoke on Sunday nights for an hour. That was one of the most fun activities, but it was offered for too short of a time. It attracted the largest crowd that we saw gathered the whole time that we were there. We were surprised that they didn't offer it as a contingency plan on the rainy days. We didn't do any excursions, but our friends loved the safari and recommended it highly to other guests. We also brought our tennis racquets, but never used them. It's very humid, even in the early morning. Lastly, we did have trouble extending our stay. Our telephones got no service. (We have Sprint/Nextel). I tried to call American Express Travel collect, and the hotel would not put me through. A Eurpoean guest allowed me to use his cell phone, but I got cut off. So, my husband tried to extend our stay through the front desk, and it took all morning to get it done. No one would let us speak directly to a manager and the front desk staff had no authority or empowerment to make decisions. The hotel's occupancy was only at 20% at best, yet they tried to charge us a ridulous rate to extend. My husband finally negotiated a better rate, but we refused to pay what they wanted for Paradise Club privedges so they made us switch our bracelets to orange and even wanted us to switch rooms. They had us completely check out and re-check in. In the end, we didn't have to switch rooms, but it was a major unnecessary hassle. We know that we were paying a great deal more for orange wrist bands than most of the other guests were paying for pink bands. I've extended my stay at numerous other hotels in the past, most recently at the Newport Beach Marriott and Spa. The same situation was handled by the first person who picked up the phone by saying, Thank you so much. We appreciate the additional business. Would you prefer to stop by the front desk to recode your card key or would you like us to deliver you a new one? I was shocked that the EdenH made it so difficult. All in all, vacations are what you make of them. Ours was about relaxing and having a good time. Don't sweat the small stuff...and it's all small! If you want a 5-star luxury vacation, pay for a Ritz Carlton in the US or Europe. In my opinion, all-inclusive resorts are never going to be on par with a la carte resort. You get what you pay for. And...tip your bartenders and servers. It's very much appreciated and will give you even more exceptional service.

<Content>Just got back from a GREAT time! We just got back from the Edenh Real Arena - we went with 5 other couples and met a bunch of other fun people too while we were there- Overall we had a BLAST! We had 2 days of not so great weather, but we didn't let that ruin the fun.All the negative reviews suprised me - , but I guess with anything there are always people that will find the negatives in things- don't worry if you are going it is a really nice placePARADISE CLUB UPGRADE- We booked the paradise club upgrade through Apple Vacations which included (2) 20 minute massages, a lobster dinner for 2 to include ceviche, potatoes, vegetables dessert and choice if white or red wine- - it was excellent- my sister booked her upgrade through American express travel and it didn't include these things. We all had the rooms with the jacuzzi's on the balcony which were great. We all did have the alcohol upgrade, but found that only certain bars had the upgrade (we were drinking abolute vodka) and they would run out of the different flavors. We later discovered the Allisio bar had tons of absolute and all the different flavorsBecause we did the paradise club upgrade we were able to book all our dinner reservations when we checked in- they gave us a sheet of paper to list which restaurants we wanted to go which night and at what time- we had all our reservations booked for our whole trip. We were able to use the internet with no problems- had 2 computers in the lounge - never a waitCould get cold drinks to include bottles of water any time of the day with lite snacks inthe paradise lounge. They had a bar set up in the evenings tooWe were not treated any different when at the bars- staff was friendly to everyoneCHECK IN: super easy - very friendly staff- FOOD: breakast buffet and beach BBQ buffet very good- especially loved the grilled chicken for lunchDinner- Senses was the best restaurant- excellent filet, the Hibachi was very good too- everyone gets the same thing- beef, chicken, shrimp, rice, veggie- all good, American restaurant- steak good , but not as good as the one at Senses.Italian - least favorite- not bad, just not as good as the other restaurants- didn't eat at the dinner buffet at all.WINE- went to a fun wine tasting on Sunday. We ordered wine every night for dinner (which is not included in the all inclusive unless you drink the house wine) - was irritating that no matter what we ordered from the wine list was also told by Richard sorry we don't have that- but let me recommend something else which was of course always more expensive.  GROUNDS- beautiful grounds, clean,- tons of chairs- ceilings were falling in from the heavy rains in some sections- tiles were beautiful, but could be slippery. Nice to have covered walkways. everything was conveniently located.SERVICE: everyone was super friendly, cheerful, eager to accomodate- always greeting with a hello/ola!ROOMS- our room was great- we had an ocean and pool view on the 3rd floor- room was cleaned everyday before lunch- also had turned down service in the evening with mood music on our TV when we returned from dinner and fresh towels. on the first day had asked for extra water- thereafter never had to ask again- our refridgerator was stocked with extra water every day. Also when we finished with our lobster dinners we called down and someone came up almst immediately to clean everything up for us.We had louffas, wash cloths, soap, shampoo, mouth wash, conditioner, lotions replenished every day.BEACH- tons of chairs- never had a problem getting a chair or a hut. for a few hours before lunch had dance lessons on the beach, stretching and water aerobics- the giant turtle in the water provided lots of fun for the naked turtle jumpers NIGHT TIME- went to karaoke one night, bowling alley is now open, so bowled one night- sports bar had football on several screens, pool tables, went to the tantra bar which was beatiful and very relaxing. We sat in the court yard one night and hung out.When it rained - the Allisio bar played music videos and had different board games, cards.overall had a GREAT time!!!!!!

<Content>A REALLY nice place- forget the bad reviews!!!!!! Flight: We flew Sunwing from Toronto. Our flight was the best flight I have ever been on! Hot meals, chapagne at 9am! Wine on the way back, snacks, free headphones.I definately recommend taking a mid-week trip. The airports were not NEARLY as busy. Upon arrival, we were out of the airport in a half hour and at our resort within an hour of our landing!Check in was easy, rooms were ready!Rooms: very nice, maid service was fine. Ask for water and you will receive it. I always had fresh towels, and everything in our room worked. The only thing we did not like was that the doors on the shower and toilet didnt actually close, they just rested shut. This would not be a problem if it was not for the hole between bed and bathroom, which was NO big deal for us.Pools: awesome! It is hurricane season so the resort is only about half full! We had BEAUTIFUL weather for all but the last day, when it rained all day but it did not ruin our good time.There is a very quiet spa-like pool, a pool with volleyball that is large and a swim uo bar pool. We usually started on the in-water loungers in the large pool and moved to the swim up pool (these pools are only not connected by a bridge)We had orange bracelets (not VIP) and we realized the difference (maybe its the time of year) is BARELY noticable!there was never many people at the swm-up bar and ALEXIS would bring us drinks on his head. He was so much fun! We were a younger (20s) group of 9 people and he gave us so many laughs! We always got a drink right away!CHAIRS- THEY FOR SURE HAVE TONs! chairs GALORE!Beach bar- Great lunch food,could have been hotter. The chicken is great, lots of choices. There is a soft serve ice cream machine we liked. Service here was good- always a full glass of water and a drink.The entertainment staff is very friendly- always making sure you have a nice time. Staff was always tidying up the pool area from cups.The drinks are not watered down at all. We found a rum and coke tasted like too much rum! Restuarants- Buffet has great choices for all meals! French - best one!American- needs some better entree choices. Too many seafood items.Italian- liked the pasta, needed some more less exotic choices for appetizers.. sometimes people want garlic bread and ceaser salad!Asian- A la carte- small portions but good- Hibachi was very good and fun!Reservation- system is MUCH better now. We went the first morning and booked all at once for 9 people.. Minfd you it is low season!Sports bar- bowling alley is open but too expensive.. cute little bar with food late at night!Alisios- poor service, need more staff. But just be patient. It was not too busy most of the week.Tahntra- cool but music we found too chill we did not go in the pool but could have been fun. This bar never had anyone in it, very loungy but a cool place!Shows- we only watched one, it was mediocreRoom service 24hours for all guests! Small choice but just what we wanted.Overall this was a great place to stay. We had a lot of fun, great service and great food! I recommend it for anyone at all! ** if it rains, it is VERY slippery and a bit dangerous, but oh well!

<Content>our vacation We have returned from Punta Cana - EDENH REAL ARENA on August 24th.2008, where we spent 15 days, family of four in two rooms. As a world travelers, and myself having 14 years experience in Tourism and Hospitality, our experience with this hotel was not really how we expected.Firs of all, 80% of hotels staff doesnt speak English, they are not as friendly as they should be for 5 star hotel.We had a problem,or better problems with our keycards for entrance doors,every other day battery was dying or who knowas??? but we couldn get in the room.Thankfully, we had 2 rooms,so we could call the service and wait for them at least 30-40 minutes to come!!! Do we have to remind you that this was our vacation and we paid big money for that.Restaurant, well it is clean but the service is terrible.Nobody to greet you, you have to call them for drinks.....The best part of our vacation and the hotel was ENTERTAINMENT TEAM..they are just great,very friendly,always there for you...Show they were doing for guests was amazing, really proffesional and entertaining..WAY TO GO NAOMYGERONIMO,ARON,JHON,DARIO AND JOSE...If we ever decide to come back to EDENH, you will be the main reason for that. Thank You!Vahedin Dino Mehmedirooms 1418;1420.

<Content>Excellent vacation at the Eden This was a last minute vacation for a colleague  I and what a great choice we made ! The Eden has some of the best staff. They are always happy  ready to accomodate you in any way they can. Ramon  Maria, our bartenders at the beach bar were fantastic. They always made sure our glasses were full  we never had to ask for a refill.....it just showed up right when we needed it! Luis at the Alisios bar was just as great - We never missed breakfast cus we could not go a day without talking or seeing Felix (our omelet maker) what better than a man to cook for us ! He is special. Felix  much of the staff at the Eden left us with some fond memories. I still cannot believe how happy most of the staff is at this resort! Activities at the beach werer aplenty. Some activities charge but are modestly priced. The guys at the pool  beach were fun  got everyone involved in the activities.Our room was on the 4th floor. We had a great view of the pools  beach. Our fridge was filled with drinks, including beer every day. The Festival buffet restaurant was good with many choices to choose from. The alacarte restaurants were also very good, especially the japanese  senses restaurants. The house wine served with dinner is not a very good quality but if you go that route, the white was better than the red.There are only 2 things that I would suggest changing. The music all day is latin which is great. However, that's all you hear even in the disco. One evening, we asked the DJ if he could play other music that people wanted to dance to  he was insulted. He just ignored our request. Another thing. you must take along some cash with you because there is no ATM machine in the hotel  they will not give you cash against your credit card. They offer a free shuttle bus that can take you to the bank at the mall which is close by, however, often times the shuttle bus just didn't show up. To summarize, this is a fantastic place to go  it is not given enough credit. As I mentioned to Mike Bryant, the PR fellow at the Eden, they need to post more pictures on the internet so everyone can see for themselves how beautiful a resort this is. I cannot wait to go back !.

<Content>EdenH Real Arena is a very nice resort, BUT.... EdenH Real Arena is a very nice resort, however, our stay revealed quite a few flaws. The biggest problem for us is that very few of the personnel spoke English. If you cannot speak Spanish, I suggest another resort. While this is a new resort, our toilet seat was broken, the shower head for the Jacuzzi didn鈥檛 work, the faucets in the bathroom sink were loose, and one of the drawers in the dresser was broken. I had a complaint almost daily because the housekeepers would not give us wash cloths. I had to call maid service twice because it was after 4:00 p.m. and our room still had not been cleaned for the day. The bath towels that were supplied were like sand paper. My wife used a bathroom glass to put out her cigarette, the housekeeper only wiped it out and put it back in the bathroom. This resort should use plastic cups.Overall the housekeeping service in the room was fair until we got the housekeeper by the name of Norka I. She did an outstanding job! Before Norka I., the toilet was never cleaned. Norka I. cleaned everything.The t.v. was nice with over 100 channels, however, no cable guide was provided. It is a little difficult to check 100 channels for a program without a guide.The second day at EdenH Real Arena, we went to get beach towels at about 9:30 a.m. noting that the beach towel area opened at 9:00 a.m. according to the resort. The attendant told us that the towels had not arrived yet. They finally came about 11:30 a.m. and we found out that this was a daily occurrence rather than a one time event. We got our new beach towels for the next day at the end of the day. The food at the resort was very good except at the Surf and Turf. The meal there was BAD. I ordered beef tenderloins medium rare and they came out well done. The salad had ham in it and the ham was slimy. I ordered apple pie for dessert and we laughed at the small size of the serving鈥bout 3in.x2in. and 陆 inch thick. I also wanted to mention that the work on the new addition at the resort was started and by the sixth day of our stay, the backup horns on the heavy equipment started at 7:00 a.m. When the construction gets under way, the noise level will really be high. On a positive and final note, the entertainment at EdenH Real Arena was very good. One of the male dancers by the name of John helped us out numerous times. He could speak English well and answered many questions that we had. John is an asset to this resort.

<Content>Great Vacation...Amazing TIme! This was one of the best trips ever! I am so surprised at people who complain, don鈥檛 people have anything else better to do? This is a great hotel for the money and great experience! We arrived on Tuesday the 2nd and stepped off the plane to be greeted by pouring rain. When we arrived at the resort we made the best of it. After the second day we got lucky with nice weather for the rest of the trip. The workers were some of the friendliest and nicest people I have meet. Unlike my last trip to Mexico no one begged you for tips or acted like you owed them anything. When we did tip they were very appreciative. The Restaurants were great! Some of the best food I have tasted. We had no problem with lines or service and thought the menu had great choices. People who complain about waiting probably didn鈥檛 upgrade to the paradise club and didn鈥檛 have reservations made each night. We were paradise club members and had no problems with anything! Our room was awesome, our balcony had an outdoor shower and hot tub. It was very open but at night there was no one really walking around outside so we had no problem using it. The entertainment was a lot of fun. The staff is there to make sure you are having a good time. My boyfriend went up on stage during one of the audience participation nights and won a bottle of champagne! The bars were a lot of fun also they are always making sure you are taken care of. The tahntra lounge on the rooftop was awesome! It also has an outdoor rooftop pool. The pool and beach are amazing. We never had any problems getting beach chairs or finding space. They also had outdoor activities during the day for anyone to participate in. One of the things I could say we had a problem with was the mosquitoes. We killed at least 5 in our room a day. We figured out what the problem was, while the housekeepers were cleaning our room they would leave the doors open and they would fly in. If I could say there is something they can improve on it would be that. Other then that its nature not much more you can do. I did get bit up a lot but my boyfriend didn鈥檛 have one bite. I guess it depends on who they think is sweeter 飦?Overall this was an awesome trip! I would definitely recommend this place for couples in their 20鈥檚 and up. I wouldn鈥檛 say it is very family oriented or singles appealing. There were a few kids there but it was actually nice to not have a bunch of little ones running around. I wouldn鈥檛 say it鈥檚 a big party place but with the bars that they have there we had no problem turning it into a good time. A vacation is all what YOU make of it. Keep an open mind and enjoy yourself, you are there to relax. The Dominican will always have a special place in my heart and I will definitely be back to visit. Mainly because my boyfriend proposed to me at this resort on our trip!

<Content>VERY, VERY DISAPPOINTED!! My sister and I booked this trip six months in advance for a 50th Birthday Celebration for myself, July 29th to August 2nd, needless to say with much disappointment. When we arrived at the Edenh we went directly to the Paradise Club Check in, in which we received our pink bracelets. The boy behind the desk at the check in told us our room was not ready, if we could come back in about two hours because he didn't want to give this great room to someone else. My sister and I did not mind at all. We proceeded to check out the resort. We changed into our bathing suits, went swimming and had lunch. Went back to the check in two to three hours later and was brought to our room by Carlos and according to the check in boy the room was to be fabulous. My sister and I were very excited. Much to our surprise and disappointment we were given a room facing an empty construction site. There was no room service menu, nothing in the refrigerator and nothing in the bathroom such as shampoos and creams as they had mentioned. No fruit basket, no complimentary robes and no bottle of rum. I called down and asked to be moved. This took three hours of our first day vacation which became a disaster more and more. We were shown two rooms which were facing the pool which we had originally expected to receive because we had upgraded several times in the Paradise Club. We agreed to one of these rooms and went back to check in and then were told they were going to give us a totally different room. Carlos took us once again to see another room and said this is the room that we have to take with an additional $330.00 charge. The room was beautiful but we should not have had to pay anything. (In which we are trying to be compensated for, ha ha) At this point we only wanted to continue and enjoy the rest of our vacation since it was for only three nights. The room was very damp and smelly but it did face the ocean. I also want to mention that during our trips back and forth checking out rooms with Carlos he continued to sing a very disturbing song to my sister and I, Don't worry be happy, then you Die. My sister became very disturbed and said to me is this some kind of threat. I found it very unusual to be greeting new customers in this manner!The first night we had room service because we were exhausted from spending most of the day looking for a room. The dishes from room service were never picked up until 24 hours later in which I was about to put them out in the hallway. Our room was never made up after the first night in which I called several times for room service and nobody understands english and the only way we got clean towels that day was finding a maid on the floor and getting them from her.We continued with our vacation making reservations for the restaurants. Needless to say every restaurant had an hour or more wait in a small room that must have been 100 degrees. We ended up eating at the buffet each night except for Friday night when they had the beach party which was rained out and the buffet was closed because of a private party for a wedding so we had nothing to eat. We were on the fourth floor and for the three nights the elevators were broken. On Friday our last day we were advised that the islands public transportation was going on strike. Our flight was on Saturday at 1:30 pm. We were told we had to be down in the lobby by 4:00 am Saturday morning and not 10 minutes late or they would leave without us because we had to be at the airport by 6:00 am before the strike started because it could be very dangerous for us in many ways, such as getting stoned as they mentioned. So Friday night was completely ruined for us. Saturday morning at 4:00 am my sister and I were in the dark lobby checking out. You think the resort would have at least brightened up the lobby by turning on more than one light and at least having a table serving coffe and tea to the poor people that had to leave at this time. My sister and I were horrified leaving in a bus, two american girls that do not speak spanish traveling in the dark traveling through the creepy route they traveled to the airport. Check in at the airport was a disaster. Hundreds and hundreds of people that had to travel at this time because of the strike. My sister and I spent the next nine hours with all the other hundreds of people sleeping on the grass in front of the airport and on the floors inside the airport.I will never return to Punta Cana again and unfortunate for me, your 50th birthday only comes around once in a lifetime and this is what I experienced.

<Content>Loved EdenH, I can't wait to go back in December! A friend and I just returned from EdenH in the DR and it was a great get away. This was my second trip to the DR, I booked the trip at the last minute and so glad that I did. We are going back in December - we loved EdenH that much. The resort was beautiful and the beach paradise. The buffet and restaurants were spotless, and the food delicious. I don't eat meat so I wish the buffet labeled what had hidden bacon in it but there was plenty available for Vegetarians and Carnivores alike. For something different but great, try the yucca at the buffet!!! The attention we received at the main pool bar was impressive. Our drinks never ran out; Raymond makes the best Caipirinha!!!Much of the resort is still under construction, and it was obvious that a few members of the staff are very new to the hospitality industry but this was a minor issue. Due to the hurricanes, the beach party was cancelled but the other entertainment was better then I expected. I loved the Fire Dancers and the show in the ballroom was nice. There could have been a little more grown-up entertainment in the evenings (DJ or dancing) when we were there. This could have just been the timing of our stay but things did get quiet after 10 pm. I'll report back after my next stay at EdenH in December 2008!Take CareCJ

<Content>Unforgettable Vacations **Cindy Miami,FL** Let me start off by saying HI to John from Entertainment. Thank you for being part of our wonderful vacation. We stayed @ EDENH from 8/3/08-8/10/08. My sister and I had a really great time. This is not the first time we visit Dominican Republic but it is our first time at Punta Cana and we loved it. When we arrived at the hotel the guys at the door were really careful with our things, very polite and extremely friendly. Once we checked in, they took us to our room in the golf cart. As the guy was driving us to the room he was giving us a tour of the hotel and showing us where things were. When we walked into the room we were amazed of the view they had given us. The room was very spacious and had really nice decorations. We were in the 3rd floor facing the garden. In general, the room itself was very nice. It is true that there isn't a wall separating the beds from the bathroom but that didn't seem to bother us. You do have your own personal space. The glass doors are built in a way where noone can see you from outside. Besides you are hardly in the room. Well, we weren't. Food: The food was good and no complaints. We ate at the 4 specialty restaurants and our favorite was Asian. We also ate at the buffet by the beach and at Festival Buffet and the food was good. Oh, my favorite was the lady making the fruit drinks inside Festival Buffet in the mornings. Entertainment:John, Jose, and Akon-- you guys were amazing. We had a blast and we never got bored. We did exercises out on the beach, in the water, and dancing lessons. We also did Kayak and other water sports. The nicest thing is that John,Jose, and Akon always knew how to gather a big group of people to participate. I love their energy and enthusiasm. They also took us to a local club called Imagine. Really nice club to visit. There were real bats flying around. Everyday there was some type of entertainment going on in the hotel. I really enjoyed the night shows. I would recommend this hotel to friends and people who want to come and relax. This is a great place. I can't believe how some many people can be at the same place and have different opinions. It is sad how some people go on vacation and critice everything. Now that's a shame.We were really sad when we had to leave. The staff is so friendly that it made you want to stay here for ever. But, I will be back to Punta Cana and I will choose this hotel again. We visited other hotels and we liked Edenh the best. Just enjoy your time away for stress and you will have an unforgettable vacation.

<Author>HOLIDAYSAREOURHOBBY
<Content>Excellent Trip!!! My Husband and I travelled with our daughter and two grandchildren, aged 15yrs and 12 yrs. from 14 鈥?28 August 2008. We booked and travelled with First Choice. We checked in the night before our flight at Gatwick, which was really easy and saved the long queues, which you usually have to check in before travelling. The seat pitch was excellent and we had plenty of legroom for the long haul flight. We were handed visa tax forms during the flight, which had to be completed and handed in upon arrival along with $10.Punta Cana airport is very pretty with a thatched roof. We were met by photographers who took photos, which they try to sell to you on your departure. There was a long queue to pay the visa tax following this, and this is my only complaint with First Choice, it was chaos as there was no FC Rep. to meet us and point us in the right direction for our coach which was somewhere in the airport car park. We joined a queue for information and it took half an hour to establish that we were in coach no. 6 鈥渙ver there鈥? Having wondered around the car park in the heat with our cases we found a coach 6 only to be told it was not the right one. We did find our coach in the end but I think a little organisation was necessary.Upon arrival at the Edenh, the check in was very easy. There was only one other couple arriving at the same time. I had emailed previously and asked for our two rooms to be next to each other on the second floor overlooking the pool. Our request was met and we had rooms 1218 and 1216. The rooms were lovely. Both had a jacuzzi in the bathroom and the large opening into the bedroom meant that the kids could sit in the jacuzzi and watch TV. They did not mind the open bathroom concept 鈥?there are doors on the shower and toilet. The balcony overlooked the pretty gardens with its fountains and to the far left the swimming pool and the ocean beyond. The rooms were excellent very clean and spacious. There was a mini bar but it was not replenished each day and we did have to ring to ask for this. Not a big problem, just a bit irritating especially as my grandson went to reception one day to ask if their mini bar could be filled and was told to 鈥済o and get his own鈥?The hotel and grounds are beautiful and nearly all the staff greet you with a big smile and 鈥渉ola鈥? even the gardeners. Most of the staff speak English. The swimming pools are lovely although we spent most of our time on the beach. This was raked every day to remove any seaweed and rubbish left by unthoughtful guests (why do smokers feel they can leave there cigarettes anywhere?). A team work all day to keep the beach immaculate and you have only to walk along the beach in either direction to see just how well kept the Edenh beach is cared for, it knocks spots of all the others.We went to the shows on the first week and these were repeated on the second. The theatre is magnificent and the performances very professional, we especially enjoyed the Pikante show 鈥?the outfits were amazing! On Friday nights there is a Beach Party, the staff go to no end of trouble to lay all the tables on the beach with white cloths and napkins. The food was superb and wine regularly replenished. There was also entertainment later in the evening. You can also buy from the locals who have stalls on the edge of the beach. Their prices start extremely high 鈥?bought my granddaughter a necklace. They asked 鈧?5 dollars for it and I eventually bought it from the same guy for $7 so do not be afraid to bargain hard!Just to the left there is an alley with a few local shops. Our grandchildren came back saying it was a bit scary as they were approached by locals who offered them drugs. We later walked with them a bit further and found lots of local shops selling pictures, jewellery, souvenirs etc. The same if you walk to the right of the hotel. We bought a Punta Cana cap with embroidered dolphin on it for 鈧?. There is a courtesy bus from the hotel to the Punta Cana shopping mall where you will find all the designer shops, they are quite expensive and we found the same cap selling for 鈧?6. We had no problems making reservations for the a la carte restaurants. We went about 09:30 and queued for about 15 minutes in the Sports Bar with a cold drink from the bar in our hand and made three reservations at once for different nights. We enjoyed all these but the choice was limiting and we preferred the buffet restaurant where there was endless choice including ice cream, cheese and biscuits or fruit for dessert. I regretted not booking the Hibachi. We went to the Asian restaurant, which was good, and we watched the Chef at the Hibachi and it looked really good.The kids enjoyed playing pool at the Sports Bar in the evenings, if I did have a criticism it is that there was not a lot for teens to do in the evenings but we spent as much time as possible on the beach, ate late and then either watched to shows or went to the Sports Bar. There were very few English guests, which did not bother us, and the kids made friends with some American kids. We did not have a problem with mossies and after the first couple of days did not even use a repellent.We only did one trip as we preferred to stay at the hotel and enjoy the sun, sand and sea. The kids wanted to swim with the Dolphins. Through the hotel we booked to go to Dolphin Island. We were picked up from the hotel in a colourful bus and had an interesting ride to a local beach were we were taken by speedboat our to Dolphin Island. I was a little hesitant of booking this trip as I do not like to think of the dolphins in captivity but they appeared very well cared for and with a reasonable amount of room. We were allowed to split and swim in two sessions so that we could take our own photos and videos. This we had to do from a distance but there was a photographer present who took some excellent shots and we were able to buy these on DVD. We had about 25 minutes to swim and during this time the dolphins swam between us so that we could stroke them and interact with them. We also had them swim up to us separately and perform various tricks and finally give us a kiss. There another area where we swam with sharks and stingrays and another where you could swim with sea lions. It was an expensive trip but a fantastic memory for us all.I felt I had to write a review as I read so many negative things about this hotel earlier in the year. First Choice even gave us the opportunity to change hotels but I am so glad that didn鈥檛. Overall we had a wonderful two weeks at the Edenh and would recommend it to everyone. It is a fantastic hotel and, if there were any problems in the early days when it just opened, they have certainly ironed them out and I feel that the price will probably rise significantly in the near future.The staff are so friendly and accommodating and they work so hard, we left small tips as we went along and it was very much appreciated.When sadly you have to return home, I recommend you let one of the locals take your bags from the coach to the check-in for you. We paid $1 a bag and it was well worth it. The check-ins are not marked so you have no idea where to go but the porter will bet you a good place in the queue! Another suggestion for First Choice, could they out a sign up saying which is the check-in for their flights?I hope you find this review helpful. We would certainly return if we received the same deal. Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions.

<Content>great time at Edenh! Our family of 3 had a great time on our trip (8/22-8/29) to Edenh in Punta Cana will will more than likely return. Check in was a breeze (about 3pm) through Paradise Club and we were in our room within about 1/2 hour of arriving. After 2 connecting flights with a 5 year old we really felt welcome and ready to begin our vacation. We arrived on Friday which was Beach Party night which was a lot of fun and a good introduction to DR culture. Food was great and plentiful. Chairs at pools and at beach were never an issue. We spent most of ouur time at Paradise Club pool in front of building #2 simply becasue the pool seemed to be more Kid friendly with shallow areas and met other families travelling with kids there. Robert at the swim up bar was always friendly and drinks were good but in small cups. We ate all meals at the Festival Buffet or at the beach simply becasue with a 5 yo, it was easier. We were not bored with the food since we were only there for a week and there was a huge variety for breakfast, lunch and dinner. We were glad there was a selection of Dominican foods/dishes at every meal as well. Table service was fast-we never got 1/2 way through a drink before it was refilled. We ordered room service once and food arrived in about 20 minutes. Alysio bar was nice for a drink before going to the shows in the evening. Our Son went to the Kids Club for about 3 hours on most days and he always had a good time. Plenty of videao games, toys, activites to keep him happy and the staff was very friendly. He also loved the sports bar. Housekeeping was very good and most days our room was clean before noon which was nice. Our fridge was always restocked and special requests were always accomodated. No mosquitos in the room and saw very few while we were there. I personally am more concerned with getting West Nile and Lyme disease at home than Malaria in the DR. The only people that seemed to have attitudes were in the gift shop which seemed to be leased and not run/owned by EdenH and was really not a big deal, just not a pleasant experience spending money. All in all, we would highly recommend Edneh and cannot for the life of me understand some of the horrible reviews we read prior to going.

<Content>Loved It We stayed at Edenh from 8/27-9/1 and had a great time. The hotel is beautiful. We arrived in Punta Cana at about 12:30 and was in our room by 1:30. The rooms are large and very pretty. We were on the 2nd floor facing the pools, which was perfect. We made all our dinner reservations in one shot and had no problems. Italian was really good and the Hibachi was fun. Senses was closed the other days, we were alittle upset about that, but we will try it next year. The buffet was pretty good, dinner there was never disappointing. We didnt really like breakfast too much. Felix is good though. We liked the beach buffet for lunch. The pools are beautiful, the beach was great. Everyone was really nice and friendly. We met alot of amazing people there. Especially the man from Germany that found our ring in the ocean! The best bartender there is Ramon. He truly made our trip even that much better. He always was in a good mood, always fun, always had our drinks ready. He was serisouly great. You dont have to tip but we did and it was greatly appreciated. Some of the staff live hours away and take dangerous drives home after working. We thought they deserved it. Nefti, one of the restaurant managers, was also very helpful and sweet. We didnt see any mosquitos at all either. The shows were fun. We went shopping one day and ate at the Hard Rock. The hotel has a free shuttle there and back. There is no atm at the hotel, which they need to get, becuase you have to take the shuttle to the shopping center to take out money, and bring your passport if you want to exchange. The hotel store is 30 pesos = 1dollar. Everywhere else it is 34. Bring everything you need because the store is alittle pricey. Buy cigarettes from the machines its about 2$ cheaper. But we loved our stay there and are planning to go back next year. We heard they are making a super VIP with Paradisuis, we are hoping that is open. I would def choose Edenh if you are going to DR.

<Content>4.5 + stars We stayed at the EdenH from August 23 th to August 30 th, just after Hurricane Gustar and before Hanna. We had no trouble with the weather except on monday morning for a strong shower. But fortunately we were at the shopping center called Palma Real ,small but nice.Anyway since it was my wife 60th birthday anniversary, i asked for some special requests prior to our stay by E-mail to Mike Bryant in order to celebrate her birthday. I must say that Mike and Clara Escribano (Hope the name is OK) did a great job and we had everything we asked for and even more, but they told me not to tell to everyone!!!!!!!Despite all the negative reports that i read about the hotel, i must say that it was one on the most pleasant stay that we had for a long time. We went to Catalonia Bavaro, Bavaro Palace, Bavaro Princess all Suite and Resort, Majestic Colonial and Grand Palladium Palace and i must say that if we return to Punta Cana, this will be the hotel we will choose.We had room 1462, the first block from the sea, 4 th floor, room 62. The view was astonishing. We had a Jacuzzi on our balcony and a fantastic view.The room was very clean, with a pretty large bathroom with two sinks and a huge shower. No problem with hot water, shower drain or toilet. They came every night to prepare the beds for the night and to put new fresh towels. They cleaned the room every day and nothing missing in our mini frig. No moskitos at all. My only complaint is that it's hard to go lower than 20 degres Celsius in the room even if the setting is at 16.While we were there the hotel occupancy was about 80% so we had no problem to find chairs at the sea, the different pools: 2 for VIP clients (pink bracelets) a large one for everyboby and threeoutdoor jacuzzis. Since we were everyday at the beach around 11 AM, we had no problem to find a Palapa even in the first row. The beach was beautiful, cleaned everyday and the water was warm.We went to all 4 A la Carte Restaurants 1 time at Senses, 1 time at Cinque Terres, 1 time at the American Grill and 2 times at the Asian one. One night we had our lobster supper on our balcony.All that we ate was very good, better than we expected and far more than some reviews wrote. The only one to compare to is the Majestic Colonial, but again it was very, very good, always hot, well presented, a very good relax service, no hassle and very friendly people especially Richard the Wine Expert (Sommelier).Thank's for the wonderfull wines that he suggested to us. Oh! by the way the house wine is very ordinary but i must say the the red one is far better than the white one.As for the breakfasts, we tried the Cinque Terres in the morning fouth times and it was very good The other days we went to the Festival Buffet and it was OK. For the lunch we tried both BeachSnack and Festival Buffet. It was also OK, but not impressive. A little parenthesis about drinks. You can choose from a wide variety of good alcools but some drinks like Grand Marnier, some brands of Cognac and Franjelico are not included in your package even if you have a pink bracelet. You have to pay for those and funny thing about it, if you want Perrier Water, you will have to pay also for it. But you can have all the drink you want at the VIP reception as long as you prepare these yourself.They have three bars and the service is fast and courtois. By the way try the Tentra Bar, it is a very surprising experience, especially wtih the pool, the red couchs and the double beds with ceeling. A little complaint about the music. It's to much latino.I read in previous reviews that people were complaining about a kind of new age music. Personaly we would have prefered this kind of music to the one we hear all around the complex.The best place to relax and enjoy a good drink is in the main court right ouside the main lobby. They were playing very soft jazz and post modern music that fitted perfectly with the surrounding. They even had an outside bar to avoid entering the noisy indoor bars.All the staft was very well accommodating and always ready to please us. You dont have to tip them, but if you like the service and the attention, do it, they will be pleased.. Don't forget the lady that change the towels everig evening. She's also working very hard but people tend to forget her.We even meet the general manager with his wife, very nice and listening people. By the way for those who are complaining about language barrier, this lady is staying at leat a month to try to learn english to the staff, especially housemaids. So you see that they are trying hard to respond to people complaints.It:s a very long review but i hate to see people always complaining and not being satisfied no mattter where they go.Thank's to everyone at the resort, our stay was a very pleasant experience. A special thank to Mike, hope you had what you were asking for!Jacqueline  GuyQuebec, Canada

<Content>Love EdenH We are a family of 3 (my husband and I are in mid 30, and our 3 year old daughter), departed from Toronto on August 24th and returned on Sep 1.Arrival and Flight We booked our trip via Conquest, this was our first time with Conquest, and it鈥檚 not bad. We flew Canjet, and we it鈥檚 basic, with no onflight entertainment. We were given cold sandwiches, and non-alcoholic drinks, and $5 for alcoholic drinks. At arrival, we were taken to the resort via a big tour bus. We were the only family to EdenH, the other were to other resorts. The bus ride was extremely safe! Our guess is the result of the tragedy a few weeks ago in La Romana, Check in was a breeze, we were taken to our building on a golf cart, and along the way, the bellboy gave us a mini tour. Great service, great people! Rooms A big thanks to PCMike, we were assigned to room 2443, which was on the 4th floor of building 2. We have spectacular view 鈥?both ocean and pool!! We loved the room; it鈥檚 modern, clean, and bright. The open bathroom didn鈥檛 bother us at all, as our daughter can watch TV while in the tub. The shower stall was big, and we got plenty of hot water. The resort provides satellite channels, more channels than we even wish for! Our mini fridge was stocked up everyday. When I left a note for more water, we have 3 big bottles the next day, and every day since. Restaurants We only dined at the Buffet every night, and for lunch we went for the seaside grill. The Buffet has a good variety to choose from, they have different theme every day, including Chinese theme! We found our daughter鈥檚 favourite dumpling in sweet and sour sauce. The only down side was their ice-creams at the buffet, they taste very artificial. The seaside grill has the best pizzas, you can taste the freshness! My husband booked the Asian restaurant, but the only available slot was at 8:30 pm, which was too late for us. We end up going back to the Buffet that day. My husband said the staff who was doing the booking has the worst attitude in the entire resort. You either take it or leave it kind of attitude. But otherwise, everyone in the resort was wonderful, always with a smile, and always trying to help. We have the best server at the Buffet 鈥?Juan. He knows our drinks before we even settle in our seats, and he will come by and play with our daughter. Bars We are not big drinkers, but the Pina Colada (non-alcoholic) is the best from our experience with other AI. It鈥檚 not watered down, and my 3 year old even know how to order it at the bars! We visited the Sport Bar once, and we walked up to the bar at the roof top to look at the amazing d茅cor! Beach and Pools We spent most of our time at the small pool (the closest one to the buffet restaurant), which was clean, and there weren鈥檛 a lot of people, so our daughter can play, splash and scream as much as she can without bothering other people. We love how they built lounging chairs/areas in the all their pools. It鈥檚 a great way to get tan and stay cool. There are pools especially for the Paradise Club鈥檚 guests, which are closest to the beach. They are small, and I didn鈥檛 see a lot of people there. Most of the Paradise Club guests spent their time at the larger pools, or on the beach.The beach is spectacular, clean white sand, and not too choppy waves. There were plenty of shades for everyone, and no one needs to reserve chairs with towels. We can find a good spot even in the afternoon. Maybe it鈥檚 the low season. There were security staff along the beach, and we saw two guests from other resort wandered over, and was guided out of the resort by the security. Grounds Beautiful ground; a well blend of modern and Caribbean style. It鈥檚 different from other AI resorts. Maybe it needs a little more colored flora; but we know they are coming. The resort has been only opened for 8 months! Activities and Entertainment Most of the entertainment shows were held at the Crystal Theatre. It鈥檚 indoor with air conditioning, what a change from the open air theatre 鈥?no more bug bites, and no need to spray yourselves with insect repellent after dinner, and wash them off again when you head back to your room. LOVE the idea. We only went for the Latin Party (I think they have replaced the Beach Party with the Latin party during the low season), which was held at the Crystal Plaza. The plaza is in front of the lobby. GREAT show, with a lot of fire throwing, juggling. You can tell the entertainers are highly professional. Departure and Check Out We have late check out, again thanks to PCMike for arranging this. Our daughter was able to catch some zzz before heading to the airport. We were picked up promptly at hotel, and delivered safely to the airport. One puzzling thing was that we never got a chance to pay for our departure tax. I thought at some point we have to hand in $75 USD for the 3 of us! Conclusion It鈥檚 with great pleasure to meet up with PCMike at the resort! I鈥檝e also told him that we would DEFINTELY go back next year for 2 weeks stay, and will invite my sister鈥檚 family to come with us. I would definitely recommend this resort to everyone. It鈥檚 a new resort, and it鈥檚 improving everyday. It has great people, great management, and great potential. Definitely a 5 stars.

<Content>Hated it!!! This resort was horrible. The food sucked, no tipical dominican food. The restaurants have like a three item menu. I found a bug in my salad at one of the restaurants. The room, my first impression of the hotel was a dirty toilet. I had to call them to come and clean the nasty toilet, they came and cleaned right away but it really ruined the experience for me. The rooms are not in very good shape and the main buildings have leaks on the roofs when it rains.

<Content>Beautiful hotel, vacation was wonderful, food not so much.. Ah, were to start. From the beginning, we thought we had bad luck. We got to the airport, and the people that carry your bags for you immediatley come up to you and carry your bags, unless you tell them no. In our case, I thought that this was very helpful because the man took us right to the travel agency representative, to make sure that we got on the right bus. We tipped $2 per bag. A small cost though, because there are many different busses outside of the airport. When we got on the bus, we didnt receive any round trip transportation vouchers from the hotel, so we had to pay $80 for 6 to be transported to the hotel, we thought we would get this back, but no. The ride there was only about 20 minutes, that was good, and the drivers drive very fast so you will get there before you even know it.Check in was a little bumpy, but once everything got figured out, we went to see our room (we had paradise club) and it was absolutely gorgeous. Although, not recommended for friends to share a room, it was mostly designed for couples, as you could see the jacuzzi bath from the bed. The view from our room was absoluteley amazing, and as soon as we got into the room, we were immediatley greeted with a bottle of rum, and a fruit plate.There was about 8 different pools, they were all very clean. We loved the pool bars, there are 3, 2 of them are for paradise club members only. This was good if you enjoy all different varieties of drinks. You can get Absolut, Stoli, etc. with paradise club, but Im not sure how much of an upcharge it is from the basic, so I wouldnt be able to say if it was worth the price (we were supposed to stay at dreams, and they overbooked, so they sent us to edenh and upgraded us) The beach was great, get there early if you want a spot under an umbrella, they fill up fast. They have kayak rentals, and cabana boats for no charge, that was fun.Its important to make reservations to eat dinner all at once for the time that youre there. The food was less than wonderful.. and was not very friendly on the stomach either. Out of all the restaurants we went to, we liked the Asian Hibaci the best. Try for the hibaci because Ive heard that the a la cart asian food is not the best either. The buffet had your usual buffet food, and usually something being hand carved. The buffet by the beach was good for lunch, we ate there for lunch everyday. We ate breakfast at the buffet in the morning, if you like eggs, the omlettes  fried eggs are spectacular, thanks to Felix ;) who was very nice.Theres two main bars if youre looking to go out at night, the Tahntra bar, and the lounge bar. I loved both. :) Tantra was loud, and a little sticky, but fun to dance. We usually began the night in the lobby bar, and then ended up there. We went to 3 different shows, all were really fun. Participate if you get the chance! :)Housekeeping was great, our rooms were always clean, down to the floors mopped daily, remember to put youre dirty towels in the tub if you want new ones. Roomservice was great also. Very timely.The vacation was overall wonderful, I would never ask for anything more, than the food being a little better. Overall we had a GREAAT time. I wouldnt change it for anything! :)

<Content>Great Trip for the Price This was our first all inclusive vacation and overall, we had a blast. Edenh is a great deal for the relatively low cost of the trip. In order for it to be a 5 star resort there are a few changes that would need to be made.Pro鈥檚:*Beautiful pool, beach, and ocean!!!*Quality materials used throughout the resort*Staff was very nice. We especially enjoyed the entertainment of Akon who seemed to thoroughly love his job! Also, Antony a server in the restaurants was exceptional. The staff learned our names and made us feel welcome!*Close to airport* Good entertainment- there were dance lessons, water aerobics, shows, and water sports available, as well as some night life at the resort* Close to outside clubs for additional entertainment*When went to some clubs outside of our resort, it was easy to get a taxi, and the security at the resort as we came and went made me feel safe*The bread at all the restaurants was fantastic!* All inclusive means not having to worry about money or ordering something you might not like!Con鈥檚:*Food- dairy and cold cuts were not quite cold enough everywhere they were served. The food at the outdoor buffet needs covered to keep flies out, and the food out there needs kept cooler and hotter respectively. My husband and I both had stomach issues for a day a piece. The food at the reservation restaurants was better, although anything made with dairy just didn鈥檛 quite taste right or have the right consistency (ex. mozzarella cheese and tomato appetizer, tiramisu dessert).* It would be nice to have a hostess at the buffets. When you come in there for the first time, you don鈥檛 really understand how they work. It would be smoother if you had a hostess help you find a table, and show you around the buffet especially if you鈥檙e visiting it for the first time.* Staff could not accommodate any kind of change for us. We had a group of 10 people, and they could not move tables for us in the restaurants, although they did move them for us once at the Festival Buffet. Also, we asked for 6 beers to be brought up to our room, but they could only bring 2 at a time. You could get as many as you wanted from the bar however. If you were late to your reservation, they refused to make you another one, for later that evening, even when the restaurant was not full. Some of our party couldn鈥檛 make it right on time, and they weren鈥檛 allowed to join us at our table.*Poolside drink service was slow. It was a slow weekend due to hurricane season, so I think they had fewer people working. In the four days I was there, a server asked me once at the pool if I鈥檇 like a drink. The rest of the time I walked over to the pool bar to get a drink on my own.*Although the materials used to build the resort were nice, the finer details need a little work to make this a 5 star resort. One couple in our group had their sink fall off the wall during their stay. We had drywall mud along all the metal fixtures in the bathroom, and the lights/signs on the walls around the resort were crooked. There was paint on the palm trees near all the walkways. The little details still need some work.It would be worth it to upgrade to the next wrist band color. You get a hot tub on your deck, have access to the special pools, and brand name liquor like Absolut.Vodka. I want to emphasize that we had a fantastic trip overall. I know some of these things might be nit-picky, but they were things I noticed. The food problems were a really big issue for me. Another person on our return flight from Punta Cana, stayed at a different hotel, and got so sick from the food that she was hospitalized. So just be really cautious about what you eat while you are visiting D.R.!

<Content>fantastic time at EdenH We were at EdenH from 14-28 August - it was our first visit to DR and we had a fantastic time. Check in was quick and easy, and bags were taken to our room, which as ready when we arrived, and very clean and spacious. We were on 4th floor at the Plaza end of the complex, overlooking an arera of natural vegetation - it was very quiet and provided an interesting view when Tropical Storm Fay paid a visit on our first day there!!We loved the bathroom with the open wall and the spa bath, and our maid left us clean towels whenever we wanted - the hotel follows the standard practice of replacing towels when they are left in the bath. Air conditioning was excellent as you could adjust both temperature and fan speed. No problem at all with mosquitoes (in fact the only one we saw was on the coach transfer to the airport!) - the fogger goes past at about 6.30 every evening and seemed to do the trick.Food was plentiful and varied, and we never got tired of it, there always seemed to be something new to try. Thanks to Felix for the omelettes, and to Gabriel for his friendly welcome every morning and excellent coffee service. We booked all the a la cartes - easy if you book ahead and not try to book them on the day - if you go to book in the middle of the day there is no need to queue, and you can book as many evenings as you want. Our favourites were the Asian (you need to book both the Hibachi and the a la carte table service, they are quite different) and Senses Gourmet.We had lunch at the beach buffet most days as we preferred the beach to the pools, and Danny was always ready with a smile and a special at the bar whenever we appeared! The other attraction was the ice cream machine...... The beach of course is beautiful, and although there is some seaweed (especially after stormy weather) the staff work hard to keep it clear. There are plenty of loungers and palappas on the beach, never had any trouble finding one.We found all the staff really friendly and helpful, but special mention has to me made of the entertainment team, who never seemed to stop. Their energy, enthusiasm and sense of fun was boundless and kept us smiling and laughing throught the whole holiday. By the end of our holiday we felt that Geronimo, John, Akon, Jose and Naomy had become very special friends and it was hard to say goodbye. If you are staying at EdenH make sure you get to know them. Francis - you have a team to be proud of. Both the shows and the beach and pool activities were lots of fun.We went on one trip - Outback Safari - and we highly recommend it, it is a great day out, and helps to gain an insight on life in the Dominican Republic as a whole.If you're looking for a great, relaxing holiday - sun, sea, good food and a bit of fun, this is the ideal place. We will certainly go back.

<Content>Beach and Resort Beautiful, Basic Service- Not so much Just came back from Punta Cana. If you make it through the jungle to get to EdenH resort, pack your patience. First of all, if you're trying to get away from kids (your own or others'), this is NOT the place. I know cultures are different, but there were even kids allowed to sit up at the bars and the Sports Bar. Everywhere you turned, an ankle-biter was squealing, crying, and horseplaying nearby. While the hotel is beautiful, the service has much to be desired. Lots of inconsistencies with what one would consider to be basic service. Housekeeping basically came in to pull up your bedsheets and put clean towels ON TOP of your dirty ones (unless you read the fine print on a small card by the small shampoo and conditioner that says to put your dirty towels in the tub to be replaced, you wouldn't know what to do. We found this out on day 3). The floor and the sheets were left dirty and sandy from our days on the beach, and our mini bar was half-stocked most of the time. Unless you're staying with your honey, the exhibitionist-style bathroom was very uncomfortable. Making reservations for dinner was a nightmare. The best food to me was the buffet. Also loved the people we met. Michael and Santiago (water sports), Maria (waitress/bartender), Akon (dance instructor), Felix (omelet station), and a few other staff seemed to enjoy what they did and it showed through their customer service. Overall a beautiful place, but maybe with some new management they may be able to provide the exceptional (or even average) service that one would expect for a resort such as EdenH.

<Content>Nice, clean spot for a relaxed vacation Rooms:I found the rooms to be impressively tidy. There was none of that funky, old mildew smell you get with older hotels. Stepping into the room was a breath of fresh air. Also, the rooms are nicely decorated and relatively spacious. It's worth mentioning that we stayed in the Paradise Club side of the hotel, which offers a balcony jacuzzi and a bathroom that has a wall (as opposed to the regular rooms with no wall separating the bath from the room - weird). If you're sticklers for suites, you can sweet talk the Paradise Club check-in staff into giving you a good discount. We were able to get them down to $125 extra per night. They get an upsell commission, so they should be motivated to help you. I found this good for us as a family b/c the suites are large and the kids had their own room/bed/bath/TV :-) Suites face the ocean and have both indoor and outdoor jacuzzis. The balconies are double the size of a regular room and have lounge chairs on them. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND GETTING A FIRST FLOOR ROOM. This is especially true if you like privacy and don't want the whole world walking by as you relax on your balcony. Also, request a room not facing the pool area if you don't like noise.Food:The food was subpar, at best. My husband joked everyday about them needing to fire the chef. It's true tho. Taste was lacking. And if you get the chance to go a la carte (reservation system is horrilble), don't get your hopes up when you see one of your favorites on the menu. Most likely it won't taste like what you expect. If you're paradise club, sweet talk one of the reps there into booking ALL of your a la carte. They did it for us, so it is possible. They can take care of all that hassle and have the tickets sent to your room. Otherwise it is very painful waiting in line and being told no, we don't have that timeService:We found the service to be excellent in general. Im an African-American (non Hispanic) that speaks fluent Spanish and English and surprisingly I found that I got better treatment when I spoke English sometimes. That could be b/c people thought I was a local and got a bit too familiar when I spoke Spanish. Just my theory :-)I left no gratuities and my service was fine. I regret not leaving a tip for Hugo in the Las Olas buffet by the beach. He was great. Always had my favorite drink waiting for me when I came through. Speaking of drinks, if you love coconut, order the coco loco w/o alcohol from the pool bar by Las Olas (they all make them diff, so apparently you need to go to that bar)Get to know someone in the paradise club office by name. We found that Griselda was our go-to buddy for any requests we needed. It probably helped that we started off giving her a $10 tip after she worked out our suite arrangements. Sometimes they'll give you a complementary 20 minute massage coupon if you ask can they offer you any massage discounts/perks. I don't think they're supposed to, so ask when nobody's around ;-)If you'd like you can meet the general manager of the whole resort. Just ask the reps at paradise club or reception. Tell him what you think of the place :-)Kids Club:If you got kids, edenh is suitable. The kids club has lots of potential that it unfortunately is not living up to just yet. Some days they are short staffed. IMO the kids club is the LAST place you want to be short staffed. And when this happens, this kids stay inside all day. I would go get my daughter and intentionally give her some outdoor swim time b/c of this. She's 5. They have XBox/Playstation for the older kids. The rooms are divided up into 3 age groups. It would be nice to always have 1 attendent per age group. Like I said, they're not there yet.Nonetheless I still recommend it. Judith heads the place and she's great. She speaks Spanish and English and the kids love her.Overall:Edenh is great if you like nice facilities at a good rate. Service is above average. Get to know people by name. They'll take good care of you. They need to work on the food and providing REAL perks for those folks that fork out extra dough for the VIP Paradise Club. Right now the perks are few and it leaves the guest feeling kind of cheated honestly. Yet and still, we went here twice during our 3 week stay in DR and I'd recommend it hands down, no doubt.

<Content>Eden Overview Hello...We stayed at the Edenh Real Aug. 10-24th...I went into the trip with some trepidation due to the reviews I have read on this web site. My parents are both avid travelers and now travel specialists, so we were sent there (on our honeymoon) to check it out.This is my fourth trip to Punta Cana. So I knew what to expect.Food - It is the Dominican...so the food is different from home. That being said, it was great for the most part. At the end of the two weeks, we were eagerly waiting for something different. More variations of food would have been nice. The Hibachi dinner at the Japanese Restaurant was amazing.Rooms - That was an interesting debacle...after arriving at 12, we were told our room wasn't ready, we waited 3.5 hours went back to VIP check-in and was told that there was no room yet. We got moved to another room, overlooking the empty lot next door and the lovely black tarp. This room wasn't cleaned, it was actually disgusting. My husband went down to talk to Fernando in VIP checkin....We got upgraded to a suite on the first floor facing the pool and ocean. Which was very nice.Mosquitos - We had tons of them, my husband and I had a game to see who could get the most every night.Cleaning Service - Very good. Unfortunately, I made the mistake of leaving out some jewelry and money, which was taken. Guest Services dealt with it well and security came down to see who had been in the room. There had been 2 different people I guess replenishing bar fridge, and turn-down service. I highly recommend ALWAYS using the safe.Towels were a commodity, and hard to come by. We had one maid that left us tons, and the last two, left us two.Entertainment - Were good for the most part. We checked out all of the shows once. The Sports Bar was okay, if you like hanging with a bunch of teenagers. Tanhtra the other bar, was alright, but closed several times with private events.All being said, we enjoyed ourselves. I think this hotel will be fantastic with a few more of the bugs out and some more maintenance on the resort.

<Content>loved it I have to say after recently returning home, this was a GREAT resort and my husband and I had a fantastic holiday. We were green wrist bands and did NOT feel second class citizens as some people have implied; their were MORE than adequate sun beds around the pool - if you wanted one with a umbrella you may have to be up sharpish -8am ish but the situation was not as bad as people imply in many reviews. Queueing for speciality resturants was poor - waited 1 1/2hrs first time, but, you can book all 4 at a time, and we found them all to be great, the asian to be our favourite - actually visited this one 3 times!This is our 5th visit the the Dominican but the 1st to the South of the island, previously flying to the north, and we were more than pleased with this hotel, and would defintly return without question. Room was spacious and always clean, only negative was the mini bar wasnt always refilled on daily basis, I cant believe the comments made my some people and I would without doubt recommend this hotel to anyone and will definatly be returning at some time. I am sure it will only get better with time.

<Content>Nice, but a long way to go Just returned from this hotel Aug. 15th. It is true what all the reviews say, it is very nice, great decor and beautiful grounds. Now if that is all you are looking for, your set. But if you are like me and would like service and hospitality on vacation it's not here yet. This was my third time in Punta Cana and the first time I went with a new hotel. The ammenities they offer that sound great, you should not believe that. The VIP check in is pretty much a joke, it was the longest check in I have ever experieneced. The staff that checks you in, pretty much clueless. There was nothing VIP about it. Some days they had drinks set in there for you with the vip snacks. That is a waste and you will most likely never go in that room again unless it is to complain or check out. Do not bother asking for ocean view, the way the hotel is built they don't have it. Just a few select rooms that you will pay top dollar for, face the ocean. The staff is quite rude, I am very easy going and I can make the best of any vacation so I was surprised myself. The girl who does the dinner reservations was very rude. Basically not friendly and can care less about you, she told us it was booked for all restaurants our first night. If that happens, take the matter into your own hands and go have dinner. We did  they were far from booked. We paid for the Paradise club, honestly it is not much of a point except the seperate pool. That was great since it was less crowded. There are never beach towels in the room. Carlos at the Paradise club pool was the best bartender in the hotel. He made you feel welcome and like you were on vacation. He was friendly  personable which most of the staff here is not. Felix at the omlette station is also a great guy with great personality. As far as the rooms, we learned if you leave the housekeeping a small gratuity each day, your room will be filled with towels, water, beer, etc. A small amount truly goes a long way. There was no bowling alley. The beach is great, a shame that they did not put a bar on the beach! There is no wait staff bringing you a drink at the beach so be prepared. If you are a drinker, the Paradise club is supposed to offer better alcohol. It is by no means top shelf alcohol and it is standard at any all inclusive hotel, in fact I have had better. The food needs a lot of work, same food every day and it lacks taste, quality, etc. I didnt think it was boring like many said, it has something for everyone, it is just a new hotel so it is not overly crowded. The casino is quite small without a bar. Overall, I had a great time, if you can get past these kinks you will be fine. I wrote this so I can help someone make a better choice on there trip. Hope this helps.

<Content>The only thing I hated about EdenH...... ...was LEAVING it !Oh my gosh, we had such a good time at EdenH last week (Aug 3-10) that I had the sad face on during ride back to the airport. I think the resort grounds are picturesque, rooms are clean and modern as is the entire property. We requested a 4th floor room and never took elevators (gotta burn those calories any way we can)Pools are really pretty and the beach is great. Plenty of chairs for all. The shows were typical of AI resorts. The food was good, we ate at ala carte's 3X--Italian once and American twice--could've easily booked more but wanted to eat at buffet a few times and Friday night is Beach Party) Drinks are yummy and fattening. Note to all rum cream lovers in Jamaica....they have Barcelo Cream here..VERY similar to rum cream...delicious! The bars are cool, especially lobby bar (Alisios sp?) Tons of top shelf booze and smiling bartenders that will make you any drink you ask for. We didn't do any excursions but did take a parasail--a must! I dare anyone to experience this and not love it!Another thing I liked about this resort was the staff. Check in...bartenders...housekeeping...wait staff....groundskeepers...ALL were smiling and helpful. I hadn't been to Punta Cana in 4 years and it reminded me of how much I like the people of the DR that's I've come in contact with.I read the negative reviews of EH and once again, have to ask myself...were we at the same place?? I suppose it didn't hurt that we had a solid week of hot, sunny days, never saw one mosquito and don't care about wash cloths (ha ha)If you're heading to EdenH and are concerned, my humble opinion is....DON'T BE. Take your smile, your good attitude and your camera and prepare for vacation bliss. Enjoy!Adios fellow travelers!

<Content>Okay but just opened so has some kinks date: August 12, 2008Just got back from a ten day trip from a gorgeous place, I dont mean the hotel. I wont steer you wrong the hotel itself is very beautiful to look at, the center as they call it is breathtaking but thats really all I can say. If it wasnt for John, Jose and Akon the morning- afternoon entertainment, aerobic and dance instructors the whole trip would have been very long and boring. These three kept going like little energizer bunnies and they are extremely talented and very respectful. They also seem to rememeber everyones name which in my book is really something. So hats off to them, you actually felt like you made three new and amazing friends. Getting back to the Hotel. What they dont mention is the huge opening in the room that separates the bedroom from the bathroom. A real downer if you are there with kids, because there is no privacy at all. Whats funny is there is a lock on the bathroom door, but you can see right in from the other room, so why bother. For a five star hotel, it was very noisy, especially when the guests above you flushed the toilet it sounded like a rain forest in your room. Service was slow, they never replenished the bottled water in the minibar, and towels were hard to come by. Since they just opened six months ago maybe they will get better in time. Oh yeah the brochure says bowling alley, if you could find it let me know cause its not there, If you have teenagers there is not much for them to do at night. This is the only resort that I have been to that doesnt have a disco on the premises. All these things were not going to ruin my vaction, especially since the day is filled with activites so you go to bed early and enjoy the next day. The beach is magnificent, John, Jose and Akon are stupendous, so maybe when the hotel works out the kinks the whole experience will be a good one .

<Content>Fantastic for Families Overall our one-week stay at the EdenH was above average, on the verge of excellent. When this hotel irons out a few minor irritants I am sure it will merit its 4 1/2 star rating.The hotel is about a 20 minute drive from the airport - very convenient indeed compared to some on Bavaro Beach that are 90 minutes away.As expected, with this hotel having been built less than one year ago, it is very clean. My first walkthrough the grounds was initially disappointing. There is not much lush vegetation. Lots of grass - some of it brown due to inadequate irriagtion, a few palm trees, but very few flowers and few other tropical plants. The pools were quite large. I was taken aback by the green pool floor tiles which of course makes the water look green. However by the second day, the green was actually quite pleasing on the eyes.I read some reviews on this hotel that stated there was a mosquito problem. I saw exactly one mosquito during my seven days there. Problem solved.The hotel room was spacious and somewhat controversial in design. There exists a large eight foot opening in the wall between the bathroom and the bedroom. I asked myself, why even bother having a bathroom door with a lock when one could easily enter the bathroom through the aforementioned opening. I suppose this opening saved the hotel from having to install ceiling fans in the bathroom since any humidity generated by a hot shower would dissipate throughout the room.A small detail: I would have prefered having the trash can in the bathroom instead of the toilet room. The toilet room by the way has a smoked glass door that does not lock. Speaking of smoked glass doors, there is also one that separates the shower room from the bathroom. It was difficult to open and close these doors because there is very little space between the botton of the doors and the bathroom floor - the doors would scrape loudly against the floor.The room has a system the promotes energy conservation. One must insert a hotel key in a slot in order to power up the lights and the electrical outlets. Remove the key and all the lights and the power go off. Small problem: the clock radio in the room would never have the right time. On the other hand, we're on vacation; should we even be keeping track of time?The air-condtioning system is cut off when the patio door is left open. The AC in my room, along with several guests I spoke to, was not strong enough to keep us very cool during throughout the night. I believe the AC was programmed to not cool lower than 76 degrees overnight.I found it a bit odd that a new hotel would not have a water purification system installed. So, word of caution, don't drink the tap water. The water served at the restaurants is fine.The food at the main buffet was adequate. There were at times long line-ups during breakfast for those ordering omelets and eggs (15 minutes is long when waiting for your omelets). This was due to having only one cook for parts of the breakfast hours. This was my first all-inclusive hotel that did not serve bacon. However there were sausages and other cold-cuts.We ate most of our lunches at the beach buffet. Again, nothing extraordinary. A nice feature of the hotel is its 24-hour room service. Make sure you get a copy of the room-service menu from the guest services personnel because there was no copy in the hotel room itself.The hotel has four a-la-carte restaurants: one serving Asian cuisine, one Italian, one Gourmet and one American. The food at the first three was delicious. The American restaurant was just ok. The hotel has made strides to help its clientel have a pleasureable a-la-carte dining experience. But there is room for improvement. 1. The reservation system is cumbersome. One must wait in a line-up for over 45 minutes in order to make the reservation. It is advisable to make all your reservations at once. And try to take advantage of going to these restaurants - the food is really worth it. 2. The literature in the hotel room states that the a-la-carte restaurants have a beeper-system and no reservations are taken. Obviously, they should get rid of this out-dated literature.3. There exists a lack of proper communication regarding the Gourmet a-la-carte restaurant. My wife made the reservations and she told the person taking the reservation that we would be three adults and five children. Once my wife came back with the reservation slip, after her 45 minute wait in line, I reminded her that I read in the hotel room that the Gourmet restaurant did not allow children. To make a long story short, after speaking to several hotel personnel, we were allowed to take our kids along. Lo and behold, when we walked into the restaurant, we saw several children seated, accompanied by their parents.4. The house wine served in all the restaurants, including the buffet, is not good. For starters, it is served at room temperature. If you want to splurge on a good bottle of wine, make sure it has been properly chilled.5. The staff at the restaurants is in general very friendly. However, there seemed to be not enough waiters/waitresses to ensure prompt service. A two-hour dining experience may be a bit much when one has a few kids to keep busy. This was the case in the Italian and American restaurants.Here are a few minor irritants that can be easily fixed by an attentive staff with proper direction from management- I asked the front desk for four bath towels one each for the 4 guests in my room; I had received only 3 towels on four out of the seven days of my stay; - I asked on three separate occasions for extra pillows; never got them. Why not just put extra pillows in the closet?- The maid should have an actual checklist of items that should be in the room each and every day; If I drink coffee from the coffee machine, make sure another pouch of coffee and coffee-mate is placed in the room. Make sure that if a shampoo bottle was used, place a new one in the bathroom. - The fridge is supposed to be stocked with water, beer and softdrinks; Make sure the fridge is replenished on a daily basis.I don't want to sound like an old man, but I found the music scene a bit aggravating. Music is played, at loud volumes from sunrise to sunset - sometimes at the beach and sometimes at the pool. The music is generally Latin and/or dance-oriented. While one type of music is being blasted through loudspeakers, another type of music is being piped through the numerous small speakers that are situated throughout the grounds. The electricity went out on a few occassions, for no more than fifteen minutes at a time. I was finally able to hear the sounds I love when I go to these types of resorts: the sound of ocean waves lapping on the beach; the sound of kids having a blast in the pool. My suggestion to the hotel: keep the loud music to no more than 30 minutes at a time - with at least a one hour pause in between. Make sure that the small speakers are not playing music at the same time as when the loudspeakers are playing.The beach was fantastic in terms of the quality of sand. My kids had a blast playing beach soccer for hours on end. A caveat for the kids: there are no seashells and no fish to see while snorkelling. For all swimmers: there's lots of seaweed floating around and some gets washed up on the beach. Don't worry, you get used to it in a hurry. The daily evening shows at the hotel were quite good. Some themes revolved around dancing at those performers were excellent dancers.Well that's it. And yes, I would go back and stay at the EdenH.

<Content>Great times at Edenh After arriving 2 hours late due to a delay in departing Toronto we were kindly greeted by Daniel in Paradise Club check in. Only problem with arriving is we were given no direction on how to get to our room. We wandered around for 10 minutes before heading back to Paradise Club. Daniel promptly took us to our room. When we got to our room we noticed we faced the hideous construction site. We called Daniel and he quickly found us a new room that faced the pool.The resort is beautiful and everyone is super nice. We only saw 1 mosquito the whole week. If you go to the ala cartes, you have to try the Asian restaurant but try not to fill up on the sushi because everything on the menu that we tried was great. We had really slow serivice at the Italian restaurant. Most days we ate lunch at the beach grill just because of the convient location to the beach and pools. The Festival buffet is good but very repetitive. For breakfast go and visit Felix. He makes the best omelets and is very friendly. We found the nightlife non existant but the shows were very entertaining. The Tanthra bar was our favourite but was only open our first two nights there???Ramon was the best bartender i've ever met. Very entertaining and always had a drink ready for us at the pool.Housekeeping was lacking. Our bathroom wasn't cleaned all week. The maid also used a dirty mop to clean our floors and we found long hairs all over the floor. On one of our walks around the resort we also caught a maid mopping the tub with a dirty mop. The only other problem we found was it was hard to get change for large bills. Plan ahead and bring lots of 1's and 5's. Leave the 20's at home.Thanks for the great week at edenh. We'll definetely come back once everything is finished.Todd and AmandaKitchener, Ontario

<Content>Nicest resort in Punta Cana! My husband and I stayed at the Edenh the week of July 25. I was VERY reluctant to book the hotel because of all the negative reviews, but our top choices came down to the Excellence, Paradisus Palma Real Arena (next door to the Edenh), and the Edenh. Edenh won out because it was the newest (Excellence was older), and the most reasonably priced (Paradisus was double the price). Overall, we were very pleased with our stay at the Edenh. The grounds were absolutely gorgeous, rooms nice and clean, and activities suitable. We actually got a chance to see the Paradisus resort next door in detail, and we both thought that the Edenh was a better choice, and was glad we didn't pay double the price to stay in the Paradisus Palma Real Arena. If you're interested in seeing the Paradisus just walk along the beach and one of their 'vacation club' reps will probably approach you- ours was named Lucky. The only thing better about the Paradisus was the food. Most everything about the Edenh was exceptional, but there were a few things that could be changed/updated to make this place a true 5 star, and things you need to know if you book here. They are:1) Our room didn't have washcloths (but had hand towels). I'm pretty sure this is standard practice for them since I read about it on several other reviews, so we brought a puff sponge to wash with. I didn't call to ask for a washcloth, but I'm assuming that they would've bought us one if needed.2) The line for the speciality restaurants is a disaster! We waited in line for 30-40 minutes, but we were able to book the restaurants for our entire stay, so it wasn't a big deal. 3) The food was less than desirable- We had a hard time finding something to eat during our stay. I'm pretty sure that we both lost weight while there. There is plenty of food at the buffets and other restaurants, I'm just not clear on how it can ALL be bad- everything from the bread, to fruit to meats. I thought it was the Dominican style of eating- until I ate at our neighboring resort, and that's not the case. It was great for us though because we didn't overeat, and we're trying to lose weight :-)4) Night activities- The dance show we saw was very good, much better than expected, but every other night's activity wasn't. We went to most and ended up leaving within 10 minutes (because it was boring :-( They have a big screen in the common area nightly but it was playing spanish game shows? I think a really good movie would be better. The night club was filled with kids by 10pm, and nooone was dancing. The DJ was good though, so it must've be the crowd. You'll be ok if you're with a group, but there should be a selection of activities at night. (not just one featured). We didn't feel too safe walking the beach at night, so that wasn't an option either.5) Jacuzzi- It was very nice to have a jacuzzi in our room, and I may be the only person that doesn't know how to work one, but I think that they really need to put a simple instruction note by it. We had water spraying all over the room until we figured out how it worked. Word of advice: Fill the jacuzzi with water and make sure all the 'holes' are covered with water before you turn it on.......These were the only things that the Edenh had issues with- which are all not too major and could easily be resolved. Overall we had an enjoyable stay and we are very happy that we chose the Edenh over the other resorts.

<Content>Fantastic Experience We returned from EdenH on July 5th 2008 and when I booked believe me I was nervous. My husband and I travel to the Dominican 2 times a year and have never really had a bad experience. This was also the first time that we have flown with Sunwing airline and that alone was a great experience. When we pulled up to the hotel I said to my husband if its bad lets just make the best of it. I will break it down for you on how it went.CHECK IN:We had absolutly no problem with check in the girl behind the counter was polite and courtious and had a great smile. We asked for an upgrade and had no problem getting one. The only thing we found different was the lobby was completely enclosed but it was very clean and quite modern.OUR ROOM: The room we had was beautiful with a great ocean view and view of the pool. The room was very modern and I really dont know why people complain about the bathroom you do have privacy and its really different. Housekeeping was fantastic our room was cleaned perfectly everyday. We do tip the maids and also bring down small gifts for their children which they really appreciate. They have room service 24 hrs aday and we never had any problem with that at all.Restaurants:We met some fellow Canadians there and they booked us three specialty restaurants which were pretty good except for the wait in the hot lobby to get in. The staff in the restaurants were very accomodating and polite. The house wine could use some improvement but otherwise it was good. The buffet was okay there was always something you liked and there was adaquat seating. The waiters in there were also really nice. A smile and a nice word goes along way.BARS: The pool bars were great even though we had a green bracelet we never waited for a drink. We also tip the bartenders and ask them if they have children if they do we bring them paper and pencils colouring books and crayons for them. They really appreciate that. The two nicest guys are Danny and Alex. We went to the lobby bar some nights and it was quite nice again friendly staff. We also went to the roof top bar and I guess we were to early as the four of us were the only ones there but if was really neat up there.BEACH: What can you say about Dominican Beaches that is the reason we travel there twice a year. We found the beaches to be clean and the water was fantastic. We can hardly wait until January to return to the country.Just to recap we found the EdenH to be a fun and very friendly place to go and eventually we will return but would like to try a few more hotels first. The staff were great and really did try to please you and like I said before a smile and being friendly really does go a long way.I do have photos but I am still trying to figure out how to get to send them with my review.

<Content>Undecided if I would repeat vacation there We stayed at the Edenh Real the week of July 19-26. NUMBER ONE - Learn Spanish before you go. Spanish is the main language and some of the staff do not speak English.NUMBER TWO - Make sure you get ala carte reservations Monday or you will not be able to eat in the resturaunts. We waited in line 20 minutes Monday 7/21 morning only to be told they were not taking reservations. When the group of about 20-30 people left, the staff decided to start taking reservations. We were skunked after that. VERY DISAPOINTEDOverall the facilities were great. Some in our party had problems with aair conditionong but it was resolved within a few days. We paid for the Paradise Club update. It was OK because you got two exclusive bars available to Paradise Club. The room upgrade with Paradise club is questionable. Some in out party despite paying for the upgrade stayed in standard rooms. BE AWARE, Paradise Club upgrades do not guarante you a room upgrade. ONLY when available. The staff was great, Mario at the club bar was great. Manuel in the buffet was a teriffic host and helped us significantly. Rose gave us great 5 minute massages through the week while selling the Midnight Massage. Bad - most of the housekeeping staff do not speak any English. You could not communicate that towels were needed in your room.

<Content>Daily activities were great and enhanced by "John" Our family of 9 stayed 7/26/08 through 7/31/08 in 4 rooms. We arrived early but were registered into our nicely appointed rooms without incident. During our stay, we were very satisfied. Our 4 sons (18-20) were always busy having fun at the pool and beach area. There, they met the entertainment man John who soon became their friend and mentor. John's mature, professional but fun approach was greatly appreciated and I continued to watch him interact exceedingly well with old and young alike. As a father, I grew to appreciate John for his caring and professional work ethic. John was always at work early, planning and setting up the day's actvities. John even got us parents involved in a wine tasting event hosted by another professional named Richard. I highly reccomend Eden H for their food, accomodations, cleanliness and entertainment man, John. Thanks to Mr. Vega and his entire staff. Matt Voytek Cortland, Ohio.

<Content>the most beautifull We stayed there for 12 days.The resort is one of the most beautifull there is in this Country.The service is good and people really try to do there best.Special thnx to the animation team,John,Aken,Jose,Geronimo,and Naomy. They do there very best to entertain you during the day.They are always cheerfull and always smile and are really good at what they do.Also special tnx to mister Richard,who knows all there is to know about wine and give you very good choice when the choice is hard to make.The food is good,fresh and there is always enough choice.The resort is new,and if i can say one minus point is that the painting is still going on,altough it is never a problem.The beds are good,the rooms are big with a jacuzzi,and the rooms are cleaned every day.The beach is the best there is in Punta Cana.Danny who makes drinks at the beach bar is always smiling and seems to enjoy what he does.Of course there is no perfect resort,but this comes close to it.We would recommend this resort to everybody.Harold and Katya from the Netherlands

<Content>Rough Start, Great Finish I was with a group of 35 that stayed the week of 7/18-7/25. Our opening problem was not caused by the resort, but by our booking agent. They shorted us 1 room. We got to the resort about noon, everyone was checking in with little problems and all rooms were immediately ready. I was the last to check in out of the group when we hit the snag. Being in a foreign country we got concerned that this would not be resolved so we started to panic. The Apple rep left at 12 so we missed him. So we got the hotel to call our US rep. It took our US rep about 3 hours to finally get the room confirmation to the resort. The Apple rep, Santos, was great in making sure the rest of our stay went well.The rooms were all preassigned and green bracelet rooms, this to me is where the difference comes in regarding the bracelets. In Bldg 1, all odd number rooms face the workers lot, very unattractive view. In bldg 2 all even numbered rooms face the black fencing. I assume all the other rooms facing the pool and or ocean are saved for the pink bracelets.About 70% of our group had a bad reaction to the food. Bring lots of pepto or amodium AD. The meats have a different texture and taste then what you are use to. We did go to the a la carte rest., avoided reservation lines by going to Apple rep, he helped us out a lot.The resort, beach and pools are beautiful. The sky was a vibrant blue and the sand soft and white. The ocean is blue, except were the seaweed is growing, which is in a lot of places.Para sailing was great, only $85 per couple. We also did the Marinaquarium snorkeling trip. It was fun and you swam with sharks and rays and then partied at a natural pool just off the shore. The room conditions where a mixed bag. Some where fine, but many had AC problems, the room was cool but very humid, the sheets felt wet and all our clothes did as well. There was also odor problems with some as well, almost like a mold due to the moisture. They also have a key slot within your room that unless your key is in the slot all the power will be shut off except the AC fan. No one in our group expierenced any misquito issues at all. They were spraying the first floor area daily.Alex at the main pool bar was great, served quickly and was entertaining, why not. The Alision bar was very upscale and pleasant. Never went to the dance bar, it was outside, needed AC after a long day of sun.Nightime is very boring. Since we had such a large group we always had fun. But if you are with spouse or small group it gets quite very early with little to do. The sports bar is more for kids to hang out and shoot pool. The casino is small with very few games, the hold em table never was used the entire week we were there. We went to a couple shows, but that only lasted about an hour or so. At night the resort is very dark and quite. All pool bars shut down at 6pm. Dinners at the a la carte start a 6:30 and on. As far as beach chair prolems, if you get out past 8 you will not get any. The pool always has plenty. There was volleyball each day, but it got to hot by mid afternoon to play any longer. Ocean aerobics and pool aerobics are done daily, but to the same music everyday. Overall we had a great time because that is the type of group we are. If I was with my family only I think we would of been bored by Tuesday. I would not go back just because of the food, not the resort itself.

<Content>GOOD and BAD of Edenh We just got back from the Edenh Resort yesterday. We were there from July 20 to 27. We (me and my girlfriend) are both 28 years old and went with 3 other couples (all around the same age). I will go through the good and the bad of this resort.... maybe give everyone some tips as well.....RESORT GROUNDSPlenty of things to keep people busy during the day including ping pong tables (2), basketball nets at the pool (2), volley ball net at the pool and on beach (2), large chess board, board games, soccer nets on beach (2), large trampoline in ocean and on beach (2), casino, 3 swimup bars - two at each VIP (Pink Bracelets) pools and one at one of the main pools, 4 pools altogther - two VIP pools, a few jacuzzi pools/tub (2 or 3, not sure how many). So simply put... there are a lot of things to do besides the norm of swimming, suntanning, etc. At night there are 3 bars (that I can think of) that you can go to. One is a Sports Bar with pool tables and big screen TVs, one is a bar thats pretty much a substitute for a disco that plays loud music and has a pool to swim in at night. The last bar is just off the main lobby building thats just a normal good sized bar. There is 4 a la cartes to eat at Asian, Senses, Italian and American. There is two buffets. GOOD - Very clean grounds. Lots to do during the day. Resort is layed out well. BAD - No complaints.FOOD We booked our reservations on the Monday, the day after we arrived. Which they kind of fixed, considering all the complaints given about not being able to book reservations prior to this change. BUT.... we still had to wait in line for 2 hours out in the hot sun waiting to book reservations for the rest of the week. Also when we got to the a la carte on a certain day that you have booked, you still have to wait in a room in line with NO air conditioning... This still needs A LOT of improvement. By the time I would get into a certain a la carte, sit down and eat my meal... I would be soaked with sweat from standing in the waiting room with no air-conditioning in my required pants and dress shirt. I am just glad they weren't strict on dress shoes and allowed sandles. NOW.... as for the food....One of the couples that we went with were already at the resort for a week before we got there... so they had already tried the American a la carte... and said it wasn't very good.... so we didn't bother to try it. Although I wish we had... I was still kind of curious about it.Senses - We went to this a la carte the last night. They have a lot of fish dishes, so if you don't like fish... you might want to skip this one. I myself had the tossed greens, lobster soup and beef tenderloin... and all were pretty good in my opinion. Although the rest of the couples we went with hated this place. Even though mine was good... I was still hungry afterword... and so was everyone else. So we all ordered room service afterword. I would rate this a la carte restaurant a 7/10. This restaurant could use a little more variety on their menu for non fish eaters.Asian - This was the first a la carte we tried. The sushi boat that me and my girlfriend got wasn't bad.... but I am a sushi snob. We never ended up trying the grill part (Hibachi, spelling?!) and I wish we had. The rest of the couples didn't mind their meals.... but the food wasn't spectacular either. I would rate this a 6/10.Italian - We went to this a la carte twice. It was everyones favourite!! Great service, good portion sizes. Yummy pasta! I recommend everyone to eat at this a la carte. I would rate this one a 8/10.MAIN BUFFET - We ate here quite a few times. You could always find something to eat here. I would rate this 8/10.POOL BUFFET - Had usually pizza, burgers, BBQ chicken, pasta, salad bar, hotdogs, nachos, etc. Was pretty good. But had to switch it up with the MAIN BUFFET for lunch every so often as the POOL BUFFET would get boring after awhile. I would rate this 7/10.GOOD - Still quite a bit of variety of foods can be found at the resort. Everything from pizza to lobster. In my opinion.... the pizza, a lot of the pastas, BBQ'd chicken, omelets, juices, hamburgers.... all were pretty tasty. BAD - Overall the food was not bad... but nothing spectacular. I always kept in mind that we were in the DR. BUT for a 5 star resort... I excepted a lot better. There is some room for growth and the reservation system is still not perfect. The worst foods at the resort were the... deserts (one or two weren't bad), bacon (for some reason), toast (also for some reason) and some other things. For some reasons... all of us.... at different times.... got sick on the food at this resort. When I mean sick.... I don't mean throwing up.... Just stomach pains, messy bathroom trips.*****TIP for the Resort - Either invest in an electronic reservation system to punch in on a computer... and what days you would like to book the a la cartes when you first get there. OR have the booking of the a la cartes inside the air-conditioned lobby. It was very frustrating standing in the sun for 2 hours to book reservations for the week. Also they should have kept the whole buzzer/vibrator thing when you waited for a la cartes..... because even though we had reservations at places.... we were still sweating and waiting in a line at the a la carte waiting rooms. If given a buzzer/vibrator.... we could have gone into a air-conditioned building or gotten a drink while we waited. As for the food itself.... I wouldn't know where to begin on how to improve the actual food in the a la cartes. I pretty much perferred the buffet food over the a la carte food.SERVICEThis also could be improved. Found that at most other resorts.... when you tip a lot.... you get better service.... but for some reason.... not here. Its almost expected here that you tip.... and when you do.... you don't get much better service. Even though I say this... I still found the staff at Edenh to be friendly.... some more then others. One thing that pissed me right off was that we were suppose to get robes, slippers, fruit and a free bottle of rum. When we got there.... NOTHING. I asked myself.... why the hell did I spend more money on the PINK Bracelets, when it felt like it wasn't worth it at all. Finally they sent us robes and slippers (The robes are useless by the way.... they were way too small. We never ever received our fruit or rum even after asking kindly 4 times.... and 4 different staff members... including Emily that works for Air Transit.******TIP #1 for people going to Edenh - DON'T GET THE PINK BRACELETS. They are a waste of money.******TIP #2 for people going to Edenh - Don't over-tip at this resort.... Don't waste your money.... it doesn't make the service any better... and they don't act happier when give bigger tips compared to small tips. It's like all tips are expected here.******FALSE - We encountered only 1 mosquito.... Not an issue at all and we were on the first floor.******FALSE - Large shipment of chairs obviously came... as we didn't have any trouble getting chairs by the pool at any time of the day early or late.EXCURSIONSWe did an excursion (Dolphin Island - I think it was called that, I don't remember.) We only did this one.... but it was well worth the money. It cost us $110 dollars per person to swim with dolphins, as well as snorkel with Sting Rays and Feeder Sharks. The only thing is you can't really take pictures while you swim with the dolphins. The staff working at this excursion take pictures of you and your party for you.... and then you can buy a DVD afterword of it all. It cost me and my girlfriend $30 each. So all together it cost me... $140 dollars to do all of this and get a DVD after. It also is only a half day thing... so that is a bonus because I prefer NOT do a whole day excursion.ROOMWe had a very nice room and with the PINK BRACELET we got a large tub on our patio. BUT unfortunately we only used it once, this was more because of the location of our room over anything else.GOOD - EverythingBAD - Nothing, expect that they didn't bring our free rum, fruit and it took them a couple days to bring robes that didn't fit and our slippers.OVERALL.....Had a lot of fun, but I have fun anywhere I go. Wouldn't go back to this resort though.... for two reasons.... one because I myself always like to go to new resorts/locations. Reason two is because the food made me feel crappy quite a few times and the service wasn't very good.

<Content>Mixed feelings about Edenh I read alot of reviews about the Edenh Real Arena, after booking with our local travel agent. I have to admit that I was scared that we made the wrong choice when choosing this particular resort. After staying there for 7 nights, I will give you my personal opinion. The resort is beautiful with lots of waterfalls and I will give it a 5 star when judging on appearance. I will now tell you the problems we encountered during our stay. We arrived at the resort 4 hours before check in. As we imagined, our room was not ready for occupancy. Check in was 3:00 so at that time, we checked in again and was told that our room still was not ready so we had to wait another hour or so before we could have access to our room. We were given green bracelets because we did not pay for the upgrade. If you are going there for the alcohol, pay for the upgrade because you will only get their cheapest alcohol. I have to say , that is my number one complaint about staying here. I feel everyone should be treated alike when staying at an all inclusive resort. You shouldn't have to pay more to drink the better liquor. We ate at all the ala carte restaurants and I would have to say that I enjoyed the food. If you eat at the Asian restaurant, be sure to sit at the hibatchi table. The food by the pool and the buffet were just OK. It seemed like they didn't change the variety of the food being served. Pretty much the same things everyday. As far as the entertainment, if you understand Spanish, you will enjoy the shows. None of the shows were geared towards English speaking people. Other than seeing a show in the evening or going to the casino, theres nothing more to do. We didn't attend any of the bars so I can't comment on them. The rooms were clean and nice but the reviews you heard about the bathroom is true. Theres no wall between the bathroom and the beds. Theres privacy glass where the toilet is and the shower but the tub area is completely open and visible. We asked for a curtain to cover the opening but were told they didn't have anything. We traveled with our 2 daughters, 22 and 24 so that created a problem. The beach was pretty but alot of seaweed. They had men trying to rake up the seaweed but it really didn't help much. This may have been a problem because of the hurricane situation. I will make my final comment saying that if you plan on staying here, I think you will be satisfied with your decision We enjoyed our stay even with the minor problems we encountered. I do not plan on returning to the Dominican only because I like more entertainment when I'm on vacation. If you are here for the relaxation, you will have a good time. Vacations are what you make of them. Enjoy yourself.

<Content>edenh comments We just returned last nite from Edenh Real. Overall its a very nice very clean resort which I find important. The pool and and the pool bars had some great bartenders. we found Carlos at the Paradise Pool full of energy and enthusiasm for his job. He was alot of fun. Some of the bartenders didnt understand English at all and that wasn't so good. One of our complaints was the inability to communicate with many of the staff especially housekeeping. Housekeeping may be understaffed because one nite we didn't even have our room cleaned until 6:30. There are no washcloths provided so you may want to take your own. We paid for upgrade for Paradise Club but not really sure what the additional money got us rather than name brand liquor at the bars. We had no turndown service in the room/our refrige. was hardly ever restocked/trash wasn't always taken out when the room was cleaned/no replacement for coffee creamers and the coffee cups always smelled of old coffee and not cleaned. OUr jacquzzi tub wasn't ever cleaned out either. Another complaint is that we were always told that there wasn't openings for the ala carte restaurants. We stood in line for 30 min. on Sunday to be told that they weren't taking reservations that day. Later on another guest advised that they then changed their mind and started to take them. If it weren't for our Apple Rep. (Santo) we wouldn't have gotten any reservations. There was one staff member taking reservations that couldn't understand one thing in English and she was not helpful at all. I found her very unfriendly unless you could speak Spanish. That made things difficult. One of the good things about the resort was the lay out. Close to pools/ocean/restaurants. Maybe a little more time for a new resort will bring some changes.

<Content>Don't Believe "All" Reviews I had chosen this resort after going over dozens of the other hotels in Punta Cana. We chose it for the dozens of unique things that they offered. Unfortunately I spent the next few months reading the reviews and entered our vacation from July 18 - 25/08 worrying that maybe we had made a mistake.It was the most beautiful resort with the most cooperative staff from the moment we entered to the time we left. We had the Consierge service and we directed to a beautiful lounge with a bar, snacks, couches and tv for the kids while checked in - maybe a 15 minutes ordeal. Our rooms were immaculate. Adjoining rooms with 2 beds for the kids and a king size for us with the jacuzzis on both balconies. We also brought bug spray and never saw one the entire week. The food from excellent from the beach buffet, to the regular buffet and all of the restaurant as well as the room service which we utilized on at least 3 occasions. (There were 5 of us including 3 children who loved this novelty!) I'm not sure what all these other people had problems with but we went to the beach on many occassions between 9:00-10:30am and were able to find 5 lounges. As far as the pools went we went on morning outings and went to the pools in early afternoon and still found 5 chairs at any given time. So no complaints. We've been to Puerto Plata recently (Breezes) and our standards were that perhaps it wasn't going to be clean or the food was sub-standard, but going to this resort turned our minds around. This was truly a beautiful, clean and hospitable place to stay. To those who had problems getting drinks, we did upgrade to the concierge level and had a beautiful rooms by the beach and pools, but we didn't restrict ourselves to only these areas as it wasnt necessary. I'm not sure how strong people need their drinks but we usually needed to add mix to ours.If I do return to Punta Cana or the D.R. I can't see ourselves staying anywhere else.

<Content>best vacation in five years I traveled with a group of 15 to Edenh, we stayed from July 4th - 11th. All of us had an amazing time. The rooms were all clean, there were a few minor blemishes... but come on are you really staying at a beach resort to enjoy your room? The food was great, I was equally satisfied with the buffet and the ala carte. Making reservations was a bit difficult for us because of the way it was done when we were there. First of all, the girl in charge of reservations (Lorena I think was her name) was not the friendliest person to deal with, and we always had to stand in a line for 45 minutes to 1 hour every morning because she would only allow 1 day of reservations, and she never smiled. I understand she has to do her job, and I am not complaining about waiting but she could have at least done her job with a smile on her face. Other than that, our group didn't have any real complaints. Ramon at the Club Paradise adult pool was amazing! Mercedes who moved around between the Sports bar and Tantra always had a smile on her face and tried to make conversation. Felix who made omelettes at the breakfast buffet was extraordinary, very friendly and like stated in other reviews remembers EVERYONE'S name. Punta Cana itself was an amazing place, every person we came in contact with was nice. I never felt in danger at any point of our trip as some people stated. We did leave EdenH a few times, once to go on the 4 Wheeling tour and another time to go out to Mangu at Grand Occidental Flamenco Resort. I would highly recommend the 4 wheelers for anyone who is feeling adventurous... but I would not recommend Mangu to anyone. When we got there we were charged an $8 cover which did include a drink ticket, but after that all drinks were $8 and up! I don't even pay that much in the states. Plus the place is crawling with prostitutes. The guys in our group got approached by several of them. Punta Cana has been one of the only places I have been that I would definitely go back, and I would go back to the same resort. EdenH was wonderful! And as for all of the complaints about mosquitoes... I am always the first person bit, and I did not see one. I brought 3 cans of OFF and a couple of citronella candles just in case, but none were used. Also, we never had a problem getting a chair on the beach. Please do not be scared off by the horrible reviews that are months old. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

<Content>Loved It My wife and I stayed at the EdenH Real from July 14th through July 21st and absolutely loved it. We stayed in a Paradise Club room in building 2 and had an absolutely amazing view and everyone was extremely friendly. Our favorite had to be the bartender at the paradise club pool Ramone who was just a really fun person and gave exceptional service. For everyone reading about the complaints, it really comes down to visitors being greedy, arrogant, and stuck-up. The food was absolutely wonderful and there is something for everyone in every restaurant and at the buffet. There have been complaints about the portion sizes, but that is the size a correct portion should be. We as Americans just tend to eat way too much so its actually a good thing they serve food the way they do. You must be willing to try different things and please step out of the Americanized box that American travelers go down there trapped in (by the way I am from Maryland). Ive read many reviews talking about food and activities for kids and all I have to say to that is, just dont bring your kids to an all inclusive resort in a different country. It not only frustrates the family, but other vacationers. Also, you are in the Dominican Repubic so do not be rude to them but try and work with the employees to understand each other. We had a small set back during check-in and were very patient about the problem and ended up with amazing service. They even sent a bottle of champagne to our room. Go down there looking to have a great time and to enjoy your vacation and everything will work out.

<Content>Great Hotel I stayed with my partner at the EdenH in early Feb 2008 just after it opened. We loved every minute and would like to return. The bath room set up could be a bit of a problem if you are not rooming with a partner or good friend as there was no dividing wall between it and the main bedroom. Having said that the room was beautifully furnished and very comfortable. We experience no delays at check in but this may have been because we were the only 2 using this hotel who came on our flight from the UK. Most of the other guests were from Canada or the USA. The food in the a la carte resturants was excellent except in the American style resturant. The buffet food was OK but nothing special. All the bar areas were good with excellent service. From reading other reviews it would appear that the sun bed shortage has been resolved. When we stayed it was a huge problem which was the only negative I had about EdenH. People were getting up at 6:00 AM when it was still dark to reserve sunbeds! We had a great 2 weeks (with no stomache problems) in a beautiful, chilled resort. We went on a couple of trips one a boat trip organised through the local dive company (I can't remember their name) which was awful. However the trip to the capital was very good and was excellent value.I would definately return to the EdenH as long as it doesn't become too family orientated.

<Content>outstanding just got back from edenh and had a great time. everything was wonderful that i don't know where to begin. here goes...check-in was smooth. we stayed in building 2 with a view of the center gardens, pool, and a slice of the ocean. we were the green bands and had a jr. deluxe room. the room was spacious, had a king bed, sitting area, and the infamous window. there was plenty of closet space, a refrig(stocked), ironing board, tv, safe, toiletries, hair dryer, coffemaker---------what else do ya need?bought mosquito spray for nothin---never saw one.bring washrags if you use them---i've been to pc 3x in 3 different resorts and always brought my own.every morning we would have a peaceful cup of coffee on the balcony before we began our day.there are 5 ac restaurants and a beach/pool grill. the one restaurant is a buffet and there are 4 ala cartes. you need to make reservations for the ala cartes but you can make them for consecutive nights depending on what day you book. you can also pick your own time which should satisfy the people who MUST eat at a certain time. men must wear long pants at the ala cartes as so many other resorts throughout the caribbean . the food was very good. the service was unbelievable. they were always checkin up on you. we liked senses the best although sitting at the hibachi grille in the asian was a treat. breakfast was at the buffet and there was always plenty of selections. the beach grill always had pizza ,hamburgers, hot dogs, grilled chicken, nachos, and then they would change daily the side dishes sometimes eggplant, or baked potatoes etc.there are 5 bars--not including the paradise bars.----so always somewhere to get a drink. the lobby bar, tantrabar, sports bar, are in the courtyard where the restaurants, shop, theater, and the casino were located. i think they open at 5 but i could be wrong--i was on the beach during the day. all i know is i always had a drink in hand.the beach is beautiful and the water is gorgeous. i'm going to stress something here!!!! no matter when we went down to the beach there was always chairs and palapas. they may not have been in the first row---but they were there and you had a great view of the water. the resort was at 70% to 90% during our week so there were a lot of people.there were 3 pools and 2 paradise club pools. the water was green because of the tiles. i know some people didn't like it but the pools matched the ocean. lots of chairs there too. i spent 5 minutes in the pool my whole vacation.activities were plenty. catamarans, kayaks, a snorkle excursion(fee), parasailing, waterskiing,dance classes on the beach, ocean aerobics,.......there are some flea markets--2 to the left if you are facing the ocean, 1 to the right. you do get approached by vendors but i tend to tell them i'll call when i need something or want to buy.i'm told there is a free shuttle that takes you to the mall. we did not do it so i cannot tell you the times.our apple package included a 15 min free massage on the beach---wonderful---and do tip. we got wonderful service anyway---but these people work hard!!! and some from morn--night.on fri--we had a beach party. they spent the whole day setting up--it was awesome food, drinks, show, and participation.i want to give special mention to jose at the grill bar, wilkins at the lobby bar, antony,katty, jesus,franklin margarita,maria the servers, felix the omelet dude, and angela our maid. everyone was kind and helpful.and finally---you mike. we are so grateful to have met you. you are truly a caring man. your love for the dominican people and their country shows in all you do and say. edenh is lucky to have a manager that goes out of his way to listen---really listen to comments---both positive and negative---and act on them. thanks again for making our trip truly memorable. and have fun on YOUR vacation!!!in closing---please do not hesitate to book at edenh. i'm sure you will have a great time unless you choose not to. if i had anything negative to say it would be this. my hubby and i are used to small intimate resorts---there is no such animal in punta cana---most resorts have 300 and up rooms. but again--that is OUR preference. i said from the getgo---nothing was gonna stop me from having fun----and nothing did.

<Content>loved edenh This resort is awesome. It is brand new and beautiful. I know it is hard to believe but the food was great even at the buffet. I already miss my morning omelet from Felix and my afternoon drink from Ramon at the club paradise adult pool. Everyone at the resort we so nice we had an excellent time. The night life was not all that great but it was still fun. We did the ATV tour and that was a lot of fun!! I highly recommend this resort to everyone!! We sure were not ready to come home!!

<Content>caliente,, ow ow the dr is an amazing place. teh hotel has many friendly people. everyone says hola. haha . yes there aren't much activities.. i mean the dancing and aerobics w/ akon is fun, but a person cannot just stay in the hotel and expect to have fun. yes there are many pools, and the beach is nice.. no waves.. it is very relaxing.. but they have parasailing and banana boating which you have to pay out of your pocket,, but carlos makes up for it,, and so does that other lady. if yu have a great representer like eddie from turinter, you'll enjoy. edwrd at the frront desk is very helpful and describes evrything/. but i like dominican people and it's good to get out of the hotel and check the real world of the people. the night activities/shows.. such as the 9:45 ones are not great.. too much karaoke night in that bar where everyone smokes and you have to breathe the second hand smoke, the crystal place is better. yes the elevators have some sort of smell,, but it's adaptable.. the workersd were very quickly and efficiently,, they aalways smile . the food isn't so fantastic.. i stuck w/ mangoes and papayas yum,, but the chciken or meat or w/e not my thing. the fish grilled was good. don't fire anyone. the restaurants were okay.. you really need to know what you're choosing..

<Content>FANTABULOUS!! Highly recommended by frequent Caribbean travler What a wonderful place! This new resort has all the amenities you are looking for in an all-inclusive resort. I have stayed at many all Inclusives in Cancun, Jamaica, etc. and this one is beautiful. Your greeter will take you to your room and double check that everything is working. Ensure you have enough chairs for your party on the balcony/patio and the number of pillows that you need to make your stay comfortable. Don't forget...the shower door pushes inward, so don't think you have to squeeze between the shower door and vanity - many of us visitors found this out later..haha. Plenty of pool chairs, drinks were flowing, resteraunts and food plentiful. Take advantage of the paradise upgrade to enjoy premium liquor and beer - including Bud Light! The ONLY thing I could thing of that the resort was missing was the blender at the pool bars...I wanted a dirty banana but they do not make mixed drinks with fruit as the other resorts do. We will go back. This resort is only a short drive from airport, which means less taxi or road time...the beach area and water was much better than even the neighboring resorts..we walked the beach to check the others out...The only reason the pool water is not bright blue was because they tiled it with yellow tiles..but the resort is very clean and great location. We cannot wait to go back. If you book the resort through the common travel websites, you are upgraded to paradise member and can get use of extra pool and better drinks..if you want them. LOVE IT!!!!!!!!! Also, enjoy the excursions...you can get see the local culture and they have beach parties at catalina island and Sanoa Island. The Caribean Festival is a great FAMILY cruise that goes up the resort shore line. We met alot of honeymooners. Gorgeous place.

<Content>Enjoy!!!!!! We just came home from a wonderful week of paradise. There were 18 of us there and all of us would give this a thumbs up. The food was excellent, no matter what anyone else says. I actually gained 5 pounds during the week!!!! I loved all of the restaurants. The Hibachi was my favorite.We had wonderful weather....all sun, only 10 minutes of rain all week. We were able to take advantage of the canoes, sail boats, banana boats, and some of us did the parasailing. We all had an awesome time.The only thing that I would suggest to them is they could have a little more entertainment at nite. But for my age, it was relaxing. We had all ages with us from 23 to 58. The beach party on Friday was awesome. The food on the beach that night was great along with the setup of everything to make a night of just party, party, party. It reminded me of a Luau (if anyone of you have been to Hawaii). Punta Cana Mike was wonderful. He will help you out with any questions that you might have. If you have any questions, just email me if you want to know anything, but I am sure that you will love your vacation there.

<Content>FUN activity workers!! I'll keep this short, sweet, and to the point :0) The hotel was pretty, quiet, and peaceful. Downfall: not crazy about the no wall between the bathroom and bedroom..lil more privacy would be nice. Beach was beautiful!!! The activity guys were AWESOME...especially Jose and Acon.The activity guys definitely made our trip. There happy, fun, free spirited personalities brought life, laughter to the day....Que CATASTROFICO!!!!! Food: Good. The hotel needs a club. EVERYONE working at the hotel was friendly, and helpful. My best friend and I had a GREAT TIME. We would definitely go back!!

<Content>Nice, friendly but not best accommodations The people at the resort were very nice and we were given a free upgrade upon arrival because we had a large group. Don't be afraid to ask for this. Rooms were nice, pools were great. Beach was fine but had a lot a sea weed. No snorkel from the beach at all. (nothing to see) Try the dirty monkey drink, it was very good. On a scale of 10, I would give this resort a 7. It needs more entertainment! The beach party on Friday was nice and the casino was very, very small and the people that worked there was not friendly at all. The food was average at the buffets but very good in the entree restaurants. Would recommend men to take long pants because they are required at the entree restaurants, it would be nice if the resort allowed men to wear shorts to them because the guys in our group complained about having to wear long pants everytime. Considering the temperature and the fact that the air condition was not very cool anywhere other than the rooms, they should allow shorts for men.

<Content>Good vacation My husband, 16 year-old daughter, 8 year-old son, and I stayed at the Edenh Real from July 12 to July 19. This was our first vacation in the Dominican Republic. We felt that overall it was a good experience. 1.The rooms were clean and spacious. However, the large open space between the bathroom and the rest of the room was an issue for our 16 year-old daughter. This was quickly fixed by the housekeeping staff by placing a sheet over the opening. The mini bar was always refilled daily. 2.Because of the way the hotel is designed, the view from the rooms was lacking. There was little to no view from floor one and two, and floors three and four mostly had a parcel view of the ocean with the other part to of the view being a nasty vacant lot or the pool. TIP: Attempt to get a room facing the pools on the third or forth floor. These rooms provide the best view. Also there was absolutely no issue with mosquitoes on the upper floors. 3.Overall, the staff was very helpful and there was no problem with misunderstandings due to problems with language. Most of the staff spoke English well. The lady that checked us in and out of the resort was grumpy. However, there are lots of grumpy people in the states as well!!4.The food was good. We liked the buffet, the snack bar near the pool (the chicken is very good), the 鈥渞omantic鈥?ala cart restaurant, and the 鈥淎merican theme鈥?restaurant (the steak was great). However, we did not care for the Asian hibachi or the 鈥淚talian鈥?restaurants. The Asian hibachi was not very authentic and the cooks were not entertaining. TIP: Get ala cart at the Asian restaurant and pasta at the Italian restaurant. 5.No problem with reserving space at the ala cart restaurants. You can make reservations for these restaurants twice per day next the buffet entrance, and you can make up to 3 days of reservations at a time. We showed up at the restaurants at the designated times and were seated right away. TIP: Men MUST have long pants. If you did not bring any long pants, then you can borrow them just prior to your reservation at guest services. 6.Beach and pools were great. No issue with getting chairs. TIP: If you want an umbrella at the pool or beach, you should get there before 9:30am. 7.The bars were terrific, and many people brought their kids with them. Therefore, it was a family atmosphere. 8.We were very UNHAPPY with the shuttle to the shopping mall. It was very unreadable. Also the mall was not worth the trouble. You can get the same stuff at an American mall for 陆 the price!!!!9. We were not able to get into our room for several hours after checking in. So pack sunscreen and your suits in your carry on bag so you can start enjoying your vacation as soon as you get there. Important things to remember:1.Get with your Apple representative, Santos. He was terrific and will help you with any issues. 2.If you are bringing younger children, do not forget to bring swimming goggles with UV protection. My son鈥檚 eyelids got sun burned!!!3.Bring lots of sunscreen (at least 2 bottles for a family of four). 4.Outback Safari was great. You can purchase some good stuff at cheap prices during this trip such as coffee, rum, and cigars.5.Marinarium trip was also terrific. You will snorkel your butt off!! So make sure that you use the flippers. Also take something 陆 hour before your trip to prevent seasickness. My daughter got very seasick! 6.Try not to use credit, because your bank will more than likely charge you an international transaction fee. Overall, good trip and nice resort with lots of amenities.

<Content>Punta Cana Beatiful but Resort was Just Okay !! I traveled with my mother May 19 thru 24th. The Country:The dominican reputblic is absolutely beautiful and a very laid back country. If your looking for a americanized area then yes Cancun is the place for you. It amazed me how many people are complaining about the resort staff not speaking English. You are in their country which the first language is Spanish!!!! The people that needed to speak other languages were able to, such as the front desk. The whole experience is being around people of other nationalities and learning their culture. Sooooo if you want everyone to speak English fluently then stay in the U.S. The Hotel:The hotel was beautiful, very clean. We had no problems with mosquitos. They sprayed every night to keep the mosquitos to a minimum. I think I saw one mosquito the whole time there and it was in the elevator. Our room was were the problems begin. We checked in and they tried to put us in a room with one king size bed which was toward the part of the resort that was near the beach and facing the closest pool to the ocean. I was traveling with my mother and when I made the reservations we requested a room with two double beds. They changed the room to one with two double beds but it was alot further away from the ocean and the pool. As we were brought to that room we soon realized that the elevator was out of service and we had to walk quite a way to get a working elevator. I called the front desk from the room and they said the only way they could give us a room with a double bed closer to the ocean was if we paid a additional couple hundred dollars. At first that wasn't acceptable to us but then we weighed our options and realized it was too far from the activites for my mother to walk especially since we had a non working elevator. I went to the front desk and reluctently signed a paper that we wanted the upgraded room which by the way was not the paradise club. Well what we ended up with was a room with the same original king size bed in the same area that they originally wanted to give us but this time they got 300.00 dollars for a supposed UPGRADE (: YEH RIGHT! I currently filed a complaint with my credit card company regarding this charge. Once I told my travel agent, she told me that was unacceptable and that I should have called her at that time. Next Negative problemMy mother used her credit card ONLY AT THE HOTEL GIFTSHOPno where else in Punta Cana and someone stole her card number and used it for over 600.00 dollars of unauthorized charges. That either leads me to believe there are untrusting people working for this resort or someone can hack into their credit card system to retrieve the guests credit numbers. Either way I would not use a credit card at this resort. .Other than that the food was good, the entertainment was good, the staff was very accomindating, especially Carlos. The resort and rooms were very clean. The pool and ocean were beautiful. Whatever you do don't miss the incridible sunrise. It's worth getting up early!!!!!!!!

<Content>Excellent time at Edenh We were at edenh for the first 2 weeks of july and had an amazing time. We were VERY NERVOUS about going after reading all the bad reviews, but were pleasantly surprised. We travel a lot, mexico, cuba, Jamaica, Antigua, St. Lucia, Bahamas, Turks and Caicos and always stay at 5star all inclusives, so we know what to expect. I don鈥檛 know which room these 鈥榬eviewers鈥?have stayed in, but we had definitely a different opinion about this resort. I don鈥檛 usually write reviews, but I couldn鈥檛 let all these BAD reviews scare people off from this resort. Here is my 2 cents.The check in is fast and accommodating, we got our rooms on the third floor, overlooking the pools/fountains without getting upgraded to 鈥榩ink 鈥?VIP鈥?bracelets. There were absolutely no mosquitoes, I don鈥檛 know what people are talking about. The rooms are very modern with a flat screen tv, a hot tub in every room and VERY CLEAN. The maids do an excellent job each day. The 4 a la carte restaurants (asian 鈥?both a la carte and hibachi, American, Italian and romantic) now take reservations and you can book for a full week, so you don鈥檛 have to stand in line each day like at other resorts. The service at the restaurants is EXCELLENT, very fast and efficient, even though we were never in a hurry, you鈥檙e on vacation! The food was great, beautiful presentation at all a la cartes. No one got sick from our group, but those reviewers that did get sick maybe ordered a rare steak? I mean you鈥檙e in the tropics - c鈥檓on! Getting a drink at the bar was also never a problem, and we didn鈥檛 even tip to get ahead in line. There was always a couple of barmen working and helped you quickly. The service was great, everyone very helpful and eager to please you.  The chairs on the beach are never occupied by towels at early am hours (like in some all-inclusives), lots of chairs are available even at 11am. The beach is wide and deep, so you get an ocean view from any chair. One day, we walked along the beach and visited hotels like barcelo, bahia principe, princess, majestic and these beaches were packed 鈥榗ancun style鈥? one tan bed on top of another鈥?.sad sight. Not enough palm trees, or palapas to give you shade. Thank goodness, this was not the experience at edenh. You can actually see the ocean and don鈥檛 have jump over people to get to it AND have some privacy at your own palapa.There is a good mix of people, Canadian, American, Puerto Ricans, Spanish鈥?.The hotel is Spanish and you鈥檙e in the Dominican, so don鈥檛 expect everyone to speak English. They do speak English at the important places 鈥?front desk, a la carte restaurants etc. Learn a couple of words in Spanish before you go, and they鈥檒l be so excited. Por favor, and gracias, goes a long way.

<Content>Honest Review!!! I just came back from the EdenH Real Hotel in Punta Cana. I stayed from July 2 to the 6th. I will say that as a pretty frequent traveler and a very open minded person that I was disappointed. I traveled with my husband, brother and his girlfriend. With much anticipation of going on a vacation that was l8 months long over-due we researched quite a bit AFTER we booked through Cheap Carribean, on this Trip Advisor website. I must say that we were so intimidated by the reviews given that we upgraded our trip from the Deluxe Rooms (the green bracelets and no jacuzzi on the balcony) to the Paradise Club (pink bracelets with a jacuzzi tub on the balcony) for a substantial amount of money to our HUGE DISSAPOINTMENT. So this is my attempt at giving a VERY FAIR and honest review so that someone may not make the mistakes we did by upgrading or even going to Punta Cana DR or the EdenH- The hotel appearance is very much like a wellness spa. The rooms are very basic-the beds are quite firm, but sleep very well. You do get a flat screen TV, we did not have a window viewing into the bathroom from the bedroom as Paradise Club room that is a delux room and it's actually kind of cool!?! There were no bed bugs or mosquitos but then again, we took precautions by not wearing perfumes and burning citronella candles in our rooms that we brought with us. We did however get the room that does face the construction site for a Paradise Club Room. We were not woken up by anything we actually slept very well. The bad was that upon check-in both parties were supposed to get Paradise Club Rooms as was specified on our Vouchers but for some reason they put my brother and his GF in a deluxe room. We immediately called about the room facing the construction site and the room not being upgraded and wasted a substantial amount of time trying to get moved....we were told that the hotel was booked up and we could not be relocated. We are in the process opf trying to get the upgraded money spent refunded (yeah right!). The Room we had was supposed to have a fully stocked fridge - we didn't it was empty and didn't work when they filled it. Then the jacuzzi tub on the balcony began shooting water everywhere!! The room service is bad, and its bad b/c the food is bad, even the drinks like bottled coke etc.taste flat. The Food is terrible that is without question, the only rest. that served a decent tasting meal was the Italian restaurant. My husband and I both did have pretty bad cases of food poisoning and diarreah. As far as any seafood goes there is plenty of octopus and squid- other than that nothing we ordered a seafood dish that was supposed to have a variety of seafood... it came with 2 pieces of shrimp, and octopus and squid... If you want the lobster, which I can only imagine is very small, you must pay $30.00 per person for it even as a Paradise Club member. There are NO I repeat NO special advantages to being a Paradise Club member as they advertise you do get to use the internet for 15 min for free, the lounge is joke you get these quarter sized appetizers that are made of white bread and some cheese that sit on wet trays all day so they are soggy, the alchohol consists of about a handful of straight liquor that sit on a end table NO BAR. Not to mention that this lounge doubles as a check-in and out desk for guests of the Paradise club room. BAsically everything that was said about the gambling is true. Everytime that we entered the Casino (that only accepts american dollars) to play Black Jack the dealer would start out as a girl, in which we would play and win about 2-3 hands, shortly after the 3rd win a young black guy gets changed out with current dealer as the new dealer- we caught this guy on 4 occasions picking up chips on hands that were won and for short changing you with chips as you cashed American Dollars. If you are an avid gambler the Dominican is NOT the place to go AT ALL. We all 4 are pretty seasoned and we lost $360.00 in less than 30 min. There is nothing else to do there at night really accept the Casino... beware- we also not to mention went to another Casino off the property called the Towers Casino it was larger than the Casino at the EdenH the cab ride will cost you $14.00 and they also DO NOT ACCEPT PESOS to gamble with- bottom line is that you are beeter off using your american money versus pesos. Everytime that we attempted to use the peso it was not accepted and when it was accepted the rate for exchange seemed to continuosly change. BIGGEST thing I wished I brought with me was a calculator!! As far as getting cash make sure you take plenty of cash in all denominations as noone will seem to have change for a $5, $10,$20 even the Casino! the ATM machines are located on the sketchiest streets I have ever seen! They are also all in Spanish and will only give out pesos which will do you no good as noone will take it! Make sure that you consult a reputavle website to show you what the conversion rates are this is HUGE especially if you want to do some excursions this is where you feel ripped off as far as exchanging your are better off in the long run using american money here!!!! The beach is pretty, it is covered in sea grass the employees try to rake it up but the water in that area on the DR is near alot of reefs and seaweed and grass. The water is ablueish turqoise color and is pretty but again there is seaweed and grass all around you. The DR needs some time this is too new of a island for vacationers to expect thing to not look like a 3rd world country. For those of you who read this that have vacationed in Mexico, Jamiaca, or the Bahamas...the DR is not like these other places there is no scenernary, you cannot leave the resort and if you do it will only be to go to another resorts casino. You cannot explore the island the way you can at some of these other places, I have been to many places and never felt that I was unsafe and I actually felt this way here. There are so many people that are living in burned out or vacant buildings (there are alot of these) and I realize that most of these places have these destitute areas, but not like this in Jamaica you have beautiful mountains and shores and foilage and you see poor people. Here there is nothing beautiful until you get to a resort which sucks if you like to go to local shops or rest. or venture out to see something cool- you can't, its jsut not safe. We were not bothered by the local beach vendors too much, we politley told them that we were not interested and they left us alone. There was not a line in the sand or anything like that to keep the vendors from approaching you... Ramon yes is a little excentric but fun, he is very nice and accomidating, the pool color is green to look like a beach it is in keeping with the rest of the look of the property very trendy and spa like- again the hotels appearance is a 5 the service is like a 3 and food is like a 1. Oh and the Fishing we tried a deep sea fishing excursion, they don't tell you this but your ONLY TROLLING you don't stop 6 people got so sick we had to stop the trip and go back these were people that took the dramamine, I was trying to medicate everyone including our guide he threw up this was non stop the swells are 6 ft on a 42ft fishing boat with about 10 people, dont do this either MISERABLE!!!! However, the Carribean Festival Snorkeling and swimming with the Sharks and stingrays was good it was $79 per person and worth the money it also serves as a party boat.I personally think that this is too new of a vacationing place the govenrnement really needs to spend a substantial amount of money and time to make this a place that you want to go to, the beach alone cannot satisfy a true traveler. I suggest anyone that is considering going to wait 10 years or more to clean up the place, there is trash everywhere, graffiti, malnutritioned dogs and homeless or poor people everywhere- not much to see, not much to do, spend a little extra money and go to Aruba if you want to gamble even in Jamiaca and Mexico's worst parts did not even compare to this... this being a TRUE non dramatic review, for god sake don't frwak out and upgrade like we did it will only make you made at the people who previously posted that you needed to, it is a waste of your money- stay with the deluxe! Seriously to to go elsewhere ion the Carribean there are so many beautiful places to see, this is not one of them now if you decide to go, stay at the Paradisus Palma Real- I did have someone that just went there about 4 weeks ago for his honeymoon- he did say that they had a great time and loved the property, great food, good beaches but agreed with everything else I mentioned about the area, casinos etc. And make sure to take anti-diarreah medicine and a calculator!!!

<Content>Overall Beauty and Service is Better in Mexico We went with an open mind, but were terribly disappointed. We have traveled in South America, Central America, Carribean Islands and Mexico and this was the worst. Overall, the Dominican Republic and the Eden Real Arena leave you feeling like you are stuck in a tourist trap. The service is lacking and the prices for souvenirs and incidentals are ridiculous. The vendors are nothing, but rude and annoying. Our biggest complaints regarding the hotel were the restaurant availability, the HARD mattress, the food quality and overall lack of follow up from staff when you had a problem. My husband  I were both sick from the food for days. I would suggest bringing antibiotics with you. We couldn't wait to get home to get well and sleep in comfort.If you are looking for a vacation with absolutely beautiful beaches (with nothing but turquoise waters and no sea weed) and service with a smile and true appreciation for you business, go to Cancun. The price is similar, but the experience leaves you wanting to stay forever.

<Content>DR is absolutely amazing--however NEVER staying here again! Okay, so we will start with the good, this should be the quickest!GOOD----The resort is absolutely beautiful, the rooms are nice and spacious. Never had any difficulty finding spaces by the pool or the beach. We really enjoyed some of the employees (Lorenzo, Carlos, Jose Luis) that worked in the hotel, they were always willing to help us out whenever we need itBAD--The mosquitoes are definitely a huge problem, I dont think its the hotels fault, however just a problem with the area. The customer service can be somewhat poor. One night at the Asian restaurant, while arriving to eat at 8pm, we basically were berated for no reason as the hostess got snappy with us because they had to stop seating tables. Another incident involving a lady who decided to completely bypass and ignore us at the pool bar and helped other customers. It was disrespectful and not cool. To eat at any of the speciality restaurants--we had to arrive at 630, if you arrive too late, you'd be chancing it. When we actually ate at the asian restaurant, the food wasn't that great! and THEY decide what your going to eat. In addition to, the nightlife was absolutely miserable, they have three nice bars but really haven't made an effort yet to spice it up!ADVICE--ARRIVE at DINNER at 630 everynight or your screw (eating at the pavilion and festival can get annoying FAST), dont worry about the VIP (its just a difference of a pool and where you eat), not worth the money, There is also alot of Europeans who stay at this hotel therefore be prepared for problems with communicating with others. And be prepared for awful food (the best restaurant was the french!

<Content>Beautiful hotel, but still needs some work I went to the Edenh with my husband and another couple for four days to celebrate our friend taking his bar exam. Before I give a full review, I should start off with saying that we are the kind of people who will find a way to have fun anywhere, so some things that might be big problems for others probably didn't bother us as much. The Good:The hotel is beautiful, and the rooms are clean and spacious. The huge bathtub was wonderful. Some of the bartenders are really nice, especially the ones at the disco lounge. The were happy to give us as much alcohol in our drinks as we wanted, and the waiters in the restaurant we always ready to give us shots of Mamajuana! The food at the buffet was great. My husband has Crohn's disease and can't eat a lot of ethnic stuff, but he loved it. The beach buffet for lunch was good, lots of American food, and we enjoyed eating lunch by the beach. The casino was really nice, if that's your thing. The guys had a blast playing blackjack and poker, and we girls had fun playing the slots. The bad:It is almost impossible to get a drink during lunch at the beach and the lobby at night. I don't know if they were low on staff or what, but we waited (tips in hand!) for long periods of time trying to get drinks. There were a lot of mosquitoes in our room. Our friends were on the second floor and didn't have any problems, but we had HUGE ones every night in ours. The maids leave the doors open when they clean, so I'm sure this contributed to the problem. The restaurants were the biggest problem for us, though. We enjoy going to the al a cartes at resorts, but it was almost impossible here. We had to wait in line in the hot sun for about an hour and a half just to get a pager. Once we got it, we were not given a choice for the time, just told when we had to eat. It was incredibly frustrating and the food really wasn't worth it. That was the one night that we actually got angry about something.We've been to all inclusives before and I just don't think that the stress caused by the ridiculous restaurant set up at the Edenh is necessary.All in all, our stay was good because we tried not to let little stuff bother us. If they got the restaurant situation under control I would consider returning if the price was still good.

<Content>Absolutely, positively wonderful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This hotel was absolutely great, the entire trip was a dream! I went down for my friend's bachelorrette party and we had an amazing time! The hotel was clean, comfortable, and relaxing. The staff was extremely willing to help and was by your side for your every need. I will be honest, after reading the nasty reviews I was extremely nervous to go on this vacation. After arriving, however, I understood completely who was complaining. When going to the restaurants, AMERICANS were complaining about their reservations (there were no reservations allowed at the restaurants) and this one lady was SCREAMING at the hostesses demanding to know why there was not champagne on her table when she arrived. I was honestly embarrassed to be from the same country as her. There were multiple incidents with people complaining over the most ridiculous things!My friends and I had a wonderful time. The beach and pools were beautiful and the nightly entertainment was great as well. The food was yummy too!This is a great place to go on vacation if: you have children, are honeymooning, or are an older adult looking for a great time away. I wouldn't recommend this resort for some young kids looking to get wasted and not remember the vacation. My friends and I are 22-26 and we drink but not to get wasted. It was positively the best experience. If you book through apple vacations, seek out Santos- the hotel rep. We did the marinarium excursion which was amazing- we swam with sharks and stingrays and what I like to call dori fish (finding nemo the movie) Hope this helps anyone who was as nervous as me!!

<Author>Beachgirl025
<Content>Nice trip My husband and I stayed at the Edenh June 10-16. We booked our trip through Funjet vacations. It was our first time going to the D.R. but we have done all inclusive resorts before. I of course read every review about the resort. I really was not too concerned about the hotel. I have found that most people who say I'm really not that picky are really picky!The airport:This was the easiest experience we have ever had in an airport. Super fast! We were one of the first people to get out luggage and as soon as we walked out our driver was waiting for us. He led us to a nice air conditioned van. It took about 20 minutes to get to the resort.The hotel:Very nice. It is clean. I didn't care for the incense smell but I realize it is a spa type feel but could do without the smell. It was even in the elevators. We went right into the Paradise Club lounge, we were the only ones on the bus staying at the resort. We had welcome drinks and then we were taken on a tour of the hotel and then to our room. The room:We had a great room. I think it was room 2475. It had a huge balcony overlooking the ocean. We did have a view of the empty lot but since the balcony was L shaped you could look straight out at the water. The only bad thing is that our AC didn't work. It was 83 degrees. We called for someone to check it out. They came quickly, said it just needed freon and it would be cool in 5 minutes. So we left for dinner and returned to 83 degrees. We called and asked for a new room and we were moved that night to room 2465, right across the hall. The balcony and view were not as great but the AC was working and that was most important to me! We actually met the people who got our old room with the AC still broken but they loved the view so much they decided to suffer through it!! The pools:We spent most of our time at the VIP pool. Carlos and Ramon were tons of fun! They were always bringing us drinks and buckets of beers! The resort was not full so there we no problems with chairs or umbrellas.The beach:The beach was beautiful. The sand is so white and soft. The water was warm. We never had a problems finding a place at the beach. The food:We ate at the Italian the first night. It was pretty good. I had pasta and my husband had lamb chops, his was really good! We ate at the Asian twice, once doing the hibachi. It was good. We did the buffet twice, I was not impressed with the dinner buffet but there was always something to eat. I am a very picky eater and I didn't go hungry! The lunch buffet at the pool was really good especially the pizza and chicken. I'm not a big breakfast person but my husband said the omlets are great. Overall the food was pretty good, better than some of the all inclusives we have been to. The beach party was fun, lots of good food to try.Now I usually get sick at some point on a vacation whether we are in the US or in another country. We had antibiotics on hand just in case but never needed them. I did make sure that I drank a lot of bottled water. We never brush our teeth with the tap water. So this was my first vacation in a long time without getting sick.We didn't really have any issues with mosquitoes in our room. We packed 3 citronella candles for the balcony, I brought a fly swatter for the room, bug spray with 30% Deet, bite MD, and caladryl. I did get bites in the evening but the bite MD worked better than the caladryl. I think I had 5 bites and my husband had 1 on his ankle. Nothing that could ruin the trip. It seems like people on the first floor had more issues with mosquitoes. ?But we read reviews and new what to bring so we didn't spend a fortune in the gift shop on sprays and meds! We also took Malarone since the CDC recommends anti-malaria meds. We had no side effects from the meds.We went parasailing. It was $70 for the two of us. We went way down the beach to almost where the ship wreck is ( I think nears Dreams??) to parasail. It was fun, we took our water camera and got some good pics. We didn't do any other excursions. I would definitely recommend this resort to a friend. But you have to keep in mind it is more of a relaxing spa type resort. So if you are looking to stay up late and party this is not the place for you, there is nothing to do late night.

<Content>Fantastic vacation!!!!!! Check In - Arrived at Edenh Approx 2am and were quickly checked in and taken to our rooms. Staff at check in were very nice and informative. Rooms - Rooms were beautiful...A Little different as we all know, but myself and Boyfriend really didn't care about the hole in the wall. We were in our rooms only to sleep and get ready for our evenings out. Travelled with 3 other couples to Edenh and they also had great rooms with great veiws.Beach - ABSOLUTLEY AMAZING!!! So Clean and beautiful. The staff keeps the beach super super clean. There is always someone going around each and everyday collecting Garbage until the sun goes down...Beach Chairs - Never really had a problem getting one. There were 8 of us in our group and we all managed to get 8 everyday for our 2 week stay. Some days we never got to the beach until around 11ish and had no problems at all. Loungers were always available by the pool as well.Food - the Food was great...Especially liked the Shore Grill and Hibachi bar. Again, Never had any trouble getting in at the resturants...had to wait 5 mins one night but it was no big deal. Rafael at the breakfast buffett was Fantastic..He is the coffee guy and was an absolute delight in the mornings. At the end of our stay , he brought 8 of us a little ornament from his hometown of Huigey to remember him by. He was truly amazing!! Entertainment - Never really saw alot of the entertainment in the Evenings as we usually sat on our Balcony until the wee hours of the morning having drinks and just having fun. What I did see of the entertainment, it was great. The costumes are just spectacular. The sports Bar was always fun as well with Karaoke night...The Best Night was the Beach Party. What a Great time we had. The only thing lacking in the Entertainment world at Edenh in not having a Disco. Staff- Super super Nice....No problems with the language barrier at all. Most spoke very good english. So my overall review of this resort is a huge thumbs up...our group enoyed every miniute of a our 2 week stay and would go back in a heartbeat. Hope you all have a great experience as we did. Go and have a good time and relax...Its the perfect place for it....CHEERS!!!!!

<Content>Too Relaxing - Did not make me feel special - BORING How do I begin...Bad, no it wasn't too bad, frankly it is a beautiful place, Let me list the pros and the cons...if you are going soon, read, this is a very HONEST opinion , with no exagerations..truly1. Rooms - Excellent - Big enough, modern flat screen TV. If traveling with family (adolescant, teens) you might want to ask for rooms with privacy, the bath area is open leaving you literally no where to change clothes when you want to change, or to get dressed after a shower. It was fine for us, it was just my hubby and me. The elevator are not air conditioned so you will roast in there and the bldg on the left as you look the beach, those elevators never worked. My friends had to be moved to a ground floor due she is very pregnant and could not climb stairs.2. Mosquitos, yes, quite a few, my hubby never got bit, but I did. They do spray, you can smell it in the evenings when they spray. But first day I was eaten alive, I learned , every time I took a shower I put Avon Skin so soft - bug repellent cream, and that did the trick ! No more bites ! Not one...they were in the room but stayed away from us !3. Internet - Great Service - Nelson the internet/business office guy was awesome young guy. You buy internet for your laptop and you have wireless WIFI in your room or pool area, for 25 dollars you get 25 hours, you can break up the hours, so we had internet all week, it was awesome, stayed in touch with the kids.And we used SKYPE to call home for 2 cents a min, awesome !We took a headphone, laptop and talked away on skype.com.4. Beach - AWESOME beach, no chair games, plenty of chairs and huts to pick from. The front ones were usually taken by early birds, but there were 2nd row plenty of them. Nice huts and chairs and beach was awesome. Activities on beach, was 15 dollars for bannana boat ride (too much !!) The vendors on the beach were annoying, altough the police did a good job of keeping them away, a distance, the minute you walked over the line they swarmed you.5. Pool - was nice...6. Bar service - lacked big time, not that friendly, although Ramonfrom the VIP bar on the right as you face the beach is awesome. He will accomodate you. (even though I was NOT vip, he was awesome. And Alexis from the pool bar was nice. The rest were fake and not very friendly. Regardless what they say, my rum and cokes were NOT watered down, they were toooo strong ! lol Hello, no water bottles at regular bars to the beach, only VIP !!! No water bottles, that is NUTS !7. Food by the pool - same food over and over, boring !!!! but, listen to me, at no extra charge , they will make Chicharron de pollo with tostones (chicken chunks with plantains) just for you and your party, also, they make fish, and pork chunks, which are chicarron de puerco. See Marisela at that restaurant called Olas, she is awesome, tell her Nilda from Miami said hi ! 8.Food at restaurants - A la carte - awesome (when open) they only had 2 out of 4 open on each nite, which did not make it very easy for us. You didn't have much of a choice and sometimes even the buffet would close and only the pool snack bar/buffet was open !!! CRAZY, they said it was because the hotel was not full to capacity and did not warrant opening up the entire eating facilities !!! CRAZY...made it where you HAD to eat by 630/7pm or you would not eat by 845 and then they ran out of half the stuff !!! Crazy is the word here ! Maria the Asian/French romantic restaurant was awesome, made you feel so special !! And do did Eddy at the italian. We managed to get wine bottles to the room too, don't ask how , we just did :)~ Portions were fine, really, we were stuffed every nite...you can ask for seconds if the portion is too small, they do cater to you there. They are great at the restaurants. But the buffet, get ready to wait for EVEN water...terrible. Not at the beach one, the main buffet.9. Now here is the BAD BAD BAD part - Animation !!!!! NONE, NONE, NONE, the music by the bars at the pool/beach were very quiet, at nite by 8 pool closed, bar closed at 6, so it was very quiet/lonely and very very dark by the pool once it all closed down. Horrible, no action after 600 , none ! This is a very very boring hotel, no action, they advertize a bowling alley, I have yet to find it, they have not built it yet. They have not finished construction so nothing to do, the disco only rave music, yuk, they should have a variety of all types not just RAVE stuff. Empty most of the nites..And bartenders need to know when to stop serving some people, even kids !!!!9. Customer Service - lacking customer service, the phone operators were like, WHATEVER, the only ones I really enjoyed their service i mentioned on this review.10. Shows - The only show we liked was the first one we saw, very good , the rest was karaoke, yuk, drunk silly people11. Shopping - we went to Bavaro plaza for shopping, all the same junk but , whatever, we just went ! Don't let them give you a price, whatever they say , talk them down, my purchase started by them at 75 dollars, i ended up at 21 dollars for 3 items.12. Security Guards - I left money with a security guard to give to a waitress when she came back from her day off, he gave me his name in honor and he swore he would give it to her, I had my doubts, so I called her when I got home and asked her , he stole the money, I called the manager of security and she got it back and he was almost fired if it wasn't for the waitress begging for him not to get fired cuz he needed the job. So do not trust everyone !13. The hotel said they had alot of noise/animation/music but for some reason the Europeans did not like this and asked for the loud latin music to cease, and it seems they are targeting more the European clientele, which is fine, but do not , advertise in Miami, if you want Europeans to rule your hotel. Latins like music, dancing, noise, (most of us) and even the FRENCH CANADIANS said this was the most BORING hotel they had EVER been tooooo and they were an OLDER FRENCH CANADIAN Couple.Ok overall - if they fix their minor issues, they WILL be a 5 Star, right now Service is a 2 star, and the hotel facility itself I would give it a 4.5 star !Email me for more details...

<Content>Hated and it was the last time I went there. Really good hotel, but some stuff was even fully develped: I came there with family and guess what they have open space between bathroom and bedroom.Good sea and the beach, but no good entertaiment. really boring, especially at night. No Disco.Food was terible, they tried to save money and staff, well regarding staff was very unpleasand. If you give them $1, they will not even talk to you.but what yuo are expected from their staff, if even food manager Jose Maria - he is a big shot in resort, was very unpleasand. They have 4 restaurants, for which you have come 1 or 2 hour early to get a pager, in one you can not even bring your kids. One day we were invited to that restaurant for celebration some kid birthday, parents payed $50 to get 8 kids inside and have some fun. Next day we were invited to our friend birthday, she was 48 or so, her husband spend $50 to get us in with my son. Then Jose Maria came and said I have to kick you out. We tried fight, but no it is a rule, it has been broken yeterday but not today. When we tried to explain that it is one kid, no, no work and out.Oh, and one more thing, in every room on the telephone it says that dial 877 number or 866 from USA or Canada for free to get contact to you in room, total bs. Your relatives will pay 1.25 per min. and $7 connection. Good business.For the amount of money I spent, $3800 for the family of 3, does not worth it. If you have a choice, just look for something else.

<Content>Beautiful Resort we stayed at the resort from june 12th to june 19th and absolutely loved it. the design of the resort was top of the line. staff was very very friendly and helpful. we had swedish massage on the beach for $80/hour and i have to tell you that was one of the best massages we ever had. beach party and picante show was absolutely amazing. we even went twice to see the show. we had pink bracelets and got to enjoy the private pools and top shelve liquor. however, mamajuana was our favorite drink. tantra bar was very beautiful and had a swimming pool inside it. however it was empty most of the time because of not that many people at the resort. that's why we went to discos at the other resorts, our favorite was pacha and areito (no cover fee), mangu was ok, $8 to enter. drinks at the discos are anywhere from $5 to $8, that's why we drank a lot at edenh before going out. taxi was expensive though, $15 for 5 min ride. we recommend to book your airport transfer beforehand in order not to get screwed on the taxi costs. excursions were around $90, but we had so much fun going out, that we decided not to spend money on them...definitely will come back again to this wonderful resort.

<Content>Mosquitos almost ruined my trip.. Other than that it was fair I went to Edenh with my boyfriend June 13th-16th. Neither of us have been anywhere like this before so we don't have much to compare it to but I have heard enough from other people to know that this trip was not top-notch. However, there were many things that we liked.The resort is brand new and beautiful. We had no problems with construction or anything like that like some people have mentioned. Our room was great and even smelled new. We had pink bands and were lucky enough to receive one of the rooms closest to the beach. Ramone at the VIP pool bar is fabulous- even brought us drinks while we sat in the hot tub on our patio because it rained all day. Overall, the service was excellent. Everyone was very accommodating and quick to get us whatever we needed. The food was poor. The Italian restaurant was good I thought, but I love pasta so I was happy to have it. The hibachi restaurant is good also. Shore Grill wasn't bad but there is hardly anything to choose from- the menu consists of about 5 items and it is this way at all of the restaurants. The buffet disappointed me. The presentation is amazing.. everything looks so good and pretty- but how it tastes is disappointing. The omelets are good. I highly suggest eating Italian and Japanese- but do the hibachi because the portions otherwise are so tiny it's ridiculous.Now on to the mosquitos.. I left there w/ 15 bites. Most of them were happening in the room. I got NO sleep because they were biting me in bed and I was too paranoid to stay asleep. I slept in a robe, pants and socks every night and still got bit. We met at least 3 couples on our trip and every girl was getting bit but the men did not get bit once. For some reason they only go after females. Buy ORO at the hotel shop. Spray it all over your room as often as possible and make sure to spray the vents. We did this and found at least 20 dead all over the room. Although this helped a little, I was still miserably itchy the entire trip. The last thing that I wanted when I was trying to relax was to be in agony because my whole body was itchy. Only other complaint is that there wasn't much entertainment. It was just my boyfriend and I and we were pretty bored at night. Could've been because it was during the slow season but there was just nothing to do. Other than these complaints we had an okay vacation. I wouldn't return to this resort but the experience wasn't awful.

<Content>Just Returned from Edenh....Very Enjoyable Experience! Just returned yesterday from a 5 night stay at Edenh on June 14th-19th! My wife and I were celebrating our 10th Anniversary and we had a good time there, the place was beautiful and weather was great except the first day we arrived when it was raining. We booked a Deluxe Room (Green wristband) through Cheap Caribbean.First, men...make sure you bring your pants! I told my wife in the weeks prior to leaving to make sure she brought a dress, etc. as the Ala Cartes are more dressy and you cannot wear shorts. I then proceeded to of course leave my pants at home and had to go buy some at the local shops in the mall at Palma Real.. $100 later I had a new pair of Jeans to wear to dinner!!!! For that, I am an idiot! Anyway, here goes...Basics:Room: 2307 - 2nd building, third floor, room 7. Very nice, no mosquitos, huge jacuzzi tub, interior veiw of fountains/pools. Great! Bathroom glass door was missing knob, but no big deal to us. Jacuzzi filled up quickly with no problems, plenty of hot water, worked perfectly! Huge King size bed, was a little hard but I slept like a baby. Only negative was that the towels in the room were extremely rough, not very soft at all! Flatscreen TV, tile floors, nice balcony..............overall I give the room a 4.5 out of 5.Food: Good overall, 3.5 out of 5! Hibachi - Excellent, 5 out of 5! Shore Grill - Good, 4 out of 5! Cirque Terre - Good for me, wife didn't like so we'll give it a 3 out of 5! Senses - Didn't try. Buffet - Good but a little repetitive, 2.5 out of 5!Pools/Beach: Awesome! Plenty of chairs, palapas and lots of drinks! Alexis at the swim up bar is a riot and the Presidente is cold! Got to the point where if I headed that way, they started pouring dos cerveza's for me without having to ask! Awesome! 5 out of 5!Service: Good in housekeeping if you were specific in your needs. Buffet's were a little lacking in service but not bad. Ala Carte's were much better service and peronal attention as you would expect. Overall, 3.5 out of 5!Casino: Kicked my butt. Please note: this is not run by the resort from what I understand but still reflects upon it. I felt a little cheated like they weren't on the up an up totally to be honest. Some was my poor play and bad luck, other times they tried to quickly pull cards and chips not giving time to verify counts at blackjack. I stopped them each time it was done in error and the pit boss confirmed the correct counts, but I felt it was intentional on some dealers part. If they were dealt an Ace, they had Blackjack every time...no lie! Most dealers weren't very friendly, never smiled. Some of this was due to language barrier I think, other times it was just that particular dealer. A few would play along with you and joke which is how they all should be. Very little bar service in here, should've been more and no ATM's on site. However you could make a charge to your credit card or bank card in the casino for a 7% fee to get more $$ if needed. They had 5 blackjack tables, 2 roulette tables, 1 Texas Hold'em table (which was never used, not enough interest unfortunately, I would have loved to play), and about 25 slot machines. Overall I'll give it a 2 out of 5!Entertainment/Shows: Unfortunately we too busy losing all our money in the casino or drinking in one of the many bars to go to one of the shows so I can't rate them for you.Giftshop: Very expensive! $2 US for a milky way candy bar, $8 for a bag of Doritos! More reasonable on t-shirts, etc. for small gifts for the kids, etc.Tipping: I was a little worried/irritated going into the trip about having to tip at an All Inclusive Resort. But, to be honest with you, I never felt pressure to tip at anytime, I only did so when I felt it was deserved and tipped according to the level of service. $1 per bag for the bell hop taking our luggage; $3/day for housekeeping, $5 if I requested something specific; $5 per meal in the Ala Carte's, $1-$2 per about every other drink order...which was frequent!! LOL I never got the impression they expected a tip, but I always felt they appreciated it when you did tip so in the end it all worked out good.We didn't do any excursions or use the free water activities, i.e. kayaks, snorkeling, catamarans, etc. There are some health issues with my wife that prevented us from doing that right now, otherwise we would have tried some out.Bottom line is if you've booked this resort, go and you will have a good time! It was a nice relaxing week and I did get to meet PC Mike and a few other regular posters from TripAdvisor and I enjoyed meeting them and having some drinks with as well!!We would return here I think without much hesitation so if you choose to go here, I think you will enjoy it! I'd rate this resort between a 3.5 and a 4.0 right now. They have the potential to reach 5 star but it will take some work, finishing touches and attention to the little details that make 5 star resorts stand out.

<Content>Great Relaxing Vacation I have read Trip Advisor reviews for several years to help plan many different trips, but I don't think I have ever seen the wide range of comments on any property than I have on the EdenH. After my visit to the EdenH, I can confidently say that most of the hysterics and warnings posted by some people here are completely unwarranted. At this time, the hotel represents a great travel value; probably not a 5 star experience, but a solid 3.5 star. My S.O. and I paid $1100 from CheapCarribean.com for airfare from Atlanta and 3 nights from June 12 to June 15.HotelOur package included transfers and the Turinter Tour bus was waiting at the airport. We had about a 15-20 minute ride to the resort and arrived about 2pm. Check-in was prompt, but no mention was made to us regarding an upgrade to the VIP package. We were assigned to room 2316. It was on the 3rd floor and faced the infamous vacant lot. Truth be told, you really can't see into the lot due to the fencing, but it basically contains sand and palm trees. I was unable to tell if there is construction going on in it or not, but you could certainly see the ocean. The lot was a non-issue. We had a huge balcony that was larger than the ground level room balconies. The A/C was icy cold. Much has been made of the hole in the bathroom wall, but it opens up the room as the jacuzzi tub sits right behind it. Sure, you are able to see people in the sink area, but the shower and toilet are enclosed in smoked glass. There have been reviewers complaining about this set up, but in reality, if you are here with someone else, more than likely you are not strangers. The room had a couch, fridge stocked with sodas and beer and about 100 channels on the flat screen TV. Overall, a very nice room.Beach and PoolThe beach area is awesome. There were plenty of loungers and huts. We did not experience the chair game but admittedly, we are late risers and were at the beach at 2:30 the day of check in and about noon the next day. The sand is sugary and the water is clear. There was some seaweed, but not enough to ruin it. The beach bar and restaurant are very close by. The restaurant had burgers, salads, grilled chicken, pizza, etc, in an open air setting. The pool area has plenty of loungers. FoodI was very surprised at the food. After reading some of the other reviews, I wasn't expecting much, but we were pleasantly delighted. We ate at the Italian, Asian, and American al a carte restaurants. My favorite was the Asian and my SO really enjoyed the Italian. We usually ate around 7 and never had to wait. We had breakfast and lunch at the buffet and were impressed by the variety. Someone posted that there was no fruit on the buffet, but that is a lie, there was plenty. There were people there to bring drinks and it was never an issue getting them. We ordered off the room service menu late one night and it took about an hour to get there. The menu has things such a full breakfast, salads, sandwiches, burgers, but also some odd choices like beef carpaccio and ceviche. Service and AttitudesOverall, we found the employees very friendly and helpful. I ran into a surly cashier at the casino, but that was about it. They did seem stingy with the towels and washcloths as we had to call to get extras. One of the bellmen helped us a couple of times getting a cab and taking care of our luggage and was very personable. Housekeeping came every day, and did an adequate job. My SO used the spa for a massage and hair braiding and was happy. So, if she was happy, I'm happy. Other reviewsSome people complained about getting sick. You are in the Dominican Republic, not at the local Dairy Queen. Spend the $5 at home and get some Pepto and Immodium before you come. My SO had one night of an upset stomach, but we came prepared. Someone was yapping about some kid getting swimmers ear and the subsequent treatment by the doctor. There are two easy solutions to that problem: leave the rugrats at home or spend the $3 before you travel for ear drops. Bring mosquito repellant. We must have gotten lucky; we had one mosquito in our room one night. Someone also said that mariachi music was blaring. That is not true. They must have gotten this trip mixed up with some trip they took to Mexico. The pool area has outdoor speakers with jazz-type music playing in the background. Those are just a couple of the exaggerations and hyperbole that need to be refuted. Overall ImpressionsThere were a few things that we felt could be improved. There needs to be some sort of informational sheet posted regarding activities and what restaurants are open on a daily basis. We found one place where they posted some info, but it wasn't there all the time. Also, put some info about Spa services in the room. It would also be a good thing to have a sign up sheet for Texas Hold 'em in the casino. No one was ever at the table to play. The most glaring issue to me were the drinks. They were definitely watered down. I don't know if it was any different at the VIP bars, but most of our drinks just had a hint of alcohol. Positively, we really enjoyed a night at the Tantric Bar. It is outside with lots a seating and it is great to relax there on a nice night. Also, we got a kick out of the photographer that was around the pool area. He had a couple of cockatoos that he would let you hold and take a picture that you could purchase later. Overall, it was a very nice, very relaxing vacation. Do not believe the horror stories.

<Content>despite a few lacks we had a great time we stayed at the edenh real resort from may 17-29, 2008 and overall, we had a great time. after reading all the negative reviews from january on, we got a bit nervous and upgraded to the paradise club. this, in our opinion, was well worth it, starting with having your own pool. due to low season, we had the left pool (looking towards the ocean) almost to ourselves in the first week, while the main pool was occupied by a lot of noisy and drunk people in the afternoon.check-in was easy, after we realized where the pc check-in actually takes place. leonardo is a sweetheart, always at your service, always being very helpful.the room (1360 -towards the pool and ocean) was nice, we travel a lot within asia, therefore not comparable to the 5-star standard over there. for caribbean standard it was nice and relatively clean. we always had mosquitoes in our room. the bathroom was great, two vanities, huge shower stall, we did not have a problem with it's concept at all. we never used the bathtub on the balcony, heard though that the tub on the terrace in the suites have only cold water, does not really make sence to us.restaurants: we did not particularly like the food in the 脿-la-carte restaurants, maybe we are too picky, i don't know. after trying every restaurant we continued having dinner at the buffet restaurant. first of all we could always dine al-fresco and we always found somehting we liked in the tremendous choice they offered. in our opinion, the gourmet (french) restaurant was the worst ! the beach grill was o.k. but very repetitive. the beach party was great, they are really making a big effort, the food is not outstanding but the location makes up for that anyway.bars: we stayed mostly in the main bar (don't remember the name) until it closed and then changed to the roof-top bar. ask for jos茅, he can mix some wicked drinks. most of the time we had good drinks, although they very much varied depending on which bartender prepared them. the rooftop bar was always empty during our stay, we found that a real pitty, the set-up in lounge style is really great and it's outdoors ! we had no explination for the lack of visitors.beach: amazing, truly amazing. we stayed at the iberostar punta cana and at the dreams (formerly sunscape the beach) before and this was the nicest stretch of beach so far. we walked often to both sides, left and right and we really loved the beach after the melia hotel. we had the most seaweed in the water but the hotel has no influence in this, we suppose. they cleaned the beach from the seaweed daily.beach chairs: every morning there wore so many empty beach chairs, by the pool, by the sea. what were the people talking about ?staff: we found the staff very kind and helpful, at all times of the day, everywhere. maybe the constant complainers on this site should cuten up their attitude a little bit and be nicer to the people - might be very helpful. we can honestly say we always got what we wanted, sometimes a bit faster, sometimes a bit slower.paradise club: we personally think the upgrade is worth it, seperate pool, extra breakfast section with hot, fresh served food, upgraded bar, room close to the beach, fresh towels at night etc. it's not a must but nice to have.overall, we had a great time, met nice people, would we return ? we believe in not returning to the same place again, it can seldomly be topped, we like to keep our good memory of edenh real

<Content>Loved it!!!!!!!! We arrived at the Edenh June 7 at 5h00pm. This is our 3 trip in the Dominican. The front desk was very polite and very quick to accomodate us. We had the green bracelets. We were in building 2, room 2422. The room was beautiful. Nothing extravagant but really nice!!! The only thing was that there was no privacy in the room for the shower and the bathroom. but i had read that in the reviews before we got there, so we knew what to expect.The resort was gorgeous, very big... The beach was great, always had chairs at the beach and at the pools. The staff was always friendly, polite and always there if you needed anything. A lot of them speak english, so we had no problem comunicating.The food was good. Always a great variety (chicken, fries, pasta, pizza, pork chops.....) The hibashi was the best!!! We went there twice. The beach party buffet was also lots of fun!!!! Lots and lots pf preparations!!!!The only complaint that i have is the intertainment. There was not anything to do at night on the resort. I dont know if its because its a new resort but the intertainmaint was not good at all. Maybe on the long run it will get better, but right now  thumbs down''.We also read about all the moskitoes, never had any problem there.For the people that complain....... I dont get it. you are on vacation, and you are served like royalty, you dont have to cook, clean... the only thing you have to do is relax and enjoye yourself. Thats what we did and we had a wounderful timeSo this was a great trip!!! and we were very satisfied with this resort!!!

<Content>ENJOYED OUR STAY My boyfriend and I stayed at the Eden H from May 25 to May 30. We booked the trip back in February due to a great deal but after reading all the reviews since then I was extremely worried. I shouldn't have been. Our particular experience was great. We were green bands, which was fine. We preferred the other pools to the VIP pools and the other VIP amenities didn't seem to be so great, so I'm glad we didn't spend the extra money. We arrived around 4:00 pm and were checked in quickly. No delays or problems. We got a room on the first floor facing the pools at an angle. Turned out to be perfeclty fine. The room was huge, and the bathroom situation didn't bother us. The Beach was beautiful and pristine, and there were plenty of palapas and chairs. Very relaxing. There were also plenty of chairs available around all the pools. The drinks were fine as we're not big drinkers anyway, but it was definitely alcohol! The food was abundunt but not very good. The chicken and fried calamari at the Pool grill was good, but same thing every day. We went to the Asian and Senses restaurant. Neither was very good after getting a beeper and waiting for a while. They both ran out of deserts by the time we were there! The dinner buffet was ok, as there was alot of variety, just not the best. They have theme nights, and on the Asian night they did have some great sushi. We sat on the patio and were served very promptly with drinks and nice service. We never went to the Breakfast Buffett but ordered room service every am with fruit, a variety of rolls and coffee. It was perfect for us. We also never went to the Lunch Buffett but ate at the Beach grill.We took a day trip to Santa Domingo which was nice, but it's a 3-4 hour bus ride each way which was tiring. Enjoyed the visit there though.The Casino was small with a few slot machines we played while waiting for our call to dinner. The sports bar is ok, but was cold and not very crowded, and the Tantra Bar was just weird. Also, not crowded.Oh, we didn't experience any mosquitoes either!I guess everybody has different expectations and different experiences. Ours was overall great, fun, and relaxing. Some of the employees are very friendly and helpful and some are rather rude. I think for what we paid we got a great deal. I wouldn't go back only because I like to go different places, but I would recommend it to others.

<Content>Tropical Hell Lets see where to begin.....We booked this hotel thinking It's brand new, how bad could it be? God knows we weren't expecting anything nearly as terrible as this!!Here's the quick and dirty version of our 5 days at this place...the food was terrible, the service was non-existant mainly beacuse the staff could care less about the guests, we had 5 rooms in 5 days, and left a day early cause it was unbearable. Day 1, Room #2119 - We were in it for all of 3 seconds. It was completely infested with mosquitoes. We called the front desk and they reluctantly changed our room.Day 1, Room # 2216 - Mosquitoes, a broken handle on the toilet bowl, and a bug on the bed. A housekeeper came to spray the room and engineering showed up (with his trusty toolbox) to fix the handle. He also told us we were flushing the wrong way. After another visit from the engineer the handle was eventually fixed, but unfortunately we came back from the pool and found a bug on the bed. Time for room #3......we only had to wait 2 hours for it!!!Day 1, Room #2331 - Finally a room!Day 2, Room #2331 - Ceiling started leaking and the shower didn't drain. Luggage got wet from the water coming in from the tub above. Engineering came up, took a quick look figuring it was from the room above said he would be right back. The Engineer never came back and we never heard from anyone about it. We didn鈥檛 report it again because it seemed to have stopped and no one seemed to care anyway. Day 3, Room #2331 - Water came pouring into our room again and this time the ceiling started to cave in. After trying to reach guest services by phone to no avail it was time to take the 3 mile walk to the the Front Desk and change rooms.Day 4, Room #2351 - Came back from dinner and found 2 bed bugs - one on the comforter, one on the sheet. Called the front desk and the clerk told us there is no reason to move and to discusss it with someone in the morning. When we requested to speak with a manger he stated there are none on duty (it was midnight). We trecked the 3 miles to the front desk, showed him the dead bed bug and demanded a new room. He then decided that a manager was on the way up. When we questioned him about lying to over the phone he said there is a manager here and he called him because 鈥渕y attitude was getting better鈥? We finally got a new room (#1468) and changed our flights so we wouldn鈥檛 have to spend another waking moment at this horrible place. We slept on the couch because we refused to sleep in the bed to wait to get up the next morning and leave.In case anyone stayed in room #2351 after May 8th you should probably check your luggage. We had to throw out our luggage because there's no sure way to know if the bed bugs nested in the creases of the luggage. I could bet $10 that the room was cleaned and someone slept in that bed with bedbugs the very next nite. My husband works in the hotel industry and the only way to get rid of is to rip up the entire room, which clearly wasn't happening at a place that can't even provide more than 2 towels at a time.Good luck to anyone who's going to this resort.

<Content>Good trip but not a 5 star We just returned from a trip to EdenH, Punta Cana (1st time to DR) - 5-31-08/6-7-08 with 3 other couples (3 fr Dallas  1 fr Philly). Overall, we had a good time and would consider going again, but give food, service and hotel mixed reviews. We travel several times a yr in the Carribean and Mexico (last 20 yrs). Did not upgrade and were not provided info on the upgrade at check in. We heard mixed $ from guests on cost for the upgrade. OVERALL - very few of the staff went the extra step to provide great service - just the minimum was more the norm. CHECK IN - ok, we had requested 4 rooms close together, 3 were on one hall and same floor but one was not available until the next day; went with friends to their room (next door to unavailable room) - it was empty and clean. Finally got moved to right room - Wanda at the desk was very helpful. OVERALL LOOK OF RESORT - very nice, plenty of chairs, landscaping that will be beautiful when it matures. A few areas that could have used some upkeep or pick up. Someone was always around cleaning or sweeping up (I saw someone cleaning the ladies room at the pool area every time I was in there). The resort is very spread out, so that would be a problem if you don't get around well. ROOM - very nice but I did not care for the open bathroom concept for 2 reasons - 1, if you do have stomach issues and 2, if one is sleeping the light disturbs them. BEACH - awesome, you could walk forever; palapas  chairs - plentiful. STAFF- friendliness and service is mixed. I wear a smile all week on vacation and most people responded with a smile and Hola. Bar service was best - my husband made friends with the bartenders and was tipping - good drinks and friendly. Service was ok to good at Buffet  A la cart restaurants. Casino employees were rude, and either were not experienced dealers or were cheating; cashier extremely unfriendly. Maids - excellent work  shy but friendly (most speak no English). FOOD - so-so, I always found something to eat that was ok; A la cart - we did not wait more than 20 minutes to be seated all week - they would tell us the time and we'd go to the Sports Bar for a drink and then go back to be seated. Asian - very good (went twice); American - flank steak was very good (otherwise, just ok); French - ok to good, not my favorite. Buffet - breakfast - good (excellent omlettes); lunch by pool - ok, but repetitious, (pasta, baked potatoes, chicken and french fries were the best). Several of our group had stomach issues even though we were carefull about the water etc. SPA - 80 min combo massage was awesome. GIFT SHP - good prices on souvineer stuff (cap, beach jewelry, tshirts), expensive on medicine, snacks etc. I take all that from home. LANGUAGE is more of a problem than in other places we have been - did have some mis-communication issues but nothing huge - I need to learn Spanish. MISC - Vendors are agressive but kept off hotel beach. Sea weed in water and on beach but cleaned up. Husband played volley ball or water polo every day; yoga on the beach, aerobics by pool and in ocean. They need activity board though, so you know what's going on. Had group pictures made by photo shop - they were awesome and reasonable price. No snorkeling unless you take a boat. No town to speak of, only resort area. Mall is mostly designer stuff  pricy.

<Content>Do not stay at Eden H In one word: horrendous! However, one word is not enough to describe how truly terrible this place is. Others that come to mind include: horrible, dreadful, appalling, awful, ghastly and shockingly bad. Please save yourself the time and money and stay at home. 22 of us spent our family vacation and this hellish place. We covered every generation from 10 to 92 and amazingly all 22 of us had the same thoughts on this place. From arrival to departure I have never been part of such a debacle in my 30 years. Being a 6 year military veteran that says a lot. The 22 of us arrived at different times from separate locations yet we all had the same experience. It was as if the staff at Eden H didn't want us there. We had to wait forever to get checked into our rooms and the staff did everything theycould to prolong process. It was overly stressful, there was no communication, and every person in the lobby was frustrated. Mind you, this was 3 separate check in times, same experience. The service....well it was non existent. In fact it was a disservice! If the staff didn't see money in your hand, they ignored you completely. If you wanted coffee at breakfast you had to flag the coffee-guy down and more often than not you would have to go get him. Try to get coffee yourself and you were scolded. There are no beach butlers, they simply don't exist. If you want a drink on the beach you walk the 1/2 mile to the bar and get it yourself, in a 8 ounce plastic cup and don't forget the tip or you don't get your drink at all. Bottled water, bring it from your room orwalk the mile to the lobby to get it from travel representative, notfrom the hotel. Or you could fill up the 8 ounce plastic cup, but you may as well stay at the water dispencer, 8 ounces go fast. Now, onto the atmosphere. There is no place on this resort to relax aside from your room, which has a nice moldy smell. They blast mariachi music from 9:00am to 6:00pm. And the repulsive bartender only adds to the turbulent ambiance. At least 3 times a day the staff provide entertainment (distraction), from water aerobics to dancing. Of course, they too play music at obnoxious levels to drown out the other music and the previously mentioned bartender who, I am certain, is still screaming at the top of his lungs. Try to get away from all of this by finding a quiet spot on the beach, and there you have the recruiters for the flea market that stand at a demarkation line (literally a line in the sand) and harass anyone who dares to cross. If there is no one walking on the beach they stare at the beach goers and wave their tounge if they find you attractive. Moving onto the food. As bad as everything else about Eden H is, the food is the most inferior. Ihave never experienced anything this repulsive in my life. Of the 22 of us, 21 got sick. No lie, not an exxageration at all. It is slop.The meat is terrible. They have an executive chef on staff but serve nothing more than hot dogs, hamburgers, and french fries. I am not kidding. There is no seafood. Well, you can get lobster for an addition $30. No crab legs, no crab cakes, nothing. They have a meat and seafood restaurant but they only seafood is the $30 lobster. The meat, well you get the picture...the restaurant is called Meat and Seafood, not Steak and Seafood. We literally ate bread with jelly, french fries and ice cream for a week. Again, not an exxageration. When my 11 year old niece got swimmers ear and the Doctor on site wouldn't prescribe her ear drops because she was, get this, a young kid, the Doctor tried to strong arm us into taking her to the Punta Cana hospital. Enough was enough, I asked to talk to the General Manager, but I was only important enough to talk to the Resident Manager.When asked why we couldn't get medication for an 11 year old with swimmers ear he said the Doctor wasn't comfortable medicating children. Ridiculous! He then told us to talkto our travel representative. Dumbfounded! The Manager said he was there to provide a service, which they obviously couldn't do. We let him know how unhappy we were with all the issueswe had encountered to which he quickly defended everything we had to say and took nothing in a professional manner. He actually told us, I don't know why I don't know the answersto your questions. This was the #1 man on campus, the top dog, and he did nothing. If the management doesn't care why would the rest of the staff? Enough from me, I could go on for days. However, I will leave you with some other things to look forward to on your vacation. - Want a romantic moment in your Hot tub that won't hold water?The maintenance man will come take care of that for you by plugging thedrain with toilet paper.- Want to enjoy time at the pool with your children in a relaxing/safe environment?The maintenance crew will bring out an electric grinder with a 60ft extension cord pieced out 10 times just to place a water depth marker next to the pool. Yes, this is anelectric tool being used 1 foot awayfrom a pool filled with kids.- Get a bad case of diarrhea and want some relief?Too bad, Imodium AD is sold out because every other patron is in the same shape as you.- Voice your concerns to management about the food making everybody sick?Their answer...you drink too much!! Nice of him to assume I suppose. I would rather stay inside a tent in North Dakota in January than go back to this place!

<Content>EdenH is a great value First off, I want to say that we really enjoyed our stay. At its current pricing, EdenH is a steal-- it's not a five star resort yet, but it's offering a lot of quality for the money and has lovely, lovely bones. I can't wait to see what they do in coming years-- I think it's going to be spectacular.This is long but, since the resort is new and reviews have been ping-ponging all over the place (from Best. Resort. Ever. to Worst. Resort. Ever.), I wanted to try and address all the common complaints and praises.WELCOMEThe bellboys were lovely (Lorenzo somehow manages to be friendly, informative and efficient). We were not greeted with a cold drink or a towel, although there was a bar set up outside. We also went to the main desk (clearly marked check in); we didn't realize that, since we were Paradise Club, we were supposed to go to the special Paradise Club lounge. Although the front desk clerk was very, very nice, he didn't realize that we were PC... and got out the green bracelets for us. At that point, I inquired, he looked surprised, re-examined our voucher (the PC status was buried in travel agent-ese), got a second opinion, and re-routed us to the lounge. THE ROOMThe rooms are very nice and look like their pictures; for me, personally, I would have liked a little more artwork or color on the walls as they felt cold, but that is just my personal interior decorator coming out. Overall, I'd give the room an 7/10-- it was very nice, but not the sort of room that made me go wow or want to spend loads of time in it.The good: loads of drawers, shelves and storage space for clothes; an enormous king-size bed that, while firm, was still comfortable; tons of channels on the flat-screen TV; a minibar that actually kept drinks extremely cold rather than just chilled; a safe that easily held a laptop (Mac or PC); a shower head that was outstanding; the air conditioning was very, very strong; bed linens are lovely; turn-down service meant our wet bath towels got replaced every night.The not-so-good: stingy towels (we got one bath mat, two wash cloths, two hand towels and two very small bath towels); we did have some mosquitos in the room (always 2-3) and they did somehow come in even with the balcony door shut; yes, folks had squished a few mosquitos on the walls (we added to the number) and the carcasses were still there; if you shut the balcony door all the way, you were locked out; if you didn't shut the balcony door all the way, the air conditioning turned off in the room which wasn't good if your husband was still sleeping in there; you needed to have a room key inserted into the slot by the door to keep the power on (Lorenzo jerry rigged this by folding up a coaster, which we eventually replaced with my Starwood Preferred Guest card, but periodically the coaster/card would come loose and the power would go off, so the clock was always wrong). Housekeeping was good but not great. We started out tipping $5 USD/day and dropped to $3 USD quickly. Our room was clean but not immaculate; when we arrived, we were missing bathrobes (had slippers) and the minibar had not been stocked. Because we were PC, we were supposed to have pool towels in the room-- not there (we discovered this when we tried to get towels at the towel hut and were told we had to have a towel card-- back to the front desk for us!). Loads of people have talked about the bathroom design... we weren't bothered by it, but we were there celebrating our 15th wedding anniversary so we are very comfortable with each other. If you are super modest about bathroom matters or haven't learned to ignore your partner's bathroom activities, I could see where this would be a problem. The toilet is European-style, in a small separate room with a frosted glass door; this does mean that you can see the outline of the person using the toilet if you're in the bathroom. Because, even in the PC rooms, the bathroom wall does not go all the way to the ceiling, we could also clearly hear bathroom noises. Whatever. See previous reference to having been married fifteen years. We weren't precisely shocking each other.The view: this is going to hurt the hotel, long run. We were in the Punta Cana building (on right as you stand in hotel lobby and look toward ocean-- other side is Bavaro). Yes, there is a huge vacant, palm tree filled lot siding the resort. Yes, said lot is cordoned off by a two story high chain link fence covered with black plastic tarp. Someone has planted baby palms along the fence, which is a minor improvement, but it's not aesthetically pleasing and, if you're on the first floor, it's probably an eyesore (you're certainly not going to be looking at the ocean). They are also doing construction work in the lot-- not loads of work, but we still heard bulldozers, pile drivers, etc. in hour-long spurts during the daylight hours. If they actually build a hotel there, most of the rooms on the outside will be very close to the other hotel and will no longer have partial ocean views. We were in 2376, a PC room and thus close to the front of the building; we had a very nice partial ocean view (see pics). If you were not PC, you were in the second building and had very little view at all. If I was the hotel, I'd consider selling view categories. This has the potential to be very disappointing. They have some fantastic suites that are genuinely ocean front, but I'm not sure how you book those.POOLS10/10. These were hands-down the loveliest pools I'd seen. I loved the aqua greens and the spa vibe: loads of curves, white stones, greens and blues. We had absolutely no problem getting a chair anywhere-- the resort wasn't full while we were there, so everything was available all day long. We stayed at the VIP pool in front of the Punta Cana buildings and Ramon looked after us extremely well. BEACH9/10. Beautiful stretch of beach. Loads of palapas. Beautifully picked up. Not too many beach vendors on the hotel's stretch of sand (apparently, a select few are allowed to pace the water line, but not to come up to the chairs). Unfortunately, the minute you stepped foot past the two burly security guards on the perimeter, you were assaulted by beach vendors. Not the hotel's fault (and we had wondered why they had security there)... but off-putting. In fifteen feet, we'd have three vendors come up to us, talking away, and trying to shake hands, touch our arms, put arms around us, physically block our passage up the beach, and generally herd us toward their shop. Since none of them would take a firm No, gracias and at least one resorted to racial slurs, it was really off-putting. As my husband said, we didn't enjoy it-- but, if we'd had our kids with us, we would have been really upset. FOODOverall, 9/10. Las Olas, the beach grill, was not good. It wasn't horrible, either-- just a quick place to grab a burger, fresh-grilled chicken, some slightly soggy fries, or those cardboard nachos and cheese. Service was confusing there as well-- no one to seat you, but plenty of folks to get upset if you just sat down somewhere. You could take the food poolside, which was nice.Buffets: we ate at the breakfast and lunch buffets in the main buffet and found these to be excellent. Highlights for us were the selections of Dominican foods (it would be even nicer if these were individually labeled as some of the items were completely unfamiliar to us), outstanding Dominican coffee poured with warmed milk, fresh juices, and the huge selection of fresh doughnuts. There was an excellent selection of fresh fruit: it varied slightly from day to day, but included cantaloupe, papaya, mango, and watermelon. They also had whole fruit (bananas, apples, oranges) and little glass cups with interesting mixtures of fresh fruit, yogurts, honey, etc. Service was also excellent: coffee, fresh juice and water was kept liberally filled.Dinner: we always ate a la carte, between 6:30 and 7:30. We only had to wait once (fifteen minutes-- they gave us a beeper). We loved the no reservations policy, having been to all-inclusive where reservations were required and it became a nightmare to get into the restaurant you wanted. There were two a la cartes open and two closed each night; we never saw a list of which were open when. We ate at the Asian twice (a la carte once and tepanyaki table once: the tempura and the beef teriyaki were outstanding), Senses once (this was our least favorite, although I really enjoyed the seafood crepe appetizer), and the Steakhouse once (unbelievable ceviche and flank steak). Lobster was available for an extra charge ($29 USD), but we gave it a miss. There was loads of shrimp, octopus, mussels, and fish on the menu and we stuck to that. One minor note: the desserts appeared to be a sub-selection of what was available on the buffet (not uncommon in all-inclusives, although Sandals does an excellent job having fancy desserts in their a la cartes) and weren't particularly inspired (the carrot cake was just plain blah and the cheesecake wasn't much better-- Senses did have an excellent tiramisu). Given the outstanding coffee, another time I'd skip dessert at the a la carte and finish up in the buffet. Oops-- is that piggish of me? ;)Room service: we never tried it. We were PC and had what certainly appeared to be a regular room service menu in our room (club sandwich, burger, fries, ceviche, cheesecake). Someone mentioned a fancy one... we didn't have that. Perhaps we missed out? We did wish they'd had the breakfast card we've had in other resorts, where you mark up the card with breakfast items and stick it on your door knob the night before with a delivery window on it.Suggestions: develop a few signature desserts; offer a Dominican selection/tasting menu in each a la carte or have a Dominican restaurant; publish when each restaurant is open or closed; offer a drinks menu and a drink-of-the-day.Past reviews have mentioned getting sick, long waits, and poor quality. We noticed none of these and, in fact, had quite the opposite experience. We're fairly adventuresome eaters, although I do know that I can't eat an entire papaya for breakfast without unfortunate consequences... maybe some people just have more sensitive systems than others (we've never been sick at any all inclusive we've stayed at). It was NOT clear to us whether or not we could use the tap water to brush our teeth. I used bottled; my husband used tap. So far, we're both just fine ;)PARADISE CLUBShould you? Or shouldn't you? I honestly don't know. For us, it was $200 USD more for our four night stay, so we did. They give you a card when you check in that lists the benefits-- we're still not clear on what they really were, however, and ran into other couples that were also unsure what they were getting for their money. - Rooms closer to the beach. True. There were two buildings each in the Punta Cana and Bavaro sections. The building closest to the beach was PC, which meant you had a better chance of a good ocean view and were closer to the pools/beach.- Outdoor jacuzzi. Frankly, we would have preferred inside. If you're on the first floor, it just looks weird and uncomfortable to be sitting in your bathtub (and they do look like elegant bathtubs and not jacuzzis) while everyone walks by. We were on the third floor, but there were still mosquitos, so sitting outside wasn't all that much fun. Another time, I'd bring citronella candles and the problem would be solved.- Upgraded room amenities. Like what? Our room amenities consisted of a shampoo, body lotion, soap, and packet of q-tips. One day, we were given bath salts. If that was an upgrade, I pity the green bands. We did not receive a bottle of rum or a fruit plate and it wasn't clear if we were supposed to.- Bathrobes and slippers. Okay. Sure. But that does seem rather stingy (if you're going for the five star luxury effect rather than a bang-up-good-value-for-your-money three star). - VIP lounge and concierge service. They were fast and responsive when we had questions or needed something seen to in the room. Leonardo was a doll and we loved him. We did use the free internet one day.- VIP pools. Lovely. Ramon is a hoot. We wanted to record him saying Wassup? for our cell phone ring tone, but restrained ourselves.- Upgraded liquor: this was just weird. The regular liquor was pretty basic, probably disappointingly so. This is one of those areas where, if EdenH wants to bill itself as five stars, they'll need to improve. The PC members got five star liquor-- the green bands folks did not. They got three star liquor. We had Bailey's, flavored Absolutes, Sapphire gin, etc. The green band folks got some pretty blah generics. If you went in some of the bars, however, the extra-charge (for everyone) liquor included things like Jack Daniels (which we've never considered a premium liquor) as well as really, really top-end rums and whiskies. It was just strange.CASINOSmall doesn't begin to describe it. Open 8 p.m. on. They had a Texas Hold-Em table that they advertised-- but in four nights my husband never found anyone to play with. It would be great if the hotel could put a signup/interest sheet outside the casino so, if you're walking by during the day, you can indicate if you might want to play/know if there is interest.TIPSIf you like to snorkel, book the snorkel tour through the aquatic center ($30 USD/person for an hour). It's a two minute ride out to the reef with Ronnie and it's quite good. Visibility was excellent and there is some very nice fans/corals and fish out. Ronnie got in the water with us and showed us all sorts of corals, fed the fish (who knew they liked banana?), etc. Loads to see and the center had decent equipment.Walk down to Los Pinos in El Cortecito for your souvenirs. A fraction of what the hotel shop cost (they have basics like batteries and Pepto as well as souvenirs) and a very pleasant shop.Frankly, I think the EdenH is an excellent value at the $217 USD/night we paid. I'd consider it a four star hotel-- not a five. Our all-inclusive experiences include the Dreams, Riu and Palace chains. What made the difference, for us, between them and EdenH was the lavishness of the rooms (but EdenH is going for that minimalist spa vibe) and a sense of generosity/lavishness throughout the resort: no towel cards, loads of towels in the room, a minibar that is filled (rather than stocked with two sodas, two beers, and two waters), in-room liquor dispensers. The other resorts also offered a la carte lunch choices and loads of information about what was going on. EdenH was quality, but it wasn't quantity if that makes sense. If I was hotel management, I'd focus on refining my messaging (if your guests don't understand why they want or need PC, the messaging isn't working), adding more web copy to the website (it's very scant, so loads of us are getting our facts from TripAdvisor, which may or may not be accurate, particularly as the hotel tweaks things in its opening months), putting out a daily newsletter of what is happening (which restaurants, which activities, drink of the day, tour of the day, spa service of the day, etc.), and developing the spa angle (we didn't have a spa menu and didn't want to stop by the spa to get one... but it would be nice to have a spa dish on the a la carte menus, more yoga/stretching/beach walking activities, perhaps bundle spa services with the packages, etc. since the atmosphere is rather zen-like and relaxed).Bottom line is we had a comfortable room, excellent food, a decent view, and a really good time despite some really bad weather. We'd book EdenH again in a heartbeat at its current price point.

<Content>There Are Better Ways to Spend Our Hard Earned Money Short and sweet- Would have rather sat in my backyard and not spent thousands of dollars for a oh so forgettable, regrettable vacation. I knew better than to have not trusted the reviews. Read them all and pay heed to. All of my issues have already been addressed on this site. Off to Jamaica in October, where I'm sure it will make me forget about..... oh, I've already put it out of my mind.

<Content>You don't want to go there! Me and my husband as well as a couple of friends stayed at the Edenh May 4-10 2008 and none of us liked it. It was our third time to the D.R, second to Punta Cana. We stayed and the Riu Bachata and Riu Palace Macao before and we loved it. The RoomsFirst of all the hotel is beautiful, everything is new and clean. However we paid extra for the V.I.P package and should have got an ocean view room. What we got was the room on the main floor overlooking the pool and the umbrellas (ocan not in sight). Not only that, the balkony was open and our jacuzzi was right by the public walkway so we couldn't even take a romantic bath together without people walking by all the time. The washroom is open with the bedroom so if you have stomach problems trust me, it's heard and smelled all over the room. Our fruit basket consisted of a few small peaces of fruit, not enough for one child to satisfy. We had to fight with the management to give us a better room (which they eventually did) since after all we paid $700.00 extra. But still the bathroom was only halfway closed, you could still smell everything, ehhh.The entertainment There was almost no games or entertainment by the pool. It was so quiet all the time and boring. It wasn't until the end when they started playing some music. I didn't see the animacion people until the end, they don't really try hard there. The evening entertainment sucked, I mean really. There was one good show with professional dancers other shows consisted of some lame singers and O!! They played you movies on a big screen instead of shows in the evening. Like we don't have movies here or in our room?The staffI was suprised that the staff wasn't that friendly. Some were but being in the D.R the third time we expected more. The pool bars don't open until 11:00. One time me and my girlfriend went to the beach and she wasn't feeling that well and wanted some water because she thought that she might faint. We went to the pool bar and the guy told us to wait 15 min because they're not open yet. So we sat down and waited. 15 min later we came up to him again and he told us to wait 10 more minutes. I said Look we just want some water because my friend is not feeling well and it's quite a walk to the lobby. He told me I don't care So then I went to the V.I.P bar which luckly was open and got some water but I came back to the other bar to get this rude guy's name so I could report him. I didn't even say anything to him I just came up to look at his name tag and he sad to me in a rude manner What?!! When I spoke to the manager he wasn't too concerned, the girl at the front desk was actually laughing when I told her about the incident. How rude....... All the pool bars also close by 6:00 pm when its still sunny outside but the place is already dead because when there is nothing to drink people just go back to their rooms and leave the pool. The Food Horrible!! I am really not kidding. We've been to Jamaica, Cuba, and twice to the Dominican Republic before and never did we complain about food. Everywhere you go you will always have things you like and things you don't like but at the Edenh all of us didn't like anything. There is very little fruit in there, no friut at lunch at the pool restaurant, very little fruit at dinner, maybe some bannanas, pinapple and watermelon. that's about it. And they don't refill it too often so even if it is available, people take it and the plates will be emptly for an hour or so until the refill it. The food is very repetitive, not many choices but it's still better than the a la carte. OMG! I just can't explain it, I don't know where they got their cook from but they need to get rid of him. By the way even though they have a few a la carte, only one or two is open a night the rest is closed. You can't make reservations before so you end up standing in a line up (sometimes up to 1 hour) to make reservation or get a table. Not only that, every time, EVERY TIME we went to the a la carte (whichever one) we waited about 1-1.5 hours for the food. So when we stood in the line up at 7:00 pm for the restaurant, we don't get in until about 8:00 pm or past that and the food would usually arrive an hour or more after we sat down so we didn't eat until 9:00-9:30. There was four of us and all of us had stomach problems. But it wasn't just a bit of diarrhea that you usually get for the first couple of days just because the food there different. I was prepared for that. However, we were all violently sick; vomiting, diarrhea all the time, stomach cramps etc. day and night. All four of us spent the week hungry because we just could not keep down the food. Now for all of us it was the first time we got sick like that. Like I mentioned before, we love to travel to the D.R it is our favorite place and we always loved the food there!! But in the Edenh......I wouldn't touch it with a 2 m stick. I will just tell you this: If you have low expectations you will be ok there. However this place is too expensive for what it is worth. It looks like a 5 star but it operates on a 2 star level. We are not pessimists and never did we complain about any vacation until now. This place is going to fall really fast unless they change the management because it could have been an excellent resort if they tried harder. However, you can feel and see that they don't really care about people being happy there. There are so many better places to go to in Punta Cana. And if you do decide to go there, don't take the V.I.P package, it is really now worth it. the alcohol is the same (they're usually out of the brands at the VIP) to room is the same except it has a half-closed bathroom instead of all open one, and NO, you don't get to have better restaurants. All you have is a designated section in each restaurant for the VIP which looks the same and has the same service, so don't pay more, its' not worth it!

<Content>Great Vacation-Hotel wasn't the best though My boyfriend and I stayed from May 24-30th. Checkin/Rooms: We arrived at about 2:30ish and our checkin was very quick. I believe Ramon drove us to our room, he was nice. We were green wrist band people. The room wasn't what I expected. We as well heard it was at 50% capacity so we thought even with our green braclets that we'd atleast have a good view. We were on 2nd floor facing a black mesh fenced area and there was mosquitos splatted all over the walls and papers and bloody. I expected it almost b/c we read reviews but it wasn't acceptable to me... Maybe if we were on 4th floor we could see a little ocean but it wasn't good. My boyfriend went to the lobby to try and work something out. We ended up paying a little more for a new room. We were transfered to 1450 (on the 4th floor). This room was fantastic, no bugs on the walls and the view was great. We saw the whole pool area and the ocean. We did bring bug spray and used it basically the whole time. Mosquitos love me and i still walked away with about 10-15 bites, but didn't realize or notice them. Food: I thought the food was Okay. Nothing spectacular. The breakfast buffet was alright. I don't like eggs so the omlets weren't an option for me. The pancakes and french toast was ALWAYS cold no matter if i got there 10mins after they opened or later. I always found something though. The beach lunch buffet wasn't too bad. I liked the pizza and pasta and chicken was great. And the french fries are really good. We tried almost all the a la cartes. The italian was so-so it was so hot in there that day that we were basically eating in the dark and it was hard to see. The asian we waited for the hibachi and in my opinion the serving size was a lot smaller. They sat 12 people at a table that probably should have only held 8 at the most and served the same portions as you would for smaller groups. The shore grill was also mediocre. I would say 3 out of 5 on food overall. I did have the chance to eat on the beach for a romantic dinner that the hotel put together and we had a server and champagne. My now fiance proposed to me on the beach one of the nights and we had a nice dinner with hardly anyone on the beach. That was a nice touch which ofcourse does cost extra but I enjoyed my steak it was actually fantastic. He had lobster and said not very good. Room service was great to have on hand. You could call anytime to eat something (sometimes i ate later at night with room service b/c i didnt' enjoy dinner) and my fiance ordered cervezas to the room numerous times. We just tipped a couple bucks and they brought it. They were so nice and this was a great touch. Pools: The pool was nice and always enough chairs anywhere. The water areobics were entertaining every day. Bars: We always got drinks in a timely manner and they were pretty good. We'd go to sports bar at odd times for drinks and it was a little smelly in there but great service. We did some excursions- Bavaro splash boat and snorkel, the zipline, and dune buggy and we enjoyed them all. Would def. recommend. Overall we had a great time and didn't let little things bother us. but i will say.. DON'T LOSE YOUR WRIST BAND. They will charge you $20 for a new one. They said that we could have given it to someone else outside the resort to use. My fiance lost his and they gave him such a hard time he had to buy a new one! He was not happy after we already spent money to upgrade rooms and what not.

<Content>5 STAR RESORT? NO WAY Went w/2 other couples from 5/24-5/31. We're not stupid, we read all the prior reviews. We are also very seasoned travelers to AI's in the Caribbean. Check In: Christina at the front desk was very rude and either did not speak ANY English or pretended not too. I gave her our Hotel confirmation and she said we must not be booked at that hotel as she couldn't find EdenH on our confrirmation docs. I pointed out where it was written and again she said they brought us to the wrong hotel. Finally got that straightened out and she rudely told us that if we lose our bracelet, we would owe the hotel $20 bucks! Funny how she got that out ok in English. No welcome drinks when we got there and no one even opened the door for us! We found that all week, which we have never had happen before. I will say that Lorenzo, who walked us to our room was great as he pointed out everything along the way. He also told us that the resort was about 50% full for the week.Lobby: Kind of ho-hum. No music to speak of except some sort of Feng-Shui stuff which doesn't go at all at this type of resort. Just off the Lobby was a courtyard which could have been used for entertainment but it was like an afterthought and all anyone used it for was as a meeting place prior to dinner as all the restaurants surrounded it. No candles or music--except, again, that haunting Feng Shui stuff. It really was bazaar to sit there and listen to that type of music in the Caribbean! Room: Weird set-up but we stayed at the Majestic a few years ago and it was set up the same way so we expected the open bathroom policy. But why they have a beautiful mahogany door on any otherwise open bathroom is beyond me. AC worked ok--could have been cooler but not bad. Maid Service was excellent! And everyone in our party with the exception of one couple said the maid service was good. The one couple ended up not having their room made up 2xs and the room flooded one time from emptying the jacuzzi (they had previously complained that their room smelled of terrible mold). When they asked to change rooms, the report was that the hotel was totally full. They finally got moved the next day, after spending half the day hiking back and forth to the frront desk to get an answer. Beds were very comfortable and very clean! Beach and Pools: Beach was wonderful and kept as clean as possilbe from the seaweed. It was a windy week so we did see a lot of seaweed but they worked hard at getting it picked up. Pools- we counted a total of 5 but we could only use 3 of them because we had the lowly green bracelets. However, the 2 'Paradise Club' pools had very few people in them! What a waste! The only complaint about the pools is that I feel that the swim up bar pool should have been connected to the other section of pool right next to it so if you wanted a drink, you could just float down to the pool bar instead of having to get out of the pool and walk around to it. Also, I have never seen green pool water before! Also, one day 4 of us are just walking around the pool and we see a cocktail table in the pool. Well, of course we thought maybe some guest that had a few too many threw it into the pool. That is, until we discovered why it was there! It was to cover up an open pool drain that was about 2ft by 2ft wide and about 3 ft deep! Now, all we can think of is the danger of someone falling into it and then we discover a huge rusty bolt sticking about 3inches above the perimeter of the hole! Talk about the liability! So we call a pool guy down and of course he say, Yeah, Yeah, OK,, OK, I take care. 20 mins later, we call another one over and he says the same thing! Now, keep in mind that this open drain is right between the 2 basketball nets and there are little kids trying to play! So, we are there keeping guard so no one gets hurt. Another 20mins go by and we yell for another pool guy to come over and he looks at the hole and just laughs!! That's when I get pissed and see another guy walking by and I yell at him, Do you speak English  he said he did. I told him that they have a big problem and explained what was going on and he acted like he couldn't believe it! So, finally about 1-1/2 hrs after we report the problem, a guy with scubba mask comes and fixes it and the drain next to it that had a loose cover and another bolt sticking up. Food: Where oh where do I begin?? I have never in my life and all my years of traveling seen such inconsistency in the preparing/offering of food!!! We attempted to eat at all of the a-la-carte restaurants and were disappointed every time. We had no idea half the time what they were serving us! Finally by the 4th night we gave up with the a-la-cartes and tried the buffet which actually had the best food and best service!! Breakfast was good but a little boring as was the lunch buffet at the beach restaurant. Hey, the fries were good and I don't usually eat them! Again, even the a-la carte restaurants had no ambiance--no candles or soft music. The so called 'romantic' restaurant actually had a glaring spotlight just above our table. The Shore Grille was so bright that we thought they had some sort of fake sun piped in. One of the men in our group ordered clam 'showder' (that's the way it's spelled on the menu)and it was actually chicken broth with an empty clam shell in it! We laughed a lot about that one and got a picture of him with the stupid shell hanging out of his mouth!! Pumpkin Soup??? Don't order it. That is one of the things I always get in the Caribbean. I have no idea what they make theirs out of but it sure wasn't pumpkins! The Italian restaurant was just pathetic. I am sorry but there are big problems here and I am just not going to sugar-coat it. The buffet food is not all labeled so you have no idea what half of it is. I have never heard so many people complain and moan as I did this past week. And I could tell it wasn't just the people that can never be pleased. One family were there for 2 weeks and every one of them were sick and stuck in their room for almost the entire time! One of our party got sick and I know it wasn't from drinking because she drinks very little! The Fri night beach party was nice--they really tried hard and the food was ok--not great but okay. By the way, why would you have to pay extra for lobster  qualitybooze?? First AI that I have ever seen that at! Also, I can understand if one wants to upgrade to a nice big ocean-view suite but for one to have to pay for better drinks??? Everyone on the property, regardless of what kind of room you paid for, should get the same quality of food and drink!! That concept is one that should be disposed of and quickly if this resort is going to be succesful! Also, no snacks on the bars to be found (popcorn, barsnacks like peanuts etc)Entertainment: The theater is one big joke! It is just one big room with chairs in it. Again, no decor or ambiance--it looks kind of like where one would go for a business conference. The entertainment itself was not great and a lot of the karaoke was in Spanish so we had no idea what was being sung! Again, I say, put a nice little band in the courtyard where people are having their pre-post dinner drinks and let them dance under the stars! That is what people come to the caribbean for! Not to sit in a conference room! The sports bar was musty smelling to the point that we wouldn't even go in it! The casino is just that--can't complain if one wants to gamble. It was small but did the trick for those who wanted to try their hand! The Tahntra Bar was a joke. Loud unknown type of music and these wierd couches all around. Looked like something out of a 70's James Bond movie! The swimming pool up there didn't seem to attract many takers. Maybe it should be open during the day or bite the bullet and make it a disco--that's kind of what it looked like. But play some decent Music for God's sake! Service: As I stated, checkin was not friendly. Most of the other service was inconsistent. Except two bartenders: Ramon at the swim up pool bar. He was just the sweetest most genuine man we have ever met. He truly knows how to make people feel like he wants us there enjoying ourselves! Did not expect tips to give a wonderful level of service. They should promote him into management because the management they currently have certainly is not doing their job! Wilkins at the beach bar was also quietly doing what he gets paid to do  always with a smile! Housekeeping was good. We did notice that there seemed to be the same litter around the pool area that we saw when we first came in. 2 deflated floats  some disposed fruit rinds were left sitting around for the entire week. Pools were clean. Final Note: I truly feel that these problems are all a result of poor management and poor training. I realize some of the staff came from other resorts and need little to no training. However, the remaining staff just hasn't gotten the direction it needs to get the job done properly. I felt very sad to see what this resort could be and what it actually was. 2 other couples came with my husband and I on my recommendation and I was really embarrassed to say the least! This is the worst review I have ever written in my 17yrs of traveling to the caribbean and I wish I didn't have to write it but that is what this site is for. Unless something drastically changes here, there is no way we would go back or recommend this resort to any of our extensive family or friends.

<Content>A Perfect Vacation We travelled to the Edenh from May 18-25. Our package was with Transat Holidays. We flew Club class Air Transat out of Toronto and the upgrade was worth every penny! The biggest plus was never having to wait in line to check in, both in Toronto and Punta Cana we checked in instantly ahead of the near 200 other people in line, plus the club class bags get off-loaded first so no waiting there either. The resort was a short 15 minute ride from the airport. We had booked Mirage Concierge through Transat which had its definite VIP perks. We had a private check in which took 5 minutes no lines. Our luggage was held and we changed to our swimwear then headed for the bar. The main pool bar was very busy and waited a long time for a drink, but once we dicovered the private VIP Paradise Club bar we never went anywhere else for our drinks. Bar service from Ramone was amazing to say the least. The private pool was never crowded and he often brought our drinks right out to us on the loungers. Our room was perfect, no complaints and anything we requested they accomodated us. Yes there were a few mosquitos every day but this is quite common at all resorts and it took 5 minutes to rid the room each evening before settling in for the night, no big deal never got bit once! Paradise club guests have the added benefit of a seperate area at the main buffet that serves an ala carte breakfast in the morning which we really liked. Service at all of the restaurants was good. Mirage concierge guests received an in room lobster dinner for 2 as part of the package. We had this on our anniversary and it was awesome, the server took almost 10 minutes just setting the table, then they brought in our food and it seemed like it would never stop comming, they even baked us an anniversary cake for our special evening. We enjoyed visiting the vendors down the beach, just a note though, if you go to the right of the resort the vendors are about a 15 minute walk along the beach past the other resorts and we found them VERY pushy, in the end all I got was a sunburn, however if you go to the left of the resort it is only about a 2 minute walk and they were quite friendly, we bought all of our gifts there. The onsite gift shop was also reasonably priced if you want to save yourself the hassle of bartering. Free internet in the VIP lounge was a plus. The food every night was top notch and we enjoyed alot of different dishes. The only downer was the night of the beach party, we did not enjoy the food cooked down on the beach but alot of people did so maybe it was just us. I had expected a wider selection of fresh fruit at the buffet that was limited unfortunately. The weather and the beach were to die for that week and we swam in the ocean everyday, it was actually warmer than the pool. We totally enjoyed the Edenh and Punta Cana, although we normally travel to Riviera Maya we are planning to return to Punta Cana next with our children, on that note we did not feel that this resort offered the same level of childrens programming that we experienced at Dreams and because of that we would not take our kids here but I would definately return again as a couple.

<Content>Best place I have ever been! Where do I start....My husband and I went to Edenh for our honeymoon from April 14-21 2008. This resort is beautiful! We had such a wonderful time. Yes of course after reading all the reviews we were extremely nervous about our trip, but decided to make the best of it. Upon arrival to the hotel we were greeted with refreshing cold towels and drinks while we checked in. We did not upgrade either. A bellman took us to our room and gave us a tour of the resort along the way. Within 10 minutes another worker brought us towels for the pool and extra drinks for our fridge. Somethings helpful to bring mosquito coils(we didn't have to use them but another couple we met did on the opposite side of floor) and caladryl clear. All the waitstaff was so friendly. The Senses restaurant was so romantic and for adults only. I would highly recommend the Outback Excursion to tour the typical Domincan houses and boogey board in the Atlantic Ocean. There is always something to do, great shows at night. There is a beach party on Thursdays were dinner is served on the beach. The decoration and time spent working on this event is amazing, we watched as the prepared all day (from under the hut on the beach!!) The catamarans are awesome! I could not have asked for a more perfect honeymoon, we will definetly be returning to Edenh soon!

<Content>Little Peace of Heaven This was a girlz trip with a few moms鈥?needing to exhale a little bit. This hotel was absolutely beautiful. The beach exquisite and the ocean felt like bath water so healing. It took all my stress away. The outside food could have been better. There are 4 restaurants, the best being Senses. It has a very romantic ambiance. The food prep made me feel like I was at a 5 star. Now the swim-up-bar drinks were basically watered down. If you鈥檝e been to any all-inclusive restaurants before, you know they all are. However you will pay between $6 and $10 a shot for the better alcoholic beverages, i.e.: Grey Goose. If you want a snack bring them with you. The gift shop has a few items however they are marked up 4 times the cost of what you would buy them in the US. i.e... A $2.00 bag of Doritos cost 250 pesos. Now divide 250 pesos by 30 pesos which is $1 鈥?you end up paying $8.33 for a $2.00 bag. So lesson learned, bring anything you can imagine yourself needing and you won鈥檛 feel bad when you laugh in the women鈥檚 face and leave the Doritos on the counter :o) There are not too many US citizens at this resort, more Europeans, Central Americans, and South Americans. That was ok because I got the chance to practice up on my Spanish I learned 15 years ago and never had a chance to use. We were greeted with people in costumes performing. We had to wait until 3 before we got our room so I would suggest either coming later in the afternoon or bring your swimsuit in your carry-on so you can go into the bathroom and change and head straight to the beach and being your vacation. For those with children, I felt this resort was more for adults in need of a nice romantic get-a-way. Enjoy!

<Content>My Edenh Review!!! Stayed there from april 20 to 27. Weather was great, we had rain on 2 occasions and it was around 3:00 pm, so we enjoyed the beach all day. This was our second trip to Punta Cana for 3 couples and the first one for the other couple. Despite all the mixted reviews, we were heading there with optimism, ready to relax, have fun, and most importantly enjoy the beautiful beach and all it has to offer. Check in: We arrived around 9:00 in the evening and went directly to the VIP check in because we had booked Le Mirage Deluxe rooms (yellow bracelets). I had sent a e-mail to PC Mike the week before our arrival and requested pool views and our 4 rooms close to one another. We were greated with a smile and warm 鈥樷€檞elcome home鈥欌€?statement from a few employees! Within 10 minutes, we all had the chance to taste their welcome drink, have our bracelets put on, and were given 4 rooms in the same building: 1336 (our room), 1338, 1436 and 1440鈥?. We were so excited, exactly what we hoped for. Then, we were accompanied by a nice guy who took our luggage, and gave us a tour of the resort. Then, they took us to our rooms and everything was perfect, we had the best view of the pools, the entire resort and a partial (great) view of the ocean鈥?.WOW! This started our vacation on the right foot!!Beach: Simply beautiful, with powdery sand and turquoise water. It is true what some people mentionned that there is a lot of trafic on this stretch of beach鈥? Boats with loud music, catamaran, parasailing, but we enjoyed the view! It was different from the location of the resort we stayed at last year (Majestic) where it was more relaxing and calm. Now for the beach chair situation, all I can say is that we never had a problem to find 8 chairs under 2 palapas every morning we were there. There was always someone in our group that was on the beach (same spot everyday) around 6 鈥?6:30 to reserve our chairs and that stayed there until the rest of the group came back from breakfast. We never left our spot during these early hours, because we knew that the security could take our towels. As we are early risers, this didn鈥檛 bother us at all. We were there to enjoy the beach as much as we could, not to sleep late in the morning. During the day, they always cook on the beach: BBQ, so it smelled good all day鈥?br/>There was a woman that served fresh tropical fruits on a stick during the day too, this was a really nice touch!!Bars: We tried a lot of drinks during our stay and went a lot to the beach bar 鈥?the one that is part of the beach restaurant. It was only a few step from the beach. Jose, one of the bartenders, always greeted us with a smile and we received great service... We liked the dirty monkey, bananamama, Miami Vice, drink of the day, mimosa, rhum and coke, strawberry daikiri, Presidente. There is something for every taste. The lobby bar was a nice place to hang out and meet new friends. Food: In the morning we ate great omelets made by Felix- what a sweet guy鈥?he remembered our names by the 2nd day!! There was only bacon every 2 days, so my aunt was sad about that. They made fresh smoothies, had a great selection of breads and juices. I think they could have a bit more selection in the morning for those who like to eat different things, but for me, they had all I wanted!! Service was great, smiling servers, they cleaned tables quickly. Didn鈥檛 eat at the buffet for supper except for the evening that they cancelled the beach party. It was OK, but I鈥檓 not the buffet type, I prefer eating at the ala carte restaurants. We ate at the beach restaurant for lunch everyday and enjoyed the chicken (very tasty), pizza, nachos, fries, hotdog. They also served baked potatoes, pasta, salad bar, hamburgers鈥? Then there was the soft ice cream machine鈥ummy!! We could eat almost anytime of the day, on the beach, by the pool so this is really nice 鈥?not so much if you don鈥檛 want to gain weight!! We ate at the ala carte restaurants 5 times and tried them all. Our best meal was certainly at the Japanese restaurant- Hibachi. Our chef was so funny and entertaining. Someone from our group went there at 6:00 and made a reservation for the 7:30 seating. Another couple joined us, so we were a group of 10鈥?We had a blast that evening. At the other restaurants, the food was good, not excellent . I thought their soups were too salty. We went to the American grill 2 times and the steak was good. The place that we liked the least was the Italian because the service was slow and some of us didn鈥檛 like their meal. They said that their menu changed the week we were there, so maybe that explains it. However the pasta with bologne sauce was very good and served hot. The waiters were always smiling, willing to accommodate everyone. I really think that when you are nice to them, they will give it back to you. We saw a lot of complainers over there, but we never had any incident or bad service. We only got a beeper once and it was our first supper at the Romantico. The hostess told us that we would have to wait an hour and it was exactly the time it took for us to be seated in there and enjoy our meal. On the other nights, we got in without waiting in line or waiting long periods of time. Can鈥檛 see what others are talking about?? And remember, we were always 8 or 10 people 鈥?Rooms: Like I said earlier, we were very pleased with the location of our rooms. Our room was very comfortable, the king bed was great, and so was the big jacuzzi tub!! When I went to sleep, I didn鈥檛 feel like I was far away from home, I felt secure and safe!! There was no humidity odor in our room, so that helps feeling at home. We sat on our balcony everyday and enjoyed the view of the beautiful resort, with it鈥檚 dominican music鈥? Yes, they have some good music playing all day!! Our fridge was filled everyday, except for the last 2 days that we didn鈥檛 get our 2 beers. We just asked a cleaning staff if we could have more and it was not a problem. The room was always cleaned before we got to our room to shower around 4-5 pm. The maid did a great job. And before I forget, we only saw a few musquitos on the first day (5-6), after that, never saw any more. No problem at all with insects. One day, I noticed that our bathroom sink was going to fall down because there was a gap between it and the vanity. I called the reception and they sent someone, within 15-20 minutes, everything was repaired and I was back by the pool. Great service!!Pools: Did not spend much time around the pool, because we prefer the beach and the ocean. There was always beach chairs available at any time in the morning. It got more crowded as the day passed. My friend and I did water aerobics twice at the pool with 鈥樷€檛he best entertainer Akon鈥欌€? he was sweet and had a great personality. My husband played waterpolo and had a lot of fun! Pools were clean and beautiful. Played dominican music around, so it was a great atmosphere over there.Entertainment: We only saw 2-3 shows because we were too tired at night. The 鈥樷€橮icante鈥欌€?show was held in the Theatre and was really professionnal, extraordinary costumes. The night we arrived (Sunday), there was the Kareoke in the lobby bar and the guests were really having a good time, the place was packed full!! Great time and party. We also went at the Tanhtra bar that evening and it was relaxing and confortable place. My husband had a quick drip in the pool and said it was refreshing after a long day鈥︹€?My only dissapointment was that the Beach Party was cancelled because of the rain on Tuesday night. The staff started to set the tables on the beach early in the morning and worked really hard, and were stopped by heavy rain late afternoon鈥? It would have been so nice to experience this kind of evening. Can鈥檛 blame the resort for that鈥?br/>There were a few things that I did not like as much, but they didn鈥檛 ruin my vacation at all. I prefer open air lobby, so it would have been nice to have the same decor but without the windows. There was always incence burning in the lobby and it reminded me of funeral services. This is getting long, so I鈥檒l finish by saying that our group of 8 had a fantastic time at this brand new resort. For a place that just started their operation 4 months ago, it is really worth going to. Nobody got sick, everyone ate well, the rooms and the entire place were spotless, the staff is polite, always had a smile and were very accomodating, and the beach is breathless. If you go with an open mind and enjoy what they have to offer, without looking for everything that isn鈥檛 right, you鈥檒l have a great time! I think that a perfect resort doesn鈥檛 exist, so take the good and leave the bad behind. You鈥檙e on vacation after all.I don鈥檛 think we would return to Edenh for the only reason that we prefer to try new places on our future trips. But, I would not hesitate to strongly recommand it to friends and family that are planning a vacation in Punta Cana. Have a nice trip!!NBacadians

<Content>Not that bad... I stayed at EdenH from May 18-22 with my boyfriend and 4 others. Overall, we had a great time and for the value it was perfect. Pros: beautiful beach, a lot of pools, swim up bar is great, friendly staff, we would get to the beach around 11AM and there were always plenty of chairs (same with the pool), the pizza by the beach/ pool is good, housekeeping is great.Cons: several people in my group (including me) got sick from either the food and/or the water; there were a lot of mosquitos in the room and I did get bit a lot, but it didn't bother me too much; the food is just okay (Shore Grill is the best); the alcohol is pretty bad (very watered down, so I ended up drinking mostly beer, which was good; there isn't much to do at night, because the entertainment is just okay.If you can get a good deal, I would definitely suggest you go to EdenH, or else wait a year or two so it has time to improve.

<Content>Very disappointing. My husband  I stayed at the Eden from May 3-May 10, 2008. The good-The resort was beautiful  clean. The spa services were great (especially the Midnight Massage). There were a few staff members that were super (Felix, Carlos and our Apple rep Sigfredo) but that's about it all I can say for the good. Now for the bad. The food was terrible! There are 5 restaurants to eat at (1 is a buffet). The only one we ate at was the Italian (if you want to call it that) restaurant. No self respecting Italian would consider anything that was served in that restaurant Italian cuisine. There was a beach party two of the nights we were there so the buffet and 2 of the restaurants were closed leaving you no choice but to eat at the beach party. There were lots of foods to choose from but everything was cold and not worth waiting in any kind of line for. Here's the best part. The resort is all-inclusive except when it comes to lobster. If you wanted lobster you had to pay $30 USD plus tax. What's the point of all-inclusive if you have to pay extra especially for food. The room service menu was a joke. One of the selections was raw fish marinated in coconut milk. I don't know about you but I have never craved anything like that for a midnight snack. Other than the room service menu there is no where to get anything to eat after 10:00 p.m. So, if you don't eat before the restaurants close you are out of luck. We called room service and the maid service one night for some bottled water because they hadn't filled our fridge with any that day. We called three times and never got the water. Our room's air conditioning worked now and then. It made the room so hot and musty it was barely tolerable. Our toilet made some awful noise every time we flushed and it sounded as though we were about to experience an air raid. I'm not sure if we were the only ones who heard the toilet but nonetheless it was loud and lasted 23 seconds (I recorded the sound with my phone to show my friends  family at home because I knew they wouldn't believe me). On one of the days my husband and I were not feeling well so we stopped by the little store to pick up some Pepto-Bismol. For two individual packets it was $14 USD. I know there are mark ups but that's a little ridiculous. Well, that's our week's vacation and I could go on and on but I think you get the point. I would never return to this hotel.

<Content>Wanted to love Edenh more than we did. Check in was a breeze, we got a great room on the top floor, we booked as Paradise Club so had the pink bands and VIP pools.The AC ran constantly but it seemed the room never got cool, otherwise room was okay, view was awesome.No room service menu which would have been nice, you had to call and the extent of the menu told to us was Club sandwhich, hamburger, things like that. We ordered room service for lunch one afternoon, club sandwhich and fruit, it was decent.The food for the most part I found to be not good, nothing on the buffet was hot enough it was lukewarm if you were lucky, and things are poorly labeled. Breakfast was the best meal of the day, omelets and fresh breads and pastries were great. Lunch we ate at the poolside restaurant every day, again lucky if things were not cold, the chicken there was awesome. The American style restaurant was our favorite, the beef tenderloin and flank steak there were amazing, though the corn served as a side was rock hard and not edible. The other restaurants were okay but I found they made substitutions without telling you before hand as we learned when the served us squid ink risotto as a side to my husbands pork dish at the Italian. Not what was listed on the menu. I guess we had a communication barrier, but it was a joke between us that we got whatever they brought us. The beach party on Friday night was the same situation with cold food, nothing was good. Don't be expecting a lot of seafood either, if you want lobster it's an additional $29.99 per person. I was disappointed with the whole dining aspect. Not exactly all inclusive with the extra charges for certain drinks and food items.Restaurants are set back towards the road, and it seemed the AC there wasn't working very well either, very hot and humid most nights, wish they had better ventilation or fans or something.The beach is amazing sugary white sand, we had no problems getting chairs at the beach or pool. We loved it. Went parasailing with the guys at the towel house and that was fun. There is some seaweed in the water and on the beach at times but they clean it regularly, and hey, it's the ocean.Really enjoyed the karaoke and dancing in the lobby bar. Saw half of the Pikante show, colorful costumes, it was entertaining. Didn't spend much time in the Casino but others did and seemed to enjoy it. Service was good for the most part, everyone very friendly and helpful and the maids would greet us with a smile and an hola if we ran into them in the hallways. Bartenders at the PC pool were fun. Be sure to ask for premium liquor even if you have the pink band, you'll get the house stuff if you don't. In summary I would say we had a good time, wish the food was better, probably won't return anytime soon.

<Content>Positives far outweigh the naysayers Booked the Edenh early in December for May 15-22 for a great price and gambled on if the hotel would be ready by its January opening. No worries at all. Any shortcomings have been cleared up regarding chairs, restaurant seating etc...It is a new resort, and does have some growing pains associated with it, but nothing that detracts enough to make your stay unenjoyable. If you've done some travelling, you're probably aware that there is a difference between staying at a resort in the Carribean and staying at a spa in Switzerland. The Hotel:Very new, and very clean. We had the standard room, (jacuzzi tub inside, one king bed, balcony and mini-bar). Great room, lots of space, but may take a bit of getting used to in its open concept. From the bed, you can see right into the washroom area, (separated by a 2 person jacuzzi tub), the sink area is exposed, but the toilet and shower stall are both behind frosted glass. We did get to tour one of the president's club rooms and it is basically two of the standard rooms,( bed, second room, two bathrooms), with a 5-6 person jacuzzi on a larger deck.It only takes a day or two to figure out the hotel layout. The main lobby exits to a central courtyard surrounded by the main inside bars and all 4 a-la-carte restos. The outside courtyard contains 3 large all access pools,(plus 1 kids pool) as well as the main pool/beach bar (one side is a swim up), and a generic resto that serves up regular fare from 12pm on. There are two pools and bars at each end of the resort for presidents' club members only. These were seldom used throughout the week, but I guess if you feel you need the exclutivity, you should find plenty of empty chairs.The buffet was hit and miss. I could always find something edible, but for the most part, unless you were in line for the grill, the food may not be very hot. You must be aware that anything based with a cheese or cream sauce will taste very different from what we're used to in North America,(not to my liking, but others raved about it). Breakfast at the buffet requires meeting Felix for a fresh omelet, (introduce yourself once, and it would be rare for him to not remember your name for the duration of your stay).The A-la-Carte restos were good for the most part. The Asian grill is well worth the hibachi experience. Senses had a funky menu that was quite tasty. The American Steaksurf ran out of steak the night we ate there,(the ribs were decent, but the corn wasn't fit for cattle). A lot of people liked the italian resto. I wasn't one of them (due to poor service and that cream sauce thing I mentioned). The 4 restos all require reservations. It can take a while at peak times, especially because pink bracelet wearers take precedence over regular guests and get seated at the next available table. I heard a lot of people complaining and being downright rude about this system. The meal is still free, you didn't pay for the upgrade, and the buffet is still available if the need for edible life support right away is the difference between being civil towards the staff and being an arrogant jerk.The beach is fantastic, the drinks decent and plentiful, and the staff very friendly. Tipping goes a long way, Alexis at the swim up bar makes the best donkey bray I've ever heard....I'm cutting this short cause I've rambled to the point of tiredness. If you want the straight dope on the rest of the resort or have questions, I'll answer you honestly. My wife and I had a great time, and would go back in a heartbeat.

<Content>Great Property - Lousy Service - Mosquitoes! Great property...brand new...But this resort needs to work out its service issues. Booked them through cheaptickets.com and when I got there they didn't have any record of my reservations. Waited patiently for a half hour with no resolution until my infant son's crying and wet diapers needing to be change made us lose it. After the whole lobby heard our baby cry non-stop, the manager, Ivan Santana finally called us and upgraded us to their best suite, which was amazing. However, the service was horrible. Had requested a crib on arrival, but it didnt show up till 2 days later and after constant complaining. Mosquitoes were rampant and had to constantly request getting the place fumigated. Living room TV didnt work and had to get that fixed. Food in the restaurants was good but service there was slow and not good. Beaches and pools were great...So in summary, great property a but pretty constant lack of service, coupled with the mosquitoes that are prevelant there, will almost surely ensure that we wont be going back there again.

<Content>Excellent romantic getaway We stayed May 8-11 on a package deal. We had had an extremely hard year and really needed a getaway. It was great. I do agree that they could have told us more about the amenities offered since they told us nothing. I still don't know what others are talking about with Pikante? Anyway, we had a 4th floor room facing the pools with a wonderful view of the beach. We never saw one mosquito and we had come prepared with spray. There was a constant breeze and we loved the room set up. I guess if you are traveling with someone you don't know well the open bathroom is odd but we actually like each other and loved it. The food was pretty good, what I expected for a third worlld all inclusive. We only ate at the a la carte restaurants in the evening and at around 7 - 8pm and never had a problem. We were misinformed as to which would be open and when by the hostess but no problem. The beach was lovely and there was always an umbrella and a couple of lounge chairs and we usually got there around 10-11am. We were harrassed by vendors when we walked off the property but never on grounds of the hotel. I was able to read sleep and swim at my leisure. The house wine is dreadful but the wines on the wine list at dinner are reasonable and the wine expert nice and knowledgable. I have to say we loved it and we never even left the resort. The only thing annoying was the couple on the bus back to the airport and our plane who were apparently on their honeymoon and had been sick the whole trip. They spared no one the full story of their problems. Even though this is booked as a 5star resort you must always remember that this is a country not known for it's drinkable water (they even tell you this) and not take foolish chances. I hope their marriage survives this, they were completely insufferable to all in ear shot.

We are both Young singles who are vegetarians! I want to say that this was the best trip i have been on ever! I have travelled all over the world but i have never experienced fun, relaxation and friendliness anywhere else the way i have at this resort!I had read a lot of reviews about people saying that this place is not good for young singles, or for girlfriend getaways etc etc... I just want to say that they were wrong and that this place is fantastic!! I have met so many people around my age group there and we went on an off season!The food was fantastic...even though we were vegetarians, we still had a great selection on food!! The only place we could not eat was at the american restaurant!we had the conceirge package, so we were able to swim in the vip pool! I know everyone has written about carlos! BUT SERIOUSLY he is the funniest and most sweetest and enertaining bar tender i have ever seen!! I know that a lot of people have said say hello to (name).. BUT PLEASE CAN SOMEONE TELL CARLOS the shorter darker one at the vip pool that NISHA from canada says HOLA??!! WE DID NOT HAVE ONE SINGLE PROBLEM WITH BEACH CHAIRS! there are PLENTY PLENTY of beach chairs everwhere!!the entertainment was fantastic!! the show PICANTE was amazing!! The entertianment crew are a lot of fun and they will make sure the nights are fun for you! the only one thing that i did not like was there was no DISCO meaning no club or place that you could dance!! They had music at the lobby bar, but that was only until 12 and then we had to get out and go to the sports or tantra bar! There is a great disco (club) off the resort called MANGUE!! The buffets are soo good, they have two buffets in the afternoon one at the main buffet place and one at the beach!! The best drink was a sammy sosa!! yum!!!!!! This resort was the best vacation i have ever taken!! I want to go back, i think 10 days would have been better than 7 days!!Please say HOLA to carlos for me!

<Content>Fantastic place - heaven My wife and I just got back (May 4 - May 10). Great place! Maybe not a 5 star, but I would give it a strong 4. Read all the negative things and found none of them to be true. Couple small glitches here and there - Too be expected with so many guests. But, like everything else on this planet - if you treat the situation and people with respect, all will be resolved. We've traveled all over the world and trust us, we know good from bad.The food was absolutely wonderful - Every meal was a feast - And I'm picky about what I consider good.. Breakfast is out of this world, and yes, Mr Felix does make a great omelet. My hat is off to the exec chef - We asked for a receipe and by that evening he had it delivered to our room. Nice guy. Drinks are so-so. You can tip the bar tendors and they will treat you right. The staff there really goes out of their way to make your stay wonderful.I thought all the guests were very pleasent. Many Canadians, South Americans, some Russians and Americans. Good mix. Some complained about too much noise and activity at the beach. Hey, next time try Gilligans Island....... And for those that thought there wasn;t enough to do..... How about Bagdad? Overall, a very positive experience. Be aware that there is not much to do off the resport. Very impoverished area. Don;t book your tours and water activities thru the hotel. Go out on the beach and you'll find other vendors that will charge much less. Also there are plenty of free water sports that the facility provides.I recommend you go. Just take sun screen and a big smile.

<Content>Would go back in a heartbeat My husband and I spent our honeymoon at Edenh from May 1-8. We had the time of our lives. Like everyone else we were quite concerned after reading some of the reviews but I can honestly say there is nothing to worry about. I will give you a break down of some of the more important things that I was worried about prior to leaving on our vacation.Check in: We arrived at 2:30 pm. We were told that we had to wait 30 minutes for our room to be ready so we went to get a bite to eat at the buffet. When we came back at a little after 3pm everything was in order, the bell boy showed us to our room. Very easy, no problems.Our room: We were in building 2 on the fourth floor facing the pool. AWESOME view!! The room was very clean, towels and face clothes were replenished daily. The mini bar wasn't always restocked but as long as we had bottled water to brush our teeth that's all that mattered to us, we know where the bar is for everything else.Food: The buffet was typical of any resort I've been to in the Dominican. There is a pasta bar which was nice but don't expect to eat at the buffet like you would at home...the food is different. We ordered room service every morning for breakfast and it was great. It took about 20 minutes to arrive to your room, it was warm and they give you more food than anyone could imagine eating. At night we would go to an a la carte by 6pm and we were able to walk right in, no waiting. We tried the Shore Grill twice, we really liked the chicken burritos. We ate at the Asian twice, the Hibachi was awesome. We tried the Italian once, the pasta and veal was pretty good. Again, don't go there expecting the food to be like the food you would get at a restaurant in your home town, your in the Dominican and they are not known for their superb cuisine.Beach, Pool and Bars: The beach is gorgeous, lots of seaweed but that didn't bother me much. You can walk in the water without having to wear shoes, the bottom is soft sand. The pool with the swim up bar was our favorite spot. Alexis is the bartender and he will keep you very well entertained. The Tantra bar is a tonne of fun, the music is lacking but with the right company you won't even notice it. The Sports and Lobby bar served some really nice drinks, try a dirty monkey...yummm!If your planning on going to Edenh don't worry, unless your a super picky person with unreal expectations you will have a great time!!

<Content>loved EdenH edited review- Just returned on May 4th, we were there from April27th to May4th. This is about our 10th trip to Punta Cana. YES, we were very concerned about the previous reviews, Big Time. Yeah we got a good deal, so we went for the Paradise Club and hopefully in six months we can get the same deal - we will go back!Beach chairs - not any problems - they must have received the shipment.Just a note - we are not in our younger years (we both work full time, every day) and have a different agenda than a younger traveller (we used to be one). But just so you know, on our trip into the hotel we were with a young honeymoon couple that just loved it and had a great time!Problems with ala carte restaurant? - none- however we do not eat at 5:30 or 6:30, even at home we usually eat at 7:30 or 8:00, in fact I just cleaned up from our diner and it:s 9:35. Ala carte restaurants were perfect for us; first we didn't go until 8:30 or 9:00 and waited, at the most 15 or 20 minutes. No you are not in a smoke infested restaurant. I smoke, my husband doesn't, never has and in the ala carte restaurants there is no smoking. In the buffet they have a section for those nasty people.ALL of the staff spoke more English than any of the other resorts we have been to and worked extremely hard. They were more than happy to acommadate you and were very friendly.We enjoyed the casino, it's only $5 at the black jack tables and they serve drinks. The poor serve has to go outside to another building to fill her orders, they should have a service bar in the casino. We played every night, in fact closed it some nights. In the end my husband won a couple of hundred and I lost $55 - horrors!Our room was in building 1 and our room was 1272, second floor, with view of ocean and in front of pool. We were very near the beach, which is near the restaurant on the beach. You can sit and have a drink and eat, enjoy the scenery or be at the beach and come and eat :something. I can truthfully say that the food there was just okay, not great and the same all the time, but, hey, the surroundings were awesome and serene.The buffet has a different theme every night and just so you know - you will not starve.We did have one mosquito in our room at check-in and I made that little sucker disappear real quick. After about our 3rd day a can of bug spray appeared in our room, maybe we got someone else's, so I did spray the balcony, as not to waste it.They have a beach party on Saturday nights and boy-o-boy do they try

<Content>Beautiful Beach, Poor Service We, two retired couples, stayed at the EdenH from April 12 鈥?26. We too had read all the reviews for months before we travelled and were very concerned, but since we had already been to three new 5-star properties (excellent, by the way) we were not overly concerned. Many of the positive reviews are accurate, but many of the negative reviews also have merit. We believe the reviews reflect the occupancy rate during the particular week the reviewer was there. If you are getting great service, you let a lot of negatives slip by. The resort management should have enough experience to know the types of start-up problems that occur, should have had sufficient staff hired and trained, and after four months everything should have been running like clock-work.We loved the layout and size of the resort, our rooms were spacious, lots of storage room, comfy beds and pillows, and a large safe. The maid service left a lot to be desired! The bed was made and the bathroom tidied up. Sometimes we got towels, other times not. Many times our wet towels were rehung on the shower door. The same sheets were on the bed for two weeks! Some days our room was still not made up at 4:30 when we returned from the beach.The beach is awesome! Workers continuously picked up empty bottles and drink cups since there were no waste cans anywhere. There was no option but to place garbage under your beach chair since even if you took it back to the beach buffet area, there was no place to put it. We tipped these workers every few days; they did their jobs so quietly and patiently. Seaweed was raked every morning and carted away.Staff in the buffet and a-la-cartes was friendly and outgoing. We didn鈥檛 have a lot of trouble getting into any restaurant, but even with long line-ups there were still empty tables inside because there simply was not enough staff to serve them. In our opinion, this resort has some really great staff that worked under very stressful conditions yet managed to keep a smile on their face. There were just not enough of them. Of particular note is Hostess Liby at the Shore Grill who took a lot of criticism about the lack of a reservation system from disgruntled guests who tried to bully their way in. She handled it with grace and poise and never let it get to her. We did have an instance at the Shore Grill when we requested a table for 6; after a lengthy wait we were given two tables, a booth for 4 and an adjoining table for 4 where two of us sat about 3 feet from the others. We were not permitted to move the table closer to the booth so we could talk. When a manager in a suit with the wine list came around, we kindly asked him if we could move the table against the booth since we were in an out of the way corner but he forbade us to move it since it was against company policy! Service in the buffet at breakfast was slow and the staff was overwhelmed at times. It was especially difficult to get coffee and some days you couldn鈥檛 even get a cup, let alone coffee to put in it. The pasta bar at lunch and dinner was excellent, as was the bread and cheese section. The rest of the food at the buffet was repetitive, not well identified, and mostly cold to barely warm. Table service in the evenings in the buffet was very good. Lunch menu at the beach buffet was excellent and included fresh salad, tasty fries, yummy grilled chicken and some of the best pizza ever! Service was sorely lacking at the beach bar and the upper end of the swim up bar facing the beach buffet. If you weren鈥檛 a man or a young girl in a bikini, forget about getting served; they would just skip over you, even if you tipped or were holding money in your hand. If someone asked for a cerveza, they would serve them first and then forget your order. Many times we had to hold our arm out to interrupt the bartender from passing us by again. It was clear that they were overwhelmed by the constant line-ups and were always running out of something -- rum, ice, water, straws, etc. The lobby bar鈥檚 only blender broke down and they were unable to make slushy drinks. They also kept running out of wine glasses and served wine in thin plastic cups. The chair war 鈥?oh, what can I say? There was no war among guests 鈥?the whole battle was with the guards! Some days by 6:15 am there wasn鈥檛 anything at the beach; you could still get a chair at the pool until shortly after 7, but there always seemed to be chairs at the VIP pools. Two of our group addressed this with the resort and we were told the resort had enough chairs for 2 people per room but that they were at full capacity with an average of 3 people per room. The resort was actually overbooked and large groups of people had been bumped to other resorts in the area and compensated with a free week or two depending on this year鈥檚 booking. Yet they still would not admit there was a problem with insufficient chairs and laid the blame solely on the shoulders of their guests. They 鈥渟eem鈥?to have a policy in place that you have to sit on your chair until 7 a.m. in order to reserve it, or if you are gone more than an hour the guards can remove your things. This 鈥減olicy鈥?changed daily according to the guards. Guards were being bribed to take things off chairs where people just arriving wanted to sit and that was that, even if the first group had just gone to breakfast. One guard wrote in the sand 鈥?5鈥?minutes, another one wrote 鈥?0鈥?to people complaining that someone had taken their things. We watched another guard take 4 towels at 5:15 in the morning and place them on a location saving them until 7:15 when one person showed up, slipped him money and left not returning until 10:45. This continued for 4 consecutive days even while they were stripping resort towels and all personal property off every other chair not occupied until 7 am. It got so bad that everyone was teaming up with their neighbours to keep an eye on their stuff so they could take a stroll, go to the bar and eat in shifts. After challenging a guard who tried to take his things, one gentleman became a target every morning by the guards and he felt he was being harassed by them. One day, after a particularly vicious sweep, one staff member was assigned to guard all confiscated property until a cart came, loaded it all up and took it to the lobby for safe-keeping. That鈥檚 where everyone had to go to retrieve their things. They also stopped some people from moving pool chairs to the beach while turning a blind eye while others did the same thing. That day there was almost a mutiny among the guests and the hotel received a lot of complaints about the chairs and the lack of service. There was a definite improvement in service the next day, and the guards were not quite as aggressive on the beach, but the same guard saved the same spot every morning for the same people. Based on our experiences, we would rate the EdenH at 3.5 Stars at best but it has the potential of becoming a very nice 5-star some day. Some areas of the resort have an unfinished look and the resort already needs a lot of maintenance to address what looks like substandard workmanship. After a particularly heavy rainfall, there were numerous leaks all over the resort including one in the main lobby where a pot light was hanging out of the ceiling. In building 2, of the three sets of elevators that we accessed the first two were out of order the entire two weeks; the second set had one out of commission most of the two weeks, and one elevator in the third set had its 1st floor button hanging out of its socket by its wire for most of our stay. Power outages became a daily occurrence, sometimes three or four an evening, including the evening we were departing. We were in the baggage storage area with our hands on our luggage when the power went out, again, this time for about 20 minutes or more. Many people were in the dark with a lighter flame trying to find their luggage to load on their bus.Although these aspects do not make or break your vacation, they do not contribute to the relaxing 5-star 鈥渟pa鈥?like experience advertised. Despite the frustrations we had a good vacation due to the many new friends we made and some of the really nice staff that we came to know.

<Content>Wonderful Time Pat and Joe May 14/2008 Stayed at hotel Edenh Real Arenas Punta Cuna from May 3/08 to May 10/08 along with another couple (green bracelets) Beautiful Resort had a wonderful time food was very good had no problems with reservations got right in every night at 6:00 no waiting and we tried every one enjoyed the buffet good selection of food we even ate Dinner there one night and totally enjoyed it the staff were very freindly some days seemed to be busier than others at the bars but there wasn't any time that we had to wait very long for drinks as there always seemed to be lots of bartenders working and they would wait on people in turn there were a few people who were very agressive towards the staff as they thought they should be looked after right away instead of waiting there turn to be served these type of people should have stayed home and got there personal maid or butler to look after them if they had one it is a vacation so lighten up people enjoy don't take it out on other people We went to the beach every day and had no problems finding chairs and a papappi some days it wasn't right up front but we still enjoyed it We found the Gift shop a little pricey (exspecially on beer and cigars) One afternoon they had a Rum and Cigar tasting presentation and demostration down by the beach which we partisipated in we found this very informative and the rum tasting was very good we bought some cigars there which were wonderful and mild they were recommended by the vendor and the price was reasonable they also did a cigar rolling presentation as i don't actually smoke anymore but i do enjoy a good cigar once in awhile any way we would reccomend this resort to anyone and we would return again and it will only get better as they work out all the little things we had a ground floor room and yes there were Mosquitos but we had come prepared after reading some of the reveiws and a couple of shots of raid before leaving the room in the evening fixed the problem and yes we have stayed at other 5 star resorts in Punta cana and have something to compare it to

<Content>I've had better.... My husband and I stayed at the Edenh from May 9-12, 2008. I booked this as a last minute trip to celebrate our anniversary/new baby/graduate school graduation, and it was recommended by our travel agent.The one great thing about this resort is its proximity to the airport. We have been to Mexico and Jamaica, and our bus rides to the resort have been up near 2 hours long. We didn't want this on this trip since we were only there for 3 nights, so being close to the airport was a real plus. We were the first stop off of the Apple bus, and were on the beach within 6 hours of leaving Ohio. Upon check in, the staff was in a rush to check us in, even though there was only one other person ahead of us. They threw a check in sheet at us to fill out with no comments/explainations. Not the greatest greeting I've ever had at an all inclusive resort, but we were still excited to be there, and didn't think much of it. We were also not offered the pink bracelet VIP upgrade, so not sure if we looked a certain way, maybe they thought they weren't going to make money off of us or something. The bellhop was extermely helpful though. Our room was not ready when we got there at noon, so he showed us a changing room in the front of the hotel where we could change and get ready to hit the beach while they held our bags. Very nice set up. The beach and pool were both very nice and clean. We had no problems getting chairs and umbrellas. Only complaint about the pool umbrellas are that they are very cheap and kept breaking and falling over. Could probably use new ones already, and they aren't very old. The outdoor buffet was just mediocre. The food variety did not change much daily, and the hamburgers and hot dogs had a strange consistency. I know its hard to cook for so many people with such diverse backgrounds, but still wasn't great. The sit down restaurant was very good (we went to the steakhouse and the Italian), however, the wait staff was terrible. We were seated right away, but our server did not come to greet us for at least 15 minutes and was very unfriendly. Once they took our order, the food came out fast, but we had a hard time getting silverware and refills on our water. I kept feeling like we were the red-headed step childen on the resort. Maybe it was the fact we did not speak Spanish, and we very obviously look like Midwesterners. Had the same problems at the bar, we would stand there and wait for a drink, and other guests would get served first even though we were waiting first. And they would never make eye contact or make conversation with us even thought we tried. Not really sure what that was about....Our room was very nice and large. We had a first floor facing out to the other resort, which was fine by me since all we did was sleep there. Only a few mosquitos to complain about, but nothing we couldn't keep under control. Minibar was stocked daily, and room was very clean. The front desk was also not very helpful in providing guest information on the activities on the resort. We would have liked to know when we checked in that there was a pig roast on the beach the first night. We walked to the buffet, only to be told the buffet was on the beach that night. And there were fireworks the one night we missed b/c we never knew they were happening. We also didn't know they were showing a movie in the courtyard, maybe more for the kids, but I would have a least been given the option. We didn't know there was a show at 9PM most nights (maybe all nights, I never found out the answer). We tried to go to guest services for an activities calendar, but they referred us to the Apple girl, who refered us to the front desk, who told us they didn't have them, and then we just gave up. One other annoying thing is the people on the beach trying to sell you stuff. I was in the water not even facing the beach and a girl was yelling hey over and over again at me to get me to buy pictures. Other boys walk up and down the beach trying to see if we like to party and wouldn't leave you alone. I was actually sleeping on a chair the one time, and a guy woke me up to take a picture with a snake. Not fun to be propositioned over and over again when you are trying to enjoy the beach. Overall, the beach was the nicest I've been too, weather was beautiful all day long, resort grounds are nice, everything is very clean, but the staff is lacking, and so is the buffet food. Maybe it is because they are so new, and maybe they are understaffed and overworked, but the service really needs to be improved upon. I probably would not recommend this hotel to my family or friends. Not the service or food I would expect from a 5 star hotel.

<Content>EdenH Real Arena Real Nice! Just got back from a weeks stay at the EdenH (May 3-May 10, 2008) and I will repeat what I saw someone else mention, if you do not have an enjoyable time here, take a look in the mirror and you will see the reason. We went with our son (4.5 years) and daughter (2 years), and we all enjoyed a week in paradise. The weather was absolutely fantastic; the staff very warm and friendly; we met many other nice and personable guests from all over; the hotel, grounds, beach and pools are beautiful; the food plentiful and tasty; and there are lots of activities on and off site to keep you busy should you so desire.One other important thing to mention, toward the end of the trip, my son got a high fever with vomiting and diarrhea. Thankfully a doctor is on call on the hotel premises 24 hours (this is a five star resort after all, contrary to some what some other reviews have suggested). She treated my son immediatly and referred us to a hospital clinic within 1 hour. A special thanks goes out to her for the wonderful and compassionate medical care! All the best!

<Content>Loved it, hated the mosquitos Our vacation was May 3-10 and was our first family vacation with a 3 and 4 yr old. I really could not have asked for a better vacation! The hotel was beautiful and the staff mostly friendly (they love kids!). The pools were great - some loud, and some quieter. The beach was incredible. The food was good - especially the Asian. Here are some tips I would have liked to known before I went:1. Mosquitos are BAD on the first floor. We were in 2164 and we should have been alerted to the problem when we saw all the guts splattered on the wall. The kids were eaten alive the first night. We killed all the mosquitos and they just keep coming. I think they come from the vents. 2. The rooms that face outwards from the hotel face a 30 ft black mesh wall and a walkway that the staff uses. Not pretty.3. If you want an alcoholic drink you have to ask for the booze.4. There are no adults allowed in the kids club and it's surrounded by an 8ft wall (... we weren't comfortable with leaving our kids here due to that)5. There is no chair issue and no reason to worry.6. There are lots of places for all to sit, eat, drink, be merry, and be entertained. In the courtyard, they play kids movies on the big screen every couple of nights which we really appreciated.7. Open concept bathrooms - we had a door on our bathroom, and glass doors on the toilet, shower.... and then a 2ft tall by 8ft wide gap over the mirror - so although you couldn't see anything, you could hear it. I don't know what the point of that was.8. Two restaurants are closed each night. 9. The restaurant pagers don't work in your room... you can't get your pager and go back to your room. If you get to the restaurant before 7pm you can usually get a table right away.10. Blue wristbands... over the weekend of the 3rd, there were a bunch of locals in the hotel (not sure if this is every weekend, or for the slower period, employee discount or even Cinqo de Mayo) but the hotel was overbooked, kids were trying to take your stuff and people were cutting in lines. It was annoying. Magically it disappeared Sunday afternoon.Ultimately we had a great vacation. We got just what we wanted - a week of fun with our kids, in a safe place. The bugs are the only reason we will not return to the area. We actually brought a mosquito net with us just in case and we all slept under it - the kids thought it was great to sleep in a tent. Had we known that other floors had less bugs, we would have moved.

<Content>a piece of heaven We arrived at Edenh on May 2/08 it was raining but that did not stop us. The rest of the week not a drop of rain. The hotel is beautiful and staff is amazing. The atmosphere is great. The bartenders were fabulous.Check in was easy, it took about 5 minutes just signed some papers and off we went. Rammy the bellboy lead the way to the best room with the best view 1276. I do not know what everyones complaints are about. We had know problems with this hotel that ihas been opened for 5 months. Everything working and in order. My only complaint is that the Helicopters are flying by about every 10 mins. the Buffet food was luke warm and so was the A La cartes. But who cares we are there to have a relaxing holiday and that is exactly what my Husband and I did.I would go back tomorrow if I could. We miss the people and the palm trees already. Go to this hotel and enjoy your self, do not worry about anything.

<Content>Average Resort This resort has quite a few problems. First, if you have already made a reservation, I wouldn鈥檛 panic (unless you have paid a 5-star price). If you have not yet made reservation, I would suggest you don鈥檛. If you upgrade it is mostly for the rooms closer to the beach and the private pool. We were Paradise Club. This was to include private check-in, rooms closer to the beach, private pool (including pool bar), top shelf liquor, private concierge, lounge and bar, free internet and private continental breakfast. There may have been other things but tI was only aware of these. We were never informed of what was included in the package. Most information came from other people. The lounge was a chuckle. A room with the check-in desks, a living room set, television, dining room - type table with chairs and 2 computers. The bar was self serve with about 10 bottles of liquor, no mixer, ice, juice, whatever you need to mix drinks. A small frig with coke, diet coke, water, etc. We found out after about 4 days that Paradise Club has a private breakfast area where you can go al a carte if you like. We only did this once because getting what you want yourself was easier.The private pool was nice. It made the resort more intimate, sort of a small party every day. The top shelf liquor at the pool bar was a joke. There were usually about 7 to 10 bottles of top shelf liquor and not necessarily the same ones. One day there was Amaretto de Sarono for about 3 hours, never to be seen again for the remainder of the week. One day Stoly, again one day only. The top shelf that was there was never used so it was always there鈥he various types of Absolute. You get the idea, nothing consistent. The lobby bar had top shelf liquor and 鈥渢op-top鈥?shelf liquor for which you had to pay. (At an all-inclusive, why have liquor that is not included?)The rooms were satisfactory but the shower doors were incorrectly aligned which could very easily shatter. I was told by a guest in one of the ocean front suites that they had no shower door but the hinges, apparently for a door that was there at one time. The Jacuzzi tubs on the balcony were a little weird. There was no privacy so if you took a bath before it was dark your bath was in view for all. Maybe some sort of privacy blind would be helpful. On our last night the air conditioner was not operating properly.There is no longer a chair issue, plenty of chairs and available palopas. However, the umbrellas are an issue. Not one at the Paradise club pool was in working order. They are shabby and not able to handle the use. How much can it cost to replace broken umbrellas? The ala carte restaurants were open two at a time, never all four. The food was mediocre except for the Hibachi. Everyone loved it. Reservations were made, a beeper was given to you and you waited anywhere from 20 minutes to 2 hours. The buffet was hit or miss. You never knew what to expect or what the quality would be. The food down by the beach was also hit or miss but you were more likely to find something appealing.There are a lot of little things that keep this resort from being anymore than a 3 star. I don鈥檛 see much potential for improvement any time soon. It鈥檚 been open for a few months and requires a great deal of maintenance already. If you鈥檝e already booked and don鈥檛 sweat the small stuff it should be an adequate holiday.

<Content>Not Great I went with my mom, sister and two friends.Hotel was built on a swamp and that is why there are a lot of mosquitoes. Don't stay in bulding 2 unless you face the pool because there are a lot of misquitoes. Bulding 1 is where my friends stayed had no problems with mosquitoes. Jewelry - Be certain to lock all your goodies in the safe. I didn't and my wedding band was missing. My own fault.Pool - okay. Beach okay. They raked the seaweed up every monring. It is on the Carribean so how bad can it be.Music same everywhere, not that great. Bring CDs and possibly ask at pool, especially VIP pools area if they will play your CD.Food - Was not good and I am not picky. I eat pretty much anything. You had to pay extra for lobster.Not a lush resort because it is so new as other people have stated. Staff - most were great. Very friendly and tried to help. Alexander at Guest Services was very helpful.Entertainment - Not great.Tours - did the Zipline and had a great time 11 platforms 10 cables. Be sure you are in shape to climb up and down flights of strair that are around 3 stories high. My mom did it and she is 74.All and all I would not recommend this resort to anyone. I have been in Punta before and there are so many better options. I like everyone else have read these review and kept hoping it was better than it sounded. Don't get me wrong you will have a good time because you are on vacation, but it would be better if you stay elsewhere.

<Content>Relax ! A great Resort We just return from a week at the Edenh from April 26 to May 3rd. Having read all the negative reviews I was very concerned and more then once thought about switching resorts. There were 14 in our group and I can say without hesitation everyone had a great time. I have been to Punta Cana several times and would certainly rate this resort right up there beside the Majestic- one that we stayed at a couple years ago. Yes there are a few things to be worked out but that is very normal being a new resort. Remember you are going to a different country for a well deserved vacation so expect things to be a little different , including the food, language, customs etc. The pace is also slower but that is part of vacation - to slow down and relax. First of all the big issue with the beach chairs- it is not a problem. I am an early riser so not an issue however there always seemed to be beach chairs available( and they were expecting more). While my wife and I spend most of the day on the beach even when we went to the pool area mid afternoon we always found chairs. How someone could say the chairs are still a problem is beyond me. For the a la carte Restaurants we went 6 times during the week , excellent food and only once did we have to wait and that was for a late sitting ( after nine) Most times we just walked in shortly after 6 and were able to get a seat right away. On two nights I made reservations around 6 for a 7.30 sitting( for 14 people) - not an problem at all. I enjoyed all the Restaurants but liked both the Asian and French the best. The weather was overall great for the week and the beach( # 1 reason why I go south) was one of the best I have been to. I spent many hours walking along the beach area and Edenh by far had the best beach front. The pool was large and also vey enjoyable( even if you are taking a swim at night) I found the stafft to be great, they could not do enough fro you. The rooms were very large and spacious . We ended up in building # 1 facing the pool and with a partial ocean view after we switched the second day. The rooms were cleaned daily and the mini bar always had refreshments . I especially enjoyed the Jacuzzi on the balcony every afternoon when I came back from the beach- very relaxing. It was a bit of a hassle at the front desk when I requested the change but mainly because of a language barrier and I had time- afterall I was on vacation. Also unless you want premium drinks I do not feel the upgrade to the pink bracelet is worth the extra money. My only overall issue with this resort is the fact all the bars were closed in along with the lobby so I found the smoke a bit too much at times being a non- smoker. Usually all the bars and lobby are open air so not sure why the resort was built this way. So in summary- just a great vacation at a great resort at a great price. I wanted some sun and surf after 5 months of winter, have some great food, a few drinks( and trust me they were not watered down) and just relax with a good book on a white sandy beach with palm tress swaying in the wind and Carribean music in the background( sometimes it was rock music) Edenh filled the bill completely . Would I recommend- absolutely . Would I go back - probably not because I like to try different resorts every year. Now it is back to reality and normal Canadian temperatures - 6 degrees today but at least the snow is gone. So just relax, go and have a great time- you will enjoy it !

<Content>Three Little Birds My wife and I stayed at EdenH from April 26-May 1. Overall we had a fantastic time and much of that can be credited to the fun, positive guests and staff with whom we shared this experience. In broad strokes, the resort is great looking with a modern, tropical-Zen look and feel. Food was good, room was good, pools, beach, sand, drinks鈥?all very good. There were a few things from our experience that stood out from other reviews so I鈥檒l focus on those and hopefully they鈥檒l be helpful:鈥淭he Up-Sell鈥?- We paid for a regular Deluxe room with green bracelets through an online travel site. When we checked in, we asked if we could have a room facing the pools area and on an upper floor. The 鈥淯鈥?shaped resort layout is such that rooms will either face the interior pools area or the exterior neighboring/development areas a.k.a. the black fence鈥? Upper floor rooms on both sides afford ocean views. We wanted an upper room on the internal pools side.Despite my friendliest attempt, we were told we could only get a room on the first floor exterior facing the fence. No upper floor. No ocean view. No pool view. Front Desk said we could get a room on the fourth floor facing the pools but that would cost an additional $80 per day. Based on our 5 night stay that would be $400. We offered $100 total for the upgrade, and eventually settled on $200. A little annoying but not enough to put us off our vacation. However, then they wanted to charge us an additional $100 each for the VIP pink bracelets that apparently goes with this room. We settled on $50 for both of us. So to sum up, we paid an additional $250 total to get a better view and the pink bracelets for two people. The room was the same deluxe room size/layout that we would have gotten on the first floor, except it had a better view. I鈥檓 not sure the room upgrade was necessarily worth it considering we rarely spent any time there. My wife absolutely thought it was worth it. As a sidebar, I initially tried to slip the front desk guy a $20 then $40 to upgrade us to a better room. He didn鈥檛 go for it.鈥淭he Pink Bracelets鈥?- Most reviews said there was no difference in the green and pink bracelets and therefore we didn鈥檛 initially plan on upgrading to the pinks. However, we were very glad we did. The pinks give you access to two smaller VIP pools with bars. At first glance they may not look like much because they鈥檙e smaller, but we loved them. The VIP pool bars seemed to serve tastier and stronger drinks than the regular bars. Since there were very few people, there was no waiting and the bartenders knew our drinks and served us quickly. Also, instead of draft beer, they also served beer in cans and bottles. You could also get cold bottles of water, which I heard were unavailable at the regular bars. There were always lounge chairs, tables and umbrellas available at any time of day. The pinks also get you into the Italian restaurant for breakfast. You will have the place mostly to yourselves. A la carte menu with attentive service and the food is hotter than the buffet. However, if you鈥檙e into omelets, Felix in the buffet area makes better ones.The pinks get you brand name alcohol. I did not see green bracelets get Absolut vodka and other so-called 鈥減remium鈥?alcohol, although I saw quite a few get turned down. More pink features: You get access to a VIP lounge next to the lobby where you can use the internet for free. The lounge also has a private self-serve bar where you can make your own drinks and get all the bottled water and bottled soda you want. Overall, we felt $50 for two pink bracelets was well worth it. However, I鈥檓 not sold on the two-tier bracelet system. I saw guests with green bracelets get turned away from some areas/services and get embarrassed鈥?that鈥檚 a bit flawed.鈥淐hair Situation鈥?鈥?Based on the negative reviews, we dreaded this going in, but really did not see what the fuss was about when we got there. At issue is not so much the beach chairs, as is the beach palapas. The prime palapas went by 7a every morning, but you could sometimes find ones further away from the water as late as 9:30a. One morning, I saw a few palapas unoccupied all day. If you don鈥檛 want shade (not advised), you could almost always find a couple unoccupied/unsaved chairs at the beach. I wake up early anyway, so getting to the beach by 6:30a to reserve a palapa was not a chore. There are joggers and other early birds to see and meet, and the whole 鈥渟aving鈥?situation was very civil. I did not see any tension because of this. At all pools, chairs were available pretty much all day long. 鈥淎 la cartes鈥?鈥?We are completely bewildered by reviewers who said they HAD to line up at 5p with their tales of hardship. We ate at the French, Italian, Asian (twice) and never spent more than a few minutes in line. We went for the 7:30p sitting every night and it was easy and organized. The most popular sitting at any of the a la cartes was the hibachi grill at the Asian. For that we went to the restaurant at 7p. The hostess wrote our name on a list, gave us a coaster on which she jotted our names and scheduled sitting time (7:30p) and that was it. We went to the lobby bar for a couple drinks, came back at 7:30p and were seated right on schedule. The French: 7:15p no line, no wait. The Italian: 7:30p, 2 groups ahead of us, 3 minute wait. And if you just want sushi and tempura, you can just walk directly into the Asian sushi bar鈥?no line up whatsoever. However, on a couple nights we did see some people complaining to the hostesses about something or other, but you can sense that those people may 鈥渋nvite鈥?bad situations with their attitudes.As for the food, we actually liked the Italian the best, although most people we talked to enjoyed the Asian hibachi most. We didn鈥檛 care much for the French. Considering it鈥檚 an all-inclusive resort, we thought the food overall (including the buffet) was very good.鈥淢osquito situation鈥?鈥?Did not see any in our room (4th floor, pool view) the entire trip and never got bit. However, we did hear from people on the first floor that this was a problem. Getting away from the mosquitoes was possibly the best thing about the room upgrade to the 4th floor. Beyond our rooms, the breeze was slightly on the strong side during our stay and we did not use insect repellant once during our trip. 鈥淭ipping鈥?鈥?we generally tip often giving a dollar for every two drinks or one round, $4 for breakfast, $5 for lunch and dinner, and $2 for housekeeping. Giving tips, smiling and making attempts to engage the staff 鈥?based on our experience - go a long way to make your stay better. And I think, they do spread the word. After a few days, we always had extra beverages in our fridge, we got washcloths, our breakfasts came out steaming hot, our drinks were amazing and even in the buffet, we鈥檇 get drinks brought to us before we even asked for another. However as other reviewers have mentioned, this is not a wealthy country. So giving tips had a 鈥渨orth鈥?beyond any improvement in service we may have received. That said, my wife ordered breakfast room service on our last day. The food arrived hot in 20 minutes. When she asked the attendant for hot sauce, he came back (out of breath) with a brand new bottle of Tabasco in less than 5 min. Considering how far the restaurants are, it was shocking how fast he came back. Overall, the staff and service were good.鈥淭he Problems鈥?鈥?just in case you think our stay was perfect there were some 鈥減roblems鈥? Our drink orders got mixed up a few times. One set of elevators did not work very often. There were regular 2-5 min blackouts. When I ordered eggs over easy, they鈥檇 come out sunny side up. I鈥檇 ask for steak medium rare, and it would come out blue. I鈥檇 ask for no bacon, and I鈥檇 get bacon. I鈥檇 order a beer for dinner and not get one (actually that was a little weird). Those and other (frequent) mistakes were barely an inconvenience and certainly not what we considered problems. Considering where we were and the reason we were there, those were more a source of amusement than annoyance. And every time an issue was mentioned, they were fixed quickly and with an apology. (Except for the beer at dinner鈥?still wondering whatever happened to that).My final two cents鈥?I think the main source of the problems and the bad reviews is that the resort is at capacity and there is an underlying competitiveness among some guests, some of which we were initially guilty of too. 鈥淕otta get a room with a nice view鈥濃€?鈥淕otta get a nice spot at the beach鈥濃€?鈥淕otta get a nice table at dinner鈥濃€?etc. Once we became aware of how we were thinking - about 1 hour into the trip - we quickly switched gears. Is it a five star in the class of the Mandarin Oriental in New York? Of course not. But isn鈥檛 a true 鈥渇ive star鈥?and 鈥渁ll-inclusive鈥?a little beyond reasonable expectations? We stayed away from people fixated on those things and fortunately found positive, funny people who went there for the same reasons we were there鈥?to chill out and have a good time. And we did.

<Content>Potential, Potential, Potential We stayed at EdenH from April 12 - 26, 2008. We had read the reviews prior to going and spoke with some people who ahd stayed there in March, 2008. We felt it would really take something pretty bad to ruin our vacation, while our vacation wasn't ruined it certainly was a vacation of inconvenience. No problems encountered at check-in, received exactly what we asked for with respect to room type and location. Declined the sales pitch to upgrade to pink bracelets for $ 40 per person per day as we didn't feel the need to upgrade. No issues with receiving service as a result of our green bracelets. Our experience with this resort was not the same as we've had at other Punta Cana resorts in the past, we have stayed previously at 2 resorts that are rated as 5 star ( Bahia Principe  Majestic Colonial ). The service and selection of food at EdenH was certainly sub par to these other resorts , but, there were other aspects that deserved kudos here, i.e. the fries, pizza and barbecued chicken were the best we've found in Punta Cana while the overall selection at the Beach Grill and the buffet were poor and repetitive. The entertainment was good and the shows were short at about 45 minutes so you could still be in bed by 11:00 at night to get up early for your beach chairs and palapa. Yes you must rise early depending on the capacity at which the resort is at during your stay, the higher capacity the resort is at the earlier you will have to rise to reserve your chair and palapa. During our stay you needed to be on the beach to reserve by about 05:30 a.m. and the second week you needed to be on the beach by 06:30 a.m. as the resort wasn't as fulll the second week. There were days that the room mini bar was not stocked ( about half of our stay ) and we had to chase down our own supplies or call guest services to have it done. None of these things are vacation stoppers but they certainly take away from the overall vacation experience. Although we got a good price by booking a new 5 star we had expectations that some of these things would be worked out by the time we arrived 4 months after their opening. While the reservation system may be improved most nights it wasn't a problem for us as we like to eat about 7:30 - 8:00 while we're ther after the beach until about 6:00. Also we found that the resort seemed to be under staffed in the restaurants and serving at about 60% of capacity and even that was taxing the staff that they had. We consistantly found that the staff was willing to provide good service but seemed overwhelmed by the number of guests versus the staff availavle to provide the service for them. We witnessed guests taking out their frustrations with the a la carte system on the individual hostesses at the restaurants, not very politely to say the least. Hats off to Libby at the Shore Grill and Antonia at the Italian for their patience in dealing with the guests.We were unable to understand the problem with the staffing and chairs at the beach and the pools, NH resorts should certainly know the equation for these areas of resort operations as they operate many other resorts quite efficiently but they are certainly burning out staff and guests over what appear to be things that are common knowledge for these type of operations. Overall this could be a wonderful resort and could certainly be a 5 star in the future if they can rectify some of their issues efficiently, unfortunately there were more unsatisfied guests than satisfied guests encountered during our stay and as they say an unhappy customer will tell 10 others so this won't bode well for their future if they can't turn the tide and SOON as it's difficult to reapir a damaged reputation in the hotel business. While we enjoyed our vacation it mostly because we met and enjoyed times with other guests and made our vacation and relied on the resort for food, drink and lodging and made our own good times and memories.Overall I could only recommend this resort to someone if they got a great deal on it as it certinly doesn't measure up to our other 5 star experiences. The positive is that the resort is beautiful and will only improve with the growth of the vegetation on the resort. There will also be maintenance needs that will have to be addressed as we continually heard of guests experinecing plumbing and stucture problems during our stay while we didn't have any ourselves in order to ascertain their 5 star rating.

<Content>Terrible customer service...stay somewhere else We stayed from 5/1 to 5/4, and would probably characterize the hotel no higher than 3 stars. There were so many little problems that eventually added up...would never go back to this property again. We had previously stayed in another resort in Punta Cana, so we had something to compare it to. Problems:1) Elevators only worked before 10:00...it was a problem with our friends because one person had back problems.2) Our room was not cleaned the 2nd day and it took over an hour to get towels.3) We changed rooms twice and front desk (Esther) said that in order to get a room not facing construction, they would have to charge us more. When we said that our friends paid the same price and their room faced the pool, she kept arguing that they had paid more. She eventually changed us to a new room where everything was broken...No knob on the bathroom door, no sink stopper, the faucet fell off, the remote didn't work, the ac didn't go below 77....etc. We found another front desk person and they changed us to another room. In the 3 rooms that we had, only one of the clocks worked.4) The service at the bars and restaurants was extremely slow. We learned to ask for 2 drinks at a time so as not to waste time.5) We only had washcloths the first day...even though we asked for some, never got any.6) he gym was supposed to open at 7....the first day, personnel didn't open it until 7:30.In October 2007, I stayed at the Cove at Atlantis in the Bahamas...that was a 5 star property. This was a 3 star disappointment.I would like to go back to Punta Cana again, but would never stay at this property and would never recommend it.

<Content>Apploso, Apploso Stayed: April 25 through May 1Room: Building 1 - 3rd floor (deluxe room - Green bracelet)We read the reviews and prepared for the worse. We were pleasantly surprised by the level of service and cleanliness of the facility. We arrived at Edenh at around 3 p.m. were given fruity drinks in flutes. Check in took less than 2 minutes (we were the only ones checking in).We were shown to our rooms by a bellman who gave us a mini tour. We were shown the restaurants, buffet, gym, sports bar, lobby bar....you get the picture.Our room didn't have the best view but weren't there for the view. Our package, when we booked said, 鈥淕arden View鈥? don't know what kind of garden that was so we kept the curtains closed.Beach:Beautiful! There are issues with chairs but AGAIN that鈥檚 not the resort鈥檚 problem rather guests who鈥檝e read Trip Advisor and think that they should get up at the crack of dawn to reserve seats. I have to admit, I did this on the first day, not on purpose but because the people who had the room before us set the alarm for 6 AM!! Ugh. I dragged my jetlagged self to the beach and watched people 鈥渞eserve seats鈥?but didn鈥檛 use them until 11 am. Meanwhile, I saw people who wanted to use the seats at around 9 am-ish but couldn鈥檛 use them because of the 鈥渞eserve鈥? The 2nd day it got better. The 鈥渞eserve鈥?crowd left and I saw less of people saving chairs. The hubby and I woke up at 10 a.m. ate at the buffet, then off to the beach. We always found chairs 鈥?under palapas! The resort provided entertainment and games at the beach. Akon and his partner in crime Geronimo (I think) were great emcee鈥檚 for the games. I shall never forget 鈥渁pploso鈥?and 鈥渃atastrofico鈥?br/>Food:I鈥檓 not a picky eater. I could eat the same thing everyday as long as its cooked. i'm a happy camper. We usually ate at the buffet because we didn鈥檛 want to deal with the wait at the restaurants. The first two days we ate at the restaurants (open during dinner only) however, when they alternately closed a restaurant that鈥檚 when the guests were restless. The usual wait was 1.5 hours to 2 hours. Bummer. But if you eat at the sushi bar you get served immediately.Staff:AWESOME! Yes. There is a language barrier but the staff tries very very hard to communicate to each guest. During our stay, we passed by the staff room located at the end of the hall at the building where we were staying and we saw the comment board. I was sadly disappointed it said, 鈥渢he only problem we had was the staff, they didn鈥檛 speak English鈥? When we were there, the hubby and I recalled our high school Spanish and tried our best to communicate with the staff. They probably laughed at our silly attempts to speak but they were nice and smiled.Mosquitoes:There were a few of those buggers in our room but we quickly placed an end to their visit in our room. We loved our stay. The hotel was what we expected. The beach was awesome and we made new friends. We came home relaxed and tanned. Can't complain about that.

<Content>Not a Five Star Hi. We stayed at EdenH from April17th-24th 2008. I was disappointed in the resort overall, as a new five star resort. I didn't like the fact that it said ocean view and our room faced a vacant unkept lot. They also took our coffee maker out of the room one day  never returned it. I didn't like the bathroom being so opened up. We were travelling with other family  if you were in the jaccuzzi, they couldn't come in for a drink or have a seat, because you would be sitting enjoying the tub. The sprayer on the tub didn't work  water would run out of the shower all over the bathroom floor. There was still an old shower cap on the floor when we checked in.We sat the second evening waiting two hrs for one of the a la carte restaurants to accomodate us. That really cuts into your vaction time.The staff were friendly, but we found that there weren't enough staff. Some days we never even got offered coffee.I had to get up every morning at 6am in order to ensure chairs for our group of six. Doesn't make for a relaxing sleep.Food overall was fair. Entertainment was not that good in the evening. They did more work setting up for it then what it was worth. And it started to late.I would like to see something open down by the beach in the evening to sit around  have few drinks. It was all closed up  rather depressing.My inlaws found they were quick to accept Canadian money in the casino, but would not accept it in the gift shop. And would not exchange in the lobby consistently .We enjoyed the company of each other  the warm weather the most. Hope others had a good time at this resort.

<Content>DONT WORRY ABOUT THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I just want to say you have nothing to worry about and just like everyone else i have read all those annoying negative reviews about this place. I stayed at the EDENH from April 20- 27 with my girlfriend. ill start by saying the check in was pretty fast we got there around noon and they told us to come back in 2 hours so my girlfriend and i just took a tour of the hotel and got some drinks so that was fine. We got back around 2-2:30 checked into our room. Didnt get a room faceing the pool area it was on the back facing some black fence but honestly we were just in the room to sleep so i didnt make a big deal of it. The food is very good and as long as you get to the restruants around 5:30 you will have no problem getting in and i found that the lines die down throughout the week. They have and Asian, American, French and Italian, i liked the Asian and Italian the best! ... and for the buffet it was just outstanding they have everything you want there and the breakfast was just Amazing!! GO TO FELIX FOR YOUR OMLETTES!!! He makes the best omlettes and he is such a nice guy and will introduce himself to you and also remember your name. I dont know how he does it but he remembers everyones name. The whole thing about the beach chair ill go through that right now. Well lets put it this way if you want to wake up at around 5-5:30 am then you will get a spot on the beach if you dont then you are pretty much out of luck. I would wake up around 7am and just get a spot by one of the pool areas and they are always planty available cause i didnt mind just walking to the beach for a dip in the ocean. The only reason im not giving a perfect 5 is just because my girlfriend and i would always get bit by mosquitos in our room and there was one nite i couldnt get to sleep because they would be buzzing around my head!.I asked other people we met down there if they had the same problem and they didnt have any in there room, so i guess its just some rooms. I m sure we could of changed our room but just didnt bother. The diffrent bars they have are pretty good, i liked the Tantara bar the best becuase it looks really so cool at night. Also you will find that this resort is mostly Canadians which is awsome cause we met so many nice people. I would go back in a heartbeat. My girlfreind and I are both 22 and didnt know if this would be a good place to go to but honestly there was a mix of all ages which was great the only thing they dont have is a night club or anything but i didnt care cause im not much of a dancer anyways. Another thing if you want great drinks at the bar near the beach go to Danny hes great! Well if anyone has any further questions about his resort please feel free to contact be by e-mail at [-]

<Content>Beautful Beach and warm sun We were a group of 18 and stayed at the Edenh Real April 19-27.I would say we all had a great time and got what we paid for鈥︹€滻t is what it is鈥?a cheap vacation that got us all away from the cold !!!The ala carte reservation is not (in my opinion) acceptable. You have to start lining up at 5.The beach chair issue is just a joke. My husband and others in the group were up and on the beachBy 5:30-6:00. if you did not play the game you did not get a chair.Overall we did have a nice relaxing week and enjoyed the beach and the nice warm sun.Would I go back? Probably not.Would I recommend? Yes, if the price was right.I think in time the resort will resolve the issues and it will truly be a 5 star. But right now I would give it a 3.5.

<Content>Nice Hotel... But many little annoying/inconnvenience adds NOT SO NICE STAY! We are a family of four (kids 8 months and 2 1/2 years old) stayed at the Edenh Real Arena Punta Cana on 4/19 - 4/26.I have read some reviews before going so I expect the negatives and positives. However, alot of negatives have become annoying and inconvenience that I would not characterize the entire trip to this hotel/Punta Cana in general a nice vacation.Negatives:1) Mosquitoes - Is there any vacation hotel/destination where you have to kill mosquitoes before going to bed so they wont bite you? (Mosquitoes are probably every other hotel on the island but it is a negative for us)2) Lot of other little annoyances:  - Dinner reservation was not organized. Alot of people are  upset because it is not organize and sometimes the  hotel/reservation people make you look like you are  looking/asking for food. It just not up to par. - Not even beach chair/Shade (people put towels early in the  morning but won't show up until later. So alot of times you  can't find beach chair or shade at 7/8am. Security supposed  to take those towels off every hour if no one is there but that  is hit and miss.)  - the toilet made this crazy,loud, siren -blaring noise  everytime we flushed. - Lot of service people do not speak English - A little difficult to  get help/service when you need it. - Ice machine is real bad (9 out of 10 times I went to get ice  and there were no ice) - Electricity goes out two or three times every other day  (although I thought it is okay and fun but probably not for  some)Positive(s):1) Hotel and beach is nice but again in my opinion too many negatives to give great review for this hotel. 2) Entertainment was nice.3) Food was okay.We have been to Cancun and Jamaica so comparing it with Punta Cana, we would chose Cancun, Mexico or Jamaica as our vacation destination rather than Punta Cana, DR.I am not a complainer and can stand most hotel little annoyances so we still have a good time. I hope my review help people reading make inform decision after reading many positive and negative reviews and nothing again the Edenh Real Arena Hotel or Punta Cana in general.

<Content>Go elsewhere Weather wonderful ,hotel give it a 2.5, room not cleaned till after 5p.m.daily and not a good job done,meals were a joke no reservations taken, if you want to be sure to get into a-la carte restaurant be prepared to start lining up at 5pm.but to be honest it is not worth it, go for the Buffet but you will feel like you are in a school cafeteria. Generally had to ask for water ,wine coffee no bar service on beach, if you want a tiki hut on the beach or umbrella by the pool be prepared to stake your claim by 6a.m. or you will be out of luck. Have visited Punta Cana many times this by far is the worst experience. Will return but never never never to this hotel Oh one last thing every evening power cuts some times lasting 15 mins

<Content>Absolutely Fabulous A couple of friends and I stayed at the Eden from Mar 29 to Apr 5,2008. We had a fantastic time. We were a little worried about all the negative reviews but in my opinion they are not justified. This was my first trip of this kind. My friends, on the other hand, have traveled a fair bit. They have been to Jamaica and Cuba and found this resort to be as good or better. The resort was beautiful. The beach breathtaking. They food was pretty good. We only ate in a couple of the resaurants so I cannot comment on them all. The service was excellent. The staff, out of this world. So happy all the time with a smile and couldn't do enough to help. Some do not speak english well but I found all the front line staff could speak pretty good english. The entertainment staff were a great bit of fun. They were entertaining, of course, funny and very genuine. I came home feeling as though I had made some new friends in the Dominican. The shows were fantastic as well. The night life is a little quiet. They could definately use a disco. All in all I had a wonderful time and we are planning to return next year. I went to have a relaxing, enjoyable vacation and that is just what I got.

<Content>Excellent resoert!!! Hi,This is short and sweet.Don't know what types of resorts the Americans are visiting because this is an excellent resort with excellent service.I too was worried about the bad reviews but I was pleasantly surprised.To Canadians travelling there,i am sure most will have an excellent experience.I have travelled to a Sandals resort and Edenh is right up there with it as one of the best resorts I have stayed at.The dollar value of this trip was unbelieveable.My husband cannot stay in our own province for a week ski-dooing for 1200.00.Some reviews say this place will be great once the kinks are ironed out.I say what kinks?Enjoy your trip.

<Content>Not the best but it's not the worst either My friend and I traveled to EDENH from April13-20CHECK INCheck in was about 15 minutes because there was 2 bus loads of people that just arrived at the hotel, we were about halfway in the line. The incence dispenser person attacked us in line lol, we all got a bit choked up, it was interesting!ROOMOur room was on the 4th floor so there was less mosquitos. The bed was comfy, loved the comforter. The bathroom and shower doors are frosted so you can't see through them. We received 2 bath towels, 2 hand towels, one face cloth. They also provide toiletries, comb, shower gel, shampoo, conditioner, shower cap, Q-Tips, and cotton face pads. You can get internet in your room for $25US for 24hrs use, I have about 10 hours left on my account, here is the access name and password, maybe someone can still use it down there.NAME- kagcor7PASSWORD- motburulMy laptop is 17 and it fit in the safe. The temperature stayed at 71 and we couldn't change it, nor would it turn off. I'm sure you can get people to fix things, but who wants to wait around for a maintenance person? Ahhhh the DO NOT DISTURB SIGN, well it's written in english and spanish but they walk right in without knocking. This happened on numerous occasions, we complained, but it didn't make a difference. The mini bar is stocked with 2 beers 2 cokes 1 diet coke 1 sprite 2 bottles of water. The TV has a lot of different channels, but no CBS, sorry BIG BROTHER and SURVIVOR fans :0( lol. Room service has club, tuna, ham and cheese sandwiches served with chips. fruit platter , tomato salad, cheesecake. For breakfast they serve coffee, tea, juice, fruit, cheese, bread, pastries. They also serve this from 6:30am -7am in the lobby.There were 4 blackouts on our last night, this might happen everynight, I don't know but we stayed in to pack. They last a couple of minutes.THE RESTAURANTSThe buffet is very small. They basically serve the same thing every night, and I agree with other reviews about the ambience. It's florecent lighting for dinner, very romantic, lol. Not a very good salad bar. And the service wasn't the greatest you would come back from dessert and your dinner plate would still be there.We tried three a la carts the romantic was pretty good the Italian, well the dinner was good but don't know about the dessert because my friend and I left after a waiter made a comment about my chest. The asian if you get a chance at the habachi table hahahahaha was like every other asian restaurant in an all inclusive, if you've never experienced it you will enjoy it. My tip would be to book it on Thursday because it's the beach party you have a good chance of getting a seat. But book it later so you can do both:0)The beach party is really the thing that impressed me they go all out. They have different sections cooking meat and fish over a fire, They had a lady sitting down and her lower half was cake shaped like a mermaids body. The table and chairs were on the sand so leave your shoes in your room. They had a DJ, and people were really enjoying themselves. THE POOLI liked the green and sand coloured glass tiles, instead of the blue ones you see. I also like that they have tiled chairs in the pool. What I didn't like was that there wasn't enough pool servers, I waited an hour before they got to me and this was after a day at the beach around 5pm, I know this because I got a chair, hahahahah! They say they have five pools, but com'mon, if you added them all up you get an average sized pool. They're really small, which is fine if you don't have 4000 people staying at the hotel. THE BEACHThe beach is the nicest, along that stetch. There is nothing to look at if you want to snorkel. Yes there is seaweed floating in the water but you get over it. Didn't see one person serving drinks along th beach. My suggestion is bring a travel mug, and something infltable to rest your head beacuse if you ususally get up early for work and god forbid you want to sleep to 8am on your vacation you won't get a beach chair. Wait a second I'm sure you know this by now.DAY TRIPSMy friend and I did the FUN FUN CAVE it was good but keep in mind you're only there for 3 hours they picked us up at 7:15am and dropped us off 7:20pm. When you arrive at the ranch they serve you coffee, tea, oj, bananas, and ham and cheese sandwiches. From there you ride a horse for about 30 mins, then hike for about 45mins, rappell into a cave, where you walk and swim to the other side of the cave where your horse awaits to bring you back to the buffet style lunch.The other trip we did was the SAONA island. They take you by either catamaran or speedboat to the island. Once there you will be asked whether or not you want your hair braided, cigars, massage, coconut oil, palm hats, beaded jewelery, cigars. If you say no don't worry they'll keep asking , hahahah. You are there for three hours. I would recommend taking the speedboat first then the catamaran on the way back because when you are on the speedboat, they stop OFFSHORE so you can look at starfish. you might as well do it first because if you do it last you wind up in a wet bathing suit on the bus. Keep in mind when they say that you stop in the city to buy souvenirs, it's really just a tourist stop, not where locals go, I paid $4 for a fanta and a snickers bar.Overall we enjoyed ourselves but would not return to this resort, nor would we recommend it. As my friend would say IT IS WHAT IT IS a cheap vacation getting away from the cold.

<Content>edeNH real area - Punta Cana This was our fourth trip to Punta Cana having stayed at Serenis, Riu Bambu, Bahia Principa and the new Riu Palace - all of which were great hotels; however the new edeNH real arena was the best experience I've had. The rooms were great, the food was great, the bars, pools, and ocean were all wonderful. There is still a shortage of beach chairs on the beach however they are working on it. About 200 new chairs came in a week ago. The workers were fabulous, kind and courteous. I would go back in a flash.!One of the bell boys, Pedro Lunis was the best ever right from the minute we stepped into the hotel. He went above and beyond his job to ensure our stay was the best and it worked because it was the best.Edward our hotel(VIP) rep was not only georgeous but more than pleasant to deal with. If you had a problem he looked after it immediately.Our pool/beach bar bartenders were the best also. Ramon and Carlos were awesome. They kept things going and also went above and beyond their call of duty to ensure the vacationers were more than happy. They will keep you laughing for sure. Ramon is the only one who can make the moon come out in the day time - this is a private joke but if you go and see him - mention to him about the crazy old Maritimer who mooned him on several occasions. It was priceless.My advice is Go try it for yourself - you won't be disappointed.Kaye and Frank TaylorNew Glasgow, Nova Scotia

<Content>Five Stars All the Way!! Outside of the American Airlines debacle, we found the EdenH Arena Real a wonderful experience and fabulous family vacation. We traveled with our three children and stayed in one of the Paradise Clubs' Suites. We were in building one, third level on the end facing the ocean. Amazing Room! Amazing View!! We had excellent care from our hosts in the Paradise Club - Arturo and Leonardo were always making our stay pleasant and enjoyable. This was our fourth trip with CheapCaribbean.Com - The ONLY way to travel to the Caribbean!!! They provide you with so much more that the other travel companies - they were awared yet another prestegious Zoo Travel Award for 2008!Our CheapCaribbean.Com onsite host - Sammy was also excellent and cared for us well - his supervisor, Elso was truly spectacular in assisting us in any concern whatsoever!Our meals were always excellent. Although we were unable to be seated at the Hibachi Table in the Asian restaurant, we enjoyed the a la carte menu quite nicely! The steaks I had at the American were out-of-this-world! Get the Tenderloin!!We boycotted the Chair games everyone played. Because we were at the Paradise Club pools most of the time, we had no problem getting enough chairs. We were there for the sun, so we didn't squabble over the umbrellas!Overall, our experience was Five Stars All the Way! and I wouldn't concede to the other poorer reviews. You make your trip what it is...not the mosquitos or the staff or the furniture!! I understand, if you've paid a lot of money for your trip, you want to feel like a Queen for the Day! That's why we ALWAYS travel with CHEAPCARIBBEAN.COM!! They're the cheapest and the best!! Do the comparison!! Don't forget all they bundle in your package!! The others don't do the bundle!!!Enjoy!!!

<Content>Do not go with high expectations After reading so many mixed reviews, my boyfriend and I were a bit worried. We almost changed our plans due to the negativity and complaints. A friend of ours has been living in Punta cana for 4 years -and she is the person who suggested we stay there. We decided to stick with the plan and being resiliant New Yorkers, (also a great deal $$$) we were sure we would manage to have fun no matter what! Plus-we were soooo curious. The bracelet issue not a problem - we are not big drinkers and it seemed that an advantage of pink opposed to green was mostly the alcohol quality. (and private pools) Check in was simple and quick. Enclosed lobby makes it not so fresh and airy..alot of smokers and no non- smoking areas. We like the whole Spa vibe the grounds have. Victor from housekeeping was a doll and brought us the biggest can of bugspray i've ever seen. It did help. However, when my friend and her boyfriend checked into the hotel 2 days later to hang with us...different story. They walked into a mosquito crime-scene. Dead bugs and blood everywhere. Even the lampshade.Try to get a room on the upper floors...the hotel is built near some swamp. They do have fumigation planes or whatever- but be careful ...I caught an allergic reaction to it! The open jacuzzi not a problem..but our tub had a bootprint in it. I cleaned that myself. The shower door was wacky. Whoever actually put the handle on during construction- put it horizontally on instead of vertically- and it barely opened 7 inches..it couldn't open more beacause the wall stops it! All it was was a handle. I'd be screwed if I were heavier.(I had to suck in so i wouldn't scratch myself) Also, the toilet made this crazy,loud, siren -blaring noise everytime we flushed. Kinda sucked since the bathroom is so open and disturbs your partner's sleep. Plus the lights ofcourse..My boyfriend is so funny..everytime we flushed he would yell that the  German's were coming! lol...Oh and there was this horrible exposed vent..they put it on backwards. Even we could figure that out.We could see into the shaft in the ceiling....ugly! Our view did not exist...a fence! I think we could have changed rooms but were just tired and didn't want worse than that! So yeah, we agree that the place was built way to fast and not much quality control at all. We still had such a good time! We never cared about the chairs on the beach..we layed on the extra towels Victor gave us! Water was perfect just wavy and busy from boats..(LOTS).seaweed was there but SO not a big deal. The restuaraunts a total gamble..we even tried to make fun of that . I saw soooo many pissed off people. That is really the only total frustrating part of our trip. If you are hungry..otherwise..just chill. Eventually , you will eat. We were given some nice meals. Others, not so much. Lots of lines for everything. Be prepared for that -we were. Being from N.Y.C. ,it was just like home!!!lol. Just really warm and pretty and still somewhat relaxing! The Asian place was the best meal I had. The beach grill had my boyfriend happy all day. (CHICKEN ROCKED) I waited on line once for Felix at the omelette station..WORTH IT! (but to hungry the other days!) He's the best guy there-besides Victor the housekeeping manager. They should put trash cans on the beach..it was dirty after 3 pm...cups. ciggie buttes. all kinds of trash. I see enough garbage here at home.Though the pools were spotless and I loved the green tile..gave it a lagoon feel. Entertainment was pretty good.The one show we caught was boring but we are from New York we have a snobby attitude about that anyway. The live music in the cigar lounge was great. And Tahntra Lounge was very South Beach . Though a D.J. or better soundsystem would have improved the music. It was a great selection..poor listening quality.(oh well.) Still enjoyed! Like I said ,we kept our expectations really low for this one folks- and you should too.We ARE tan -and still chuckling about that crazy ,backwards Hotel!

<Content>An Amazing Resort! I booked this resort back in January as a birthday present to my husband. For months I read trip advisor and saw the horriable ratings this resort was getting. I even asked my travel agent for a possble switch of resorts, but I decided to stick it out and go to eden anyway. Im glad I did.The resort is absolutely beautiful. The buildings are all new, the vegetation is still growing but is still pretty. The layout of the resort is convienent with all the resturants off of the main plaza with the lobby right there as well. Our room was spacious and clean, the open concept bathroom was a bit inconvienent and we did have a bit of a problem with mosquitos but it wasnt a big deal, nothing some bug spray didnt take care of. The people are fantastic. Felix at the front desk is great! If you have any issues at all, ask for him and he will totally take care of you. Edwardo and Felix at the breakfast buffet are fantastic, make sure not to miss their morning omlettes!I started the week off as a green bracelet and was upgraded to a pink bracelet by midweek. I didnt really find that big of a difference. I dont like using the pools, I spend most of my time on the beach anyway, so the two extra pools for the pinks werent really any bonus for me. They say that there is premium alcohol available to the pinks, but I didnt taste a difference here either. The interenet is free for pinks, but there are only two computers and you have to wait for them anyway, twice I went into the business lounge and just paid for 15 minutes of internet so I wouldnt waste any time. So all in all, my advise is to save your money and just stick with the green bracelets. The resort is beautiful and the people are friendly and helpful and it doesnt matter what colour your bracelet is to enjoy this.My only complaints would be that there really isnt much of a nightlife after the theater/shows are over at about 11pm and that it is insane trying to get a beach hut and chairs. Maybe there wasnt alot of nightlife bacause everyone had to get up so early. I was up every morning of my vacation at 5:30 am to get a spot on the beach. The first day we were there we didnt realize exactly how early you had to get up for this and ended up just laying on our towels on the beach with no hut, which I normally wouldnt complain about but the sun was so hot that we both got burnt pretty badly and neither of us burn easily. So if we didnt get a spot on the beach in the morning we found something else to do off the beach during the day. The safari excursion was fantastic and there is some shopping up the road.All in all we had a wonderful time and would not hesitate to return to or recommend this resort. It was fantastic!If you have any questions I would be happy to answer them by email.OntarioCanada

<Content>Good, but could be better Stayed at the EdenH from April 5th - 12th. Arrived early, around 9:45 to the resort. Upon arriving, upgraded to the pink bracelets because we were on vacation and wanted to drink great drinks. We expected a fruit tray, rum, etc. upon entering the room, only to find out later that you only get the full Pink Bracelet deal if you book with your travel agent. At that point it was too late, so we just enjoyed the premium liquor and got it for all our friends as well. We were shown right to our room, while some of our friends had to wait until 3 or so. No big deal. The beach is amazing. White sand, quite clear considering the surf. Seaweed is raked up every morning and taken away. The chair issue was ok - we are early risers so it was no big deal. We lounged one day by the pool, and it was great too. We had no problems finding chairs by the pool. We did notice many people towel reserving chairs by the beach, and those chairs sat empty the ENTIRE day. They should have a ticket system - you get a ticket and place it on the chair with the towels. If you are not back in an hour, bye bye chair. That would be fair. We saw some people dumping belongings off of chairs, and saw the security guards taking towels from chairs which weren't occupied within an hour. We walked up and down both sides of the beach. Watch out for the beach vultures - they will try to drag you in to their shops. Be ready to barter if you go. The food was amazing. We mostly ate at the buffet, the beach grill and tried 3 of the restaurants. The hibachi is hard to get into, so be prepared to wait in line if you really want it. The beeper system was fine for us, but we saw a lot of nasty people who were very upset at not getting seated for supper. They ended up in the buffet. The restaurants were ambient, but quite small. The food was good, fast and service was fine. We and our friends did have some issues - we had a terrible sewer smell in our room for the last three days that seemed to come in through the air conditioning. They came to try to fix it, but we just ended up turning off the air conditioning. Our friends had a flood through the light fixture in their bathroom. They called maintenance and they said they would fix it tomorrow. I guess electrocution isn't high on their emergency list! The same friends also got eaten alive by something in their bed. They were on the 3rd floor with no mosquitoes, so upon returning home their dr thought it likely bedbugs. Something that should be further investigated. The rooms were cleaned well, and we never saw the cleaner or the bar restocker the entire trip. Everything was just always done when we returned. Our ground floor room had a jacuzzi on the deck, but the plug was missing. We Borrowed one from another jacuzzi. We enjoyed our bath with the security guard walking by. ;)I was a bit surprised that the kids pretty much have free range here - bars and all. Don't be surprised to see a 7 year old shooting pool in the sports bar at 10 pm. I was! Over all it was good for us, but I can totally understand the negative reviews. The resort seemed to have some building issues - one area had plaster falling off the roof, lots of broken tiles, burned out lights, things like that. Mostly cosmetic, but not what you expect from a 5 star resort. We heard guests yelling at the front desk staff as we were checking in about how bad the place was. We found the staff very nice, fluent and entertaining. Everyone smiles and says Ola! or Buenos noches!  I would rate EdenH a 7.5/10.

<Content>Great Vacation!! I just returned from this hotel on sunday April 20th. I went to Punta Cana with my best friend, we are both 30 years old. We have been to this island four times before. I was also very nervous about going to his resort after reading so many bad reviews. When we arrived at the hotel just past noon hour, the front desk staff said our room would not be ready till after 3pm, they were very friendly and spoke english very well. We went back to the front desk around 2pm and asked if also we could get a room with a pool view, and at that time they said they would give us an upgrade room at no extra charge. We had an amazing room on the first floor looking right at the pools (2161) we were given the (Pink Bracelet) room at no extra charge. Our bathroom was closed in with 2 sinks. We only booked the green bracelet.Our room was extremely clean, and I was please not to have the open wall into the bathroom. The mosquitos were bad on our balcony, you will need bug spray if you plan to sit out at night. We also had a few in the room, but I called the front desk and a large can of spray was sent to our room. Food: We ate at the buffet everyday for breakfast  dinner, the food was good, just never hot enough, but an excellent selection of fruits, breads, sweets. You will never go hungry, there is so vmuch to chose from. I always enjoy pasta and pizza, and that was also great. The meat was the best I have ever had before.Beach: The beach was beautiful....the water was so warm. The chair issue on the beach is just that an issue. More chairs had arrived as we were there. The resort is doing everything they can to get this issue solved. Just relax...lay on the beach if you have too!! Don't put a towel on a chair if you do not plan to be there for the day!! I saw so many people reserve a chair in the morning and did not come to the beach till later in the day. These kind of peolpe are the ones making this such a problem!! It is also not fair to reserve chairs in more than one place, pick one spot pool or beach!! I was very happy.. I put a towel out on a chair every morning at 6:30am, but I was back laying on it by 7:30am. Just respect each other and do not be so selfish!! this is not the employee's fault, it's the peolpe travelling!! Pool: Amazing!! We mostly stayed at the smaller VIP pool, it was great!!. There are chairs built into the pool, we loved that!! Please also remember to put your garbag in the can, don't leave it around for others to pick it up!! The staff are so busy already with other things, don't be a pig!!Bars: Great... the roof top bar is so pretty, you must go!! Otherwise we had a great vacation, I will be planning to return soon. The service we had was outstanding, just treat the staff kindly, they are doing there best!! For all those people who just put the resort down....just think how luckly you really are to be able to travel, when most of that staff would be luckly to get one day off in the month!! Go with an open mind, just represent canada in the highest manner!! we are very luckly and blessed peole!! Have the best vaction, enjoy your time because it goes so fast!! Have Fun.

<Content>Was pleasantly surprised You really have to read these reviews with a grain of salt. Obviously you can't please everyone. I was unsure what to expect after reading these. We had booked in Oct'07 and went Apr 5-12. Our plane was delayed 8 hours so we got to the resort at 5:30 a.m. and found that they did not have a room for us until later that day. Us and the couple we were with. Great way to start! They sent a cab for us and we went next door to the Barcelo Dominican. We just showered and ate breakfast and went back to the Edenh. We were not impressed with the Barcelo, so we were glad we weren't staying there. For the inconvenience they upgraded us to VIP (pink bracelet). We got a room with a view of the beaches and the ocean, best view I have ever had. There were 2 private (VIP) pools and bars so we went there everyday as there were never beach chairs. Keep in mind that the only thing separating the pool from the beach was a small berm. We could still enjoy the view of the ocean and get the breeze off the water. We just didn't get the sand. We were have stayed in Cuba in the past the pools were no where near the water so you had one or the other and usually at the pools it was so hot you couldn't stand it. We really enjoyed the pool area, they also had their own swim up bars. The restaurants were great. We went to the Shore Grill and had the best tenderloin that I have ever had. The portions are small, like you would get at an expensive restaurant at home, but the food was great. We went to the Italian and found it good (not really into genuine Italian food) and the night of my husbands we went to the Asian and had a fantastic meal and they brought him a birthday cake that was also really good. Again the portions were small, but our server told us to order more than one entree if we wanted so some of us did. With VIP you got premium liquors (our brands). The drinks were great. We had mostly Miami Vice (strawberry daquiri and pina colada mixed together) They had 24 hr. room service which we used one night. Really quick and good food. The rooms were very nice. The open bathroom concept didn't bother us. We liked it. The shower and toilet are separately glassed in w/frosted glass so you couldn't see through them anyway. We found the buffet really good. For breakfast I would go to the omelet bar and my husband would make our toast. We had no complaints at all about food. We went on the Tropical Storm excursion. $85 each. The boat was all french (one of us were bilingual) so we got the condensed version of everything. Disappointed with the day. Wished we had gone on a different one. The little markets along the beach were great. We got some really good deals. They just want to make the sale. There was a good open restaurant at the beach. French fries, chicken, hamburger, hotdogs, salad, rolls, nachos, etc. We ate there everyday. One night they had supper on the beach. It was the nicest thing. We couldn't believe all the preparation that went into that. Seating for 600 people and again, the food was fantastic. You have to remember that some people aren't happy until they have something to complain about. Maybe if you are used to going to Sandals or similar, you would find this resort inferior but I haven't, and I loved this place. It was hard to believe that it just opened in Jan'08. The landscaping was beautiful. Overall I would definitely return. I'm sure that it will be more expensive next year, we paid $2422. total for two. This was also our first time in Punta Cana and the beach sand was beautiful. I would have nothing negative to say about this place even though they had overbooked, but they more than compensated us for that.

<Content>The rumors are true. Our group of 10 realized upon check-in that most of the reviews were true. We decided to laugh about it  make jokes  had a blast comparing notes!! EdenH has potential, but between the major language barrier, lack of chairs and needing to work out the kinks... it needs a few more years to get going. The rooms are new  nice... even with the strange open bathroom area. We stayed on the fourth floor  did not see a single mosquito. It's not awful, but if you expect the Ritz Carlton's first class accomodations, you better not stay here. If you want to party, it will be just fine. Absolutely DO NOT order a margarita anywhere on the resort, get the Hummingbird!! Delicious!!

<Content>Had Fun Anyway! You will have a great time at EdenH if you have a good attitude. This hotel is not without its problems.At first glance this hotel is beautiful. But it is obvious that the place was thrown together to get it open. Everywhere you look there are signs of this - (doesn't help that my husband is a carpenter and contractor). One example - my friend opened the lobby door and the handle came off in his hand. Another - my husband pushed a button in the elevator and it came out of it's slot and dangled by its wires. We saw exposed electrical wires in the plaza. There were also 2 inch expansion joints in the tiles in the plaza that hadn't been filled. So many accidents waiting to happen! I could go on and on. Biggest problem for me was beach chairs. I love the beach which is why I love Punta Cana. But there's no way this 57 year old is laying on a beach towel - I'd never get up!! (Though I did have to do that the first day as we arrived at the hotel at 11AM and there wasn't an empty chair in sight)  I slept horribly worrying about getting up early enough to get a chair in the shade. I noticed that people were up earlier and earlier as the week wore on. (Before six and even before 5). On my last day, I couldn't sleep so for a joke I went down to the beach at 4:20AM. There were already several people lying on beach chairs reserving their spots and that was just in the vicinity I looked. It was crazy.Service was sporadic. I've been to Riu's and Iberostars where service was impeccable. Part of the problem is that they don't have enough servers. It was difficult getting coffee in the morning. Only one server for a huge dining room. Most days we just gave up. A self service beverage bar on the buffet would alleviate this problem.The food was okay. I didn't eat at the dinner buffet, only at the ala cartes. As most people stated the Hibachi meal at the Asian is the best. Everything is fresh - chicken, shrimp and beef with fresh veggies and fried rice. At most restaurants they didn't have at least one or two items on the menu. Surf and turf was not available at the America which was a disappointment.Drinks seemed watered down. I felt like I drank a lot of calories without much punch. That was okay. I don't need to get a buzz to have a good time.We were in paradise, in a country where the people are warm and friendly, the beach is one of the most beautiful in the Caribbean and we met some great friends. Can't complain about that. I just know that when I go back to PC, it will not be to the EdenH.

<Content>Edenh Real Arena: I love this place! First off, let me just say that the poor reviews are more than likelyfrom people who had quite the odd experience, and that you can't please everyone when they have one vision that they expect from the resort they are staying at. Now, I mean this place is brand new for one, and it is sparkling beautiful. Some of the rooms have an open bathroom area with a jacuzzi that you could hop out of into your bed, and people have complained about it, but if you are not using the jacuzzi and dont want the other guests with you to see you naked just put up a blind or sheet....it was ideally built for lovers to get a way and relax in a romanticset up. Anyway, now onto the room design: As for the edenh it is very well constructed and is built of very solid material. A lot of solid quality wood furnishing and marble tile outlines this entire resort. The bedroom has a mini fridge and the maids do an excellent job of cleaning...Im mean a mr clean type of clean. The bedrooms are not lined with carpet, so they mop up the place, change the beds which were very nice and comfy and the pillows were nice, big and fat. ......the next stop after the room was to grab a little bite to eat after we arrived....and man o man! All the food at the edenh rocks! The buffet is absolutely amazing...lots of fish, shrimp, seafood, plantain, it really bringsyou the taste of the caribbean. ..The staff are excellent...so I don'tunderstand why there are reports of the service being poor, I've found the staff very helpful. Isidoro and Osiris are in charge of the buffet and they deserve their kudos. The restaurant's are also excellent, and I could not get enough of the broiled lobster from the bar and grill.The resort does not have cheap drinks at all, rather they have a very good selection depending on the colour wrist band you have, I had a green wrist band and was not complaining about a thing. .............HowAbout the beach???? The beach was gorgeous. The weather was about 29-30 degrees celcius through out our week stay, and the white sand was beautiful....the aqua salt water was oh so nice. I ended up on the beach everyday. They had quite a few beach chairs...and it seems some people were complaining that there were not enough chairs, but the problem is the lazy [--] just sat on the beach chair getting a tan and holding them for their friends who aren't even going to use them, and then you have complaints generated. As for the live shows, the edenh put on great acts, from a circus, to a jazz night, and even one night some fashion models were on the scene...yes its a beautiful place! The Staff in the lobby bar are also very great...Gregory, Josefina, or Julio will mix u up a fabulous drink! And to top it off the President of the Dominican Republic was speaking at the edenh on one of the nights we were there down at thebeach...what else is there to say....definitely a 5 star stay...maybe 5 and a half star.

<Content>Good and Bad Stayed at EdenH 4/5 - 4/12The hotel is very nice. The chair problem is real and it stinks! Instead of getting a ton of cheap beach chairs, they are waiting for more of the very nice/expensive ones they have. We tried to make the most of it, but it's tough laying on the ground for a long time (for me anyways, 35 with some back problems.)Our room was very nice and very clean. We upgraded for an ocean view room (cost like $400.) We had an awesome balcony with great views. The bathroom was open (the toilet and shower in stalls with cloudy glass doors) and the jacuzzi separated the bathroom from the bedroom. I was with my husband (been together for 15 years) so it wasn't a problem for us. If you are staying with someone that you don't want to see you naked, make sure you get a room with a private bathroom.Some of the staff was very nice. (Luis at Guest Services) Some were very rude (girls in the giftshop).Most staff spoke some english. They are learning. This was an issue for me, but shame on me for not learning any spanish before I went.If you smoke, you'll be in smokers paradise, you can smoke almost anywhere and they don't make you feel bad about it. I recently quit, so it wasn't paradise for me, but I was with 3 smokers and it was nice that they didn't have to keep leaving to smoke. With my new sense of hightened smell, I have to say that the elevators stunk! I don't know what it was, but it was awful!Felt a bit isolated and trapped in the resort. Not the kind of place where you can walk to town, or walk to anything. My #1 advice for anyone heading to EdenH is bring something to lay on, a float would be ideal, I would of paid $50 for one, or for a small cheap beach chair.I think EdenH will continue to improve. I tried real hard not to crap in my own corner and managed to have a nice time.**One thing that really harshed my mellow - my Sister-in-Law and her husband came down on Monday (4/14) when they arrived they were told no rooms were left and they would have to go to another hotel for one night. While we were standing in the lobby complaining about this, another couple checked in and were given a choice on which room they would like! Apparently there was a bump list and my S-i-L was first on the list. It worked out ok because the other hotel they stayed at was much nicer (it was the Majestic.)Bring plenty of sunblock, a small tube cost $21 in the store (the one with the rude girls.)

<Content>Edenh - just ok, not great - 3 out of 5 We stayed at the Edenh April 5th-12th - green bracelet. First impressions - we weren't impressed with the closed in lobby - we both prefer the more traditional open concept / outdoor feel of most resorts. The lobby had the feel of an urban hotel, not a caribean resort. It's not a big deal because we spent very little time there - just an observation.The room we had was incredible - 4th floor in building 1 facing off the resort. We overlooked a row of rental units for some of the locals and the back of a small resort. We also had a partial view of the beach and ocean as we were in an end unit of one of the buildings. Inside - the room was what has been described before with the large opening to the bathroom. Neither of us found the bed comfortable at all - very firm for our liking... however we found the pillows very comfortable. The housekeeping time varied day to day, but it was always done before 4pm. The fridge was re-stocked daily fairly early in the day - usually by 10am.The food was good in the buffet every day - not a huge variety, but that made it better in our opinion. We ate at two of the four a la cartes, Italian and romantic - both meals were good - not great. The lighting in all the restaurants was very bright and there wasn't much atmosphere. The line up for the Japanese hibatchi was crazy and we did not even bother putting our names on the list and we ate late every night. We did order room service one night and it was very prompt.The beach was fantastic, beautiful white sand. I saw a little evidence of garbage on the beach, but that was because it was left by inconsiderate guests not willing to take it with them when they left their chairs. The resort NEEDS to place garbage cans along the beach at various places to eliminate this problem. We walked for miles in each direction. The Edenh beach is the best along the strip.The pools were nice, cool and refreshing.We enjoyed most of our days walking the beach or laying by the pool so we got most of our drinks from the pool/swim up bar. The service was ok at best - not very friendly whether you tipped or not. I didn't notice any discrimination between bracelet colours - everyone was treated the same... poorly. The sports bar was fairly quiet at night and the three times we went to the Tahntra bar it was virtually empty. The lobby bar occasionally had people in it, but it is completely closed in and the cigarette/cigar smoke was too much for me to deal with on a couple of occassions and I'm very tolerant of that kind of thing. Again - service was inconsistent and not friendly regardless of band colour or amount tipped.Chair situation - as bad as everyone says. Be up around 6am to get a chair on the beach and around 7am to get a good chair by the pool. No wonder everyone is in bed by 10pm and there's no nightlife in the bars, people are too tired from being up when the sun rises. The resort needs to get more chairs, or enforce the rules they have put in place - plain and simple. We often saw security look the other way when people were reserving multiple chairs and leaving to go back to bed, or dragging pool chairs to the beach because there were none available at 7am.Overall - we had a good time because we made the best of our situation. We met some great people from Canada and the US. We had great weather - lots of beer and nice cocktails. The food was good and the staff was usually nice. We would not go back to this resort - even with the introductory price that we got because there are too many other resorts and countries to visit where I don't think we would have to deal with the hassles we experienced at the Edenh. 3 out of 5.

<Content>GREAT!!!!! i can't believe i am still hearing people complain about this resort. i went there after hearing all these bad reviews expecting this place to be mediocre at best. i was pleasantly surprised. the only problem was the beach chair situation, but i laid on a towel which was fine with me until some chairs freed up. and i always got a chair by either of the pools. i actually always got chairs for myself and the other three of us who were there. besides that, the food was good, the staff were great, the room was great, i got drunk every night (the tantra bar is fantastic) and had a great time everyday i was there. hopefully get a chance to go back soon, this time for two weeks.

<Content>Just Not My Style We arrived at the hotel after a short drive from the airport and checked in at the VIP lounge. Check in was efficient but our 鈥渞equested鈥?room was not ready. We had emailed the resort asking for a king size bed and an upper floor with a nice view. We went back to the lobby and our room was ready. A porter helped us with the luggage but we walked 鈥?no tram was available. Our Concierge room was in building # 2 on the 3rd floor. We had 2 double beds not the king we requested and our view was of the black fence and the vacant lot. We were given 2 regular brown beach towels and 2 tiny little robes (kid's robes?). We had quite a laugh modelling them. NO RUM. NO FRUIT PLATE. We contacted the VIP services who referred us to the front desk supervisor. She said the hotel was at capacity and they couldn鈥檛 switch our room until the next day. The porter told us they were sending people to other hotels. The next day we were moved to building # 1, again on the 3rd floor. This room had a king bed and a beautiful view of the pool areas and the ocean. Regular adult size robes in the closet and slippers. We had to call and ask for our rum and it arrived later in the week. Here is my opinion of the various aspects of this resort and our experience.Lobby 鈥?closed in. You have to enter by narrow glass doors. There is no open, airy feeling like other Caribbean and Mexican resort lobbies. Unwelcoming. Business like.Elevators - 2 out of service while we were there and the ones that worked had a terrible odor. My husband thought there might be stagnant water in the sump at the bottom of the shafts. We did see staff washing floors and pushing the waste water under the elevator as well as into the fountains in the passage ways - accounting for the soap suds billowing out of the little ponds.Room 鈥?spacious, good TV, good bathroom amenities, furniture 鈥?cheap Holiday Inn style, comfortable bed with duvet and good pillows, large balcony with jetted bathtub. The glass door to the toilet didn鈥檛 fit right and caught on the floor all the time (lucky it didn't break) Our toilet flushed about every other time. We constantly had to call Maintenance to come and fix it. Luckily they responded quite quickly each time but overall it was annoying. The phone in the room didn鈥檛 work at all 鈥?just hisses and clicks. The phone in the bathroom did work but fell off the wall the second day. The power went off daily a few times and had to be reset. The little power module by the door fell off the wall as well. The safe worked well. No leaks in the room. Several times we had a sewer smell in the room. Mosquitos 鈥?We killed a lot of mosquitos in the first room we were in but had none in the second. My husband noticed a lot of mosquitos by the pool early in the day and he used Deet. Neither of us were bitten.Pools 鈥?We used the VIP pool by building number 1 for the most part. The greenish look to the water takes some getting use to but overall the pools were clean and nice to use. There is a bar with a swim up section here but the swim up area was rarely staffed. If you waved and hollered, sometimes a bartender would take your order. The umbrellas around the pool were the inexpensive type and many were broken. A nice staff member went back and forth to the VIP pool trying to find umbrellas that worked. Bar Service 鈥?Bar service was fair to good at the VIP pool. They often ran out of things (like limes). Air Transat Holidays brochure says Butler Service at the private pool but I think this was a misunderstanding. The card we received with our welcome package that listed the VIP services stated bar service not Butler service. In other words, get up and get your own drinks. No big deal. At the beginning of the week they had Miller Lite in bottles then Bud Lite then only Presidente and Bohemia. There was no Corona. Mixed drinks were hit and miss. The Margaritas were awful and no taste of Tequila at all. One of my G  T's tasted like chemicals. We stuck with beer, rum and coke and sometimes champagne. The tropical drinks were just too sweet.Lobby Bar 鈥?We did not like the mood or atmosphere at this bar. Usually on holiday we like to sit and enjoy a pre dinner cocktail in the lobby bar. This one was so unwelcoming with no ambience that we stayed away. A big room 鈥?no fresh air, smoky and lit like a beer hall with uncomfortable chairs and tables that you can鈥檛 get your knees under. The d茅cor is terrible. Lurid blues and oranges with fabrics from the 60鈥檚. Also we found it very difficult to get service here. The bartenders are very busy and usually ignored us for long periods. Some people got served twice before we got served once. The Tahntra Bar is much nicer and should have been open all evening. but it was very busy also and long waits to get a drink. We did not go into the sports bar but they served a nice little snack there in the evenings 鈥?mini burgers. The VIP lounge was the best place to hang out and wait for dinner. Good drinks and internet. TV. Quiet. We did not enjoy the house wines at this resort.Restaurants 鈥?The buffet area suffers from the same horrible d茅cor as the rest of the public areas. It reminded me of a hospital cafeteria. At other resorts we have been to, they try to create some ambience in the evening by lowering the lights, putting candles on the tables etc but not here. The food was so 鈥?so. Their breads and fresh fruits are very good. They ran out of bacon by mid week and didn鈥檛 get any more. Champagne was available at breakfast one day while we were there otherwise it was blood marys. Service was spotty especially at breakfast. A fellow went around calling Coffee Coffee all the time but ignored you when you waved. He seemed to do more calling than pouring. We ate at 4 a la cartes 鈥?The Asian (fair for hibachi table, really good for sushi); People should know that not every chef here does a theatrical presentation. Our chef was efficient but did not do any tricks or humour to the disappointment of the children at our table. We found the chicken and beef dry and overcooked but the shrimp and rice and soup were good. Italian (good pasta and excellent carpaccio, terrible bread basket with soggy breadsticks and ? left over pizza cubes, no parmesan cheese,), The Shore Grill (tough steak and the surf and turf has been scratched off the menu). The Gourmet (pretty good food but not served hot 鈥?everything luke warm). Service at the a la cartes was good and the Sommelier was very good. The absolute worst meal was the in room lobster dinner. The lobster is taken out of the shell, cooked and placed back in the shell and was covered with a large portion of grossly over salted cream sauce alongside some extremely salty mashed potatoes and a soggy slice of carrot. The appetizer was unidentifiable 鈥?some type of thinly sliced salmon and surimi roll 鈥?we think. Mostly inedible. The beach grill and the barbeque were good for lunch. Excellent chicken and burgers and fries. I never seemed to catch the ice cream machine in working order so I did not taste any. One evening they served dinner at the beach and closed the buffet and 2 of the a la cartes. This created chaos and lots of shouting at the 2 open restaurants. The best food we ate on our vacation was on the plane!Staff 鈥?Our housekeeping was very good. No complaints at all. Lots of towels. Room made up before noon usually. The turn down service was also good. We did get a pair of sunglasses taken from the room the last night we were there. Our bad 鈥?shouldn鈥檛 have left them out but I guess we had gotten complacent. Bar staff seemed indifferent and tipping did not seem to affect them at all. They took the tips but did not give any better service in return. We had no problems with the language barrier. We thought the staff was doing really well with their English. I thought the restaurant manager was very rude to the guests and staff alike and I witnessed some very unprofessional behaviour on his part.Music 鈥?A few months ago people were complaining about how quiet this resort was. Not the case now. At the VIP pool we had music blasting from the bar competing with music from the speakers on the grounds (fake boulders) competing with music coming over from the main pool. And it鈥檚 the same songs over and over. Hardly elegant. Beach - nice white sand, not a huge beach. EdenH is a very narrow/shot gun property so the available beach is crowded with palapas and chairs. The water is nice and warm, sandy bottom but not clear. It is constantly being churned up by wind and full of chopped up weeds (from boats). This beach is too frantic for my tastes, helicopters, light planes, parasailing, hobie cats, party boats going by several times a day. We saw a couple of weddings on the beach and one couple had just finished their vows when the Tropical Storm boat went by blasting In The Navy by the village people. Chairs 鈥?Getting chairs was a major problem. We got up at 6.00 or so to get 2 chairs. We would have preferred to sleep in. By 7.00 all the chairs were gone. In contrast to other people鈥檚 reviews, we did not see a lot of chairs being reserved but not used 鈥?some but not a lot. This resort was full and there simply were not enough chairs. This was at both the pools and the beach. We found the plastic rattan lounges very uncomfortable and they are in various states of disrepair. Excursions and Entertainment 鈥?we went on the Marinarium trip. It only took 陆 day by bus and then catamaran and we snorkelled with the mantas and nurse sharks and visted the natural pool. Other than the sharks and rays in the pens there was very little to see 鈥?the reefs are pretty well dead here. Still it was a fun trip and I would recommend it. The evening shows at the resort are pretty good. They need more tables and chairs in the courtyard when they hold shows here. The casino was small but fun. Didn't see any big wins.The Good: Sushi Bar (No waiting and Angelo the sushi chef was great), Comfortable bed and pillows. Jacuzzi tub on the balcony 鈥?we used this a lot. Spacious room with a big balcony and nice view, The VIP breakfast 鈥?nice and quiet with good service (Eddy was good) - limited menu. The pool areas are nicely laid out and very clean. The fruit lady on the beach was a nice touch and the lunchtime beach grill served good food but had long lineups. The VIP lounge 鈥?very friendly staff and nice snacks. The weather 鈥?warm and sunny, quite breezy sometimes. Not a drop of rain. The Fireworks display from another hotel - woke us up but so worth it.The Bad: Lack of chairs. We walked down past other resorts and there seemed to be lots of spare chairs on the beaches. Bad lobby bar concept. Loud, competing music systems, Dead plants and palm trees. Bad decor and no ambience in all the public areas. The Air Transat rep 鈥?unhelpful and rude. The reservation system or lack thereof for a la carte dining. A terrible system and I do not see why they persist with it. Stressful for guests and staff. We saw guests yelling and also the restaurant manager being extremely rude to guests (different occasions).Overall this resort does not have the atmosphere we enjoy in a Caribbean resort. It was also too competitive (for chairs, dining, drinks etc). The resort was very full and they do not have the resources to make for a comfortable stay. We enjoyed the sun and the sea and got a nice tan but we would not go back to this hotel. I had hoped for a classy - elegant type of resort but it was crass, noisy and over-crowded. Its just not our style at all.

<Content>The weather was Beautiful We were at this hotel April 6-13. Most of what you read is true. I wonder if the owners read the reviews? This hotel has half the facilities it needs to service the amount of guests it holds. You do not need a business degree to see that 200 beach chairs and twice the wait staff would help guests overlook the other deficiencies. The lack of facilities does not make for a relaxing holiday. At the beach by 06:30 to get a beach chair. Always 10-15 people in line for an omelet. Lunch at the beach 15-20 people in line for the grill. Most resorts take reservations for diner. Once again its line up and wait.The staff are very friendly but you can see that they are frustrated.There are too many other better hotels to go to. The eadnH was not planned properly to service the amount of people it holds.Yes there are mosquitoes (killed 30 in one day). Had to down grade rooms to get off the main floor then there was no problem.The weather was beautiful.

<Content>EDEN "H" stands for hell real arena Just returned from our trip to Punta Cana EDENH REAL Arena. The place is beautiful the weather is fantastic. It was in the 80's for the entire week. Upon a closer look though things in our room were not brought for two days including basics, like stocking the mini bar, robes, fruit tray which is really thinly sliced melon no basket and our room was on the second floor we paid the extra for the upgrade which if you really are willing to take a chance on this place please save your money. The people I understand are native but they do not understand english at all. The room for being a new establishment was already pretty dirty, burned out light bulbs, broken hose to the hot tub, the glass doors don't close to the shower and the very unprivate toilet, 2 inch gap under door so stick towels in there other wise you will have a million bites in the morning, there is no bowling alley, the casino has 25 slot machines and a couple of tables for card games, the sports bar could hold maybe 50 people, the restraunts are disastrous, the food loked like what ever they scrapped off the plates from the night before, don't order a drink pool side or at your dinner table they never return to bring it to you. Men must wear pants yes pants when it is near 90 to ALL the restraunts except the buffet. Another added bonus is the fact that you must get down to the pool by 7:00 a.m. to even attempt to get a chair. There is one bartender for the whole swim up bar. and approx 4 for the entire out door area including all of the beach. The lunch at the pool side grill was the same thing everyday burgers the were either burnt or raw, hot dogs that looked like they hadn't even been warmed and my personal favorite the broccoli filled with worms. This was the worst food ever they have no sanitisation or health codes in place that is obvious I got food poisoning by day three and still have not fully recovered. The entertainment starts at 9:45 p.m. that is about what time you can get into one of the restraunts you waited for 3 hours to get into. If you don't tip everyone all the time you get no service what so ever this is all inclusive nightmare. We always tip but not when they treat you like you have to that is not the principle behind all inclusive. There seems to be no one in charge at this place and from every person from all over the world that we met they will never return nor recomend this place to anyone.

<Content>Perfect Honeymoon Our honeymoon was prefect. The hotel is amazing. The staff is friendly, the facilities were excellent, and the beach was beautiful.This is a new resort and so you have to expect some projects here and there but for the most part they were in one corner of the resort and were small. Laying sod and small repair work were the only things we noticed during our stay.The staff was absolutely amazing except for one female (hostess at the American Grill). I was amazed time and time again with the qaulity of service we received during our stay. We had our room cleaned daily and bar stocked with what we desired. Room service was spectacular. We ordered at all hours and got our food immediately. Julio A went far beyond what we expected when he delivered food/drinks to our room in the middle of the night. The staff seems to genuinely care about their guest and do whatever it takes to please them.The resort has several pools but the main pool is the best. There are activities every afternoon and evening shows. On our last night they had a beach party that was FANTASTIC. We couldn't believe the amount of work put into this event. That night I was completely amazed by the staff. I would highly recommend participating in the beach party if you get the chance. The beach was warm and cleaned twice a day. Snorkeling is a little disappointing since there isn't a lot to see. The water sports are fun and easily accessible. Another down fall- you must get up before 8am to get chairs on the beach. Although some believe they need more chairs I believe guest need to stop claiming chairs at the beach and pool. There would be plenty for everyone if people stop claiming at both places. Another tip- you can remove items off chairs if they are unused for an hour. Staff is a little uncomfortable taking things off chairs but you can if it has not been used within an hour.We didn't take the option of upgrading and we were happy with our decision as the benefits don't seem to out weigh the cost. If you tip then you receive the same accommodations.The food was good- not great. I recommend any Dominican buffets since they know how to cook that food the best. Again I must say that room service was amazing.When facing the beach do not go to the shops to the left. They will grab you and not let you leave. One guest admitted she bought something just so she could leave. I recommend the shops to the right but remember to negotiate. As a rule don't pay more the half of the 1st price given.As many have stated, the rooms are a little weird. The hole in the wall between the room and the bathroom made it a little uncomfortable. However, it is set up that way so you can lay in the tub and watch TV.Overall we could not have asked for a better honeymoon. We were super impressed and happy with our experience.

<Content>Fair Review We stayed at EdenH from April 7-14. Overall the resort is beautiful, very clean, staff is friendly  I honestly don't know what resort the people who have been complaining stayed at. Most of the negative reviews are inaccurate. However, there are some issues that the guests themselves have been the cause of, but feel the need to blame the resort. If you are one of those complainers, stop reading right now 'cause you are about to be put in your place.1. LANGUAGE BARRIER: we are visiting a Spanish speaking country. Of course they speak Spanish. Do you expect people to speak English when visiting Canada or US? There is more than one official language in Canada  the no. 1 spoken language in the US is Spanish, so what is everyone complaining about? The vast majority of the employees that we came into contact with were well spoken in English. The only exceptions were the maids  the beach groomers. They are not frontline staff, go find someone who is.2. BRACELET COLORS: We were yellows  found absolutely no didffirence between yellow, green, and pink. Keep in mind that yellow  pinks paid more for a package that included perks that the greens didn't. If you were green  wanted the perks, fork over the extra cash the same as we did.3. LACK OF GARBAGE CANS: There was a lack of garbage cans at the resort. But what do you do in your own country when you can't find a garbage can? Do you just dump it on the ground or leave it on the beach? No, you don't. You look for a proper place to dispose of your garbage. So what makes you think that you shouldn't dispose of your garbage properly when you are a guest in another country.4. BEING RUDE TO STAFF MEMBERS: Several times I saw guests being ignorant to staff members. Sometimes over silly little things such as a drink that wasn't strong enough. Order a new drink if you don't like the first one. Paying for a vacation at a resort does not give you the right to treat someone like crap. The employees are people with feelings too  we do not have the right to humiliate them.Now for the good things  the things that I can understand people complaining about:1. FOOD: We found the temperature to be always good. Our problem was with the lack of selection at the supper buffet. But let me make it clear - we didn't go hungry. We ate what was there  we enjoyed it, but we would have liked to see more options. As for the a la carte restaurants, we only went to the steak house  Italian. Both were very good  we didn't even have to wait. We showed up at 6:30  our party of 4 was seated immediately. The beach grill was the same every day, but no complaint s. Breakfast was my favorite. Felix the omlette chef is wonderful. Tell him your name  he will never forget it.2. MUSIC: Many people complained earlier about the lack of Latin music. I can understand that. You are on vacation, you want the tropical atmosphere. The resort has installed speakers that look like rocks throughout the resort  plays music all day. At the beach there is a dj that sets up about 10am, but for the first hour all he plays is Barry Manilow's Mandy over  over again. A real downer.3. ENTERTAINMENT: The Thursday night beach party was amazing. It was the best beach party that I have ever been to in the Caribbean. Hats off to those guys. They set up the evening buffet on the beach, there was dancing, a live band... wonderful evening. Don't miss it.4. ROOMS: No complaints, very nice, comfortable bed, clean. To be frank, I have been to several resorts  this one had the nicest rooms.5. BEACH CHAIRS: They aren't as big a problem as we expected, but are a problem. If you want a chair under a hut, be prepared to get up at 5:30. A chair in the sun by 7:00. The catch is you cannot leave your things on the chairs, you must stay with them or security will confiscate them. If they take your towels, you must pay $20/towel prior to check out. We saw security taking towels left, right  center. We are early risers, so this wasn't a problem for us. Our problem was going to the bar, or a short swim  coming back to find our chairs missing. People would dump your stuff off  take your chairs. We had someone take my husband's chair while I was asleep on mine  he had gone for a drink!! We also had a problem with people saving chairs at the pool  beach. Now for the biggie:BROKEN GLASS ON THE BEACH!!!!!!Everyday that we stayed at EdenH, we had to scan our little section of beach for broken glass  I don't mean a piece here  there. I mean full handfuls  we have the pics to prove it (they will be posted on April 16). The glass seemed to be consentrated on the left end of the beach - the side of the resort that borders the privately owned complex that is occupied by locals. I would suggest bringing liquid band-aid. I have contact NH Resorts with copies of the photos.Overall, we had an excellent stay  completely enjoyed ourselves. But we will not be returning to the EdenH because of the broken glass.PS - Tip Ramone  Rafael on the beach - they work hard cleaning up our mess  rarely get a thank you!

<Content>Very nice resort We just returned from Edenh on Sunday, April 13th. This is our 6th trip to the Dominican. We have previously stayed at the Riu Palace, The Riu Macao, Iberostar Bavaro and twice at the Iberostar Haciendis Dominicas which is in La Romana in the southern part.The Edenh is very comparable to these other resorts. Every one (except maybe the Bavaro, which is our favorite) have both good and not so good, but every single one are beautiful.The Edenh has a beautiful beach, location. The hotel is very nice but the feel is more Florida than the Carribean for the most part.I think it is probably the decor and music.The food is good. Like everything else, some dishes were excellent and some not so good, but like everyone else said, the Asian restaurant is the best. One thing we like a lot was the bottled water. Whenever you go up to the bar and ask for water, you get a large bottle instead of just a cup of water (which is what we received at all the other resorts).The rooms are nice and when we got there I expected to see a huge opening into the bathroom, but that was not the case.The opening is only at the top of the wall and is only a foot or two from the ceiling which was not bad at all. It lets the air circulate and helps keep the humidity down. The mirrors never fog up here. There is also a nice thick frosted glass door for both the toilet area and the shower.We maybe saw four mosquitos the whole time we were there.Not a problem. We were in room 1461. Very nice and came with two robes, two sets of slippers, toothbrush, toothpaste, comb, shower puff, bath salts, lotion, shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, soap, etc.By the way, we had green bracelets.If there were any problems at all, they were created by the guests.The chair issue....People saving WAY too may chairs and not using them all. Trying to save 3 chairs with one towel, etc.Not showing up for hours and hours after saving chairs.All chairs are gone on the beach by 7AM. We got up and were on the beach by 5:30 every day and watched the sun rise. That is not necessary though. Just get out there by 6:30. The chairs that go first are not the ones under the huts necessarily. There were plenty of huts left after 7 without chairs. The people go for the chairs closest to the sea, then move back.We only had two disturbances all week and were not the fault of the hotel.The first was on a Friday night when the hotel next door set off some fireworks at 11:45 PM that were so loud it woke everyone and it sounded like cannon blasts were going off right outside our door. Then the next night, there was a party going on until 3:30 AM. This was in a private complex right next door that our room happened to look out over. It was nice view because we looked at their pool but the party was way too loud and ended way too late.The Edenh also had a wonderful bbq on the beach on Thursday night with music, drinks and everything from roasted whole pigs to fried chicken. Very nice.Everything is very nice and clean.So go and have fun.

<Content>Worst experience in the Dom.Rep so far! We went to the Edehn from 26th March to 9th April.Our 4th trip to the Dominican, and the only bad experience... all the others were great!!I'm going to try to be short and to the point because I want to forget chair wars at dawn as soon as possible, and look forward to my next holiday which sure as hell won't be at the Edenh!Travelled with First Choice from England, and the whole trip was a complete cock up from start to finish. Won't bother including everything because others have already mentioned them.Felt like I needed another holiday after I got home.... nothing enjoyable about a holiday where you have to be up at 6.45am to get a parasol and sunbeds for a family of 4!! Sleeping in can't happen at the Edenh if you want shade for the day by the pool or on the beach!We paid a supplement for interconnecting rooms... we didnt get interconnecting rooms when we arrived.... we complained... we were told they didn't offer this option!Complained to our First Choice Rep... also expressed our concern about the sunbed situation... she reassured us chairs and parasols would arrive in the next day or so and she would get back to us about the room.The parasols didnt appear at all while we were there and most of the parasols that did exist were getting broken daily as they got blown over by the wind.Saw guests paying the chair maintenance men cash to actually get a parasol!Next evening we were told we had been allocated an interconnecting room.... packed up all our stuff, went to the room.... OH NO! A gaping hole in the ceiling and water dripping through onto the floor!Got taken to a second room... no air con working and the interconnecting doors jammed shut. We were all so tired we decided to take it anyway, at least we wouldnt get wet!Air con fixed pretty quickly at least :-) Doors were partially fixed.Speciality restaurants simply cannot cope with the volume of guests... people started queuing at 5pm to get seated. As this wasn't our idea of a pleasant holiday we didn't bother and chanced our luck coming by later, about 9pm, to see if there was any room. Although this meant we missed the theatre entertainmant every night, but we managed to get a table by 9.30pm most nights until the end of our holiday when the hotel was overbooked and it became hopeless.The buffet restaurant is ok, but a bit repetitive.By halfway through the holiday the chair wars situation was getting us down... the kids were spending afternoons in our room to stay out of the sun and my husband was tired from getting up at sunrise!We were green band guests and we had noticed that there was more room around the pink band pools (Paradise Club), they also seemed to have enough umbrellas and chairs and the 2 bars were quiet in comparison to the single green band bar by the pool.Bar service also seemed to be faster if you were a pink band guest... This is the first time we have seen this band segregation in an all-inclusive, and I must admit, I didnt much care for it! I dont see why you should be made to feel second class when you have paid good money for a holiday, and being a green band certainly made me feel that way once or twice.This was proved to us when towards the end of the holiday we got a phonecall from reception asking us if we would move rooms again.They informed us that the hotel was very overbooked for the following week and they didnt have enough rooms, they could fit 8 guests into our 2 interconnecting rooms. They offered us one of the rooms overlooking the sea at the front of the hotel which were for pink band guests. Reluctant to move rooms again we went to see the room, which turned out to be beautiful with a very large hot tub on the balcony and another jacuzzi in the bathroom... the downside was that there was only one bedroom and an adjoining lounge area with sliding doors between. My kids are teenagers and need full size beds to sleep in but we were assured they would give us comfortable beds for them in the lounge area.We agreed to move again on the condition they upgraded us to pink band guests, and provided some rum in the room for us as we were tired of having to walk up the the main bar by reception for a drink after the pool bar had closed at 6pm. We dont drink beer, and thats all they provided in the fridge along with coke and water which wasnt always replaced every day.Changing rooms turned out to be a good move and improved things for us a little bit.There was a definate difference to the way we were treated once we were upgraded to pink bands... we were always served promptly at the main bars, seemed to get seated in restaurants faster and were actually offered parasols before we had to ask. The pools areas were quieter and the bars much less busy. I must admit to feeling a little guilty for abandoning my fellow green banded guests as I watched them scrambling for beach chairs and parasols and packed in like sardines around the main pool.Unfortunately we still needed to get up quite early to get chairs and a parasol as the now fully booked hotel was bursting at the seams and there simply were not enough chairs by a long way.The final straw was on the day of departure when First Choice told us the wrong pick up time from reception. We waited in reception 3 hours but no bus arrived to collect us and we ended up having to make a mad dash for the airport by taxi, gripped with fear that we would miss our flight home and have to spend another few days at the Edenh.We really had enough of the place after 2 weeks.Must admit its the first time we have all wanted to go home by halfway through the holiday!!So, in a nutshell, the Edenh needs at least another 2 speciality restaurants, needs more chairs and parasols that dont get blown over and broken and they need to stop making green band guests feel second class.Last trip to the DR we stayed at The Riu Mambo and they could certainly teach the management at the Edenh a thing or two about how to run a great resort where guests leave feeling relaxed, happy and with warm memories :-)Good luck to all future guests at the Edenh Real.

<Content>give it some time and it will be great Let me start by saying there are many negative reviews for the Edenh Real, and we had some concerns going into this vacation. However, the key is to be very open-minded, especially since this is a new resort. We went with a group of 39 people for a wedding and the end result is pure satisfaction. I'll start with the positives.All of the food reviews were bang on. The reservation system for the A-la-carte restaurants was as everyone else has said...very challenging. That being said, there are enough amenities around that you will not go hungry. The Asian restaurant was by far one of the most enjoyable food experiences I've had in a long time. The staff was friendly and accomodating, even letting one of us go behind the grill to have pictures taken and to prentend to cook.  The Shore grill was out of Lobster, Sirloin, and some of the other appetizers, however as I said, there is enough selection that you will not go hungry. I found that ordering a medium steak is equal to rare, so be sure to order well done, if you like medium. The Italian restaurant was excellent, and I didn't have the opportunity to attend the Gourmet restaurant, however from what some of our group was saying, it was excellent. The Tantra bar was unique, complete with music, drinks, and even a swimming pool that you can view from the courtyard, so no skinny dipping! Some of the challenges we occured were with the beach chairs and the pool loungers. Unless you are willing to wake up at 5:45am and be to the beach or pool by 6:00, you may be out of luck. Many people would go to the beach early to reserve a chair for a few hours with a towel, only to find after an hour your towel had been taken by security. The music on the beach and around the pool was WAY TOO LOUD. Unless you enjoy non-stop calypso music playing at 1000 decibles, with the same songs on repeat, be prepared to bring an iPOD, or something else to distract you. Also, with every resort, the gift shop was extremely over priced. (35.00us for a bottle of lotion?) The layout of the resort was perfect... everything within a few minutes walk from your room. The lobby bar, tantra bar, sports bar, casino, and a-la-carte restaurants are located in the courtyard right outside the main lobby, making it very easy to find things. Luis, in the sports bar was great, and at the swim up bar, make sure to hear Alexis' donkey impression... way too funny! The beach and the pools were great, and despite everything everyone else has said about the staff, if you learn to work with them, and not against them, you will have no problems. Getting upset or angry will get you no where. Be courtious and they will reciprocate. Overall for the time being I will not go back, but give it one year of existance and this place will be paridise. Just don't book with Skyservice airlines.... unless you want to be charged for your luggage at the airport even when you're not over the weight limit.

<Content>Paradise We (4 adults) stayed at the Eden 3-22 through the 28.We found the place amazing. The staff is wonderful and the resort is clean.We were pinks, but we did not like our rooms they were along the back side facing the black fence and other resort. The smell was terrible. Sunday we moved to rooms on the floor facing the interior of the resort. It was our choice not to have the suites, just so that we could get some view of the ocean , and rooms side by side.Danny V and Robert at the VIP family bar was amazing. They were alot of fun and keep the activity level up. Very entertaining.The language barrier was fun, we learned alot from each other.I was surprised that as new as the resort is, that there is always fresh paint and replacing broken tiles being done, Alot ot upkeep at the time. The grounds were lush and in a few years, I can only imagine what it is going to look like.The chairs was still continued, but oh well, if they want to ruin their time looking and fighting over chairs, so be it. Not worth it for us. We were either in the pool, ocean or at the bar. And still got plenty of sun.Really miss the resort and wish I was still there. Do one should be disappointed when they returned.

<Content>watered down liquor eight of our family members went to eden h in punta cana from march 31 to the 7 th of april.the resort was beautiful,the scenery was awesome.the rooms were very clean and nice.its a perfect place for someone looking to relax.there was no entertainment for people who like to party.at 8:00pm the whole resort pretty much shuts down.the food was beautiful to look at but didnt taste very good.staff werent very lively and could barely speak english.one important thing you need to know before going is that THERE LIQUOR IS WATERED DOWN!!!!!!!!!,which explains why after 5 drinks i felt nothing,and this is coming from someone who is intoxicated of a one beer usually.how i know this is because one of our family members ordered staight drinks of vodka until he had enough to fill his quart bottle and brought it home and the whole bottle FROZE!!! beeing that this was an all inclusive trip i feel we have been short changed.

<Content>Travel Agent Just Returned from Edenh Travel Agent Just Returned from EdenH Arena RealStayed at property from April 5th - 12th.I am a travel agent and have stayed at over 30 differentAll Inclusive resorts, The Good - Beach is awesome, the pools are nice,food pretty good, average for a 5 star in Dominican Republic,The staff is hard working and as helpful as possible.The Bad - 1) This hotel still has some construction issues to deal with. Plumbing and electricial. We had three power outages while there. Plumbing from my jacuzzi tub leaked into the room below.Constantly saw small construction issues being done on the property and in the rooms.2) This hotel is at 100% occupancy, and the managment and dinner facilities cannot handle. Them system of getting dinner at any of the restaurants other than the buffet was a joke, Not once the entire week did I get a lounge chair at the beach or pool3) The evening entertainment was boringI think this resort needs another three months to work out management issues. If you can switch your hotel, without suffering major penalties, I would do so. If you cannot change, Make the best of it as I did. It was not a total loss, but I feel that for a little more money, I could have stayed at another property that I would have enjoyed more.

<Content>Loved It !!!!!! Five of us stayed at the Eden from April 5 - 12 and loved it. Resort is already beautiful but will be even nicer in the next year or two when the gardens and trees mature. Loved the walkways from the rooms to the front lobby especially when you needed to get out of the sun for a bit. We only had green bracelets but had no trouble with service and it is not true that the pink bracelets get better service.Mosquitos were not a big problem - few in my room each day but came prepared with a fly swatter  raid - got a few bites but unlike at home did not swell up very much and not itchy at all!Ate all four restaurants and enjoyed them all - favourites were the Asian and Shore Grill. Italian  Romantic were good too. Buffet had a good selection and only complaint was that some of the food wasn''t quite warm enough. Have stayed at many all inclusives and food was hot - maybe they don't have the water hot enough underneath? Also, buffet restaurant needs more staff - they were having trouble clearing and resetting tables to accomodate all the guests. The beach chair situation is a little frustrating but not the hotels fault - appears to be lots of chairs - but many people put their towels out very early and don''t appear until after lunchtime. Not very considerate. We had no problem as I would get up at 6:00 am and go down and watch the sunrise. If you went out at 7:00 no way you would get chairs at the beach and very limited chairs at the pools then as well. We found all the staff very friendly - they all work so hard and such long hours. Would go back to the Eden again - however next year probably will be out of our price range.

<Content>Fun vacation at EdenH! We arrived at EdenH the night of the Grand Opening Gala and were immediately impressed by this resort. Check in was a bit rocky at the beginning with the lady working at the front desk, due to our lack of hotel voucher (that's another story, and no fault of the hotel), but afterward a gentleman at the front desk gave us assistance, and he was very helpful. We headed right down to the beach and unfortunately the windstorm was wreaking havoc with the gorgeous beach party that had been organized. It was impossible to eat down there with the sand blowing, but it was an incredible set up and we could see the work that had gone into this beach buffet.Our room was beautiful, on the second floor of building two, and we had a view of the pool. We did have mosquitoes, but tried to keep the door closed as much as possible. It was my understanding after talking with other guests, that building one did not have this issue. I believe it was the standing water to the north of the resort that caused building two to have more mosquito issues.The pool and beach were beautiful!! I loved the beach especially and enjoyed watching all the excitement. My husband and son went parasailing and banana boat riding. They had a blast! I had a lovely massage down on the beach as well. Yes, there is a chair issue, but we did not let this affect our vacation. It was terrible to see how guests would reserve chairs and not come back for hours. Shame on them.The food was very good, with lots to choose from at the buffet and we did enjoy the a la carte restaurants, and had no problem going for a drink while we waited for a table. The service in the a la carte restaurants was a bit disorganized, but I am sure it will be getting better every week. The one problem for me was mid week they changed the house red wine from Casa Alta to Vinas and I found the Vinas to be undrinkable. We started ordering a bottle of red from the menu and that did seem to cause confusion, and took much longer than it should have. Again, I am sure this will be worked out with a bit more time.I found most of the wait staff to be very friendly, and a smile does go a very long way. There are always going to be times when you don't get served as quickly as you want, but you are on vacation and on Island time, so relax and enjoy.We saw improvements being made every day at this resort. Lots more umbrellas around the pool, speakers being hooked up to provide music around the resort, gardens being added to, etc. It was a slice of paradise and we really had a fun time at EdenH!

<Content>Not Ready still My wife and I returned from the Edenh late last night and I thought we would share our view of the resort. Our arrival went fairly smooth, we arrived at 6:15 PM and were in our room at about 6:35PM. The hotel lobby was very nice and the walk to our room 2336 was not too bad. Our room overlooked the side facing the construction site which wasn't the best view. But when my wife and I read all the negative reviews we were hell bent on not being negative ourselves... so we faced the construction big deal. Our first day we were going to be positive and not think about anything we had read. So we got up at about 8am and walked over to the buffet for breakfast, pretty typical breakfast in an all-exclusive resort. The only problem was the service was pretty poor, had to ask for a napkin I'd say 4 of the 5 times we ate in the buffet. Getting a coffe sometimes seemed differcult. This was our 5 trip to Punta Cana in the past 4 years. So we have seen a few buffets.... 9:00AM headed down to the beach, walked by the pools and saw no empty chairs, only a few had towels and had been reserved by use of the towel.Got down to the beach and looked for a couple of chairs for me and the wife.... NONE.... Searched for a few minutes and found one beach chair... Great ... the wife would have a char and I lay in the sand.... I thought don't worry about it I'm on Vacation!!!!. Later at about 2:30 pm someone offered me a chair. We ate that night at the Asian resturant and it was very good..... Drinks were pretty easy to get even wearing the green wrist bands...... We gambled a bit and went to bed... Next morning pretty much got up the same time and had breakfast and headed down to the beach ...NO CHAIRS again.... we ended up laying in the sand..... I swore to myself that I wouldn't play the chair game.... Guess What? next morning I was down there at 7AM sitting in chair reading along with about 250 other guest of the resort. The resort does not have enough chairs... Plain and simple, I looked around quite a few times and saw only a couple of chairs empty at any one time.... They need more chairs...I have stayed at 3 of the Rui Resorts in Punta Cana and the punta Cana Princess and never had a problem getting a beach chair... Might not have been able to get a great soot but I alway got a chair.... The biggest complaint i heard from other guess was the chair issue. Over the years we always told our friends how much we liked going to Punta Cana, how freindly the people are in the Dominican, but I never felt the friendly feeling at the Edenh....most of the employees tried hard, but I think the problem with this resort is the lack of training and I also felt the lack of leadership. When we had stayed at other resorts we had the same servers at dinner in one location and we would sit in that area so we could get that same server.. and would tip him or her well. At the Edenh I never really knew who my server was.. You'd order from one and another would come back and another might ask about drinks .. no real smooth transfer of service with the wait staff. I wouldn't say we had a bad time but I wouldn't say we had a great time.... If you asked me if I'd return there I'd say no

<Content>Excellent Vacation, Accommodations and People ... We arrived at Eden on March 31 and before arriving knew that we would not be able check in until 3:00 ... fine, we went prepared to enjoy the afternoon from our carry on bags. At 3:00 we were checked in. No wait. We were assisted with our luggage by just an absolutely great fellow who showed us our room, and all that we would need to know about room service, etc. The room was beautiful, clean, well kept with the maid and the mini bar service in every morning. I don't want to make this too long, but there is so much negative being said I need to share the positives. We had room service, which was delivered to our room probably within 20 minutes. We ate at the buffet regularly, and at the pool resturant. It was all great. We ate at the ala carte resturants, would go over around six and would be seated shortly after 6:30 and would be enjoying our dinner and a glass of wine shortly after that. No problems, just one extremely rude person treating the staff terribly, who if he was in a Canadian resturant, would have been thrown out and it would be over with. He by the way was wearing a green bracelet. The only other rude person we came across was a women who treated one of the bar tenders badly because he couldn't explain what a certain type of vodka tasted like???? She was wearing pink. Found no difference in service at all between the green and the pink bracelets, and I was watching. Everyone seemed to be treated the same. As for the cots at the beach and pools side, we never had a problem either place. They could certainly use a few more of them, but again some people were saving as many as 6 or 8 for themselves and friends and not using them for hours. Find it hard to blame that on the resort. The resort put on a huge beach party which was exceptional, unfortunately the weather didn't cooperate that evening and it was blowing very hard. We had one of those room that overlooked the construction site but what it also overlooked to the left, beach for as far as you could see. We got a lot of great pics of the wind surfers, etc from our balcony. There are so many more good things I could tell you about Eden. If you are going to vacation there I hope you enjoy it as much as we did.

<Content>Wonderful vacation My husband and I stayed at Edenh the first week of April. I of course obsessed over the reviews prior to our vacation. Sure, if you searched for something to be wrong you could find it (as with any where). From check in to check out everyone we met had a smile on their face. The resort is beautiful. We did not have an upgraded package and didn't feel any different than anyone else. The guys at the main bar by the pool are fabulous, even on the one rainy day we had, they made it fun.Our room was nice. It did have the weird opening in between the bathroom and bedroom. I could see it being a problem if you were with friends or had children with you. But for us it was no big deal.This was our 8th all inclusive trip, second time in Punta Cana. So I feel that I have a good sense of what a 5 star resort should be. Edenh is almost there. I think because of the size of the resort they could use one or two more ala carte restaurants. There was only one night that we couldn't get in. So we went to the buffet. We never waited more than 40 minutes to sit down. The food itself was really good, I thought. Just my opion.As for the chair situation. This is definitly a problem created by guests. There are plenty of chairs. We mostly sat at the pool. My husband would go down around 8am grab us two, while I was showering. We'd go to breakfast and be at our chairs by 10. What I did see on a few occasions was. People coming from the beach where they were sitting to the chairs they had saved at the pool. Some people had six chairs saved!! We also saw security moving items after the chairs were empty for a couple of hours. This is very hard for them to monitor. Some days we didn't get up early to save and always found a spot.So in my honest opion, it is a great resort. I would go back in a minute. It's definitly has a more mellow vibe. It was truly a relaxing vacation.

<Content>Amazing Vacation My husband and I stayed at the Edenh from Mar.22-Mar29 and had an amazing time. The weather was amazing-sunshine all week. We loved the resort and had no problems with our room. We were green bracelet people and saw no need to upgrade.Our room was upgraded by the resort to a superior deluxe overlooking the pool and it was beautiful. We had the open bathroom but no problem. Our jacuzzi was inside which we preferred. The room was clean and stocked everyday between 12-2 and we had plenty of towels and we just put a note in the fridge and our mini fridge was always stocked with what we wanted.The staff were amazing friendly and very helpful. Most understood English and if they didn't they found someone who did. The front desk were great in answering questions and changing our large bills to smaller ones. I was impressed with the number of employees who were always cleaning the grounds and the various areas. The resort is beautiful and when the flowers grow it will be amazing with the palm trees and fountains. I can see this resort being a 5 star level very soon.We had no problem with chairs or umbrellas. We are pool people and always got a spot we wanted and a simple request for an umbrella was always answered promptly. We did see people heading out around 6:30 for the beach to get a good spot. Chairs did arrive while we were there so there were lots more on the beach so maybe this will help. As others have said if people wouldn't hog them by reserving chairs in several areas there would be no problem.The buffet was great--especially breakfast and we tried 3 al carte resturants after lining up for only 15 minutes and all resturants were good. MY favourite was the Italian and Asian. I loved the beach resturant as well and the 2 bartenders at the beach resturant were great.All in all a great vacation and I was sorry I worried about my trip for weeks before going after reading all those terrible reviews and I only hope we can afford to go back as I am sure the cost will increase next year. We got and awesome deal and a GREAT vacation. Thank you EDENH .

<Content>Vacation from Hell....the sequel !! This was our 4th time to the Dominican. Read the reviews but thought most were exagerated. I was wrong. The Conquest rep was rude and no help at all. The hotel is run by unskilled management and the staff are rude or incompetant most of the time. The maids and the maintenance crew are quite polite but very busy. Does that tell you anything. Our rooms were barely cleaned and most days the maid didn't show up until 5pm-6pm. First night our air conditioning didn't work and maintenance came right away at 12:30 am and changed a fuse. The air worked fine but the next day we had a puddle in our room from the condensation caused from the air conditioner. It went from a drip to a flood with a huge hole in the ceiling where the drip was. In our friend's room there was a drip but it went undetected until they arrived back to their room from a day at the beach to find all of their clothes hanging over the furniture, soaking wet. The tiles in our other friend's washroom was falling off the wall. The one tile holds the glass door which if it fell could have caused some serious injury. The tile was repaired but they couldn't fix our leak so we were finally given a new room for the last two days of our two week stay. While we were at the resort there was a private fuction right in the centre of the resort but we were served our dinner at the beach in the middle of a huge wind storm. The table were set up complete with chrystal glasses and silver. Gale force winds and sand everywhere.. in our food and drinks and I'm sure there was broken glass on the beach the next day. We didn't go there to find out . Trying to make reservations was a bit of a joke. You line up at 6:30 and if you are not one of the lucky ones to fill the dining room you take a beeper with you and it goes off when a table becomes available. Sounds simple doesn't it...well not so. The people in charge don't know what they're doing and they don't speak english or french or any other language ...(the maids speak better english). We did get into the Asian ala carte dining and where ignored continually until we finally left and went to the Buffet. My sister in law ordered a chocolate cake for a special Birthday ($20.00 american) We waited for 45 minutes for it and then carried the cake around until we could find a place to eat and when we cut the cake it was vanilla and then they charged her $24.00 ) When she complained that it was not what we ordered they said we should have brought it back right away. Unfortunately we were at the Beach Party and it was 10:00 at night. These incidents were just a few and I could go on and on forever. Overall, it was a bad stay. The building is already falling apart and the staff are either overworked, rude or incompetant. We tried our hardest to have a good vacation but with all the structual and management problems it's next to impossible to relax and enjoy. Good luck to you if you go there.

<Content>Great Vacation We stayed at the resort from Mar 13 - 20. My wife, our 2 children, ages 18  19 and 2 of their friends traveled to the D.R. for the first time  had a great time.Like many others that had written prior, after reading the reviews we were very fearful, however we are glad we stayed. We have stayed at numerous all inclusives at other locales  felt that this was one of the friendliest staff's we had seen.We were green bracelets  had no problems with that  in no way did we ever feel slighted as a result. Check-in was smooth; we had requested adjoining rooms  had 2 side by side rooms on the 4th floor that faced the exterior. We came prepared for the mosquitos, but it was never much of an issue. The rooms were very nice  the satellite tv was great, however 2 good peices of info that we did get from TA were the sheets we hung over the opening in the kids room and putting a piece of paper in the light switch. We usually sat by the pool and had no problem getting chairs prior to 9 a.m. The 1 day that we did sit out on the beach, we got out there at 5:30 a.m.,  got a prime area  were able to watch the sunrise. The food was good, we ate at all 4 ala carte. Typically I got in line, between 5:30 - 6 to get us in on the first sitting. Time went fast as always had a drink  met many friendly people. This wasn't an issue, if I were home would have to wait at least an hour to get into a prime restauraunt. The Asian was our favorite. Service was fair - good, but wasn't in huge hurry anyway. Always could find something good on the buffets. Felix is outstanding at the omelet grill in the a.m.  there are many nice touches each morning.Loved the swim up, lobby bar,  the Tantra bar. Getting a drink was very accessible. The Lobby and Tantra are not your typical tropical fare, but were a lot of fun. The kids usually stayed out late at the Tantra  Lobby bars  the lack of a disco was not an issue. We did enjoy the room service several times.Caught the evening shows each night, which won't be confused with Vegas shows, but usually were entertaining. The casino is relatively small, but we did win some money  had some fun there. Other good things to know - the exercise room doesn't have many machines, the pool entertainment staff isn't as active as other resorts we have been to. It is a new resort  once the plantings grow, it will be outstanding. The beach was amazing and the water was great. We never had any major issues and did not sweat the small stuff. We met many friendly people and found that a smile goes a long way. Overall we loved this resort and had a fantastic time, and would have no problem going back.

<Content>Well worth the wait! After a long wait and numerous negative reviews, it was well worth it and I will keep it as short as I can and to the point as most of this you have already read.The rooms are very nice, clean and spacious. The open bathroom was never a problem and there were 7 of us in 4 different rooms aged 25-49. The food was good in all restaurants, especially the Asian. We went twice and had no problem getting a seat at the Hibachi. The first time we waited in line for a hour for the 6:30 seating and the second time we made reservations at 8:00 for the 9:00 sitting. There are 3 Hibachi grills, ask for Pedro, a young guy with a great sense of humour and an excellent cook. For breakfast, Felix's omlettes in the buffet are a must.The pools and beach are as beautiful as they come.The entertainment was as good as I've seen at any resort and is very professional. The costumes and acrobatics are as good as you will get without actually being in Vegas.The entertainment committee itself work very hard, especially John, Jose and Evelyn.We found the drinks somewhat inconsistant at the pool bar, however the Lobby Bar and Tantra bar made the best. Look for Sandra at the pool bar for the best drinks there.Overall the staff throughout the hotel were very friendly and helpful and work very hard.The only things we would like to see change are at the lobby were when cashing US travellers cheques, you can only get Pesos and when buying gifts whether at the resort or off, the price always seemed to be higher in Pesos than in US dollars.The other, we would have liked to see more music around the pool, even though it seemed to get better later in the week. I understand the whole ambiance thing, but the music just adds a little flavour.I would rate this resort a 4.5*, but that is not an option, so I picked 5, as they are not quite perfect, yet.A special thanks to John from the entertainment team for making the trip special.

<Content>amazing vacation ! We were a group of 17 people with the ages ranging from 45 to 5 years old. we got to the resort at about 7 pm and were checked in right away with out a problem. We had asked to all have a rooms together and it wasnt a problem .... the front desk were very helpfull and spoke very well in english. The beach was absolutely incredible and by far the best beach on all of the strip! yes there is some sea weed but so does every other beach .... and they do clean it up early in the morning wich we witnessed .. they work very hard to keep it clean but it accumulates all through out the day. We did not have any problems with beach chairs but we also did have an early riser who saved some in the morning... just dont be greedy about it and save chairs on the beach and by the poolok so our first experience with the a la cartes wasnt bad at all we were seated right away and it was delicious and awesome service ... but our second at the shore grill we werent so lucky we waited a long time to be seated and once we were in the service was horrible ... we got stuff we never orderedOther then that little incident at the restaurant the service was absolutely incredible everyone was friendly with you if you treated them with respect .... the entertainement staff were great akon evelynn and jose were awesome ! but they could have had a little more going on but its understanding because it is a new resort, and all the bartenders were great.. but every time you order a drink it will taste different we had 2 18 year olds and 4 16 year olds our trip and we were all very dissapointed when we found out that there was no disco but we delt with it and partied at the sports bar with the two best bartenders ..Bladimir and Mercedes .. the two nicest people we met on our trip! The last few nights we made our own little disco in the sports bar we brought our ipod and the station and just started dancing ! it was great As for the pink and green bracelets ... we personally did not see any difference .... we even got served prenium alcohol .. you just gotta be nice ! and just a little tip if your planning on doing any tours ... stay away from swimming witht the sharks and stingrays ... the water is sooo rough that if your not a strong swimmer youll be in and out of that water. most of the kids in our group just found it too rough ... but the teens enjoyed the experience but had nothing else to compare it to!The grounds are beautiful and very modern .... the resort is kept very air conditioned ... some nights we even wore sweaters cuz we were kinda chilly .... as for the mosquitoes i think i saw maybe one or two of them really not a big problemoverall we had an incredible time .... but we were a very easygoing group and didnt make a big deal over certain things ... the resort isnt perfect ..yet ...but one day will be once they iron out the little problems We were thinking of moving resorts when we were reading all of these reviews but we extremly happy we werent able to, it was a gorgeous resort with the best beach great food and awesome people what more could you ask for ... your trip is what you make it !

<Content>2 weeks in Paradise! Date of visit: March 23/08-April6/08Green braceletsMy S.O and I had a wonderful 2 weeks at the EdeNH. Check in- oh so easy. We got there at around 10:00 am and it took 2 minutes. We were given our package and was told our room would be ready at 3:00pm. ( This is standard just about anywhere ) The porter stowed our bags after letting us rummage through them for clothing, sunscreen, etc and we hit the buffet, then the beach. Checked back at 3 and our room was ready. Room- Very nicely appointed, second floor in the back with a view of a very high black fence. Had the large window in the bathroom, which we really liked, since we have no shame and could easily carry on conversations. I can see where this would not be great for families or friends. A simple shower curtain is the answer. Great tv, daily stocked minibar and with a nice note and a tip the minibar person would leave extra beer or whatever. Housekeeping was well done everyday in a timely manner. TIP- called home 7 times and talked for 5 min at a time, once for 10 and had a whopping phone bill of $9.00. Not sure if this is Edenh or the phone company, but I was astounded and even made him double check it. One downfall to me was that there was no screen door on the balcony. I really, really missed being able to hear the sounds of the resort. Leaving our door open was out of the question because of mosquitos. The little boogers were ready to attack the second you opened the door. We could not sit outside at all. We killed about 10 per day but I still received many mossie bites throughout the night. I swell up terrible and itch for days. We had our room sprayed half way through and it was great for the evening and night, but the next day they were back again. These 2 things were our only issues the entire trip. Beach- Fantastic. One of the best on the strip. Very busy, you could watch parasailers, numerous types of speed boats, banana boats, booze cruises, helicoptors and people! We love to people watch and this was the place for it! Sand like powdered sugar. We swam often, but I missed snorkelling off the beach. There is nothing to see here. Seaweed was not an issue. It was cleaned up every morning. It amazed me to see how many people littered on this gorgeous beach, leaving behind bottles and cups and garbage. People, pick up your mess! LNT!Food- Ahh, the food. We tried all a la cartes but the french and thought they were all just ok. Line ups no big deal, it was hit or miss. 6:30 seemed a good time.The sushi bar was outstanding, however. Fresh, quick and beautifully prepared. TIP- Walk to the front of the line and just say sushi bar and go right in. Here you can only get sushi but if that's your thing, you are in Heaven! The resort buffet was fantastic. Every day was a new theme like Dominican night or Seafood night that started at lunch and continued through to the evening. One night, while running pell-mell from counter to counter looking at what we would eat tonight, a lady went by and said Slim pickings tonight, huh? I was literally rendered speechless. If you can't find something to eat here, something great, you have a serious problem. One night was peel and eat shrimp, oysters on the half shell and broiled lobsters. One night was the best prime rib I've had in a long while, cooked to perfection (very rare!) Every night you could get fresh cooked (in front of you) steak, pork and fish. Fresh pasta also cooked in front of you with a variety of sauces. Shepherd's pie, potatoes, french fries, calamari, my goodness, I could go on forever. The bread selection was unreal, cut into a loaf in the morning and it will still be warm. The deserts were wonderful, a huge selection, right down to tiny pastry handmade swans. Breakfasts were delicious with fresh, made to order omlettes and french toast, pancakes, bacon, sausage, the BEST (cream of wheat?) I have ever had the pleasure of eating. The morning pastries were out of this world, croissants covered in white or milk chocolate and a chocolate cake, cut suspiciously to look like toast so the guilt didn't kill you. I ate chocolate cake for breakfast for 2 weeks people!!! And sadly, the scale proves it. I must mention the beach BBQ that was held one night. The main buffet closed and down on the beach were white tableclothed tables and chairs and walkway arches made from braided palm fronds. There was a quarter of beef being bbq'd, strung up over a fire pit in the sand, a whole roasting pig on a spit, fish being bbq'd in a hole in the sand. (Unfortunately, it was very windy, fish was kinda sandy..lol) It was unlike any other beach bbq I have seen. I would like to thank the many people who must have laboured for hours providing us with this special treat! The attention to detail and obvious pride in their work was outstanding and noticeably worth comment. Beach chair wars- Not an issue for us. Since we could not see the sunrise, or anything else for that matter, we got up at 5:30 as usual, made coffee and hit the beach by 6 or shortly thereafter and watched the sun come up everyday. Then we lounged around, rolling over only to eat or drink until 4:30, when we would go to the pool and continue to be slugs until 5:30 or so. The pool was very beautiful and clean.Nightly shows- Couldn't say as we are in bed by 9pm, exhausted from the daytime sun! Room service- Timely and yummy. Only ordered twice, club sandwiches and ham and cheese sandwiches with french fries. Staff- A friendly face everywhere you turned, greeted by Hola! and a quick smile. Service was very good, could be a bit slow, but who cares? Not us, that's for sure. We tried to speak Spanish when we could using our handy little EdeNH dictionary (thanks, good idea) and were always encouraged by staff who must have thought us a bit daft at times trying to pronounce words in their language, but always a smile and you will get whatever you need. Always. I saw a woman berating the staff over not having any face cloths. Pleeeze.... Of notable mention: Felix. the omlette guy, of course. Happy, happy man is he. Gabriel, coffee guy, we miss you...cafe con POCO leche, how he tried to teach my S.O that, with the patience of a saint. Yudi, you were everywhere and so sweet and kind. Yohanna, lobby bar, funny and wicked and we loved her immediately, especially her little dance with the silly drum my S.O bought. Yunior at the buffet, thank you for your excellent service and flashing smile. Angelo and Francisco, sushi bar, we miss your sushi so much, and your company more. The Sea Pro guys on the beach, Ruddy, Ronny, Willie, wicked good fun always to be had! Other mentionables:Had a massage on the beach, not bad but not great, cheap though, only $110.00 for 2 of us for 50 min. each. Jellyfish Restaurant- Very excellent meal (stuffed sea bass and coconut shrimp) exceptional service, make reservations and they will pay your cab fare home. Horseback riding $60.00 each 2 hours-Just like in the movies, pounding up the surf on a gorgeous, deserted beach. Used Rancho RN23, checked out where the horses were kept, very well cared for, lots of fresh, clean hay and water. Good shape on most, a couple were a little thin. All were well groomed and excellently trained. BOMB proof and responded well to neck rein/leg. I was pleasantly surprised. Reef Explorer $166 for two. Ok, little unorganized, Rays were cool, sharks were interesting, they just lay on the sea floor and breathe. I guess this is a good thing! Snorkelling was not good, reef not pretty, but a few nice, colorful fish. 15 min. mini massage was nice. Great pictures holding the rays. Mike's Marina- $250 for two for 1/2 day. Top notch boats, equipment (Penn) and crew. S.O caught an incredibly beautiful, huge sailfish that must have weighed 70 pounds. It was worth every penny for a moment he will never forget. And last but never least....Steve's Corner Bar. We spent a wonderful afternoon sucking back bahamaMama's and Tequila Sunrise's, watching the people and loving life. QUALITY drinks and unexpensive. $15.00 by cab to get there and an exciting motorcycle taxi ride back to the resort for $5.00 each! That was a blast to an excellent afternoon. Never got to meet Steve sadly, but it was the coolest little bar in town! Go and enjoy!A big thank you also to Mike, for all your information and help. We had the pleasure of meeting Mike and his wonderfully kind, sparkling eyes that smile. And thanks to all who went before us and left helpful reviews. EdeNH is a wonderful resort, beautiful, clean, pleasing to the eye and our home for 2 weeks. We miss it and it's warm, friendly people.

<Content>Great Location - Horrible Service Room Service - Don't even think about it.Front Desk - Be prepared to be there awhile.Beach - Beautiful.Concierge - Not helpful.Bartenders - Fun and friendly.Food - OK. But DON'T eat outside....yuk!Drinks - Mediocre.Ice - What ice?Phone System - Maddening!Overall Attitude of Service Personnel - Odd, almost resentful.My suggestions if you decide to go:1. Upgrade to the pink wrist band for better drinks and access to a small restaurant where you can order a decent breakfast b/c room service is a joke and food in the public areas is sickening. 2. Upgrade to an ocean-front suite so that you don't have to fight for a spot to sit down outside. Chairs are limited. I woke up several times to find every chair on the beach and around the pool covered with towels but nobody in sight. It's common to find people reserving seats both at the pool as well as on the beach.3. For some fun - wake up around 7am and move the towels used to reserve beach chairs. Wait a few minutes and someone else will swoop in to stake their claim. Sit back and watch the drama as the original owner returns to find someone else in their seat.4. If you don't speak Spanish, good luck. Just enjoy the beach, take lots of walks and steer clear of anyone but the bartenders.

<Content>Incredible Place - Don't Believe all the Naysayers First and Foremost, had I listened to all of those negative comments, I would have missed a truly incredible resort.We arrived on March 30 and stayed through April 6th. The hotel was beautiful, well appointed and we did not want to leave. This was our honeymoon, and after reading ALL the negative reviews over the past two months, leading up to the trip, we were quite concerned about what we had signed up for and almost booked elsewhere. From the moment we arrived till the day we checked out, we were made welcome, pampered and felt as though we had made the right choice by sticking it out.I have read no less than 60 reviews, and all I have to say to all the folks that have written negative ones is.... Give Me a Break! OMG, your toilet had a scratch in it???? The door to the bathroom had a smudge on it???? The chair wars were hell??? Please.... tell me one place where you have been that you could not pick out something bad. Its like winning a $36 million dollar lottery, and complaining you have to pay taxes!!!! Bunch of crybabies.......Seriously folks, you will enjoy this place. And my experiment below is worth looking into.Check-In We arrived at 12:00, and were promptly greeted at the front desk, and were given our green bracelets, and told our room would not be ready till 3:00 - which was the checkin time so no big deal. We were prepared with swimming suits and went to the beach (and oh my god... found a chair) and ate lunch. When we returned at 3:00 to the front desk our room was ready. RoomVery nicely appointed with everything working. Very clean, very nice bed. Very nice bathroom, although it was so horrible to see through that hole (just kidding, it is no big deal, the toilet area has a door). Nice balcony on 2nd floor overlooking pools (although the other side of the building would have been nasty... I agree with that). Mosquitos were only a problem when my wife and I left the sliding glass door open, enjoying the tropical breeze. But not as bad as everyone has made it out to be.FoodWe ate in two of the four ala carte restaurants, and there were lines, but we just got our beeper, went to the Sports Bar, had some drinks, and when the beeper went off (30 minutes was the longest wait), we were seated. The food was good. Nothing great. The Buffet was our best choice, cause we were on vacation, and did not want to deal with waiting. The food was fresh, and varied each meal. The poolside buffett was good too, and the food was a little cold, but using common sense (sorry for those who may not have had any in previous posts) had the guys at the grill put the burgers BACK on the grill. Problem solved.DrinksThe bartenders are very good and very helpful, but what you have read in past is true. Each one makes drinks differently. But I guess I am the optimistic type, and it did not bother me.EntertainmentSince it was a honeymoon, we were not that interested in the shows, but did see a wonderful Circus in the main courtyard and went to the Casino a few times. The Tanhtra Bar is pretty cool too. Had some drinks laying in a bed, which was pretty interesting.Chair-WarsThe hotel has supplied a sufficient amount of chairs, it is just the other guests that are the problem. I too, woke up at 6:45 to get a chair at pool or beach, but I stayed there, and actually occupied my chair. Where the problem is (and I witnessed it the last day there, cause I was just watching the hawks gobble up the chairs from my balcony) is when people reserve chairs at the pool, then go to the beach and do the same. That is downright rude, and is why there is a problem. The hotel is trying, ordering more chairs, but you'd have to have two chairs each for the 1000 guests if everyone did that. You do the math. It is not the hotel, but the rude people that are there.ExperimentMy wife and I had read all the negative reviews and were real concerned especially when we read about the Pink and Green Bands. I contacted the hotel to upgrade, cause this was my honeymoon, and I did not want to feel like I wasn't as good as those with Pink Bands. Unfortunately the hotel was booked solid for the Paradise Club. So I did a little digging, and found someone on eBay that sold me 4 Pink Bands. Although not the same as the ones there, they worked. I felt guilty, and my wife would not wear one, but I did the last 4 days, and the treatment I received was notably different. The alcohol is much better, and the Paradise Club Bartenders make you feel very welcome (Ramon is an amazing person). Of course we did not change rooms, but there was a notable difference. It was worth the money I spent for the bands, but I would have been upset if I had paid for the Paradise Club. I have since gone to confession, but would do it all over again!!! Go to eBay and search on Pink Wristbands.OverallI would definately go back. It was worth the money and we did enjoys ourselves.Tips- Bring bathing suits in carryon, cause checkin time is 3:00 and you don't want to waste your time waiting for room in lobby- Bring Imodium and Tylenol... God forbid you have to pay $3.50 for a tylenol- Bring Large Insulated Mugs for your drinks - we did not and wish we did- Don't stress about the chairs, it will ALL work out- Don't nit-pick, you are on vacation, enjoy it!!!!!

<Content>Loved it... My husband and I stayed at Eden H March 30 to April 6th. Despite the negative reviews we decided to stay with our original booking to this great resort.We booked Air Transat's Mirage Concierge (pink bracelets). Check in was very fast and our room was not ready but we were prepared with a change of clothing for the beach. We returned at 3:30 p.m. and promptly taken to our room which overlooked the pool area of building #1 on the first floor. Our room was kept clean throughout the week. We had nightly pull down service with chocolates.The beach and pool are wonderful...the best along the strip. We decided to stay at the Paradise Club Pool for a few days because of windy conditions and the sand creating dunes amongst the palapas and chairs. The wind subsided on Saturday before leaving. We did not let the wind deter us nor the one day of intermittent rain dampen our spirits. The weather was still warm and we were able to find something to do.We ate at all restaurants. The only time we waited more than 20 minutes was the Hibachi grill which we wanted to experience the cooking table.Although we had pink bracelets, (despite what others say), we were not served out of sync at any time. In fact, I was at a bar with many green bracelets who were served before me.I have to say that staff were wonderful, especially the bartenders at the Paradise Club Pool. On more than one occasion we experienced rudeness/inappropriate behaviour from other guests while at the larger pool, a la carte and beach grill . By far, not the resort's fault. The unattended reserved beach chair/palapas game was in full swing except for the windy days. Then it became a pool area problem. Bottom line - I would go back again with no reservations. We enjoyed the resort, staff and service. Absolutely wonderful holiday despite the wind and intermittent rain on a few days.

<Content>Beautiful Resort We (group of 17) just got back from the Eden h Real and after reading all the poor reviews, we were relieved that it wasn't as bad as everyone said!ARRIVAL - we arrived without any glitches. They kept telling us it was a 1/2 drive from the airport but it really only took 20 minutes. Our biggest fear arriving was the rooms. We needed five rooms and had requested that we had four rooms right beside each other because two families had to split up. This was done without any problems whatsoever. Check in was honeslty 5-10 minutes.ROOMS - We stayed in room 1433 and 1431. The rooms are spacious and very clean. We had two children in our room and tried to work around the opening in the wall to the bathroom but after my sons first experience with a topless woman was his own mother, (lol) we taped up a plastic shower curtain to obstruct his view! We quickly learnt to keep a piece of paper in the slot for the key as this keeps ALL the power on. (if you don't have anything in the slot, the air conditioning goes off as does the fridge!) Also, if you open the patio doors the air conditioning will shut off. The beds are amazing and these rooms are incredibly sound proof! One couple in our group had two days worth of problems with their key not working. Pretty patient people because they made easily 30 trips back and forth to the front desk to keep trying different keys. Finally on the second morning the whole lock was replaced. The only way into their room previously was by going into their daughters room and climbing around the deck outside. (four stories above ground! YIKES!)We never had any mosquitos in our rooms. The view wasn't great but I enjoyed it because we saw more of how the locals lived. Not sure what we were facing but really never sat out on the balcony anyway.FOOD - The grilled chicken was fabulous! The pizza and pasta were also big hits for the kids. Breakfast was by far my favorite as the bread there is out of this world. (makes great toast!) You can always find something to eat and I think if you complain about the food, then you're just picky. (yes, the buffet is usually the same old, same old, but so much to choose from) We had one evening with seafood which would be great if there was enough to go around. I was able to grab some great prawns but by the time the other went up, it was gone! (I can honestly say it wasn't because of the lack of it but because when some people saw it coming, they would fill up an ENTIRE plate! PIGS!) We ate at the Asian a la carte and the Grill. The Asian was very good and the whole group of 17 of us waited no more than 5 minutes to get in. Service there was quick and the food was good. (the noodle dish was by fart he best!)The Grill was the total opposite. We were the first people in line and we waited nearly 2 1/2 hours to be seated. Some of the group opted out and went to the buffet. The service was behond slow and the food, with the exception of the meat, was served cold. It would have been tasty otherwise. This was also the only evening that we found the staff to be very rude. (and we were pretty patient)DRINKS - Let me start by saying that we were 6 adults, 2 eighteen year olds and 4 seventeen yr olds who had green bracelets. (We were asked upon arrival whether or not the 17 yr olds could have the bracelets or not and WE chose to give them to them!) We had no problem drinking whatever alcohol was given to us. There are so many different drinks to be had but it seemed that just when you found the drink you liked most, everyone had a different way of making it! I was served Baileys without having to pay extra and my husband also tried all the different scotch. We only experienced twice the pink bracelet/green bracelt issue. (if that's what you want to call it)Both times was at the pool bar. We ordered our drinks and when someone with a pink bracelet came up beside us, the bartender would take their order, fill it ,then go back to ours. I totally understand that they paid the extra and I was very patient to wait. I can honestly say that the bartender even felt bad doing this as he apologized several times. The second time this happend the fellow with the pink bracelet told the bartender to finish serving us first. We thought that was quite kind!The biggest probelm we ran into at the bars was that they often wouldn't serve the teenagers at all. Now, I don't know if there is a specific age in the DR for consuming but even the 18 yr olds wouldn't get served. This happened all the time in the Tantra bar and occaisionally at the pool bar. When we asked the bartender why he wouldn't serve them (even with the green bracelet on) he would answer that the manager wont let us. When asked to speak to the manager, he somehow dissapeared. In the end, they moved back down to the sports bar and made some great friends in there with the bartenders!ENTERTAINMENT - This was great entertainment for the adults especially. Wednesday night was the best in the theater. The Jazz night was a favorite for the adults and the kids enjoyed white night and the Beach Party. The eve of the beach party was an experience in itself. I have never seen such angry people. The President was apperently at the resort that evening so the lobby area appeared to be closed for that. When we called down to the front desk to ask about the a-la-cartes, we were told they were all closed and the only place to get food was on the beach. This would have be fine if the weather had co-operated. It looked like a huge strom was on its way. The wind was blowing so hard that any plate that you grabbed, was full of sand. It was a beautiful set up but just tooooo windy. People were stanidng in line at the buffet (not realizing that it was closed) and when they were finally told, the *@#! hit the fan! Angry, Angry, Angry. Room service had never been so busy. To top it off, iImade my way down to the lobby to ask a question when I saw the a-la-cartes were all opened! We were not the only people upset by that. First they tell us there closed only to find out they were opened? The good thing was that they finally had some live music for the kids to dance to and that was by far THEIR best night at the resort!BEACH and POOLS - Beach was clean and beautiful. We walked down both ways (several miles) and the beach here is BY FAR the best. We had an early riser who got us chairs every morning but they are hard to come by. One morning we saw the security removing towels from chairs. Honestly, people are actually up at 3:00 a.m. to place their towels. (I actually met someone who did this everyday and told me she was never alone!) If you are only two people, you will find a couple of chairs sooner or later. I would suggest to walk down by the towel hut, there seemed to be more that way. The pool is clean and not alot of people go in the water! The VIP pools are almost always empty.STAFF AND PEOPLE - The cleaning staff are truly amazing. Our rooms were spotless and we even had turn down service one night! There are constantly men painting and grooming! They work very hard and I feel need to be recognized. One of the fellows in our group gave his (very expensive) Canada t-shirt to one of the workers and he was elated. The bartenders in the sports bar are alot of fun and even catered to the younger kids.All in all, most of the staff are very cheerful and helpful. Out of the resort, not so much. I have never been to this country before and several of us were frustrated and annoyed when walking through any market! Everyones name is so and so cheapie cheapie! The men were all over the teenage girls not to mention even us! Some got downright angry if you tried to talk them down in price or ignored them. One guy pushed me out of his store because I told him to quit yelling at me! Our teenagers were constantly asked to by drugs and our little ones were just plain scared [-]! EXCURSION - All we did was the Marinarium excursion. This was in our opinion the biggest rip off ever! Snokeling was awful and unsafe. It was a huge gong show for alot of money!Live and Learn I guess!!KIDS CLUB - I tried to bring my 7 yr old in. She took a little tour and was expalined what would be happening that day and she quickly turned to me and said no thanks! After asking around, I didn't seem to get much positive feedback. Some people described it as a day care and others thought the kids spent too much time inside. To sum things up,The resort is beautiful! I would highly recommend this resort to adults who are looking to relax and have some great entertainment. I do think that they should make this an adults only resort as it just isn't geared towards kids. Our last day there was rainy and the kids were actually anxious to leave.By the way, very FEW mosquitos. Coming from Alberta, when we saw one or two mosquitos, we laughed! All the complaints earlier are legit but WAY over exagerated in my opinion! Enjoy this place now, because prices are sure to rise!I'd be happy to answer any questions!

<Content>Fabulous Time! My husband , 13 year old son and I just returned yesterday (April 5) and we had a fantastic time at the Edenh. This place is incredible! We had an Air Transat package (standard room with great view and a few perks) that entitled us to a yellow bracelet. Loved the room (put a shower curtain up in the space between the bathroom and the main room like others) and especially the amount of storage space and the beautiful wood from South America. The animation staff was great . We took part in water arobics, intro to scuba, dancing, tile painting, flower arranging and cocktail mixing and really enjoyed. The beach is gorgeous and we managed to get chairs under a palapa almost every day even when we arrived on the late side. It was very windy most of the time we were there so it seemed that the chairs by the pool were the most popular. Loved the drinks - tried all the ones people have been talking about plus. My favorites were the margarita, mango colada, spanish coffee and dominican sunrise. The house wines were very good too. Alexis at the swim up bar was very entertaining - don't know how you can dance with a full glass of beer on your head but he did it! Oh and they have an adult and kid's drink of the day (listed in their newsletter) and my son enjoyed many of the kid's concoctions. The food was very good and we never once had a problem getting into the restaurants. Many days we lined up for 20 minutes before the restaurant opened and had no issue at all. It really looked like the only bottleneck was was the Hibachi show at the Asian restaurant. Try table service at the Asian if you have difficulty getting the hibachi show. Our favorites were the Asian restaurant and the Italian restaurant.My favorite shows were the Jazz/Swing show and La Cirque. There was a Las Vegas style dance review that was very well done too. For those of you about to go to the EdenH have a great time!

<Content>Lovely People, Hotel needs improvement What others have written is mostly true as far as the hotel opening too soon, unfinished rooms, mosquitos galore esp. in the bathrooms, limited beach and pool lounge chairs. To compound matters, the weather (3/30-4/3) was not good with rainy mornings and then very windy conditions on the beach with sand blowing, etc. First time I have experienced this in Punta Cana in 7 years of going there.We were a group of 4 (husband, wife, 16 yr. old daughter,  my dad with bad knees) booked into 2 rooms. We had asked to be as close as possible. They had us on opposite sides of the hotel so about as far apart as is possible. We spoke to Ramon at the front desk and were told to come back at 3:00 p.m. to check in and he would fix the rooms. At 3:00 they gave us rooms #1115 and #1119 so we were happy. We were driven in a large golf cart to the rooms with our bags.As soon as we walked into the room my husband noticed that the A/C was not on. We immediately called and someone came right away and fixed it (circuit breaker.) I found the handle on the toilet was cracked off so the toilet would not flush unless you took the top off. Also the lock on the bathroom door was missing. The TV had a picture but NO SOUND. We noticed that the sprayer in the shower was oddly set up so that you had to hold it to use it. We had a set up for coffee but no coffee pot. One thing we did have was lots of mosquitos buzzing around but I came prepared with a fly swatter and citronella candles. Our room was ground floor facing the outside of the complex so our view was of a chain link fence with some barbed wire on top, a few sad looking small palm trees, and what looked to be construction materials and some palapas being built. It was hard to sit on the little porch as the mosquitoes kept landing on us.Regarding the restaurants, we ate at all 4 even though we were only there 4 nights. The longest we waited was 1 hr 45 min. for the Japanese as we wanted to sit and watch the chef cook the food. All the beef was very well prepared and tender, cooked as ordered, not overly cooked as I have experienced before in the DR....i.e. no matter how you order it, it comes well done. We ate breakfast at the buffet every day, it was OK but not thrilling. The bread/cake selection was very nice and fresh.We stuck to Alicio's Bar as we got to know the bartenders.....hi to Julio and Gregory. Julio...Raquel sends a big hug and kiss for you. We will send you the photos we took before we left.One nice treat for me was the Fruit Lady at the beach. She has a boat full of fruit that she cuts up and you can take what you wantOne big minus at the hotel is no DISCO. My daughter was very upset to find that there was no where to dance at night. There are no regular shows as in all other all-inclusives we have been to. There was a Cirque du Soliel-type circus one day in the courtyard. There was supposed to be Karaoke one night at the bar, but was cancelled due to technical difficulties. On Weds. night there was an absolutely beautiful party set up in the courtyard but it was private for the guests of the owner of the hotel. I was not a happy camper that night watching all the owner's guests enjoy themselves while the real guests were on the outside looking in.They did change our room on the 3rd day to #1111 as the TV situation could not be rectified. Also, the whole pink and green bracelet thing is awful and should be gotten rid of. In all, I would not go back to this hotel, nor would I recommend anyone book here unless drastic measures are taken to address some of the problems.

<Content>stop the fussing I really want to say that the reviews this resort is getting seem unfair. There was a group of 7 girls going and we even thought about switching because of all the negitive things people were saying. Well I can honestly say that we are so glad we didn't! The resort was fantastic. The people were great and the food excellent. We were all in different areas of the hotel only because half of the group got there on a Sat. and the rest of us got there on a Mon. The room we had only had one King size bed but if your travelling with someone that you can't stand to sleep beside weather it be a female or male then you shouldn't be travelling together. The bed was large enough that we didn't even know the other was in it.Ceck in wasn't until 3 pm so we just waited in the lobby bar until it was ready, this is really no different then any other resort that I have been to so the people at the front desk checking in really have to relax and not start off there vacation stressed.The food was great, people are saying its repetitive well if you can eat everything that they offer in that buffet you really need to slow down. There is always some items that are the same each meal but then there is a selection that is different each day.We ate at 3 of the 4 restraunts. The Asian was the only one we had to stand in line for and then told to come back at 7:45 but that's because we wanted to go to the show the food was well worth the wait. The Americana had a wonderful beef tenderloin and the Italian had the best lasagna I think I have ever tasted. People need to remember they are on vacation and that you have no where to go so relax!As for the beach chairs I got up at 6:30 each morning and stayed on the beach and watched the sun rise.....rough life! Some of my group did the pool each day and did the same thing got up early and then just relaxed.As for people that say about construction and the rooms maybe we were lucky but we had no problems with noise or things not finished. It is new....if something like a tile is going to ruin your vacation then you really need to stay home.So go and have a great time, the staff is wonderful and if you treat them nicely you will be treated nicely too.

<Content>Had a great time...(from a seasoned caribbean traveler) We just came back from a week at the Eden H Real in Punta Cana. We spent the Easter holiday there. My husband and I along with our 2 year old daughter went with another family of four. My husband and I are experienced Carribbean travelers having stayed at most of the big name resorts. We were looking for a getaway for the Easter holiday, and we were taking our daughter on her first caribbean vacation.We decided to stay at the Eden because it was a brand new 5 star resort at a great price. My husband and I have booked 5 star resorts under grand opening specials and have never been disappointed. We were not disappointed this time either. For weeks, I have been reading the reviews and was extremely concerned about this trip. We really needed a relaxing week and so did the other family we traveled with. In addition, the other family have never done an all inclusive vacation and we really wanted them to enjoy it.We encountered none of the situations that many of the previous review writers did. All that we found at this resort was a lovely, perfectly clean resort on a beautiful beach with wonderful staff who bent over backwards to accomodate us and the three rowdy little girls with us.Rooms- Nice. Very clean and well maintained by staff. Housekeeping was prompt, timely and we always had fresh towels and toiletries available for us. Minibars were always stocked with sodas and cervezas!!! We had rooms side by side and since we were traveling with little ones, the men asked for additional cervezas so they could sit out back and enjoy the weather while the kids slept. I don't know if it was accidental or not, but the room assignments were also very well-planned. We were on the first floor and centrally located to the beach, restaurants and pool. With kids, this was a big plus. We had no plumbing issues or no lack of hot water. The bathroom floorplans were wide open which was a little weird, but didn't cause us any problems. Pools- Big, beautiful, clean. The chair issue was there, but this is a guest problem. We noticed that there would be 3 or 4 chairs with towels only to save them for hours. Obviously, people were at the beach in the morning and saving chairs at the pool for after lunch. Although this was an annoyance at times, there is nothing the hotel could really do about it. Many upper end hotels make you rent chairs and umbrellas for the day at the beach or pool. A little common courtesy on the part of the guests would fix this situation. However, we always seemed to get a few chairs so that we could have a little place to camp out when not in the water.Beach- I can only say Bonita! This is our third trip to Punta Cana and this is the most beautiful stretch of beach I have been on. Cabanas and chairs really didn't seem to be a problem for us. We met other couples with kids who were willing to share their shade with us if other cabanas weren't available.Drinks- We drank mostly cervezas, wine and virgin daiquiris for the girls. Never had to wait long. The service around the pool was actually pretty good. The girls work hard getting the drinks out. Be willing to tip a little and the world is yours!Restaurants- Ok, so here is probably the only fly in the ointment. No good system for this. They don't do reservations. You have to line up at 6:00 ready to eat, not dripping wet in your bathing suits to get an early seating. If this isn't convenient, go to the buffet. It has different themes every night and is very good. However, we really didn't have any problems getting in where we wanted when we wanted after we figured out the system. The Asian restaurant had great sushi and was worth going to. However, we attempted to go there the second night we were there and were told it was closed at 7:30. We lined up another night at 6:00 and were told to come back at 7:45. I looked in and saw empty tables and told the hostess to push tables together because we weren't waiting. She looked at me in a bit of disbelief but did as directed. We all felt like they didn't really want children in the restaurant because there weren't any as young as ours in there. The Italian restaurant was excellent with excellent service. We went there twice. Don't skip the eggplant. The steak restaurant was great as well. The beef was cooked perfectly and delicious. We enjoyed the buffets as well. We mostly ate lunch at the beach buffet because they always had pizza, hotdogs and chicken nuggets. Several days they had fruit carts set up on the beach and near the pool where you picked which fruit you wanted and they cleaned it, sliced it and put it on a stick for you. The girls loved that.Armbands- Did not upgrade to the pink armband and did not need to. The staff really paid no attention to whether your armband was pink or green. I could go on and on rebutting the negative comments, but I think that I have hit the highlights. This is a wonderful resort with wonderful friendly people working there. It will be so beautiful when the vegetation is full grown. Don't let any of these negative comments scare you. Go, relax and have a great time!!! If you have kids, do the animal adventure park excursion. Lots of photo opportunities and interaction with the animals. Lenny the Sea Lion rocks! New Hard Rock Cafe and shopping center minutes away. What a great week and a needed break. Don't forget the sunscreen...50 block!

<Content>Better than we expected!!!! We had a family re-union to celebrate my mother's 75th birthday.From the time we got to the hotel till we left, everything was just fabulous. My mother had the best birthday of her life. The resort is clean and beautiful, the food was good and the beach was pristine. After reading the review, I was very nervous, as I had organized the trip for 12 people. Everything was great. The hotel even had a special party for my mother, with a cake and the works.....I highly recommend this resort.....don't listen to the negative comments......go with a positive attitude and you will have a great time.......Congratulations to the staff at EdenH!!!!!!

<Content>Loved the Resort and the Staff My husband and I and 7 year old son stayed at Eden H from MArch 14-28/08. We were extremely pleased with our choice and plan on returning next year. I cannot commend or say enough about the friendliness and accommodating staff at the resort. Our check-in went extremely smooth, we asked to change our room location with no difficulty. The food was great and lots of it, actually had flavour to it as opposed to some other resorts we have stayed at in the past. This was our 8th trip to Punta Cana and it is the best resort we have stayed at all around. We have always stayed at 4.5- 5 star resorts. The bartenders were wonderful and funny, Guests please treat them with respect. The cooks, waiters, waitresses were all extremely accommodating. You can go to the A LA Carte Restaurants every day if you want to. Our room was great, we only had green bracelets but they did not treat us differently. Next year we plan on pink bracelets to get the premium liquor. We found there to be enough chairs at both the beach and pool, no problems getting towels either. Entertainment was the best we have seen in 8 years travelling to Punta Cana. The Kid's Club was fabulous, kept our son busy and interested all the time. This was the first year he asked to stay the whole day and go back at night. They had everything for kids including an X-BOX; playstation; Wii; pool table ; TV; games room, board games, magic show and other entertainment, we had no worries about keeping our 7 year old interested. The staff at the Kids Club were very astute in dealing with children. Plan on having the best vacation ever! Next year this will be a 5 star plus resort, you will see.

<Content>A great resort After reading all the negative reviews we were a little scared. After returning on March 30th, I have no idea what all the fuss was about! Eleven of us stayed there from ages 5-62 and we had a great stay.We arrived around noon but could not check in until 2, so we changed into our shorts and went for a walk and a snack. Rooms are great, we had a TV, king sized bed, jacuzzi tub and lots of water/pop in our fridge. If you are travelling with family members/friends take a shower curtain/duct tape for the hole in the wall. The bathroom doors are frosted and you can't see through them.Almost all the staff speak very good English and do their best to help you in any way. A little friendliness goes along way. As other travellers have stated, the chair situation is the fault of the people, not the resort staff. We had chairs most days, but one day we laid on the beach...not a big deal, I'll take laying on a beach towel on the sand over snow any day. Unfortunately, people hog the chairs and go to lunch, nap or whatever for hours and leave their stuff on the chairs. The security will not let people put stuff out before 7am.Asian a la carte is the best, we waited in linfe from 6:15-6:30 and we were served sushi right away and ate within 45 mins. It was fantastic, the best one by far. The Grill was also quite good, we waited in line for 10 mins, the Italian and Romantic were a bit disappointing but there was no wait. We showed up at 6:25 and walked right in. There is no need to wait in line at 5pm...The shows are a bit different, far better than the shows at other DR resorts, beautiful costumes, more dancing and music than comedy. We only saw three of them as they didn't start until 9:45-10pm and some nights that was too late for us.There were free scuba lessons in the pool, free kayaks, catamarans (get up early 9:30 ish for a lesson, a must have to take the boats out) a great kids club, as well as on site gym and spa. the boats are very close to where you swim but there is a buoy seperating the area and the boats were out almost all day, so not a big deal. The water is quite warm and I didn't use the shoes I brought in case the bottom was rocky.Overall, it is a beautiful resort, the staff was very friendly, the buffet food was quite good, there was only day I ate salad and french fries because I did not like anything else. there will be a few little glitches as it is a new resort but overall it was fantastic and I would not hesitate to recommend it.Like other travellers have said, if you are looking to be waited on hand and foot and be served gourmet meals...go to another country. If you want to relax, enjoy the sun, go to the Dominican!

<Content>Good Vacation Our large group of 18 just came back from Edenh. We were there 3/22 - 3/29.. Overall we had a good vacation, we chose to make the best of it. Check-in was a bit of a hassle with some in our group being taken to their room and finding out it was already occupied (twice!). We all got rooms in building 1 facing the residential area, which was fine, though I would have preferred to look out at the pool and hotel grounds versus somebody's laundry drying on a line. I also hated not being able to hang out on the balcony or keep the balcony door open as everytime we opened it mosquitos got in the room : ( The room itself was large, but I will say that if you are traveling with children, my suggestion would be to upgrade to a paradise room as the opening between the room and bathroom is very incovenient for families (no privacy whatsoever). Our toilet wasn't working when we got there, but my husband fixed it : ) There was also quite a bit of work going on at the hotel the week we were there (painting and banging on the tiles). This normally wouldn't bother me at all, but we had small children in our group and for some reason all the banging on the tiles took place when they were attempting to take a nap after a day at the beach. We called to ask them to stop for a few hours, but to no avail.The beach and pool areas are very nice. We walked along the beach and I can say that Edenh has the nicest and cleanest beach by far. The beach and pool chairs weren't an issue for us, we had early risers in our group so we always had a place either by the pool or beach, but I will say that after 7am you'd have a hard time getting a chair on the beach, the pool was a bit better.The food was ok. We always found something great at the buffet. We ate at 2 A-la-cartes, Italian and Shore Grill, the food was again ok, the service was very slow at the Italian (normally I wouldn't care, but with the kids it was tough), Shore Grill was better. Didn't get into Asian, we just weren't willing to stand in line to eat.There was always something going on by the pool and by the beach with staff trying really hard to get everyone involved. The nightly shows were good, although a bit late at 9:45..For those traveling with small children, the kids club was ok, but not nearly as good as some of the family resorts we have been to before, though the girls at the club tried really hard with the kids.Overall we had a great vacation. We had a large, fun group and made the best of every situation. We read all the reviews prior to going and went with an open mind understanding that the resort just opened and still has wrinkles to iron out. Personally, I don't think that I will be going to a newly opened resort again, but that's just me : ) Please feel free to ask any questions..

<Content>fantastic vacation the edenh was a very pleasant vacation. after reading many negative reviews on tripadvisor i was very hesitant about what our vacation would be like, but we were, fortunately, quite happily surprised by the resort. there were 4 people in our group - 2 adults, 2 kids (ages 8,5). we utilized nino's kids club, which was quite nice and a big hit with my kids - examples of activities included tennis, jungle gym, video games, face painting, pool time. the resort is clean, the staff is very friendly, grounds very well kept, food was decent. the rooms do have a strange, very large opening between the bathroom and sleeping area, but we knew ahead of time (thanks to reading other reviews on trip advisor prior to trip) and brought along a sheet and tacks which quickly solved the problem. we made the mistake of assuming that there would be an ATM at the resort, which there is not. you have to leave the resort by taxi to go to one, which was an interesting experience given the fact that it's not the safest situation outside of the resort, so bring enough cash to last you the entire vacation. another thing to be aware of is that beach chairs are usually snatched up very early on in the morning - by 6 or 7 a.m. so unless someone in your group is getting up early to stake out the chairs (with towels, hats, etc) you may be out of luck. management claimed that they were getting in another shipment of, i believe, 400 chairs. even taking those little glitches into consideration, the edenH is definitely a great resort.

<Content>Didn't want to leave!! We just returned from EdenH . We stayed from March 23- March 30 and we loved it!. Here is our review.Rooms: Beautiful, clean, we did have one with the space between the bedroom and bathroom, wasn't an issue for us, could see how it would be if you had teenagers with you. One hint, when you shower, put a towel outside the door as when they designed it, the ledge wasn't quite high enough and the first shower we had, there was water everywhere, we learned real fast...towels and facecloths were supplied every day, and everything in our room was working, we didn't have any problems at all, the power went out a couple of times all over the resort but it was restored within a few minutes.Mosquitoes: there were lots, bring your fly spray. I got bites, at least five a day, but my boyfriend didn't get any, flies love me no matter where I am. There were some in the room every day but bring a fly swatter, and keep the air conditioning on. I heard people say they didn't see any all week, so you may or may not..Beach: Beach strip by Edenh is one of the nicest and cleanest on the strip . We walked for at least an hour every day and they seem to keep it by far the cleanest, at least in my opinion. There is a lot of seaweed on Bavaro beach but EdenH has a lot of staff working hard at cleaning it up, which seems to be ongoing, they work hard. They have workers taking your drink orders, and some picking up garbage from your area. There is a grill on the beach every day , with really great food. They have yoga , salsa and meringe lessons and water aerobics in the ocean every day, starting from 10-11:30 . Do the water aerobics with Johan he is hilarious. Also before I left I read they were trying to make it sort of a relaxing mood with soft music everywhere, they must have changed it, because they do play a lot of caribbean music on the beach along with lots more upbeat music. I think by the pools it seemed to be a little quieter, I may be wrong. They offer flower arranging classes, cocktail making classes, wine and rum sipping sessions, darts, a huge chess board game, kids loved it, and a jacuzzi. There are two ice cream machines and of course bars and food wherever you go. Order the dirty monkey or mango slushies, pina coladas were pretty good as well, but do mention that you want rum in them as they tend to give them to you without unless you ask, that was my experience anyways.Green bracelets vs pink bracelets: We tried before we left to upgrade but were told we had to wait until we got there and ask. Once there we didn't bother. We checked in, was told our room would be ready by three, went to the beach until three, went back at 3 and it was ready. We checked the room and was ok with it. We didn't see any preferential treatment for pink bracelets as we had read before and actually we were glad we didn't spend the $700.00 as we had a great vacation without doing so. But of course this is a preference and if your tour company is offering it or if you want it, why not!! Chairs: we did play the chair game. If you want a really nice spot on the beach with a palapa be there no later than 07:00 . There were still pool chairs left at 08:00, so whatever your preference is, will determine what time you want to get there. Security will take your belongings after one hour of not occupying your chairs, we didn't have a problem with this but we did see some people have theirs taken back to security. They give you some hotel information when you check in and it states this on there. We did see someone arguing with security to take a chair from the pool to the beach but it states that they don't want you to do this in the information you are given, so expect to be stopped.Restaurants: Buffet was really good, huge selection, staff was attentive, we didn't sit for two minutes without having a coffee or wine. Italian and American, we went there at 18:15, went to the lobby bar, sat and had a drink and watched until the lineup was empty. Opened at 18:30 and we were in by 18:40. Asian : we went there at 18:30 and got a reservation for the hibachi for 19:45, went back at that time and walked straight in. French(Romantic) : we went there at 19:00, got a beeper and twenty minutes later we were in. Fortunately we didn't have a problem in this area.All of them were very nice with great food and wonderful staff.Entertainment: we only went to three nights, circus , pikante and Friday night DJ party. They were all great....really try to make it to the circus one, it was amazing!!We had a wonderful vacation here and would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone going to Punta Cana. Enjoy it, we did!

<Content>Fantastic Trip After reading all the negative reviews about this resort, I was actually sick worrying about what my vacation would be. I am not the type to write a review but I had to, because I am sure there are people worrying about their holiday like I was. The resort is beautifuil, the food was amazing, service was fantastic, I would return in a second.My friends and I did upgrade our suite prior to leaving so we were the pinkies. I don't think this would even matter, it seemed to me that everyone got the same service. All the people who gave this resort terrible reviews must be extremly picky because from what I had read prior to leaving and what it was actually like there was totally different. The only negative thing was the lounge chairs (which are on order). We took floats to chill out on but by mid afternoon there were chairs available. I hope that people will read this and not stress about their holiday because it is everything and more than what you see in the travel magazines.Enjoy your holiday !!!

<Content>No problems, lots of fun Stayed Mar 22 to 29 with green bracelets attached. Late night check in was fast and efficient. No mosquitos, lots of towels and hot water and rum and bottled water and rum and beer and rum and food and rum.Left a note saying how many water, coffee, beer we wanted and that's what we got.Food was great and varied. Hot was hot and cold was cold. Breads and desserts to die for. Chicken, lamb, pork, beef. French fries every day for those who didn't have any sense of adventure.Don't line up before the restaurants open! Have a late snack before the buffet closes at 3 and then go for 6:30 knowing you may have to wait. We waited an hour to get a group of 15 at the habatichi grill. Went in smaller groups other nights and rarely waited. If there's a wait one night, chances are there's a slow restaurant happy to serve you. Italian was the one we decided to do twice.Sushi bar is always available and you can see the habatichi show from there. Sushi was great.Best market is down the beach towards the jumpy castle. lots of items, sheltered from the sun but open and safe. Barcelo rum cream is great if you're a 'Bailey's drinker.Drinks varied from bartender to bartender but were good. Wine was good and plentiful in all restaurants and at buffet.Massage on beach was great as was facial for 'sensitive skin'. Shows were great and staff was helpful and pleasant. Those with the most direct contact spoke the best English. Resort offers English lessons to staff and is the second highest paying resort in Punta Cana.Great holiday.Only saw a few 'complainers'. One lady who claimed to have waited 3 hours for the Asian....She'd lined up long before it opened, causing others to line up too and then only wanted hibatichi, wouldn't take menu or sushi bar......She could have been eating sushi immediately when the restaurant opened.One who used her internet time up and then gave the lovely worker a hard time because the @ sign didn't work. He explained it was a Spanish set up on that particular keyboard and showed her how to use ALT 64 to get the sign but she was just trying to get money back after checking her mail.One man said he'd been to Dominican several times and this was the best staff he'd seen!There are lots of male 'maids' so think about treats for men too when taking trinkets. Our maid even wrote us a thank you note.Enjoy your stay. Its a beautiful place to spend a week.

<Content>Great holiday We loved the EdenH. Check-in was quick  the front desk staff spoke very good English. We found our own way to the room  bags were there within a few minutes. We鈥檇 booked an oceanview room  were very happy with the room and the view (rm. 1348). We were on the 3rd floor in building one, overlooking the pool and with a great view of the ocean. We had no trouble with mosquitoes  only killed 3 in the room all week. The beach  the ocean are very nice  we walked for miles up and down the beaches to the right and left of the resort. The buffet was great and the awesome omelettes by Felix are delicious. We tried 3 of the 4 restaurants for dinner and thought that they were good, but not great. We don鈥檛 like to line up for dinner, so we went down about 6:30 and got a beeper for the 2nd sitting. Then we went to the buffet  had a light appy and a glass of wine and waited for the beeper to go off. The staff was usually happy and hard working, quick to refill coffee  wine. The beach buffet was good but with a limited healthy selection. Our room was cleaned everyday, although on a few days it wasn鈥檛 done until 5 P.M. which makes it hard to have a shower before dinner. Mini-fridge was stocked everyday, and after trading our regular cokes for diet cokes on the first day, we found diet cokes in the fridge every time after that. We didn鈥檛 have to wait very long at any of the bars to get a drink. We even got Malibu rum with our green wristbands, so unless you really like top shelf drinks, upgrading may not be worth it. We weren鈥檛 impressed at all with the gym so don鈥檛 plan on having much of a work out. The doors of this facility were left open instead of using AC which allowed mosquitoes a feasting opportunity; the music was always too loud even though we continually turned it down staff would turn it up high again; the equipment is probably 4th or 5th grade; washroom was filthy with no t.p.Check out was very easy and they keep the luggage secure until the shuttle comes to take you to the airport. We consider ourselves low-maintenance people so it would depend on your expectations and/or needs. We just wanted good food, clean facilities, friendly staff, soft sand, ocean and relaxation, which we received in abundance, so we consider it a successful trip.

<Content>Great Resort Our family - 6 adults stayed at the Eden from March 20 to 27th. We upraded to the VIP rooms. Check in was very quick and we were handed a drink right away and a cool washcloth. Our rooms were pefectly located. Four of us came from Toronto and two from Vancouver so we were not sure if we would be in the same buildng as - we were all together. The rooms were great - had everything we expected - rum, fruitplate, upgraded bathroom amentites. There were a couple of problems with the rooms but they were fixed right away. Our pool was a minute from our room and the swim up bar was great. Ramon and Carlos made our week. We got our chairs every morning around the pool. Our daughter-in-law did get up at 6:00 a.m. and stayed until 7:00 a.m. so that she could get our umbrellas too. Apparently the sun rise was worth the wait. I don't think you would have to get up this early but we did it because the 6 of us wanted to be together. Breakfast at the Italian restaurant was lovely, quiet and service was great. The buffet breakfast was also fast, good food and service was great. We ate at the beach restaurant for lunch and it was fine. Dinner was good. We managed to eat at all the a la carte restaurants without too much of a problem. Our in-room lobster dinner with champagne was beautiful. We did not see many of the shows. The circus was good. We did see the show in the theatre - I think it was called Picante. It was the best show we have ever seen. If you stay at this hotel, it is a must to see. We have travelled down south for the 14 years and have never seen anything like it. We found all the bars great. The pink bracelet really helps. All the staff we met were friendly and we had no problem with them speaking English. I almost changed hotels due to the bad reviews, but I am glad we didn't. I hope we will be able to go back to the Eden but next year it will probably too expensive.

<Content>Great Trip We had a great time at this resort from March 17-25. The room was large,clean and quite luxurious(huge bathroom shower).There was a large whirlpool tub on our balcony .We were on the third floor next to an empty lot so it was quite private.Not the same on the ground floor!! The beach was beautiful and the water was warm for swimming.The beach was closed for swimming for two days because of high waves from an offshore disturbance which I was told is not common at all.Our group spent a lot of time at Paradice pool #1.Ramone and Carlito made our time at the pool so much fun it was hard to go anywhere else without comparing the service.Paradice pool #1 won this contest hands down. The food was good at the buffet(we only ate at 1 a la cart------------don't care to line up for meals)We did eat breakfast at the Italian restaurant almost every morning.(pink bracelet only)the food was excellent and it was not as noisy as the buffet.Eddie andYudy treated us like family and went out of their way to please us. The only person who I would consider was not very friendly was a lady at the casino.It seemed to be quite a chore for her to make change the two times that I needed it.No problem ,everybody else more than made up for that.The nightly entertainment started a bit late for me but the restaurants don't close till 10 so that gives the late eaters a chance to see the show.They have a large theatre but Ididn't see anything going on it there the week Iwas there.Probably could use it for shows(local dancers etc.)something for middle age guests.the weather was very nice.80-90 all week.Lots of sun(sun block a necessity)and an umbrella comes in very handy during a day at the pool.We did not do the tour thing or any of the extra's.Our group were content to sit in the sun walk the beach and do a little shopping in the shops run by the locals.

<Content>Excellent Time Buffalo, NY  We stayed March 20-27 and had a wonderful time! We braced ourselves for the worst and almost changed hotels! Thank goodness we didn't! The grounds are beautiful and coming along great. We had no problems checking in or out, very nice room facing the courtyard of the hotel and could see the ocean. We were green and loved everything! A couple of minutes wait for drinks, servers all day bringing drinks as well! I can't imagine all the negative, I wondered if this was the same hotel at times. Workers always working, but never banging or bothering us at all. The beach was white, bit of seaweed, but they always were cleaning it up and the water was sooo clear. We seen only a few mosquitos after our rooms were cleaned and the doors were open.  Chairs-the first few days, they were almost all taken by 8:30 ish, and the umbrellas earlier. I am an early bird, so it was fine. There was only 2 of us, so even when we came down at 10 or noon one day, we found chairs by the pool. We never sit on the beach. By the end of the week, chairs and umbrellas everywhere all day. Their busy season is coming to an end. We brought tubes, never used them once, but would be a good idea for children.  The shows were really good, the bars were nice, not party like, relaxing, remember that before you book. It is a spa like hotel.  Food was excellent. Buffet always had a huge variety. The a la cartes were good as well, Asian our favorite. We never waited in line, some did, we came down around 7, sometimes given a beeper, had a few drinks and called over. Other times we walked right in.  Go and enjoy people. because next year the prices will soar! This is my fourth time to the Dominican, 2nd to punta cana! We travel every year somewhere all inclusive and this was awesome!

<Content>What a great place! After reading so many negative reviews prior to going to this resort, we went with much anxiety. I was such a pleasant surprise. This is going to be a long review because I would like to cover everything possible. Arrival-Punta Cana Airport, whisked through and onto a bus, comfortable, ac, great guide. Arrived at hotel in 20 minutes, Bags were taken care of, no lline for check-in. Told the clerk what we preferred (8 of us) and we had rooms on 1st floor half way betwen the beach and the buffet and plaza. The room was very large (standard) and beautiful. Marble floors throughout (entire resort) Jacuzzi in bath, also large shower and lavatory. The toilet and shower had frost ed glass doors which gave privacy. There was a large approx 5x6 foot opening over the jacuzzi looking into the bedroom. If this is a problem bring something to hang over it. One family brought a sheet and duct tape. We are an older couple and didn't mind. The fridge is kept restocked every day with soda, beer and water. If you prefer more or a different kind they will happily oblige. If you are ready to have the room serviced p;ut the sign on the door handle. Put the do not disturb sign on the door any time you do not want to be disturbed. They do frequent checks on the rooms to be sure they are being serviced properly. The Beach-georgeous! Plenty to do-windsurfing, sunfish, Hobie cats, being towed on a tube or banana boat.Parasailing and ultralite raft rides. An army of people are out early every morning raking the beach to remove seaweed and any debris. I never saw a piece of trash the entire 7 days. They bring out a canoe and cut pineapples, melons, etc and put them on skewers for everyone to enjoy, There is also a grill down by thewater. The pools are large and clean. They are surrounded by chairs on the edge as well as chairs on the multiple pavilions that surround them. Yes,at times there are not enough chairs-more are still coming. Our way of dealing with this was the guys got to the beach at 7 and set up our chairs under two tiki huts with towels and other personal items on them.Then they went to the buffet for a boys coffee klatch. We were all out there by 8-8:30, and never had a problem. Food at the beach was great-a large grill and buffet under a large tiki roof. Terraced so you had a great view of the beach while eating. There was always grilled chicken, hot dogs and hamburgers plus an additional item. (fish, skewers). The staff is very attentive, always asking if you want another drink, etc. The bartender at the swim up bar is a real showman, must see to appreciate. Always stuff for the kids-ice cream etc. Main bufet-in the style of Vegas. Many, many selections. Some are navtive dishes, and they are worth a try. There is always a carving station which included on different nights, beef, lamb, pork, ham, turkey, salmon and local fish. One night was lobster, shrimp and various other seafood. The selections are always varied. Other restaurants-forget it! Ate at the American, great service,  half a lobster, and a piece of steak. It was ok, but not what we are used to. We Americans are very spoiled when it comes to steak. Don't expect what you are used to. But, The meat is very tender and flavorfull, especially the beef on the grill. They also grill a variety of other meats for lunch and dinner. There is an omelet maker in the morning (Felix) he is amazing! We walked out of the Italian restaurant because we had waited 45 minutes and had not even gotten our salads. Menu was mostly pizzza, and a selection of pasta and sauces. Two waiters for a full restaurant and the hostess was not pleasant. The restaurant that most people were trying to get into was the Asian hibac hi because it had good reviews. Line for beepers started at 5 for 6:30 opening.Unless you have a team to take turns it is hard. Of course we are older and no one felt it was worth it, since we enjoyed the bufet so much. Entertainment-In addition to the staff,who were often very entertaining themselves, the shows were good! They were held in the plaza (outfdoor) and there was a variety.One night it was non-stop carribean music and dances who were amazing. Men walking on stilts seemed to glide. Lots of picture opportuinities. Kids loved it.Had face painting and made balloom hats for the kids. Got exhausted just watching. One night was Jazz, Sinatra,Ella fitzgralds, etc, anothe night, Circus with trapeze artist,another,vegas lounge act singer and impersonator. Was it Broadway?No, but it was entertaining and pleasant after a day at the beach a great dinner,and wonderful tropical drinks.- Don 't miss The Dirty Monkey, Domincan Sunrise, Mango Martini just to name a few. The power and air conditioner in your room is controlled by a card in a slot inside the door. The staff always left one in our slot so the air was running as much as you wanted. We often turned it off for a while at the thermostat, usually at night. Any credit card shaped card works in the slot. If the power goes out, it happened twice for a few minutes y ou must removed the card and replace it to turn the electric back on in your room. Mosquitoes-saw a few, swatted them. We live in South Jersey and ours are the State Bird. These were minis. If you need your room sprayed they will come and spray for y ou. We were on the first floor and they were no problem. Don t leave the sliding doors open! THE STAFF-I cannot find enough complimentary adjectives to describe them. The Dominican people are beautiful in both looks and manner. I cannot even imagine the ratio of staff to guests but it was more than ample. There is also a great deal of supervision. There was always a manager in sight, and they usually spoke the most fluent English. The housekeepinhg staff is is least fluent, but we could usually sign language our way to understanding. The staff truly makes your enjoyment their mission. It made us feel good just to be around them. They are proud of their country, and rightly so. They were always spotless and professional. We shared many laughs as they attempted to teach us their language and we ours. If your can't find a bar there you are blind! Would we go back? Definitely! Will we be able to afford it? Don't know, it is certainly a 41/2 star resort now and certainly will be a 5 star by next year. Upgrades-didn't find it necessary. Little larger room(maybe)robes in room, and top shelf liquor. (which you can get for an addition charge per drink:) One of our party did it once to get Absolut and after that didn't bother. The tropical drinks and thebeer were so good it didn't seem worth nearly $500 per couple. That's all I can think of. If you are going there you are lucky, have a dirty monkey for me!

<Content>Great Vacation Great VacationArrived in Punta Cana March 17 about noon from Halifax. The flight was fine. Check in when we arrived was very fast 5 minutes maybe. We then headed to our room which was ready, wonderful. We changed and headed to the pool. Pools very nice, two in center of complex and one at each end of the U shaped buildings. VIP pools. Service at bars friendly and fast Danny makes a awesome cappacino martini this is his specialty.Food at buffet very good we could always find something to satisfy, we did not try the buffet at lunch but heard it was good. We usually ate at the beach buffet or what was being cooked on the beach that day. The a la cartes very good, because we were a party of two of we did not have any trouble getting into a la cartes no wait at all even if we went after 700pm.Room service very quick, the club sandwich is great.Rooms nice, new, clean, beds comfy, bathrooms large, tub on deck we used twice but our neighbors used it just about everyday. You can hear the water running next door when tub being used but conversations are never heard when jets on. Good thing!!We had room 1465 our view was of the condos next door, no view of the beach but this was a nice view and very private. The Beach was wonderful we love to walk and could walk in either direction for hours.Use of computer is great and easy.Bars in the evening were good. We visited them all. The Tantra Bar is a lot of fun. We partied with some fun Islanders there a few nights. Resort full the week we were there and it was during the Easter weekend and we were not effected in anyway by the holiday.Service great a lot of hard working staff everywhere, no shortage of them and always helpful. I guess that is all we have to say it was a very relaxing and enjoyable trip. We did not have any issues at all!!!!Have a good oneKel

<Content>It was Fine! We stayed 3/19 to 3/26. We had a great time. Yes the dinner system is different but improving. Last year we stayed at the Riu Palace and I had to stand in line every morning to make a reservation. Here you stand in the evening. People need to understand 1300 people can not all be seated at once. Housekeeping needs more experience ( forgot towel twice but repalced them when asked). Staff is very friendly. I know for most people it it easer to complain. As we were checking in ( yes it took 15 minutes) a women behind us was already complaining! They saod they have more chairs on order. The chair situation was my only complaint but this is caused by the people who get there Two came to the pool at 8am took 12 chairs for their group and did not return till 11am!!!! Sorry but most people would rather compain than just relax!!!

<Content>Don't be afraid Just returned from a week at the Edenh. Please do not believe everything you read! This is my 6th trip to DR and have always stayed at 5 apple resorts. The hotel is clean, well-staffed, good food, nice pool, etc. The hotel was sold out because of it being Holy week. We were able to eat at the Hibachi, Italian and American Grille, which were all pretty good. There are no reservations--if someone from your group gets in line at 6:00 you will eat at 6:30 at that restaurant. There is waitress service at the beach and pool, The girls also bring trays of little sandwiches and cookies around during the day. There is also a woman cutting fresh fruit in the afternoon on the beach as well as a barbeque on the beach each day. The sports bar is a nice asset since the bowling alley isn't open--kids could play pool, cards and watch the basketball tournament on big screen tv. Mosquitos---only on the back balcony.Power outage---did happen one evening for about 20 mins but did not really interefere with anything--it was about 5:30 PM. I had a room w/o a hole in the bathroom wall but bring a shower curtain to hang just in case.  The grounds are nice, people are friendly, food is good, go and enjoy!

<Content>Great Vacation Spot Just back from a fabulous vacation at the Edenh! We were lowly green banders and had a room overlooking the lively local scene - so no ocean view, no slippers in the room or anything like that - and we still had an absolutely wonderful time. In fact, I kind of preferred the local view. I mean, we were in the midst of the beautiful grounds of the Edenh all day. So it's not like we missed anything. I don't think the chair war is as bad as people say (or maybe just not as bad as it was in the beginning). Shade though is definitely at a premium. If you want a shaded pavilion by the pool, you pretty much had to be out there by around 6:30 or so and you had to stay there til after security/staff went through and removed un-watched stuff. Umbrellas were still available by around 8 or 8:30 though. A lot of people were at the same spots by the pool all week long - you kind of find your spot, figure out when you need to get there, and adopt the same strategy all week long. Of course, we had a large group and were able to split the getting-up-early duty, so it might be more of a hassle if there are fewer of you. Food at the a la cartes was sort of hit or miss. Not really worth standing in line. Sometimes too salty, sometimes just kind of not very good. So we never stood in line. If there was seating available when we ready to eat, we sat. If not, we didn't. We ended up spending about half our dinners at the a la cartes, half at the buffet. The great thing about the buffet is that there is plenty of food to choose from (unless you are vegetarian - slimmer pickings, for lunch and dinner anyway). I am a bit of a food snob and was able to find something I liked at every meal. Sitting outside at the buffet, by the fountains, was nice, especially at night with the moon. But the a la cartes were definitely a nice change of pace every other night or so - the food is no better but you get served, the tables are nicer, the restaurants were generally quieter than the cafeteria-like buffet interior, etc. Best meal was breakfast, at the buffet. Oh, and the self serve soft serve all day long!!! Some things to bring: ones for tipping by the pool (for drinks and umbrellas or chairs, if you get help in the AM moving them); other small bills for buying souvenirs if you want (from either the gift shop or the annoying vendors down the beach); a dark sheet and thumbtacks for putting up over the open space if you've got a deluxe room and are sharing it with someone with whom you'd like a little more privacy when brushing your teeth or whatever; maybe a little light of some sort to put in the bathroom so you don't have to turn the big light on at night if you get up; books to read and games to play; sun screen (it is very expensive if you forget it); bug spray just in case (although we never used ours - I only saw two mosquitos all week - they spray the grounds every night). Took our snorkeling gear but never even pulled it out of the suitcase. Didn't see anybody in a kayak or any other non motorized boat all week long. We were looking forward to the kayaking but it was just too windy. We ended up spending most of our time by the pool.I don't know that I'll ever do another D.R. resort vacation because there are too many other places to go and things to do. But if I did, I would definitely look into Edenh.

<Author>Refreshing
<Content>Awesome! Just returned from Eden H from March 19-26.... awesome. Here is the good news!Mosquitoes - saw one in elevator - that was it!Room - fantastic - had open bathroom concept and was with 15 year old son - took the suggestion and brought a dollar shower curtain down with us and it worked great!Service - wonderful...always waited on. and we only had a green bracelet but found if you are genuinely nice to the staff they are nice to you. We found that some guests with the upgraded bracelets felt that they deserved so much more. It was funny. We were nicer to the staff and got waited on more...maybe this is the secret. Reception - no line up.No clock but received one first day on request The evening shows were fantastic!Food - expected long line ups and for sure I waited 30-45 mins. to get in but so what.... enjoyed especially the Asian restaurant. The staff are the nicest. Met so many and all were nice. Alex at pool bar, Danny at Guest services, Antonio at the front desk. Beach chairs - did get up every morning and put towels on chairs at 6 a.m. .... not a problem until a new group of tourists arrived on our last day and several were loud and obnoxious... took our towels and threw in sand and then took chairs.... never happened before this... the group that were there before them couldn't believe what was happening..not resort fault, just demanding visitors! They didn't think we knew who they were but we all did!Beach was wonderful ..water warm, lots to do. This is the 3rd time to this area , all at 5 stars and this was the best. If you go with a positive outlook and ignore the reviews you will be just fine but if you go looking for ever little thing to go wrong then it will. Some days the elevator didn't work to the fourth floor (we stayed in 1408) but guess what ...if you walked a few steps down the hall there were more elevators. So some found this a problem?Hotel is beuatiful.All marble floors and fountains. Lots of happy people. The resort next door tries to get you to go in and see there so called 5 resort. Don't go...they promise you a free week next year but you waste 2-3 hours as they try to pitch their resort. The atmoshere in theirs was hostile compared to Eden H.. And we never did receive our free week and wasted a beautiful afternoon looking at the next door resort!Some complaints in this trip advisor mentioned too many security....they were wonderful...all dressed professionally in white and kept an eye on everything.Yes we definitely will go back next year.

<Content>EdenH Great Time Had By All To all of you who have booked EdenH, go and have a great time.We just got back on March 24. There where 9 of us from Ontario and 5 from Montreal.The staff at the front desk where excellent and spoke English very well. The rooms were nice even with the opening in it, we had room 1229 facing locals who were always having a good time. Bring a night light so as not to wake your roomate when using the washroom in the middle of the night.The bars where great and if you like white wine it was great. Get the light coloured one it tastes good. Everyone else drank Red and thought it was good as well.The Buffet was good, the Italian was great, and the Grill was good as well. We did not stand in line at 5:00p.m. to get a table but managed to get in to 2 of the a la cartes at 7:30 both evenings and there was 6 people in our group for dinner.The pools are amazing. We where there during Easter week and the beach was Black Flagged Thursday and Friday. Not a big deal we sat by the pool anyways.Got up at 6:30 every morning to get chairs and there was usually some left by 7:30. Got my chairs and sat and read til 8:00 in my PJ's.Just ask some of the employees by the pool and they will get you umbrellas, chairs, towels for a tip. You will have to buy adapters in the gift shop to plug anything in. The only plug in that we did not need an adaptor for was behind the TV. Some said they had no problem but could not plug in my phone charger and IPod charger.This resort is great. Yes we upgraded to a pink bracelet which allowed us use of the VIP pool bars which was a plus. Gotta love Malibu Rum and Pinneapple juice YUMMY.Go have a great time. The staff is wonderful, they all seem to enjoy their jobs.What needs to improve is they need to open Beach Grill for breakfast at 6:30 a.m. for early risers instead of only having buffet open at 7:00 a.m.. Coffee down at the beach would be great at 6:30 in the morning.

<Content>Edenh = Paradise Returned last night from a wonderful week at Edenh Resort. Had a fabulous vacation! The food was excellent, drinks cold, beautiful beach and pool areas. We flew Sunwing out of Charlottetown, which I would rate as fair at best. Staff really go out of their way to make sure that you have a great time!

<Content>Great Time!!! I would have liked to give this place a 4.5 rating but there is no option for it.We stayed march 23 for the weekPretty much everything that anyone has said on this website is true to a point. But its not nearly as bad as rating this place a 1,2 or 3. Yes the resort is new, so it still needs to grow into itself, and ya there were some mosquitoes, but theres mosquitoes everywhere this time of year down there so what to people think?The rooms are awesome. beach is great. food is great. people are great.We had green wrist bands mind you so some pools were reserved, the restaurant line is about the only thing that i didnt like, ya sure we got a beeper but... it still took a really long time to get food sometimes.overall this place is a 4.5star as it stands, but you get 5 star accommodation.

<Content>The Best and The Worst Just returned from EdenH Real Arena March 26, 2008. Experienced a wonderful vacation in a beautiful new resort setting on the beach near Bavaro. The best:Rooms are very spacious and well equiped. Had a King Size bed, couch, chair, desk, small bar fridge stocked daily with water, beer, soft drinks. The bathroom is large with double sinks, walk-in shower and separate toilet in glassed walled partition. Hair dryer in the bathroom and shampoo and soap. Brought our own soap as what they have is a bit different. Take a bar of your favourite soap with you.TV in room gets about 100 channels on satelite with about 40 english channels including CNN, ESPN, Fox, etc. Our remote did not work but we just got up and turned the chanels on the set.The resort is just beautiful. Liked the separate swimming pool and bar for Paradise Club rooms. It was not as busy as the main pool. Never had a problem getting a drink there. Robert, the bar tender, is just excellent. The food is generally quite good. Some things a bit different - the pork is different that in North America - not bad just different. The Creme Brulee in the French restaurant is not like you would get in North America or France - it is more like an egg custard - not bad just different. The hamburgers are different than you would get in North America as well. Not bad just different....I suspect they are mixture of beef and pork, as pork in plentiful there and beef is not.The Asian restaurant has a Hibachi Grill that is just excellent and is a must - great food and entertainment combined. The steak house uses U.S. beef but you can only get it medium or well done. There is no rare available. The steak was pretty good - not excellent, just pretty good. Lots of good seafood here if you like that.The buffet has a good selection and they are now trying different theme nights to vary the food a bit so it is not the same every day. Staff are all wonderful and we had great service from Eddy and Yudy in the Italian Restaurant. Paradise Club rooms can eat here for breakfast instead of the buffet and the cook eggs, etc. to order - poached, whatever you wish. It is quieter than the buffet at breakfast. This was a great benefit.In room dinner was beautifully presented and was a welcome break from going out every night. One of us ordered the lobster and one steak. The steak was the best - the lobster just O.K. - we got the body, not the claws or tail. Order steak instead of lobster. The bar selection is very good with premium liquors. The Paradise Club room folks get the best brands. We only went to one evening show in the theatre and it was a Jazz singer - Chris Blizzard - who was excellent and the show well done. Again only one bar tender at the bar in the theatre. We did one off site excursion - Bavaro Runners Safari. They take you to a local home, farm, sugar cane plantation, cigar factory and get to see the real D.R. This is a very worthwhile excurison and not too expensive. TIP: Take some school supplies as these folks support a local school and the students have to buy all their supplies - paper, pencils, etc. Many cannot afford this so go without. The worst.There are mosquitoes there. We took a can of fly and mosquito spray and used it in our room every night and that worked like magic to kill any. When they make up your room the door is left open for half an hour and the mosquitoes come in then. Take a can of mosquito spray and also some repellant for the evenings for yourself like OFF with Deet. The workmanship in some areas leaves a bit to be desired. The rooms have beautiful dark stained doors and closets and these were installed before they painted and paint is all over these. No light in the shower - just a hole in the ceiling. There was a switch for it but no light. One of the electrical recepticals in the bathroom was falling out of the wall. Lots of little things that could have been done better but this did not stop from having a wonderful time. Beach lounge chairs - definintely not enough for 660 rooms with two or more people. They have received some more and more are on their way but it is a bit of a pain. You have to reserve a lounge chair before 8:00 AM or you don't get one until about 5:00 PM. They need to get some more and also prevent people from reserving them so early. Some chairs were reserved by 6:00 AM and then the folks did not show up until after lunch. This is not fair to other guests folks. They should initiate a policy that if a chair is not used for an hour the stuff gets removed and someone else gets to use the chair. At peak time all the chairs are reserved but only about half being used. Restaurant reservations:There is no reservations. You show up and get in line to get abeeper . Then you wait until they beep you. One night it was 10 minutes and the next night 2 hours. You can go and have a drink while you are waiting but how many before dinner drinks can one have, especially when hungry?!! Most resorts let you book the restaurants when you arrive for the week and let you reserve three or four nights maximum. Here there is no reservation system just show up but there is also no limit on the nights you go. You can to the ala carte every night if you wish. We saw one guest finish a meal at the Italian restaurant and then they went and got in line for the Asian right after - two in one night. Meanwhile some wait for two hours to get into one. If you to eat early (the restaurants open at 6:30 PM which is not really early) you need to line up a 5:00 PM. Kind of a waste of vacation time. We went around 7:30 and one night was 10 minutes and the next night two hours. The bars are very good but they need more than one bar tender at each bar. I noticed the lobby bar had two bartenders by the end of the week we where there. If you want a drink on the beach go up to the pool bar. There is one server getting drinks on the beach but with over 1,000 guests she can not get to them all.Bring some one dollar U.S. bills to tip once in a while. Even though it is all inclusive you do get better service if you leave a dollar at the bar, restuarants, and in your room. The staff work hard and deserve this little extra. You can afford it as well. It is hard to get change there. The front desk rarely has change and they send you to the bell man who always has change. The bell man will give you 19 U.S. dollars for US $20. He tells you up front - it's not a tip it's a service fee for him. I don't appreciate that. If I want to tip I want to decide - not be forced to. Overall, the best overrode the worst. It did not stop us from having a wonderful vacation. This is a very beautiful resort. The beach is great, the staff are great. FINAL TIP:Take malaria pills as there is a warning on Heath Canada website about malaria in this very area. This is real - not a joke. We took them and had no problems in spite of some bites. AND DON'T EAT ANYTHING AT THE PUNTA CANA AIRPORT! I witnessed several people that had been there waiting for flights and eating there getting violently ill and throwing up. This is a third world country and the food/drinks at the airport are not safe. The have some U.S. chains there like Wendy's and after a week at a resort, there is a temptation to eat there. The water to make ice is likely contaminated and the lettuce and tomatoes on the burgers are washed in the same contaminated water. Eat before you leave the resort!!!!!!!!!!!!! Don't ruin your vacation.

<Content>Great Week at Edenh We stayed at EdenH the first week of March and had a great time. Reading some of the negative reviews has been amusing because we heard some of the same complaints loudly expressed while we were there - - probably by the same people who wrote the bad reviews. You'd think that demanding people would relax a little when they're on vacation, but that doesn't seem to be the case. EdenH was our choice because of the exceptional rates. Everyone knew this was a newly-opened resort which means there are still problems to work out. We saw a few mosquitoes in our room but just got rid of them. One lady was freaking out because there was a mosquito in her room. This is a tropical climate, right? Has she never had a mosquito in her house?We were green bracelet people and were glad we didn't upgrade to pink, after talking with the pink people. If you want expensive liquor and your own private bar, then go for the pink.There were only two problems that we saw. We didn't get up at 5:30 a.m. to get chairs. We just used beach towels and got chairs as they became available. The problem is the guests who go out early and reserve both beach and pool-side chairs. As the couple we traveled with said, A reserved chair has a body on it. If the resort gets 3,000 chairs to accomodate two chairs for each person, there won't be room on the beach or at the pool. I'm not sure what the other resorts do, but it's the guests who are the problem.We waited in line for some of the specialty restaurants, but we do that here at home for two restaurants that don't take reservations. The only problem we had was that our beeper didn't go off one night, so we didn't get into the American restaurant until 9:30. Our best meal was in the Italian restaurant where there was never a wait. The Asian and Romantic were very good also. Other than those two things, we loved it. I worried about glass on the beach from reviews we saw before we left but never saw any glass or other litter. The entertainment was varied and great. When we asked for chairs to be brought out into the courtyard in the evening, there was a young man (I wish I had gotten his name) who worked hard to be sure everyone had a seat.The buffet had a good variety of food. You can't help but have a good day when Aleta greets you at the door with her great smile, Malagy makes you a smoothie to order, Elvis and Felix (Felix had the incredible ability to remember people's names and country of origin after meeting you once!!) made watching your omelet fun, and Gabriel served us our vitaminas (coffee) each morning with a super sense of humor. This isn't hotel related, but we took three trips away from the resort which were very good. We went to Saona Island which is a paradise (take advantage of the massage on the beach). The safari mountain tour was a fun experience with horse-back riding, visiting a local home and a school, and dinner up on the mountain. One morning we hired a taxi and drove to Higuey to see the basilica and a local market. So we didn't spend 24/7 at the resort, but we enjoy meeting the people.As we were waiting for our bus to take us to the airport, it was interesting to watch people. It seemed that a smile and an attempt at Spanish (the resort is in a Spanish-speaking country, right) brought a lot more attention than yelling at the staff. We agree with another review that we probably won't be able to afford this resort a year from now, but - - if we could - - we would go back.

<Content>Not A Terrible Place To Stay We just returned from a week at the Edenh (March 15-22). After reading all the terrible reviews we were expecting the worse! Actually, it was very nice! It was beautiful but will be much more lusch once the plants mature. Check in was quick and painless. Most of the front desk staff spoke English. Our room was clean. The chair situation is somewhat a problem if you didn't get up early to reserve. The restaurants were not that great and the service was long so we decided to stick to the buffet the rest of the trip, which got somewhat redundant. The beach was definately the most beautiful in the area. The mixed drinks were good but a little weak. Alex at the pool bar kept us entertained our entire stay. We tipped him at the beginning of each day and he took wonderful care of us! We met alot of great people during our stay. This is a great place to stay but don't expect to be waited on hand and foot. If you treat the people with dignity and respect they will treat you the same!

<Content>Five + Star for Food, Service and Ambience Stayed at the Edenh Real from March 8 - March 15. We were a group of six female co-workers, all a little apprehensive because of the recent reviews. This was my ninth trip to DR and Cuba - mostly five star resorts. Check in - our flight was delayed (weather) by five hours. Arrived at 2:00 am, checked in immediately and escorted to rooms, all third floor, building one. All three rooms were on the same floor (obviously they did their best to keep our group together). My room however, had the spectacular view of pool and ocean, whilrlpool on balcony. The others had the same room design but faced the back of the resort. The next day I politely explained to the desk that I had a better view than my friends and both rooms were reassigned - one beside mine, the other ten doors down, same side. Everybody happy now! We enjoyed our jacuzzis every night - no mosquitoes (more about that)Rooms are spaceous, clean, all modern amenities. Linens/ towels / toiletries / bar supplies were changed daily (thank you Carlos). Fruit trays and bottle of rum arrived the first day. If you ask at ANY bar, they will give you a bottle of wine for your room every evening. Enjoy! The beach - incredible beach. We walked every day and noticed ours was the cleanest beach by far. Chair situation - a non-issue for us. we secured six chairs in the same premium spot on the beach every day by taking turns between 6:15 - 7:15. We would enjoy the pool mid-afternoon without any difficulty getting chairs. Did notice the beach was busier on some days more than others. Beautiful sun (we lucked out), sand and water! Did not get to snorkel...heard you had to travel to see any good reef activity. Food - Absolutely great. The Fiesta Buffet had lots of choices. Seafood night (Fri and Sat) had lots of variety. Breakfast, of course was consistently good (and yes, chat with Felix, the omelette chef). We LOVED the Italian restaurant ( went back twice...no waits) Romance a la carte our least favorite. Asian a la carte...incredible!!!! Beach buffet - very good but the same every day ( with some variety) . Beach Grille - excellent!!! Hamburgers, chicken, and the grilled dish of the day ...chicken stir fry delicious!! Drinks - consistently good, lots of variety, no waiting. Hello to Jose (beach bar) , Danny (VIP bar), and of course everybody's favorite Alexis (swim-up bar). Very entertaining. Please tip as you would at home!!!! (this goes for the entire staff.... I noticed for the first time in my travels, that guests are not tipping!!!) Entertainment - the usual... pool aerobics, yoga, dance lessons, painting lessons, drink sampling, cigar demonstration etc...The shows were the best yet ...Picante excellent (las vegas calabre)...circus show...entertaining.... Karaoke...fantastic!...white show (so...so), Dominican Night.... very good, Jazz singer/ chef show...excellent ....piano in lobby bar...awesome...missed the jazz show on Sat sadly because of our flight delay, the one everyone is talking about. Tantra Bar...quite unique....relaxing. If you want disco see Francisco and Marcillo in VIP lounge ...they will take you to the local Mango Disco. Ricardo, Jose, or any of the animators could also see you have a good time there. I personally like the ambience of this resort, they are certainly trying something unique to DR...with the incense, tantra feeling and subliminal enya music. You feel pampered and relaxed in the evening with a traditional taste of all Dominican activity in the daytime. Loved it! Service - by far the most incredible, genuine, caring service that I have ever experienced. Every need or concern was met. Special thanks to Radhime, Edward, Estelle, Victor, Saul etc..... Medical attention - One of our friends needed medical attention and was seen immediately (withing five minutes) by the resort physician then taken by ambulance to a clinic less than five minutes away - nothing serious in the end. We discovered that ALL employees have extensive medical training. Upon her return to the resort, she was constantly being checked on by the female physician and the management. Exceptional!!! The mosquito problem (?) - the only night that we had a few mosquitoes in the room, I had accidentally turned off the air conditioner before dinner and it was very hot during the night. I immediately woke up during the night and turned the AC on...problem fixed! EVERY night we partied on our balconies until the wee hours in our hot- tubs ....NO MOSQUITOES!!!!We did burn a coil after we came back from the show...but it was not necessary. USE YOUR HOT-TUBS and DON'T WORRY! Finally, a little advice to all who are booked to go to the Edenh.Do not be fixated on the reviews of this website, unless you are looking at the beautiful pictures, which, by the way, do not do this resort justice. Plan on relaxing, enjoy the fine food and drink, partake in all of the fun activities if you so choose, be entertained by the shows, walk the most beautiful part of the Bavaro Beach, watch

<Content>My two cents on the edenH We just returned on the 19th of March after a two week stay at the EdenH...we arrived at the airport with no problems and were at the hotel in no time...we had booked transat mirage so we checked in at the VIP room once we arrived...there were 7 of us in 4 rooms...I had requested the rooms be in close proximity and we were a bit spread out but still relatively close to each other...check is was quick and efficient...we were in building 2 but faced the construction...not a big deal really and there was no noise to speak of...there was however a pretty foul odor in our room...we had to phone for about three days to get someone to come address it but eventually they did and the problem seemed to dissipate...I think there was something wrong with the plumbing and the odor seemed to emanate from the air conditioning vent...other than that, the room itself was great...my 4yr old daughter actually loved the hole in the wall thing because she could watch tv while she was having a bath...we were never short of towels or any other bathroom/room amenities although we never did recieve the robes and slippers that were supposed to be part of our package...again, no big deal...unfortunately the chair wars was in full effect during our stay so we didn't get many chances to spend time at the beach...getting chairs by the pool was never an issue though and my daughter probably enjoyed swimming in the pools better than the ocean anyways...she also really enjoyed the kids club...she was pretty disappointed in the evening entertainment and the lack of dancing at the resort though...we also never managed to make it to any of the ala cartes either as the lines were way to long and with two small children in the group it just wouldn't have worked...I really didn't see it is too big of an issue though anyways...we ate at the buffet every night and the food was always very good with a terrific selection...I had gotten sick of the buffet at the Gran Bahia last year after two weeks but didn't find that here...I also really liked the size of the resort...it was just about right...as I had mentioned we went to the bahia last year and really did not like the huge size of it as you never really got to know any of the staff or other vacationers...we were not 'pink' bracelets but I really saw no difference in the treatment..as many others have said, a smile and a 'hola' go along way...will we go back, I doubt it...while there were lots of things I liked, it was outweighed by the overall atmosphere of the hotel which we found lacking...we go to the tropics for latin music and open air and all the restaurants and bars are closed in and air conditioned...just not really our thing, or our daughters...lastly, we travelled with my mother who uses a motorized scooter and accessibility was definitely a problem...the courtyard where most of the nightly entertainment is has absolutely no ramps and all the buildings are only accessible at the very end or at the very front...we did talk to PCMike while we were there and he assured us that they are aware of the problems in that respect and will be addressing them once the busy season is over...

<Content>We had a great time. We were there from Mar 13-20. This was our second trip to Punta Cana. Last year we were at the Grand Bahia Principe, which we loved.  I was expecting the trip from hell after reading all these reviews. In fact I even tried to change resorts with no luck. When we arrived check in was a breeze, everyone spoke english. Our room was standard, but I don't go to the DR to spend a lot of time in my room. We travelled with our 2 little girls and they too had a great time. The food was average and the buffet served the same food as the a la carte unlike our resort last year that really did the ala carte well. If you want to go to the restaurants be there by 6:00 and you will get first seatings. I did love the the champange and OJ served every morning in the buffet.. The fresh fruit was great too. My kids loved the soft serve ice cream they could get all day long. The drinks were enjoyable. Granted they did change from bartender to bartender, but hey, I was on vacation. If you're worried about that stick to the beer, everyone of those I had was the same. Now the only problem we did encounter was the chairs. I don't think the problem lies completely with the resort. The guests don't play fair. People were getting up at 5:30am and reserving chairs by both the beach and the pool. In fact most pool chairs were empty all day long with stuff on them and no sign of the people who owned the stuff. Even worse were people who saved chairs in both the sun and the shade. Shade chairs were prime real estate there, but very limited. I felt bad for the people who were with small babies or burnt and looking for relief from the sun. If everyone played fair there really wouldn't be a problem. To me it's not a holiday if I have to get up at 5:30 to get a beach chair. The one day we couldn't get a chair we paid one of the staff $2 and we got 2 chairs and an umbrella. So really no problem. They are working on this, if your stuff was left for more than an hour it was taken to the front desk. (Those who had their stuff removed would complain and say they were only gone for 30 mins, but they weren't.)Anyway with all that being said when you go remember this is a different country and they do things different. Go with an open mind and the right attidude and you will have a great time we did. I didn't have to work, shovel snow, cook or clean so I was off to a good start from there. Don't let these reviews scare you. If you want American standards go to Florida.

<Content>Honest Review Ok, so here is my 2 cents鈥 read every review about Edenh Real before going March 17 鈥?March 23. I was very worried because of the overwhelming amount of negative reviews. The resort is great!!! My fianc茅 and I are in our mid twenties and we really enjoyed our stay. We did not upgrade to the pink bracelets and were glad we didn鈥檛. The chair situation is fine unless you鈥檙e planning to stroll in at noon. We got up at 7:30 鈥?8 am and always found plenty of chairs at the pool and the beach, placed our towels on the chairs and went to breakfast. The food is better than average, if you expect quality that you find in 5 star Manhattan restaurants, you鈥檒l be disappointed, if you expect all-inclusive quality, you鈥檒l be pleasantly surprised. The Asian restaurant is pretty good, their sushi bar is also very nice, and there is no wait for that. The American Grill was also good. We ate at the specialty restaurants all 6 nights we were there. The lunch buffet at the pool is good as well. The room was not a problem with the opening in the wall opening for us, but I can see how it can be problematic for families with kids. The mosquitoes weren鈥檛 horrible, but we were on the third floor. The place is 25 minutes away from Punta Cana Airport. We got our room right away, without waiting. The shows were not your usual 鈥渟taff show鈥?that most all-inclusives offer, pretty interesting. This place is going to be very expensive once they work out all the wrinkles, so go now!

<Author>Outagamie
<Content>advice for a worry-free vacation at Edenh My boyfriend and I (late 20's) stayed at the Edenh resort March 7-14 and have to say we had a great time on our vacation. We knew that this resort had just opened up so we knew there would be some flaws. We read many reviews before leaving to go to this resort, and let me tell you, we were very nervous. Pleasantly, to our surprise, we had a great time at this resort. We made sure to take the advise of others so we were better prepared than lots of the other guests. Check in/RoomCheck in was very smooth, we were unpacking our bags 20 min after stepping foot at the resort. We stayed in room 1436 - beautiful view! Yes, the rooms do have the 6x6 opening and I can definely see this being a problem with families. The door to the toilet is just a frosted door that swings open and close, no lock. Besides the wierd opening, the room itself was beautiful. There is also a jucuzzi in the room, very big. The first day that we arrived, we did not have any water stocked in the mini bar. We threw a five dollar bill in the fridge with a note asking for lots of water and we came back to fourteen bottles! I think a little tip goes a long way here. Beach ChairsThe beach chair issue is true, you do have to wake up very early to get a chair. We were up every morning between 6:30-7:00am to get a chair by the beach or pool. We never had a problem finding a chair at this time (either beach or pool.) However, the last day that we were there, we got down to the beach at about 6:50 and not one chair available. We went to the pool and there were still plently of chairs there. We heard from another guest that he went down at 6:30 that same day and there weren't any chairs available at that time! I suggest getting down to the beach or pool early, tie your beach towel to your chair, put a book, or some other personal belonging on the chair and go back to your room. Just don't go down too early (I think around 6:00, we have seen security taking people's belongs that placed them down there too early.) Restaurants If you went with Apple, don't listen to the travel rep at the orientation when talks about the reservation system. She told us to get to get the specialty restaurants a half and hour earlier that the time that you would like to eat. This is very untrue. People are in line at 5:00 and the restaurants don't even open up until 6:30. We usually didn't even eat until 9-9:30. This is something that resort need solve. We did eat at the buffet several times, which had an excellent pasta bar. I thought that breakfast was great at the buffet, lots of varitety. Felix works at the omelet station and is excellent. He really gets to know everyone in line and is extemely friendly. EntertainmentThere are nightly shows performed outside resturant and lobby area. The shows start after 9:00pm, which I think is pretty late. There are several bars that you can choose from. The sports bar has two small pool tables and four small screened TV's. They do make very good Miami Vice's there (which I highly recommend trying!) The lobby bar gets pretty smokey, so we weren't in there too much and never made it to the Tantra Bar (which opened up later than we stayed up.) There are two bars at the beach/pool area and two at the pool area exclusively for the VIP's (pink wristbands) for a total of 4 at the beach area. We found that walking up and down the beach, Edenh has the best beach area. The employee's here clean up the seaweed constantly which we cannot say for the other resorts that we saw. WatersportsThere are plently of water sports available. Parasailing will run you about $90 per couple for 10-15 min. They also provide many free activities as well such as kayaks, windsurfing, and catamans (you will need to get a free lesson for these in the morning, so go down around 9:00am to sign up.) OverallThroughout our stay we met so many happy guests at this resort. We were not able to figure out how so many people could be writing all these bad reviews about this resort. We are receiving this resort at a discounted price and if you read the reviews you will have a heads up on all the people that were not smart enought to go and read reviews on this website. Just remember to get beach chairs early, be friendly to the employees, and be prepared to wait a little bit for the speciality restaurants. If you listen to this review you should have a great time at the resort.

<Content>Finally a good review! I just got back from Eden on Saturday. I stayed for a week. before going I was so nervous because almost every review I read was bad. I thought the resort was beautiful and we had a great time. I would recommend VIP bracelets if you prefer to drink better liquor and that is why we got them. If there were no chairs we would lay on a towel until someone left and it was only an issue one day. Every other day we got chairs at either the beach or the pool. Sometimes we had to wait for the restaurants but we got a beeper, had drinks, and went back. Even an hour to wait is normal anywhere where I'm from in Philly, so we didn't mind. One night we even just walked up and got a table so it is hit or miss. I dont think it is necessary to go before the restaurants open. Everyone that worked there was very nice and I learned some Spanish while I was there which made it even more fun. About the bug situation, I was expecting it so I brought Raid and sprayed my room when I got there. We had no problems for the rest of the week. Well, overall I thought it was great, so if you are planning on going have a great time!

<Content>Had a WONDERFUL time We stayed at Edenh Mar 15-20. We had read trip advisor many times about edenh prior to our arrival. at one point, we were ready to book a different hotel, but decided not to. We were very glad that we didn't. we had a wonderful time. when we arrived, we were greeted by the staff with a dominican sunrise, check in was a breeze, and were given a personal tour per cart by a bell boy. he even stopped by the swim up bar so we could get another drink. did i mention, that we were just the green wrist band people? we got to our room right away. upon arrival, we noticed that our toilet handle was broken, so we called to the front desk and someone was there to fix it within 15 minutes. we were in room 1435, which overlooked a small village. no problem, the people were quiet, not one misquito in our room. just one word of advice, make sure in the am you put out the you may enter sign or they may not clean your room. it took us 2 days to figure that out.Restraunts: we ate at all of them except the romantic. very good, hot food. for the asian and seafood place, we had to line up by 5:30 to be guaranteed a 6:30 seating. the other 2, if you were there between 6 and 6:15, you didn't have a problem getting in. it took us about 1 1/2 hours to eat each meal, they were a little slow at times, but were doing the best they could. and the more people you had in your party, the longer it took to make sure that everyone ate at the same time. the restraunts were always full. they do have a dress code, for men long pants and a collared shirt, no sandals. i don't think they fully enforce it though, because the men would wear sandals and they never said anything that i know of.Pool/Beach: as you know, had to be out by 7 to get a spot on the beach, if you were out by the pool by 8:30, you didn't have a problem getting a spot, depending on the size of your group. Nightlife: shows started a little late, 9:45, but that was to make sure everyone was done eating and could have the chance to see it. they did the shows out in the courtyard every night, but also had a theatre. Circus show was the best. Tantra bar is nice, opens at 9. casino is small, 5 blackjack tables, 1 texas holdem table, and about 25 slots. we did the zip line, which was a lot of fun. was 89$ and took about 4 hours all together. ride was about 45 minutes. the instructors were awesome, very fun and spoke good english. had 10 lines all togetheroverall, we had a great time. very relaxing. the resort was beautiful, and will be even more once all the greenery has had time to grow. the staff was wonderful to us. if you are nice to them and have a smile, they will treat you the same. we never had a problem getting drinks, maybe had to wait a few minutes when the bars were full. most staff understood english, never had a problem trying to tell them what we wanted. we would go back again anytime.

<Content>We had a fabulous stay!! We stayed at the Edenh from March 8 鈥?15th 2008. Our stay was beyond fantastic and our only complaint is that by this time next year we won鈥檛 be able to afford to stay there again!!We arrived at the hotel at approximately 5:30pm, our check in was smooth with absolutely no problems, the bell boy took our bags up to our second floor room in building two facing the pool. We booked a standard deluxe room (green bracelets) and were staying in a room with the open view from living and bathing areas. This did not effect out stay as we are a young couple in our 20鈥檚, but I do understand how this could be uncomfortable for a family/friends sharing a room. Two couples that we met on our 25 -30 min bus ride to the hotel did have trouble with check-in as the hotel had not placed their faxed reservations into the computer system yet, they told us this was rectified and were in there rooms within an hour or so. From start to finish we were in our rooms within 20 minutes. Our room was clean and spacious, with lots of clothing and storage space. Each day our room was cleaned by 4:30pm when we came up from the pool area. We received clean towels everyday and facecloths 2 out of the 7 days we were there鈥?No problem, if we needed to wash/dry our faces we used one of the two hand towels we were given each day. Each day we received the same amount of fresh towels as we had used. ie) we used two towels, we got two new towels!! Our room was stocked with 4 towels, 2 near the shower and 2 above the Jacuzzi. The bathroom was equipped with one small garbage can that was placed inside the toilet stall which I moved from inside the stall to just outside the stall door and the maid had no problem leaving it there all week. Because the garbage is small, we placed our empty water/pop bottles and cans on top of the bar and that seemed to leave an appropriate amount of space in the can for other types of waste. The maids do leave the doors open while they clean (understandably) and the mosquitoes do come into the room. On average we killed between 5-10 mosquitoes per day after the maid had been in our room. After we had 鈥渧iolently ended their lives鈥?(as I read in another review!), we were mosquito free for the rest of the evening. If we happened to be in our room for an extended amount of time I would light a citronella candle in our room which seemed to help a little. One day after the sea had gotten the best of my boyfriend, we spent the afternoon holed up in our room with the Do Not Disturb sign on the door, the maid service did not disturb us but did leave a note under the door stating that they had come to clean our room but didn鈥檛 because of our sign and if we required any towels or amenities to call guest services and they would be brought to us. One day we requested more water from the bar re-stocker and he had no problem giving us more than enough water bottles, we tipped him 1us dollar for his generosity and each day after that we received extra water. To be clear we did not tip to get the water, we asked politely and without demand and received our request, AFTER we received the service we tipped. Tip of advice fold up a piece of paper and slide into the electricity slot near the door in place of one of your room keys to keep your electricity/AC running, this will save you from having to reset your clock radio everyday.The grounds are beautiful, well kept and clean. Once the flowers and shrubs have grown more they will be magnificent. The fountains and water throughout the property are a nice touch, adds serenity to the atmosphere. The pools are beautiful, with a tranquil green hue. With mention of the pool brings me to the beach chairs. Each morning we would go down to the pool anywhere between 8:30 - 10:30am and would place our towels and belongings on two chairs. We generally did not have a problem finding two chairs, sometimes together sometimes not, but all you have to do is drag them together! One morning closer to 11, we couldn鈥檛 find any chairs and just as we were about to suck it up and lay on the pool deck, a nice couple graciously offered a chair that they had saved for their young son who was not using it. I had brought a blow up air pool mattress from home to use in the pool (it was great to place over top of the in-pool lounger for added comfort) just in case I had to use that to an alternative to a pool chair. One morning I woke up at 7:30am to save two chairs on the beach, once again they weren鈥檛 together in the same spot but all I did was drag those suckers together! As I was moving the chairs, a security guard came over and helped me move them. One couple we talked with, who had been at the resort for one week already had mentioned that he had noticed a difference in the chairs wars. He said the week before we arrived the chair saving had been very bad and that you couldn鈥檛 find a chair by 7:30am, but the week we had arrived, he said he noticed a younger crowd and that there were more chairs available later in the morning. The chair saving game is quite bad, but you can easily select the few who ruin it for everyone, I would observe hours going by with no body sitting in chairs that had been saved earlier than when we ventured down to the pool鈥?I guess you really can鈥檛 teach old dogs new tricks. All the specialty restaurants were delicious; we ate at all 4 restaurants each night, 3 times at the Asian (twice ala carte, once habatchi grill). Each night we would go down to the restaurants between 7:30 鈥?8:30 pm and receive a beeper with a wait between 30 - 45 minutes. One night when we went to the Asian we were able to walk right in at about 8:30pm for the ala carte seating. By our second night at the resort we realized we were going to have to line up for the hibatchi seating, so we asked the hostess Lorenza, who is actually very nice and accommodating if you talk to her with a little bit of respect and patience, told us we should line up at about 6:00pm to 鈥渞eserve鈥?a time for the hibatchi. We waited in line for 30 鈥?40 mins, had a drink and enjoyed the warm breeze. We decided not dress for dinner while we waited because we knew we wanted an 8:00pm seating at the habatchi, therefore we wore our beach attire, I was wearing a dress bathing suit cover up and flip flops and my boyfriend was wearing shorts, t-shirt and flip flops. Please take note that if you decide to use this advice, Lorenza WILL NOT let men make reservations in shorts, she would only let me approach her to make the reservation, which was fine by us. We then went back to our room to shower and dress for dinner. CRISIS SOLVED! The Italian restaurant had very good food my Italian boyfriend even commented that it was almost as good as his moms cooking! I think one of the main problems with the restaurant seating is that guests are lining up 1-2 hours before the restaurant opens, if I was standing in line for an hour before a restaurant even opened I would be pretty grumpy by the time I got to eat too, and that doesn鈥檛 even guarantee you a seat in the restaurant depending on how many people were in line before you! If guests trickled down between 6:15 鈥?6:30pm, instead of mass truck loads of guests hoarding the doors for hours I believe a lot more guests would be satisfied with the no reservation policy, not everybody rushes down to the local steak restaurant exactly at 4pm because that鈥檚 what time it opens at鈥ommon sense people鈥ot everybody can eat at 6:30! We would have either a late lunch or light snack from the beach buffet, where we could always find something to satisfy our cravings, and that would tide us down until we ate later in the evening. We had no complaints with the bars or bartenders, we saw no preference between green and pink bands, and frankly during the day the 鈥減inkies鈥?should have nothing to complain about as they have two bars just to themselves! One night in the sports bar, I felt as though the bartender was 鈥渓ooking past me鈥? so I patiently waited (5-7mins) but did not feel that it was appropriate to tip someone who had served people that had come after me first. That was the only semi-rude service we received all week. We found one gem of a bartender, aside from Alexis the swim-up bartender, named Miguel, he was fabulous always had a smile on his face, always shook our hands each time we cam to see him and always remembered our drinks. He worked in the lobby bar, or outside during the shows closest to the casino. The shows were very entertaining and what seemed to be quite original to our resort, we found the start time to be perfect, by the time we finished dinner and got a drink it was Showtime. One night there were not enough chairs so we politely asked an employee to get us four chairs and he did, as well some for other guests who had asked. All in all, I think a lot of the negative feedback this resort is receiving is not because of management not knowing how to run a resort its management not knowing how to deal with the rude American/Canadian way! A smile and a hola goes a long way鈥f your ideal vacation is to go to a resort and be treated with respect and gratitude, soak up the sun and enjoy the company of your travel companions, this place is for you鈥f your ideal vacation is to stay at a resort and be waited on hand and foot, with Egyptian cotton sheets and gourmet meals by wolf gang go to the nearest four seasons, because you wont find that in the Dominican Republic and no resort will make you happy. To those of you going to the Edenh soon go and enjoy it, and stop reading Trip Advisor, once you get there you will realize how much of your precious time you wasted listening to the petty complaints of others. It really was a standing joke with many of the guests about the 鈥渃omplaints鈥?on Trip Advisor.

<Content>The good and the bad Stayed at the Edenh Real Arena Feb 21 to Feb 28.The good the weather the beach the location was great.The bad not enough beach chairs. They do not take reservations at any of the restarants. They over booked. We paid $140.00 for the Paridise Club rooms. When we arived they didn't have any more club rooms. The only thing we got for the extra money was a privite check in and use of the adult pool and pool bar. The best part of our stay was the service we received at the Paredise club pool. Carlo's Carlo's and Ramon was outstanding. I would like to give them a message from Mac and karen HEY COLD BEER HERE!!

<Content>Loved it, Loved it, Loved it We stayed at the Edenh Real Arena Punta Cana from March 13-20 and had a fabulous vacation. We had booked our holiday through Signature Vacations in January before the resort had opened and once the resort opened I read the reviews on a daily basis. I was very upset to hear all the negative reviews and wondered what kind of resort had I booked for our winter escape. This was our fifth trip to the Dominican Republic and we were very concerned about how it would unfold. My husband and I decided that we would just make the best of it. We arrived at 11:30 PM, and were the only people checking into the hotel. Check in was fast and friendly as we received our Green Bracelets. A bellboy helped us to our room, which we believe was an upgrade to a Paradise Club room, and gave us a brief tour of the hotel so that we knew where things were in the morning. When we got to our room, we were very impressed. The room, was beautiful with a king size bed and classic decor. We had our beach towel as well as bathrobes and slippers laid out on our bed. The bathrooms were beautiful with a gorgeous walk in shower. We did have a view of the black screen that people talk about but, we don't spend that much time in our room that we did not mind. Since it was late we decided to order room service. Club sandwiches arrived to our room in less then 15 minutes.I set my alarm clock as I had read that you need to be up early in order to get chairs. I was up at 6:30 and was surprised to see how many people were up and sitting in chairs. Chairs on the beach are high in demand as well as chairs under shelter by the pool. We prefer the pool to the beach and discovered that chairs were still available by the pool until at least 8:00. The resort was book solid during our stay as it was March Break. I stopped getting up at 6:30 to save our chairs as we just reserved them on our way to breakfast. The food was excellent. We were always greeted at breakfast by a staff member with a beautiful smile to welcome us. The tables were plentiful and had no problems finding one ready for us to sit at. We never had to wait for coffee and the staff had lots of fun teaching us how to order our coffee in spanish. Lots of laughs!!! Plenty of selection and even had Mimosas (champagne and orange juice) or Bloody Mary's every morning to start the day! We ate at the Beach Hut everyday for lunch and they served typical food, hamburgers, hot dogs, french fries, pizza they also served the best BBQ chicken! Self serve soft ice cream for desert was the best!!! For dinner we only ate at the buffet twice. The selection was good but we really wanted to try the a la carte restaurants. I had read the reviews that if you wanted to get into the restaurants, you needed to be in line by 4:30. I told my husband that we would go down at 5:30 and try our luck. When we arrived in the courtyard we were third in line for the Asian restaurant. The restaurants open at 6:30 so we had a few drinks and chatted with others in line. We all agreed that we did not mind waiting as it was fun talking to people and having a few drinks in the warm weather. We were able to find out about the other restaurants and heard about some of the excursions that people went on. It is a fun way to learn about what is going on at the resort! We did not get to sit at the Hibatchi on the first night at the Asian restaurant but the a la carte menu was great and we had fabulous service from our waiter. We tried all the restaurant with the exception of the Italian. Wonderful food and service at the French, and the Steak, we were able to go back to the Asian and sit at the Hibatchi and it was fun and enjoyable.Housekeeping was great! Friendly service. The room was cleaned at different times through out the week but it was always made up before we returned from the pool. Our mini bar was re stalked daily with pop, beer and water. We did have a few mosquitos in our room daily but we tried to kill them as we spotted them. Housekeeping keeps the door open while cleaning for security purpose so a few come in during the routine. We also brought bug spray as they come out in the evening and tend to like your ankles!The pools are beautiful and very welcoming throughout the day as the sun is very hot! They are not heated but the warm sun does a great job by mid morning! The pool bar is very busy during the day and service can be a bit slow. You may have to be aggressive in order to get some of the bartenders attention, but once you have it they are quick to get your drink!We had a massage in one of the beach message huts. It was very relaxing and well worth the money.Check out was at noon and our flight home was not until 9:00 PM. They held our luggage in a room until we needed it and provide a room with showers and washrooms in order to freshen up before we left. We loved our stay at the Edenh Real Arena, Punta Cana. We would suggest that others going to this resort go with an open mind and make it your vacation, not re-living someones negative holiday. We would recommend this resort to family and friends and do not believe the Edenh Real Arena deserves the bad reviews that it has received.

<Content>Nervous at first... SO happy we did not switch!!! I went to Eden H from March 13th-20th 2008. I will break the review down according to categories and just to notify everyone we were a group of 9 all green bands.(Check In)Was a bit slow but the man at the front desk was new and hardly spoke English. However we got our four rooms in about 15 minutes. All four rooms were on the 3rd and 4th floor of the second building. (Rooms)The rooms were amazing. Far exceeded my expectations. The bed was huge and very comfortable. No infestation of mosquitoes. I think we saw one and that may have been a fly. The bathroom was nice and an open concept. This was not a problem considering it was my sister and I in the room. Maid service came daily. Cleaned well and we always had beverages and fresh towels. NO COMPLAINTS.(Beach/Pool)Oh my gosh. The beach was absolutely gorgeous. Clear clear water and the sand was white. The water was calm and warm so we were able to float on floaties we had brought and we also went parasailing, kayaking and went on the catamaran. There is a bit of seaweed but they cleaned it daily. The pool was also quite nice and CLEAN. There were always chairs around the pool but you had to wake at 6:30 for chairs at the beach. We did this daily and always had a nice chair under some shade. That is one of the biggest problems was lack of chairs. But it never ruined our trip. Also play beach volleyball..so much fun played for hours daily.(Food)Buffet was actually very good. Had a huge range of things to eat and was pretty much like every other resort we have been too. The ala cartes were good and a nice change from the buffet. OF course by the end of the vacation we were tired of eating. Drinks were soooo good. The best i've had. Pretty consistent. TRY the Daddy Monkey... sooo good. And none of us felt like lower class citizens. Not even once. All the bar tenders treated us the same. So if your green...DONT WORRY. OH AND TRY THE CHOCOLATE MUFFINS to die for!(Entertainment)All the shows were excellent. Were not the cheesy stuff. Check out the circus and white night. At night we also drank at the tantra bar, sports bar and the lounge. All wonderful and fun. Would have been nice if there was more of a disco thing going on at the Tantra Bar. But we always found something to do. Also the casino is far too fun. (Service)Overall everyone was really nice and we never felt like we were treated poorly. Some of them hardly speak English, but the ones that spoke English well were always nice. Especially the bartenders they were a joke! The only people that were not friendly were the people at the front desk.. which was weird and can totally throw people off.Overall, the only problems i saw were that there was lack of chairs ar the beach and sometimes it seemed that there was a lack of staff. None of these problems got in the way of having a great time. Oh and the massages they offer are wonderful and the gym is good too. I think there is no reason to complain about this place. We have been to about 6 all inclusives in the dominican and this was one of the best times we all have ever had. GO AND DONT WORRY!!

<Content>Had a great family vacation! We travelled as a group of nine with five teen age girls and two couples. We have been to the Dominican five times and have travelled to Mexico and Jamaica as well. After reading all of the negative reviews we arrived with some hesitation as to what we would find but we had decided to arrive with an open attitude and enjoy our stay.Our arrival was without difficulties and since it was a late night flight we went directly to our rooms.Overall, we found the rooms very nice, the beach fantastic, the staff friendly and helpful, the ala carte food better than most resorts, the room service option great and the entertainment quite a bit better than most resorts we have all been to.We were able to have pool chairs everyday. Yes we did go down at the scheduled time of 7:00 am but this was not any different than any other resort we have ever been to so it was not a big deal for any of us. We participated in the activities around the pool (volleyball, aquabics and even painting classes), banana boating, kayaking and dance lessons. We also took a snorkelling excursion and toured the area by taxi to a local 'mall' / flea market.The resort is still working out the kinks of a new resort and we knew this going in. We booked at a very good price and were aware that we might find some growing pains problems and there were a few but nothing that interfered with our vacation. We met many guests who commented about the negative reviews but who did not agree with them. I would say that the only suggestions we would make to the hotel is to allow for ala carte reservations (not lining up- we did turn this experience into a positve as well by having our group take turns in line and found that we met some very nice people from all over the world while we were waiting) and as Canadians we are not used to having bars and restaurants where there was smoking allowed so we would suggest that they consider changing that but overall it was a fantastic week and we all said we would love to go back.A big hello to Ramone at the bar, Clara in the Paradise Club lounge and all of the very friendly staff we met along the way!!

<Content>Loved Edenh !!!!! We just returned from Edenh and had an amazing time!!! Our group consisted of a teenagers, children, and parents. Before we went we were more than a little weary about staying at Edenh and even thought about rebooking elsewhere. I am so glad we did not! The place was amazing.Pool-very clean, large and loved the colour..the only thing that would of made it even better was allowing access to the swim up bar from the main pool but being so close to the beach made up for that fact! beach- one of the best i have seen (and i have been to the Dominican for the past 10 years). Beautiful clean water with white sand.Rooms - clean and amazing (the open concept was a nice added touch). The doors were frosted so you could not seen in the toilet and shower. The huge bath tubs were AMAZING!Service - friendly and always were willing to help.Food - excellent and the restaurants were even better. Try the Asian (best spring rolls i have ever had)Overall this was the best domincan expercience. The only minor complaints i have is that Yes the chair situation needs to be fixed. More chairs on the beach are needed but there was always enough chairs around the pool. There also could of been a bit more for the teenage crowd at night...and i am sure that will be rectified when the disco is opened up shortly.AND as for the bug problem..we did not see any mosquitoes. There were a few people that had a few in their rooms, but nothing that was a big problem.

<Content>Wonderful We just got back from holidays last night and wanted to share with everyone our experience not to much to share only that we had an excellent time, we were a little learie on going to this resort as we had not heard great things about it. we were given the opportunity to switch resorts but decided to give it a try. the staff was very friendly the resort very clean actually quite beautiful now we were told about the difference in the all inclusive deal about the different colored bands pink for the concierge yellow for the vip and green we had yellow the only difference between that and the pink was pink had suite for rooms, and had their own poolside now the poolside is no different then the other pools on site and there are 3 other pools to choose from and not too many people even used that pool, the beach is right there and hardly no one used the pools at all. and our room was beautiful. there is talk about getting up early to get beach chairs that is true. you have to get up pretty early to reserve a chair. now if it wasnt for our friends who were early risers we would never have gotten a chair. but you know it was no big deal it was that way everywhere apparently. now if that was the only complain than the resort is doing well. considering how new it is. the food was excellent the activities great, again considering how new the resort is there will be a few bumps in the road, the only thing for us was the lack of understanding english on their part. but you adjust to it. so please dont be discouraged by the different bands because like i said the only difference between the pink to the others is the pool and the room there is no discrimination when it comes to getting your reservation for dinner its a first come first serve basis. thanks for listening. and i would definetly go back to the same resort again next year.Michelle  Brett Worby Toronto Ontario

<Content>Awesome Vacation!!!! We had a wonderful family vacation. Check in was a breeze! We were greated with a fruity drink that was yummy! We knew that we had a fifty fifty on getting an oceanview room, however we booked deluxe with apple vacations so you are placed as rooms come available. We did not get the ocean view but knew that are time in the room would limited.The food was great, we enjoyed our steak and lobster in the Shore Grille. The Asian was our favorite though, we had an awesome meal twice at the hibachi grill. After dinner we sat at the sushi bar for drinks and sushi! Very fun!!The rooms were very nice and spacious. The showers were outstanding. We had a very nice patio with chairs and table. Several days at lunch time we would order room service. Takes about twenty minutes. We ordred club sandwiches and fruit plates. Very good! We enjoyed the Italian,everyone was happy with their meal choice. I had lasagna and it was delicious!!The pools were beautiful! The chairs were high quality too! I especially liked that while sitting poolside we would be offered tea sandwiches and or cold fresh fruit cups! Nice touch! I did not see this offered everyday, but when it was it was wonderful!! We made sure we were up just before seven am. Never had a problem getting a chair. The resort does have ALOTof chairs, but I think people would save chairs poolside and beachiside. My husband and I really enjoyed taking out the catamarans, we had a blast. Our teen daughters enjoyed parasailing, they payed 85.00 for a tandem ride. They loved it!!We really enjoyed the entertainment! My kids loved the tantra bar! The one and only dissapointment wasthe casino, very small. I guess I can say I saved my money. Actually we decided that at the end of our trip we would tip our favorite workers! We loved the Dominican people! Very funny and friendly. One person that stood out to me was Felix the omelette maker! He is awesome! Great personality. When he asks your name he will remeber you all week. Special kid!!! I guess tha t is all i can think of. Just kniow that you will have an amazing time. Don't worry, be happy!!!!Kristin

<Content>Very mixed feelings Let me try to categorize my experience Mar 9 - Mar 16 2008Arrival: Check-in was fast, with few oops like miscounting four people in front of the counter, and bad quality photocopied plan of resort.Also I asked three workers for direction to our room - the first one gave us right direction, but other two told us that the first worker was wrong and we had a mini tour until we arrive at our doorstep :)Luggage delivery:Very Fast, but leaving a stroller behind, (we found it locked up in their storage few days later)Room:Clean and spacious with plenty of mosquitoes inside. Usually I had to kill like 5-10 before we were going to sleep but we ended up with mosquitoes bites every morning. Some electric outlets had missing covers and one phone jack was not installed at all.Alarm Clock is hardwired into the wall. Plenty of light, mini bar sucks - 2 cokes, 2 sprite, 4 bottles of water and 2 cans of local beer. TV remote was not working, on the 3rd try they gave me the one that works. We check in on Sunday - On Monday our coffeemaker disappeared - after four calls I got it back on Thursday :). No eyepiece in the door - just a hole - some doors has it some are not - used some paper to clog it as mosquitoes were flying in through it.Very nice pillows :)BathroomNice looking (if you can ignore missing wall to the room), a shower and a toilet with stained glass swing doors that constantly loose alignment and hit the static section of the doorWater is NOT purified so I went to the shop and paid $3US for a gallon of water as was recommended :) by our funjet rep.There are a few Ice/purified water machines per every floor but out of 5 I saw only one was hooked up and working for 2 days, then it was disconnected as well.BalconyLarge well lit up with table and two nice cushioned chairs. The ocean view was obstructed by 20-25ft high fence (construction on the other side)Food/Servicewe did not visit any restaurants (having two small kids) but central Paradise Buffet was nice. Food quality very good. Fruits were excellent, bread always fresh (even warm at times). Pastries are not ultra sweet and very tasty. Guys at the grill are always smile, remember you from short conversation, and very professional. There are no self serving drinks except breakfast juices (4-6 types freshly squeezed). Launch and dinner drinks are served by staff. Unfortunately there two distinctive types of staff - some understand English and are fast responders, other are just .... well not that bright. For example I asked for Pineapple juice, Orange Juice and Coke - almost 10 minutes later I received Hot milk, Fruit Punch and Diet Coke. And the guy was really surprised when I told him that I did not order it :)Kids ClubExcellent: My 5yo loved it - clean very unprofessional staff.ShowsVery very nice - we had dances from around the world, circus, Jazz/Blues night, Swing Night, Local Dances. Really enjoyed them.Pool/BeachThere are three main pools, one kids pool and one VIP Pool.main pools are not connected and only one of them has a wet bar. Water is not heated so it little cool at the morning. One Whirlpool around 15 ft diameter with cold bubbly water. Snack bar (mini version of main Buffet). Shortage of chairs. If you go to beach/pool after 8:30am - you out of luck. One day Hotel security went along the pool and cleared chairs with people absent and dry towels. Hotel rules says that if you leave for more then an hour you need to vacate the chair) but the security did not bother them self with such details. they took bunch of towels, and people belongings, then stuff books, shoes,sunblock in few peoples bags and took away - even 4 hours later I heard people trying to locate their belongings.Ocean floor is uneven - one step you over the had - 1 foot further below shoulders. Bars/Internet/Casino/ShopBars are nice well ventilated. Three shelfs of drinks: local that are free, 2nd for VIP, 3rd you have to charge to the room. Internet rates are (if not VIP) $4 - 15 min $12 - 1 hour single session. or you can pay for wireless access at 30% discount. speed is very low. Shop is nice - the only source for chips/candy/apple juice - pricey but not too bad compared to major US citiesConclusion:I think if they would open the place few month later and finish the construction and staff training - the average score on this site would be at lease 1-2 stars higher.

<Content>Great Location - wonderful time We stayed at the Edenh 3/10/08 - 3/17/08. After reading many negative comments here we decided to go in very open-minded to their problem areas. First, the positive. The location is fantastic, beach is gorgeous, property was clean and neat (no glass seen around beach). the staff was very corteous, from the moment we arrived from the aiport. Check in was very smooth, room was ready about 3:30 pm and was on the 4th floor as we requested. We stayed in 2421 so we had a pool/ocean view and that was wonderful. The bar in the lobby area had Great bartenders, especially Luis and Julio (thanks guys) who made the drinks we requested perfectly, even though they had never made a long beach before. We got great service from them every day. we had green wrist bands and so no difference in treatment to us vs pink bands. If you are ok without 'brand' name liquor, I would not upgrade.The food was decent, plenty to choose from, but I would not say it was gourmet. We were able to get in to all 4 ala carte restaurants. The Italian and the Asian were our favorites. The spa and casino were open and we enjoyed both.Now on some of the negative areas. Yes, they do need more beach chairs. We tried to get chairs one day at 6:45 AM and they were all already reserved. We decided to just lay our towels on the sand and enjoy a few hours on the beach anyway. Pool chairs were available for us all week, even as late as 10 AM, which was better than prior reviews told us. Hopefully they will add more to the beach soon.the reservation system for the restaurants is still as noted with long lines. Again, went in without expecting to get in to all. We would get there at 6:30 - 7 pm (party of 2) and were able to get into all but steak house on first try. took 3 nights to get into steak house, but Italian and French both had openings 2 of those nights we were turned down. If you have a larger party, you probably need to get there earlier, but honestly, the dinner buffet had steak, chicken, pasta, fish, etc that the cooks were grilling for you and they all tasted good.The bathroom scenario - it is very contemporary. Since it was only hubby and I, worked out fine, but I can see issues if sharing room with others. Not sure if the hotel will ever close up' that opening, so larger groups may need to try to put up some kind of divider for privacy.Overall we enjoyed our trip and would definitely go back again.

<Content>Sun on the Caribbean Mar. 3rd, 6 of us arrived at Edenh with Apple Vacations for a stay of 7 nights. This was not our 1st stay in Punta Cana, but decided to try a new resort. This appears to be a very nice resort, but they're still working on it and there are some issues to work on from my viewpoint. I wasn't able to get this hotel before I left to read the reviews, but now have it 'plugged' in and my review may sound repetitious to others. First of all, we got there at 9:00AM, but when they say check-in is 3:00PM that is what they mean and it won't happen any sooner. We got our wrist bands and towel cards right away, but no room. The rooms are very nice, but no privacy between the bathroom and the sleeping area. They definitely need another waste can in the room. We had empty bottles, papers, etc. and no where to dispose of them. Housekeeping was very good even though the rooms usually weren't done until very late in the day. My group agreed with others that they seem to not have enough help. The beach chair fiasco was as bad as they say. Everywhere we've gone in the Caribbean I've read the reviews saying-no chairs, but never had a problem. People were actually up before light saving chairs and if you went later there were none.Towards the end of the week, guards were patrolling and curbed the saving before 6:30 unless you stayed with your chair (which people were doing-sleeping on the beach to have chairs in the sun.) Specialty restaurants were another problem-they opened at 6:30, no reservations,so people were dressed for dinner and waiting in a line from about 4:30 on. Our group went down about 7:00 and would get in for the 2nd seating. The food was excellent at all 4 restaurants, but a couple nights we ate VERY late. The drinks were pretty good--I especially liked the lounge bar, but my favorite bartender was Aniely at the beach restaurant bar. He took very good care of us and when he saw us coming, he would start to make our drinks. I didn't encounter the language barrier at this resort that I did at the last one I stayed at in Punta Cana. If one couldn't help you or understand you here, they found someone who could. Most of the help seemed very friendly and ready to help you have a pleasant vacation. (There was 1 girl at the Specialty restaurants, seating people who got under a lot of people's skin, but 1 out of all the help isn't bad.) We had a nice vacation and great weather-good food and drinks, but unless they work some things out, I don't think I'd go back to this resort.

<Content>great time at edenh!!! We all just got back from the Edenh and had a great time.... the ppl were wonderful and very friendly. We went in a large group and we all were nervous about all the bad reveiws we had read.We had figured that we would just see for ourselves and so glad we did. Our check-in went smooth and quick, our rooms were ready by 3 and in the mean time we sat at the bar and enjoyed being away from the stress and cold weather of our everyday lives. The rooms were beyond belief and some of our group got the our door spa and showers and they were wonderful. Pools were nice and the adult swim up bar was so much fun. Ramoan and Carlos did a great job keeping drinks full and the laughter going. They join in with our antics and made us feel like old time friends. They truely made you feel like they were going to miss you when you left and went above and beyond to help you enjoy your vacation.The maid always had our room cleaned nice and fridge was full with water and drinks. The whole bathroom things is really not that bad. The toilet had a door to it and so did the shower. My mom stayed with one of our friends that she never really meet and they mananged fine. The food was really good in the buffet and there was always something for everyone taste. Yes sometimes it was luke warm but I'm sure it will only get better. Not one of us got sick and we did a huge amount of eating and drinking.!! I'm not sure what some of these people expect from a vacation. There was sun and drinks and friendly faces everywhere. You are on vacations and just relax. I do understand that everyone has put hard earned money into a vacation and want to enjoy themselves so just do so.... and RELAX!!!And yes we did go into town to Steve's bar with Punts Cana Mike, had a great time and did some shopping at the same time. The bar was a coner bar and I mean it sat right on the corner of the street. Punta Cana Mike was wonderful and always there to help and is willing to spend his time with anyone. (Tuff job huh Mike!!)Ivan made our vacation special and was so nice to us all helping us all with any of our needs. Also Felix at the front desk was a delight to talk to and always had a smile for us.  most of the chair problem is from the other vacationers. They have all read about lack of chairs and I swear it has caused mass hysterica. getting up at 3am to save chairs all over!! if everyone would just calm down it wouldn't be a big deal. All that said we had a great time and would love to go back. We have been to Punts Cana 5 plus times and have always found the bright side of any place. This was easy to do with EdenH and it is a place that we enjoyed. Please give this place a honest chance you will not be sorry!!!

<Content>Could Be Good! If Only! We were there with seven women(middle aged). It could havebeen great, but it wasn't. I have no complaint with the staff, overall they were great; with the exception of a few who thoughtthey were smart asses that thought we didn't understand the language. This company (NH) doesn't know how to run or builda hotel in the Dominican Rep. No disrespect there; they try. I didnot get a discounted rate in my opinion. I'm sure others woulddisagree. Granted, I personally went for the sun  surf, which was wonderful. One thing I will tell you that it is true about the beach chairs, I could never relax at night or sleep soundly because I had to getup at 4 or 5 am to get chair for our party! Since we had older women in our group this was totally needed! I definitley wanted achair too! Since I usually get up early,(not that early), this was notreally a problem, but come on, on vacation who wants to do this!It is not really a comfortable situation at 5:30 AM, They do havesecurity, a new thing apparently, but still not easy.The food is mediocre at best. I'm not picky, so not a problem,but others with us did not like it. The reservation system is NOTready to say the least; constantly changing.Entertainment is sometimes good but does not start until 10:00PM. Too late, there should be some type of other venue,;games,tea parties, something.Rooms: Nice, not the best junior suites I've been inand nottotally finished,ie: door handles,etc.Wait a year!I will answer any question on the forum

<Content>Wonderful time at EdenH My review is going to be short but sweet. There have been a lot of reviews on several sites with a lot of the same information good and bad throughout the many different reviews. I just want to say we were considering moving from Eden because of the negatives. After awhile you actually start to panic and BELIEVE! Guess what鈥?We are so glad that we didn鈥檛! We were a group of 2 families consisting of 4 adults and 4 teens. We met such wonderful people from all over; I really enjoyed starting up a chat with everyone when ever possible. The staff are very friendly, warm and very helpful in every way. We didn't have any problems with the language barrier. Many spoke english very well and others knew minimal english but it was no problem. I'm trying to learn their beautiful language as well. Check in for all of us was under 10 minutes and very effecient.The accommodations were fine, the food was great with a lot of variety for everyone, even picky eaters and I have a one who is. No issues for the ala carte restaurants either and like I said there was 8 of us. We didn鈥檛 ever get a beach or pool lounger till later in the day, everyday. We just planted ourselves in the sand in front of the ocean鈥?you can鈥檛 get much better view than that! Everyone has their own expectation of a holiday and what they believe they should receive or have. I know there is no 鈥減erfect鈥?vacation as this is not a perfect world but we wouldn鈥檛 really have changed anything鈥ot even for a lounger. We are looking forward to try to get there again this winter/xmas.Also, a heartfelt 鈥淭hank You鈥欌€?to Punta Cana Mike for spending the little time he has during the day to share his valuable information to all of us. I was able to see first hand how busy he really is!Missing Eden and the staff already, as I see my tan slipping away.CheersConnie - Calgary

<Content>Great stay at a great resort! My husband and I just returned from a week at the EdenH last night. We had read a lot of good and bad reviews, and the bad ones had us worried, but it turned out that our stay was absolutely wonderful! No real complaints at all.Probably the best thing about this hotel, aside from its prime location on the beach, is the staff. From the bartenders to the waiters to the bellhops, everyone was extremely pleasant, polite, and eager to please. I am sure these people are not paid buckets of money to make guests happy, so the fact that they bring a smile -- and sometimes even a song and a dance -- to their work every day is great. Unlike some cruise lines, where you get treated well only if you tip well, at the EdenH you seem to get the same great treatment no matter what.Anyway, some basics:the rooms -- we had a deluxe room. Our room was always clean, the sheets were changed daily, and the fridge was always stocked with water and sodas. Like many others, I wasn't crazy about the 'hole' that opened the bathroom up to the sleeping area, but it didn't bother me too much. I have heard they are going to add shutters, so eventually this will not be an issue at all.the food -- we thought the buffets were excellent, but we're not people who expect 'luxury food' on vacation. there was certainly enough variety to please any appetite. We ate at the Italian and Asian specialty restaurants, and we liked both. the beach and pool -- We upgraded to VIP on checkin, so we got to use the Prestige pools, and they were great. Nice cold water to chill off in after sitting in the sun. The beach is just beautiful, full of pure white sand, low surf, just perfect. We used the catamarans and kayaks, and we were usually able to get whatever items we wanted without waiting more than 10 or 15 minutes.Overall, an excellent first trip to Punta Cana for us. We would definitely book this hotel again.

<Content>Don't know why everyone else is complaining.... My wife and I really enjoyed our trip to Eden as an overall experience. The few negative things we may have experienced are only due to Eden being a brand new resort with a few kinks that need to be worked out as well as an obvious language barrier. You did have to wait for a resturaunt, but you would anywhere else too and its not like there was nothing to do while you were waiting. There were not enough beach chairs but there were several more which were delivered yesterday. In our opinion, the good more than out weighed the bad. The service was phenomenal! We were waited on hand and foot, the staff was upbeat and pleasant. They made for a very enjoyable experience. The entertainment was good every night and there were several inclusive activities offered throughout the day at the resort for example, merengue lessons on the beach, rum tastings and cigar rolling. There were resturaunts which we liked more than others. We definitely reccommend the shore grill and the asain grill. The others were still good, it is all a matter of taste. The buffet was always good, especially for breakfast! The overall construction was beautiful!!! The rooms were gorgeous and kept clean everyday. The scenery was very appealing throughout the entire resort. Most importantly, the beach was beautiful...it looks like a postcard! There are markets in walking distance either way on the beach, there was lunch grilled on the beach daily and there is a constant breeze which keeps it from being too hot. Overall we had an awesome time. We would definitely recommend it our friends and we hope we will have the opportunity to go back!

<Content>Up and coming star BackgroundMy husband and I travel to a sunny location 3 times per year. We usually stay at 4.5 star resorts but have on 2 occasions stayed at a 5 star. We stayed at the EdenH Arena from Feb.29 to March 15 together with 2 other couples. The reason we selected the EdenH was because it was in Punta Cana, it was listed as a 4.5 star and it was new which meant we could stay in a new resort for 2/3 the price. We were aware that the trade-off was we would be involved in the resort鈥榮 adjustments. The value and service drove our rating of this resort to a 4.5 star which we think is commendable considering it had only been open a little over 2 months. Had we paid full price, the rating would have dropped, but not significantly. I've never written a review, but thought I would because EdenH, in my view, is getting a bad rap just bbecause of a few fixable issues.We flew Air Transat from Toronto. Good flight, but due to weather one hour late.We arrived at Punta Cana Airport around 10:30 pm. Everyone鈥檚 picture is taken at the airport so you can buy it if you like on your return home. Immigration was quick, as usual, and we got our luggage and got on our assigned bus to EdenH Arena.EdenH Arena is located about 25 minutes from the airport. It is just north of Paradisus Palma Real. With a total of about 660 rooms, we consider it a small to medium resort for Punta Cana. I think the resort was at full capacity.. As the bus left the main road and entered EdenH property, the driveway separated 2 lagoons left in their natural state. I understand the spa will eventually be situated in this area. Unless you play tennis, this initial drive will not be revisited nor visible during your stay. As we entered this beautiful, modern resort, the front desk is to the left, and to the right is the VIP internet lounge. Check in was quick and we were given our wristbands and taken to our room with our luggage in a golf cart. Our room was initially a regular Deluxe Room on the 4th floor facing a parking lot but we relocated 2 days later to a pool view, 2nd floor room, upon request. It was in a location convenient to the lobby/restaurant area, and to the pool and beach. Whether in building 1 or building 2, the views are the same - inside pool/garden/ocean view or not so cute view if you don鈥榯 get the inside view. I think it is inevitable that eventually the room cost will be based on the view. Currently, I understand it is based on standard as opposed to Paradise Club. Our room was spacious with a lot of closet and storage space. My first impression however was that it needed a little more wall decorations. Rooms have a plasma TV, a Jacuzzi tub big enough for 2, and a separate shower stall with a rain shower head. and toilet stall with frosted glass doors. It is open to the rest of the room and not especially private but I liked the openness. Hot water was available for the entire 2 week period. Bathroom amenities included a hairdryer, makeup mirror, soap, bath gel, shampoo/conditioner, body lotion, travel toothbrush kit, q-tips and makeup removal pads and Kleenex.An electronic in-room safe is included, and is large enough to hold a laptop computer. Our room had a king size bed with good pillows and a comfortable mattress, good sheets and a duvet. It was nicely decorated with modern furniture. There is also a coffee maker, clock radio, ironing board and iron. The air conditioning worked very well and there was also a ceiling fan. A mini-fridge contains 2 cans of Presidente, Pepsi, Pepsi Light, 7-up, 7-up Light, and bottled water, which was restocked daily. If you want more of one thing, just leave a note. Balcony is on the small side but has a nice table and 2 chairs. We had turn-down service three nights, and one night I declined it. There are 4 large bath towels in the bathroom, we were never short of towels. Getting facecloths was sometimes a challenge, as it is with most DR resorts. Housekeeping was very efficient, cleaning our room early every morning.Room service is free, and we ordered on our first evening at the resort, around 2:00 a.m.. It was fast and the toast for the delicious toasted tuna salad sandwich were still warm. GroundsThe resort is built in the shape of an 鈥淯鈥? The lobby, common areas and restaurants are located in the middle, with the rooms to the left and the right. Fountains and bodies of water surround the main restaurant. It is possible to walk under cover from one end of the resort to the other. In the area between the rooms and common areas are beautiful, young, well-manicured gardens, with gorgeous fountains. There is also a large courtyard with tables and comfortable chairs where my husband and I enjoyed cappuccino in the mornings and cocktails at 7:00 p.m. On some nights the entertainment plays in this courtyard which has a center stage.Weather and BugsThe weather was beautiful for 2 weeks with 2 five minute rain showers during the day. Temperatures were in the mid-80鈥檚, dropping off to comfortable mid-70鈥檚 at night. So if you are looking at forecasts for Punta Cana, don鈥檛 be discouraged when you see rain forecasted every day, it doesn鈥榯 happen! It did get a little windy the first few of days of our stay here. No problem whatsoever with bugs. We saw about 5 or 6 mosquitoes in the 2 weeks we were there. My husband had a few bites on his legs from sitting out in the evening. None on me.Beach and PoolThis hotel is located on a beautiful stretch of beach that was kept very clean. What I particularly loved is that the ocean is visible from the pool and resort gardens. From the beach, has the best appeal compared to any other resort. The hotel was at capacity when we were there. There appeared to be a problem finding chairs at both the pool and on the beach if you didn鈥檛 get there early. We didn鈥檛 have a problem because we were out very early so we could get 6 chairs together. There are 5 pools: the main has a swim-up bar. Two of the pools are reserved for Paradise/Mirage Club guests. One is a wading pool. There are also jacuzzis (cold), as well as built-in, tiled sunbeds you can lay on and be partially submerged in the water. All of it very beautiful.Bar waitresses go around and take your drink orders whether you are sitting at the pool or beach. As a matter of fact, if you sit down anywhere at the resort, someone will quickly appear and ask you if you would like something to drink. FoodThe buffet restaurant is in an enclosed air-conditioned area divided into three parts, all identical and opens from for breakfast from 7 a.m. to 11 a.m., lunch from 12:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m., and dinner from 6 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. The restaurant is very well lit and therefore doesn鈥檛 really offer any ambiance. I heard no music in the buffet restaurant until late in our vacation which likely means, they will now play some. Breakfast offers a large assortment, everything you can think of. Good omelettes made to order. For the most part, the food was hot. Champagne/Mimosa or Vodka/Bloody Mary were available as part of the buffet at breakfast. At lunch and dinner there is a good selection of coldcuts, salads, meat (steak, pork, chicken, lamb), fish and vegetables, fresh breads and rolls, and desserts. There is always a pasta bar with a selection of different types of pasta and sauces. Also a variety of excellent pizza.The beach grill, cafeteria style offers hamburgers, dogs, fries, onion rings, pizza, different fresh roasted meat, fish, salads, is by the ocean and pool, which incidentally are within a few feet of one another. There are 4 a la carte restaurants: French, Italian, Steak/lobster and Asian fusion which consists of 3 dining options: tepanyaki tables, sushi bar and contemporary tables. No reservations are required. When choosing to dine at these, we would appear at 7:00 p.m., and we were given a beeper which beeped by 8:00 p.m. calling us to our table. The only time I saw a line-up is from 5:30 to 6:30 p.m. for people who wanted to be the first seated at 6:30. The a la carte restaurants had good wait staff and good food. The lights were dimmer than the buffet, but not quite dim enough. They could use candles and they could also use better music. A dress code applies for all the a la carte restaurants - No shorts or sleeveless shirts or sandals allowed for men. (although we did see some men wearing sandals so I don鈥檛 know how strict they are in enforcing this.) They absolutely wouldn鈥檛 allow men鈥檚 shorts and we saw some men turned away.BarsThere are 5 bars around the pool/beach, including a swim up bar but 2 are restricted to Paradise Club/Mirage Concierge guests and these guests are offered premium brand drinks. The regular guests are serve mostly local drinks however Canadian Club was available to us. It presented absolutely no problems. Bottled water is also available at all the bars. There are also a lobby bar, I think a casino bar, a sports bar and the roof top Tahntra bar.EntertainmentWe saw all shows while we were there and some were probably better than others I鈥檝e seen at other resorts. The costumes were outstanding! Fire shows, lounge singers, dance extravaganza, etc. Outside of the shows, there is not much to do. The music, even at the Tahntra bar which is absolutely beautiful - well decorated and could be conducive to dancing - did not move us to dance because of the music. The music during the day is piped in spa music and very relaxing but does get monotonous. At night at the Tahntra, they play piped in techno animusic highlighting the xylophone. Could be good for some people I guess. There was quite a gathering at the bar but most guests would walk in, stay 10 minutes and leave. The sports bar is very lit and the music is better. It has 2 small pool tables. I was under the impression that management is already promoting its resort as a spa resort. CasinoThere is a casino at the resort, opened at night. We just went in and looked around, I think they have Roulette, Blackjack, Caribbean Poker, Texas Hold Em Poker, and some slot machines. SpaA temporary spa is open while the main spa is built. Massages are offered and maybe other services.  Kids ClubThe Kids Club is centrally located off the hallway on the way to the restaurants but I didn鈥檛 check it out. . Day Activities for AdultsThere are all kinds of daily activities, included or at extra costs. Things like jeep safaris, boat trips, Manati Park, etc horseback riding, snorkelling excursions, scuba diving, and boat trips, tennis at the 2 courts located at the front of the resort. Non-motorized watersports are also included. deep sea fishing (extra cost), and motorized water sports (extra cost) The activities staff also arranges volleyball games and beach soccer. Also available are table tennis, table games, billiards, giant chess, horseshoes and bocci ball. During the week there are also painting classes, cigar rolling, Salsa dance classes, and Spanish lessons. GolfGolf can be arranged at the 27-hole Cocotal Golf  Country Club (extra$) near by.ShoppingThere is a new shopping centre within a 10-15 minute walk of the EdenH. It includes restaurants such as Hard Rock Caf茅, Tony Roma鈥檚, and some high end stores (not souvenir shops). There was only one store in the hotel itself, which sold a little bit of everything. Take what you think you will need as prices are higher than you鈥檇 pay at home, although not as high in this store as I鈥檝e seen in other places. From the beach, if you walk to the right or left, there are little 鈥渇lea market malls鈥?of souvenir stores. Money ExchangeMoney can be exchanged at the front desk. If you have U.S. cash, you can use it for virtually everything without having to change it into pesos. SummaryThis is a very nice resort, well on its way to being one of the top of its class because they seem committed to please their guests. For example, Guest Services effortlessly arranged a surprise birthday cake and celebration for my husband. Another example is a maintenance mechanic coming out and fixing my sunglasses-just for asking. The staff at this hotel was excellent. Very friendly and many spoke English relatively well. Service was consistently good. We were very lucky to have PC Mike provide us with all the early information last November and December. Without this we may not have selected this very nice hotel.Thank you Mike.

<Content>Not ready to open! Went away for a quick girls weekend with a friend. The bathrooms were quite a shock, there is a huge open window looking into the shower stall and toilet stall and bathtub. We asked a worker for an extra sheet which he hung to cover the opening for visual privacy, though you could still hear everything!.The staff were all very attentive, with the exception of the bartenders who had a habit of looking through you when you were standing there. They knew you were there, but no acknowledgement whatsoever was made. We learned to be aggressive in order to get served.The beach chairs were a whole other problem. There are not nearly enough and you had to get up at 4:30AM (on vacation!!) to grab them. While we were there (March 1-4), they made a change and said that no one could claim chairs before 7AM. The police actually confiscated people's stuff who came out earlier that day to claim a chair. Those guests were quite surprised to come out to the pool expecting their chairs and instead their stuff was gone and other people were sunning themselves in their spots. Thought there were going to be some brawling!We had no problems with mosquitoes while we were there. A guest who was leaving gve us a tip to not have housekeeping make up your rooms because they leave all the doors open while cleaning. We just got fresh towels and sheets ourselves and did not encounter one mosquito!Elevator in Bldg 1 was broken the whole time we were there. On our first day we were assured it was being worked on and would be fixed that day. Didn't happen.Truthfully, think this resort will be beautiful once they have everything worked out. We were very disappointed.

<Content>Geat Resort/Big Fun! We just returned March 13 and had a wonderful trip! There were 7 of us staying in 4 rooms. 1 couple checked in about 1/2 hour before the rest of our group. They had booked with another company and their room was on the 2nd floor. The rest of us had 3 rooms on the first floor side by side. This was me and my husband's 4th trip to an all-inclusive resort and the speediest check-in we'd ever experienced at any of the others. Lorenzo took our bags to our room and gave us a very good tour along the way. My husband and I did not try any of the a la carte restaurants. We ate breakfast every day in the buffet. Felix fixed great omelettes - I'm not an egg eater but my husband is and he thought they were very yummy. Consequently, my hubby is a very picky eater! We sat in Gabriel's section every morning so we could have our coffee poured by this happy guy! He was great and really helped start the day out right. We ate lunch every day at either the beach barbecue or the beach buffet. In my opinion if you couldn't find foods to please you in both of those places then you may as well have stayed home and cooked for yourself! We ate a few evening meals in the buffet, ate off resort 1 night, then ordered late night room service for dinner our last night there. Room service was very speedy and I ordered for us and 1 other couple. We had club sandwiches and fries for 4, 2 fruit plates, and some cheesecake. No, I didn't have a room service menu but last time I checked I still have a voice and 1/2 a brain so could ask over the phone what they had available and made my decision pretty swiftly. No big deal.1 couple we traveled with are early risers so they'd go to the beach by 6-ish to get 7 chairs for our group. I joined them early 1 morning just after 5:30 so I could catch the sunrise. There almost always appeared to be empty chairs by the pools throughout the day but we did not spend any time at the pools. Regarding the subject of beach and pools - we were impressed by both. Thought the beach was well-kept and the pools were very clean and nice. Did find a couple of pieces of broken glass on the beach, but that could only be attributed to careless guests. No one in their right mind should expect a resort to sift and rake throughout so many square feet to find every little thing that might cut your feet. That would be like searching for a needle in a haystack!Our rooms were very clean and nicely furnished. The 3 of us who had rooms on the first floor had them cleaned and restocked very timely - usually by noon. Our friends who had a 2nd floor room had their room cleaned around mid afternoon most days. We thought the jacuzzi tub and big shower were very cool and really had no problem with the different design of the bathroom. We all had some mosquitos in our rooms but not 1 of us got bitten - maybe we all had too much alcohol in our systems! We had gone prepared with bug spray and used it from time to time. We never witnessed a spraying process at Edenh and were never buzzed by a mosquito anywhere outside our room. I consider the mosquitos a non issue.Another non issue in my book was the alleged trouble getting drinks at the bars. We had green wrist bands and can honestly say that we never really had any problem getting drinks timely, nor did we notice any favoritism that some have felt the pink band customers received. We especially appreciated the beach waitress (Maria I believe) and how good of a job she did. Bless her heart - she had a lot of territory to cover. We only went to the Tantra bar twice. It was a little quiet for our group who really likes to laugh and have a slighlty rowdier time than some! I will say it's a very nice, comfortable bar and can really see how some people would like to hang out there. We spent very minimal time in the Sports or Lobby Bars - just really not up to being inside when the weather was so perfect.Can't say a lot about the evening entertainment because we didn't see much of it. I've read complaints that it starts too late, but in my book the starting time was probably very appropriate. By the time you spend every minute possible on the beach, get cleaned up and have some cocktails then eat it's probably going to be 10:00 before you're ready to watch some entertainment. We did catch some of the circus-type act 1 evening and it was great. Just a few random things - enjoyed the fact that there was a resort photographer, liked the layout of the resort and how the restaurants were in close proximity, made some purchases at the gift shop, and most importanly - found the staff to be very pleasant, helpful, and quite competent. About the only negative comment I can think of is the fact that we had a little drip in our shower ceiling the last day we were there and the biggest negative of all - we had to return home to gloomy, rainy, snowy, drab NE Missouri!!!! I had the pleasure of meeting Punta Cana Mike and we made friends from Minnesooooota and Ohio! None of us had ever been to the D.R. before and we really enjoyed. I think I can speak for our entire group when i say we had a wonderful vacation and thought Edenh was very nice!

<Content>Yes !!! It' s on, and it well deserve 4 /12 * !!! We were at that resort from 8 to 15 of march, a groupe of 10 people and  No WE WERE NOT VIP  We had a wonderfull time. All the negative story will now stop it has to because everything is great. We did wait a little to go to the a la carte restaurent, but it' s not as bad as some people are saying. And they now have a live band at evening to keep us entertain until show time. A lot OF ENTERTAINEMENT DURING THE DAY, DANCING LESSONS AND ALL THAT, JUSTE LIKE EVERYWHERE ELSE. All the chaires have arrived. And nobody has to get up early to reserve one because the guard wont let them so.... The food is excellent and beleive me we travel a lot, every years for the past 20 years and this resort is really it' s 4 1/2 stars it was given in first place. If you go already with anger, well...... it is you that will hate your vacation but go with an open mide and i am certain you will juste LOVE IT !! It is a fabulus place, verry beautiful place. Do I recomend this resort ? Of course !! Have a great vacation.

<Content>Wonderful Vacation!!! I honestly don't know how you can go to this resort and not have a good time!!! The food was great, everyone was friendly and the weather was perfect. The layout of the resort is great and easy to manage. Yes, you have to wake up early for a beach chair but that is how it is at other resorts. I wasn't going to let a small trash can in the bathroom or a few mosquitos ruin my vacation. Its amazing what can ruin someones vacation. Please read the reviews with caution. Would love to go back to Edenh!!!

<Content>Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, Hi We were at the Eden from March 9-16 and had a wonderful trip. WE had booked a deluxe room (green bracelet) and had absolutely no issue with getting our room, It was ready when we arrived at about 3pm. We were pleasantly surprised with our room, it was clean, on the fourth floor of building two, facing the outside of the resort. WE had a great view of the ocean and the sunrise everyday. The beds were confortable. When we arrived we were very concerned about all the negative issues we had read on trip advisor. Please be reassured that we had no issues whatsover all week. Our rooms were cleaned daily, linen was changed and all supplies in the bar and in the bathroom were replenish daily. We had at two instance problem with our toilet and it was fixed within a few minutes. I have not seen any of the complaints I had read about. We were served promplty at the bars. The service was great. We did have to get up early to have chairs on the beach. WE were able to eat at all of the restaurant and we were able to go to the Italian and Asian ones twice. WE usually went to the restaurant at 7:30. We got a pager and within half an hour to forty minutes we were seated. The beach area is wonderful and the sand is the softest I have seen. There are guards all over the resort for your own safety. Work was being done in one area but the noise was minimal almost none. If you have a trip booked at this hotel and are like us a bit worried please stop worrying. The resort is beautiful, well kept and well managed. The people working are great and friendly. We speak french and english and had no issues being understood or understanding them. There were shows everynight from 9:45-10:45 and then the bars are open longer. By then we were too tired to stay up anyway. The room area was always quiet. There are activites all day and you can get the sheet explaining all of those on the guess service table. When we arrived we had a tour given to us by our bell boy. He brought us to our room and explained how everything worked. If you are going to this hotel and are stressing about all of the bad reviews stop stressing. We had a wonderful week, the weather was great 83 degrees every day. I cannot find anything negative to say about this hotel except that the rudeness was mostly caused by some of the guests. This is a wonderful resort.

<Content>Beautiful Resort We just got back from the EDENH and overall we had a wonderful relaxing time.Rooms: The room we had was wonderful. We had a corner room and it faced the ocean and the pool area. We couldn't have asked for a nicer room. They were kept very clean with no shortage of towels, face cloth or toiletries. The bar fridge was well stocked daily with pop (coke, coke light, water and beer) lots of bottled water. Food: the food was good, and no shortage of that either. The buffet restaurant had a wide variety and plenty of it for all meals. The Beach grill had everything there as well from fries to hamburgers to hot dogs, pizza, chicken and just about anything you could think of. As well they had a soft ice cream machine there. We went to two a la carte restaurants, the shore grill which is steak and seafood the meal was excellent. The Italian restaurant which I found the food to be okay. My one and only complaint to the waiting to be seated for the a la cartes. We lined up at 5:00 for the Italian restaurant which opened at 6:30 and were the first ones to be seated in the restaurant when it opened, as it turned out we were still sitting there waiting for our main coarse at 8:00 o'clock which it did come shortly after that. By the time we finished our main coarse we still had dessert to come but decided to leave because it was starting to get to late. I think that they should have the reservation set-up like most other resorts have. The Beach and pool areas are beautiful and kept very clean. I have absolutely no complaints except for the minor reservation thing at the a la cartes, but that is it. Overall I would recommend this hotel to anyone. The staff are great and go out of their way to please you.

<Content>The Good, the Bad and the ICK The Good - the people who work there are consistently and sincerely wonderful. Blue and green ocean water, blue skies, we found the sun and the warmth we were seeking.Rooms are clean although consistent housekeeping is spotty (our face clothes came and went). We left a daily tip and not once was there any sort of acknowlegment.One of the other couples in our group upgraded to the premium package (about $500 more for the week) and they were very pleased with their choice and service.The Bad - probably the most depressing archictecture and landscaping I have ever seen. Not very happy and / or tropical. Ditto for the music played in the Tantra bar (we called it the Tantrum bar). It was a constant funeral dirge! Never once did we dance. It was so uninteresting.Creepy is the word we used more than once to describe the vibe of the whole place.First time I've ever seen an air conditioned lobby (usually we see open air) and that was a huge turn off as people smoke inside and they burn incense constantly.It felt like management wanted its residents in bed by midnight.ICK - THE SMELL IN THE ELEVATORS. It's a combination of smoked pot, plastic, and bug spray. The smell never went away and the old gag reflex kicked up several times.Drinks - well we drank too many of them, shame on us. Agree with other comments that they were pretty funky tasting (but we managed - HA!)I don't mean to sound picky and snotty because I am NOT!! I am one of the easiest going travelers you will ever meet. This place just was not for us. It's great for probably Europeans seeking a quiet retreat. It's not great for those who like to dance, play and stay up late.No fun games by the pool. *sigh*.

<Content>Growing pains We were apprehensive about staying here after reading all of the negative reviews, but were determined to go and have a great time, which we did. We have been travelling to Mexico and the DR frequently for the past 12 years, staying at 4 and 5 stars only.We did not take the upgrade as it was not available through Sunquest.Our room was on the third floor and we had a view of the ocean, I don;t know if the elevators were working as I walked the stairs. I am 50 years old, and wasn't doing a lot of anything to work off those drinks. Our maid was friendly and very hard working. They start at 8 am and we saw her many days still there at 6 p.m. I had gifts for her and she politely asked for a note to go with them saying thank you with our room number and my name. No problem. She seemed very appreciative.Yes there is an open window in the bathroom, but we talked to many people that were well aware of the problem and brought quick fix solutions for their particular family situations. I do believe that in the future they will need to put in some sort of blind or shutters. This did not ruin our vacation.Yes, there is a problem with not enough chairs. They are being shipped from Spain and have not yet arrived, Yes, the security goes around collecting items from abandoned chairs, which could be claimed at guest services. Our towels, books, etc were taken while we were at breakfast (7:00 am), but got them all back. It was an inconvenience, but it did not ruin our vacation.They should allow reservations for dinner, but we met some awesome people in line, and were never disappointed in our seating arrangements or the food. We travelled alone, and by the end of our week, there were 10 in our party for dinner. We enjoyed the walks along the beach each day, and in response to one of the reviewers, I drank gin and tonic regularly and never had a problem finding tonic. Margaritas in the lobby were also great. All in all, we knew leaving , that there would be some inconveniences as they are still new. Puntacana Mike was available and helpful, unlike our Sunquest rep who was noticably MIA. My biggest complaint would be the empty or abandoned chairs by the upgrade pools. However, it was also quite entertaining watching people go in and remove the chairs and take them to the other pools. There were always enough chairs, by these smaller pools.They are understaffed in the restaurants, and work so very hard. We found them helpful friendly and just added another element to our vacation.Would I go back? Pprobably yes, but on the other hand, I enjoy trying new places and have never gone back to other resorts, that were absolutely amazing in every way.We found our vacation flew by and I find it hard to believe, that I am already home, sitting at my computer writing my review.

<Content>A great vacation We just return from Edenh on March 9, had a great time. This resort is new with a few new opening glitches, none of which made our stay any less enjoyable. We have been to Punta Cana on vacation 5 times in the last 6 years and found this resort very enjoyable. The food was as good as any other resort we've been too. The staff amazed me, very hard working and friendly, they would go out of their way to help you even if there was no tip involved. The beach and pools are very nice and only one day out of 7 was it difficult to find a chair. The chair problem is mainly caused by people reserving chairs and then not using them. We saw this happen every day. We were in the conceige section with pink bracelet and found the rooms very nice. This was the first resort I have been to that had great water pressure in the shower and we never ran out of hot water.On saturday night March 8 the resort beside ours set off fire works on the beach at 10.00 pm, I'm not sure if this is a weekly event but the display was quite good. We would go back in a second.

<Content>Disappointed to say the least Just returned from Edehn on 3-14-08. Most of everything that was written, negative, is true. There needs to be more chairs for the beach, pool, there needs to be a reservation system for the restaurants. A panel of glass needs to be installed between the bathroom and sleeping area. I wondered what people did who had teenagers with them. I went on vacation to have a wonderful time and I just hope that anyone who stays at the Edenh does not judge the rest of the island by that experience. I have been there 6 times and every other resort was wonderful.We did have good food service, we did enjoy the buffet. The two negative experiences were that no one, not even the cashier at the front desk, would make change for a $20. The other was on Wednesday, 5 days into the vacation, we tipped for an umbrella by the pool. The umbrella was taken away a short time later as were most of the others, to be sent back to Santo Domingo for repairs. One couple kept theirs, they were also under a pool cabana, and some pink bracelets got to keep theirs. The rest of us were out of luck. The umbrellas were not returned by Friday when we left.We traveled through Apple. So with our Apple rep. as interpreter my husband tried to talk to management regarding the above mentioned things. The person in management blew him off, as if not to care.

<Content>Beautiful but BORING! We just returned from a week at the EdenH Real Arena and this was our experience.Check in was very smooth and our rooms were ready when we arrived (3pm) We were with 2 other couple and they had issues with the location of thier rooms and the hotel was very accomodating and switched thier rooms with a problem. Our room was an upgraded pool/ocean view room and was abit larger tan the normal Deluxe room. We were on the first floor in the first building and did have mosquitoe problems. We did bring bug coils and that seem to solve to problem. The rooms were nice and very clean. Our maid service was very good. always clean by 10am and plenty of fresh clean towels every morning. Beds were comfortable for us. They are very firm. Linens were changed daily and the floors were moped and bathrooms were cleaned daily also.Pools and Chairs were fine but if you wanted a bech chair you had to get really early to get one. We never were out by the pool before 8am and we always seem to get chairs for our group of 6 with no problem. Pools were clean but we did not understand the green tile they used in the bottom. It made the water murky looking and not blue and beautiful. But it was clean. The VIP pool was really nice. No chair problems and the upgraded drinks were readily available. The Bartenders were SO GREAT! The staff was really nice and was willing to go out of thier way to accomodate you in any way they could. The VIP lounge was exceptionally helpful. The problem was that they are extremely understaffed. They need to bring more people in to work.The food was Blah! the Asian was good but the rest was not so good. If the dish wasn't full of salt then it had no taste at all. The VIP Breakfast was AWESOME! Very good and always HOT! The buffet was alright the best part was the pasta.The resort has NO NIGHTLIFE! This resort is really boring especially for anyone who wants to stay up past 10:30pm. They would have a show and then want you to go to bed. No dancing, no fun music, no disco, no bowling! If your looking for fun activities to do during the day or night they just don't offer them. The only music they play is funeral music and that is even during the day by the pool. This was a caribbean mood killer!All in all the resort has a couple years to go till it is lush from all the new plantings. It is nice and clean and very beautiful. The food isn't all the good and the entertainment is horrible. Especially at night!

<Content>EdenH - Good and Bad We were at EdenH March 4-12. First, let me say that the layout of the hotel is great. All of the al la carte restaurants, the casino, the store, the lobby bar, the sport bar and the steps to the Tahntra Bar are all located within the circular area of the courtyard just outside of the front lobby. Easy to find everything. We were in building 2 on the first floor, overlooking a veryhigh wall of black plastic. No view whatsoever, and lots of mosquitos. We even had our own spray and brought along sticky bug strips, but to no avail. Even under the sheets at night with sheets over our heads, we could hear them buzzing around us. Lots of dead ones on the ceiling and walls from us killing them and previous guests too. Housekeeping should have a long extension handle mop to wipe them off. Our room was very functional and comfortable otherwise. Everything worked fine. We did have a problem with the deadbolt on the door, but that is very minor. Aslo, there is only one very small trash can in the room,and that one is placed inside the toilet area. I moved mine each day into the bathroom near the vanity. Each room could use another larger trash can for empty water bottles, beer cans, etc that need to get discarded throughout the day. The al la carte restaurants were all great food. We went to one of them twice. Don't bother getting in line at 5:00, that is just ridiculous. We went down at 6:15, the restuarants open at 6:30, and we walked right in with the people who had been waiting since 5:00. We did that each night, with the same results. The buffet has good breakfasts, but we did not eat any lunches and only one dinner in it. We did see an improvement each day with the staff getting on top of the dirty tables quicker and getting coffee around to all of the tables. We all agreed (party of 6) that the staff is working very hard. There just isn't enough of it yet. Those working are doing their best, and are very friendly. The beach, well, everything you read about getting up early is true, but mid-week we were being stopped by staff telling us we couldn't get on the beach before 6:30 a.m. Who knows how long that will last or be effective. It didn't matter anyways. Most or all chairs are reserved by 7:00 a.m. We did find several pieces of broken glass and other sharp objects in the sand. There is not a single trash can on the beach (except at noon when the staff is cooking the beach luncheon) then they bring down one or two cans with them, but remove them when the luncheon is over. No where to throw anything away that you find on the beach. Marie, one the waitresses on the beach, was very nice, and working hard. But we only saw two waitresses working the entire beach! They need help. So easier to get our own drinks sometimes. The alchohol is bad. Normandy brand is what we always seemed to be served, and some of it was undrinkable. I described my margarita from the lobby bar as jet fuel. Also, cannot get tonic water anywhere. Ice machines are placed around the resort guest room buildings, but none of them are hooked up yet. No ice before 10:00 a.m. when the pool bars open. If you have been out on the beach since 7:00, it would be nice to be able to get some ice for the bottled waters or sodas from the room we took down to the beach with us. The front desk people, although efficient in getting us checked in, are clearly tired of hearing complaints. We went there just once to complain about the mosquitos and when we said that we had a complaint, the look on the gals face was clearly that of tired of hearing it, what now. None of them are her fault, but she has to be the one to listen. Be kind to them. All of the restaurants and and buffet are enclosed, nothing open air, except the beach buffet. We did not like that. Too much like eating at a restaurant back home. We wanted to feel the breeze and warm air. My husband played volleyball, but they need more sand on the court. My brother in law stubbed his toe on a large rock just barely covered with sand and broke his toe. Most came off the court with scaped and bloody knees and elbows from falling on the court. There is way to little sand, and a very hard surface under that. Be careful if you play. All things considered, We had a nice time, we are tanned, relaxed and gained a few pounds from food. We probably won't go back to this resort, but that is due to the enclosed spaces and the location on Bavaro Beach. We just like it better down by the sunken ship. Hopefully management is working hard to get the problems taken care of, but I don't know what they can do about the mosquitos. The swamp is just too darned close to the rooms! We never did see them spray once while we were there. Be happy you are on vacation, and just go with the flow and don't sweat the small stuff too much.

<Content>Amazing time at Edenh A group of 7 of us (2 families) just returned from the Edenh. We were there from March 6 to 13. We are all seasoned travellers having visited dozens of 5 star resorts over the last 10 years, all over Mexico and the Caribbean. This was our first time to the DR, and we absoutely loved it, and found this resort to be of 5 star quality. Here is my perception of our experience (which was shared by all in my group).Check in:We checked into the VIP Paradise Club (aka pink bracelets)lounge at midnight. We were quickly assigned 2 adjacent rooms (we were travelling with our 2 teenage boys), on the third floor, pool facing in Building 1, as requested by our travel agent. The room was very nice, spacious, excellent view, and everything was in working order - no issues at all except for a minor toilet flushing problem (the flusher occasionally needing jiggling to stop the flush - not a problem at all). The air conditioning was excellent, adjusted in every room. The rooms were new, fresh and smelled clean and new. No mold anywhere. The beds, sheets and everything else was brand new and good quality (good thread count on the sheets); and the beds were very comfortable. Mosquitos were not an issue in any of the 4 rooms. Our friends had two rooms in Building 2 on the 4th floor, pool facing and they also had no issues. Food:The food was excellent at the ala carte's. We went to the Japanese Tapanyaki, Italian, French (Romantico), and American. The Italian was our favourite, but most people loved the Japanese. The sushi was excellent and very fresh - comparable to North American standards. All were very good though; however, some restaurants were slightly understaffed which left us with a slightly longer dining experience. The wait system for the ala carte's was painless. We actually walked in to the Romantico and Italian, as did the green bracelets; and waited about 1 hour for the American, and 2 hours for the Japanese. By waiting, I mean we were given a beeper, went to the Lobby Bar, enjoyed a few drinks with friends and then went to dinner at about 8 (American) and 9 (Japanese). There was a longer wait for the Japanese because they can only accommodate about 12 people at each hibachi table and there are only 3 in the restaurant, with the remaining tables offering sushi and other Asian food from a menu. There was a much shorter wait time for those tables. The buffet was very good for breakfast and lunch and hit and miss for dinner. Beach/PoolsBeautiful. The beach was very clean. No glass or syringes anywhere. Some seaweed that was constantly cleaned; and some twigs and branches from the palm trees. The ocean water was warm and beautiful with some seaweed as well. The kids enjoyed all the water sports. My husband and boys went on the catamaran, kayaks, banana boat (extra charge) and parasailing (extra charge). The catamaran and kayaks were always available and the boys used them every day, sometimes twice a day.We had no problem booking our free massages; my friend went three times (used the coupons for herself, her husband and her daughter). She was never refused; again contrary to reviews. We never used the free lobster dinner as we had lobster at the other restaurants (American and buffet in the paella for lunch).Beach Chair situation:Our first morning there we expected no chairs anywhere. Well, at 8 a.m. there were plenty of chairs at the VIP pools. We were able to find 7 chairs every day, no problem, even as late as 8:30 a.m.. We didn't try the beach because we knew these would be scarce. We opted to sit at the pool a mere 3 feet away from the beach, which took about 30 seconds to walk to the ocean... again, no big deal.StaffThe staff are the friendliest I've ever met in all my travels. Most speak English very well. Others try their best and are learning. The VIP Pool staff, closest to the towel shed, are exceptional, especially Carlitto (aka Carlos #2), Maria Elena and Ramon. They all deserve a huge bonus for keeping the guests entertained with their singing and dancing; providing us with beer in buckets and champagne on ice. Carlitto deserves special mention for his yummy Carlos' Especial drink - Baileys, Kahlua, Vodka and banana. Everyone I spoke to was having a good time. There were some minor complaints from some people that I spoke to. The reality is, some may have been expecting a 6 star American resort, instead of a 4 to 5 star Caribbean one. As two families, with 4 rooms, all had a great time with only very minor issues.The only minor complaint is the lack of music around the pool and in the Tahntra Bar. Staff informed us that management is trying to maintain an upscale spa type resort, hence the elevator music piped through the pool/grounds. This was annoying, however, the bartenders made up for it by doing impromptu singing and dancing (again, thanks to Carlitto). There was some talk that this may be changing though, as management sits back and re-assesses the strengths and weaknesses of the resort.From my experience, there was no two tier system. The green bracelet guests were receiving excellent service as well. The only differerence between green and pink is the location of the rooms (pink are closer to the beach); and some of the alcohol is of better quality (from what I saw, we got Absolute Vodka, at the best). For a few extra dollars, the pink bracelets Paradise Club rooms were well worth it. Our friends used the balcony jacuzzi daily (just put towels on the balcony railing). My husband even used it once. All in all, an excellent experience. Don't believe the bad reviews. They're over exaggerations of minor issues experienced by the minority. A true measure of a good experience is whether you'll return to the same resort twice. Although we have vowed never to do this because there are so many new and exciting places to visit, I think I may return to this one next year and am recommending this resort to a few friends who were thinking of visiting this summer but were put off by the negative reviews. This is truly a gorgeous resort and I'm already missing it. To everyone out there who is considering this resort, or has already booked. Don't worry. You will not regret it.

<Content>How not to start a resort! After being to Punta Cana a number of times (8), and being to a number of other places in the Carribean and Mexico, this resort is by far the worst ever. For one thing, it was opened much too soon, as rooms were not finished, workmanship was very poor, electrical and plumbing were not on par with anything I had ever seen. There were no signs directing you to the restaurants, and upon arrival and a 2 hr. wait for a room, we followed a porter taking us to our room on the 4th floor. As we approached the elevator to take us up, the porter asked if we would prefer to walk up the steps as the elevator was not working. By the way, this elevator was not working even when we left. We had to walk to the other end of our wing to get an elevator that did work. Whoever was the brilliant person who designed these rooms should be assigned to a deserted island with a thatched hut. Why is there a 6'x6' square opening between the bathroom and the sleeping area? This does not give you any privacy although the door to the bathroom had a lock on it. It was like looking at a big screen TV when anybody was doing thieir thing in the bathroom. Management was very bad, as decisions were made without any notice. I will not be back to this resort.

<Content>A big Disappointment We went to EdenH the last week of January. It's taken me a long time to write a review because I have been waiting for correspondance from the hotel. They stopped communicating with me when I complained.We bought the pink bracelet, although we didn't actually get it until the last 3 days. We did try for 4 days to get it. We saw the service with both bracelets. I can say we enjoyed the VIP pools when we finally were allowed to sit there. Check in: We got there at 1 am and didn't get checked into a room til 5:30 am. We then walked in on a sleeping couple and had to get another room.Rooms- our room was nice, but on the ground floor with Many mosquitoes. We moved to the fourth floor after 3 days of sitting in the lobby and waiting for someone to help us. PC Mike dodged us for two days, after telling us on day 2 that he would help us. He didn't. Our fourth floor room in building two, was next to the front and had construction going all day from 8 am to 6pm and was very noisy. The halls had no lights at night. We complained to the front desk several times, but I don't think they understood because they brought us a light bulb. Our jacuzzi was caved in around the taps. There were wires sticking out of the walls in two places and the railing was not finished.Food: Quite good, but wait time was very long in the restaurants so we only went to two. We chose not to waste our time in line.Moving: When we moved rooms the third time, aporter moved us and my sneakers were left and one of my partners golf shoes. We tried daily to find them at Guest services, but they didn't help at all. They just kept looking in a drawer and asked us to fill out a form. We filled out the form four times. No one ever got back to us. Lobby: Most of our time was spent here. It was highly entertaining there. There was lots of Drama and a lot of waiting and little action. Thank heavens there was a bar close and the lobby sofas were very comfy.We have been to Punta Cana several times and have had wonderful experiences in the past. This was so upsetting for us.

<Content>Great! We are a 23 year old couple and we have been to Eden from Feb 23 to Feb 29. We booked our vacation through cheap carribien who partner with Turinter agency in DR. Turinter's rep Sammy was very helpful and tried to accommodate our needs and anticipate our problems and was over all a very pleasant individual. Not like we had any problems.This is a very new hotel there is a good chance to get a cheap discount rate. The new hotel means just that, new, so some things are not complete and it should be expected. Complaining about the lack of over the top service from the place you paid 2/3 the usual price for the area for seems strange to me. If you keep in mind that the hotel is new you will have a great vacation. We sure did.Our check-in took about an hour, granted we arrived 40 minutes before they were expecting us. Edenh's check in is at 3 o'clock. Our tour agency informed us about that. So it makes no sense to complain about long wait if you arrive at 12 or earlier like some of the reviewers. We changed into something lighter (we left snow storm in Boston) and spent the next hour exploring the property which is very beautiful. NH is a European chain and the property has a very simple and modern feel to it. The check in staff is not friendly. People say staff is not friendly, however, we only found check in staff to be so. They should fire all of them and put some of the bartenders on check in cause those guys and ladies are for the most part very friendly and try hard to create a vacation ambiance. The hotel is shaped like |_| with open side facing the ocean. We were on the outside of the right wing facing a empty under construction lot(there is also inside rooms facing the pool area) with some palm trees on it. Except there was no construction going on there. Our forth floor room allowed us to see the ocean pretty well and actually that side of the hotel gets to see the sunrise from the sea which is well worth waking up at 6:30 for. Our room as very good. Everything worked, maids restocked and cleaned everything every day around 2-3, and we never had to chase them. No one ever barged into your room(room can be locked from inside in such a way it can be open from outside if you feel you need to), no early morning calls, no construction noises ( I don't even know where it was happening) and ONE mosquito in 7 days. So unless few spots of smudged paint can ruin your vacation you should have no problems.The beach and the overall pool area very beautiful and active. Kayaking, windsurfing and sailing is free and always available; motorized sports are also available albeit a little expensive for the entertainment value they provide in my opinion. One review mentioned lack of activity at the pool area. The review said that not even music was playing. That makes me think we are reviewing different hotels. There is always music at the lunch hut by the beach. There are water aerobics classes/shows from time to time. There are even Merengue(DR dance) classes by the food hut. There is a frequently occupied beach volleyball net, ping pong table and a 6x6 feet chess board by the pool. The person who gives out ping pong racquets also has books and board games. Management just needs to let people know about that which they don't. They also bring out cooking equipment and cook all kinds of interesting foods right on the beach which can be a show by itself if you like that kind of stuff. My point is all this creates very vacation like atmosphere whether you participate in aforementioned activities or not.The situation with beach chairs is true. Unless you are willing to wake up really early you will be very likely to get no chairs. I don't know how big of an issue it is for others but for us it wasn't a problem. We just lay on the beach when we weren't playing volleyball, swimming or getting a drink. I mean thats what sand is on the beach in the first place isn't it?:)The drinks are bad, which we very much anticipated. It seems that the price of all inclusive hotels would go through the roof if everyone wanted a gray goose based cocktail. So expect a mojito and a sex on the beach taste pretty much the same since they have the same very sweet mix as a base. My preference was a gin and tonic. Can't go wrong with such a simple combination. My girlfriend tried pina colada from time to time and she enjoyed it as well. VIP visitors get the access to premium liquor(imported as opposed to local) but more on VIP later. The local(and as far as I could see only) beer is better then i thought it would be. Its a light lager and tastes sort of like heinken. I didn't notice bartenders paying more attention to people with VIP bands. The speed of service in my opinion depends on how well are you able to attract attention to yourself, just like in most bars, lounges, etc. The bartenders are generally very friendly but few don't speak English too well so asking for a complicated drink might leave you with some sugary vomit inducing liquid. One of the more reason I stuck with gin and tonic - everyone understood that one:)The food is good. A lot of variety. You can have a great omlet in the morning, a greasy(not saying it in a negative sense) burger and a salmon steak in the evening. Which brings me to the second most complained point so far: reservations. There is about 350 rooms in the hotel assuming each has at least 2 its 700 people who obviously can not be accommodated by 4 restaurants if everyone want to eat at the same time. However the buffet, which was, pretty good always had tables. I read few reviews say that they saw people with red bands(VIP) walk in to the top of the line while they have been waiting for hours to get in. I think those VIP people just did what we did. Every day we went to the hostess of the restaurant of our choice for the day around 5:30 and asked to be seated and 8(some times 8:30) and our longest wait was 10 minutes even if there was a line at our reservation time .We ate in a la carte restaurants 5 our of our 6 nights there. Yes its unlikely you will eat at 6:30 (that's when restaurants open) unless you are willing to get in line early but if you use a little common sense you are guaranteed to eat where you want. The food and decoration was good except for the French which, in my opinion, looked like a teenage girl's bedroom on Valentien's day. It was only missing some boy band poster.There was a show in the resort almost every day at 9:30. It was pretty entertaining for the most part. One day they brought in a local circus troupe which was amazing especially considering the limitations of the courtyard the show was in.As for late night there a rooftop bar ,Tantra which is open until 2. They have beds and pool chair as well regular lounge couches and bar stools. Having a drink while chatting with your friends and watching stars in the carribean sky is pretty relaxing and enjoyable experience. They also make better drinks there.The place has a lit pool but it didn't look like many people wanted to take a late night dip on the roof top.I want to talk about VIP in a separate paragraph. It seems that a lion's share of bad reviews here are coming from people who bought VIP packages and rightfully not satisfied with their experience. We also talked to two couples(one our age the second in their early 50s) at the resort who had VIP packages and their experience left a lot to be desired. The VIP rooms are on the very front of the hotel and were the first rooms to be offered when the hotel opened. I believe that those rooms were rushed and therefore have problems with it. Both of our VIP friends had their jacuzzi not working, one had a leak from the ceiling, and in both of them had to wait for new rooms which took away from the relaxation feeling. So as strange as it sounds I recommend not buying VIP packages for now.So long story short there is only so much that can be expected from a new hotel. So if you go with this thought in mind I am pretty sure you will have a great time!

<Content>VIP really stands for Vile, Inferior, Pointless We came back from EdenH on March 6, 2008. We convinced some friends and family to travel with us to what was supposed to be a beautiful vacation, and I feel guilty for making them endure such a terrible resort.Everything that has been written about the resort that is negative in nature is absolutely correct.A vacation should be a time to relax, sleep in (if you want to) and to enjoy yourself.This trip consisted of being forced to wake up at 6am to get a chair by the pool, and that was if you were able to avoid the guards who policed the beach as if saving a chair was a crime. Then you'd have to wait in line for hours just to try to get a chance to eat at one of the restaurants.Waiting wouldn't be so bad if we could sit and talk while in line, however that was being policed too. Apparently it's against EdenH law to sit in a chair while standing motionless in a non-moving line. We paid for the VIP service hoping to secure better service for ourselves, but this was a WASTE of money!!As a VIP, you receive a pink bracelet which should signal to the staff that you've paid for the right for better service. Pink bracelets weren't worth the plastic they were made out of. The brochures promised that a complimentary message would be included as the spa...however when I went there, I was told that I'd have to pay for my message but they would give me 20 minutes more if I paid for the message up front.We didn't get access to superior drinks, if we got any drinks at all! We would have to beg the bartender for coffee every morning and drinks would not be served to us at the VIP pool. Other reviews stated that guests with pink bracelets received buckets of drinks, but please be assured that was NOT the case. Only if a bartender or waitress was bribed with $10 or $20 would they come to serve you.My husband asked for a hamburger as the food was, at best lukewarm - not to mention it was the same menu everyday and the food became monotonous. However the hamburger was actually a SPAMburger with spam meat as the main ingredient. He was up all night throwing up (NOT alcohol related as we had too much trouble trying to get a drink).The only good things I can mention is that the morning buffet for eggs were very good, the Beach was picturesque and the weather was fantastic.However, any other resort in Punta Cana will have a similar beach (hopefully without the broken glass, syringes etc), and the weather will be common to all resorts. I've been to other resorts and was able to enjoy more than a morning egg buffet.So the end result is that you will probably enjoy yourself much more in another resort. I've been to Punta Cana before and had a great time. It's a beautiful place with beautiful beaches and water. EdenH is NOT the place to spend your money, and the VIP service is an even bigger waste of money. Avoid EdenH at all costs!!!

<Content>Nice, but needs to work out a lot of kinks still We just returned from a trip to the Edenh 3/7/08. We had a large group consisting of 27 people. For most of our group this was our 4th, 5th  6th trip to the Dominican. We are not new to the island. Since the resort opened, we had all been reading the mixed reviews on the hotel. We decided not jump to conclusions and give it the benefit of the doubt. After all, it is a new resort. And with our size group, we almost always have fun, no matter where we go. We did have fun, however there are definitely some kinks that need to be worked out for the Edendh. The resort is very appealing to the eye with many fountains and decorative touches. Lots of nice areas to capture good vacation photos. Our entire group had the pink VIP bracelets. This didn't change much of our trip, other than the fact that we were able to access an additional 2 pools. Also, we did not stay together at all times, so that is not the reason we had problems with certain things below. Let me break down certain areas of resort:Beach/Pool - Definitely not enough chairs anywhere!! Even at the VIP pools, there were not enough chairs to accomodate the guests. We tried going to one of the regular pools also, to no avail. All 3 times we went to the beach, we had to lay on our beach towels b/c there were no chairs free anywhere. Part of the problem is the that people were reserving chairs at ungodly hours of the morning. I am on vacation. If I want to sleep until 8:00 and then go to the beach and lay on a lounge chair for the day, that should not be a problem. I shouldn't have to get up at 4 and 5 am everyday to reserve a chair for the morning. And security did no such thing about limiting reserved chairs to one hour of hold time. Maid Service - All of the maids were very nice and efficient, however, they need to work on their timing. We were informed right off the bat that our room could be cleaned anytime between 8am and 6 pm. Quite a span, no matter how large the hotel. On many days, 2 of the couples were not brought fresh towels until 8  9pm. A la Carte Restuarants - There is no system for these restuarants. It is a first come, first serve basis. Understandable, but many times, people started lining up outside the places at 5. (Keep in mind, they do not open until 6:30pm) And even being in line that early did not mean you would get a 6:30 seating. It is a waste of precious time on vacation to have to wait in line for over an hour for dinner and then be told you cannot eat for another 2 hours. You should definitely be able to make reservations for each of the 4 gourmet restuarants. This would save a lot of time, aggravation and hassle on the guests' and the staff's parts. Once inside the restuarants, the food was very good. The Asian and Seafood Grille were the 2 best and it showed b/c they always had the longest line. Buffet - The buffet was always good, although the food could have been labeled a bit clearer. (it was not always very obvious). The staff at the buffet was a bit slow on getting drinks and re-setting tables. We ended up eating most of our daily meals there. All of the staff was very friendly and helpful. We did not come across too many language barriers. The nightly entertainment was good. The views from every room were beautiful. Overall the resort was very nice, but they need to work out quite a few kinks before they can truly call themselves a 5 star resort. We have been to 3 star resorts that have provided greater satisfaction then this so-called 5 star resort.

<Content>Worst vacation ever New hotel, very modern and very clean - that is all I can say about it. Not enough staff on hand to service you and almost no one spoke english. Booked garden view room and faced an alley overlooking local residence housing, clotheslines and storage for building materials as well as garbage trucks and laundry constantly running by. No privacy in bathroom as it is open to bedroom. No liquor in drinks unless you asked! Not enough beach chairs, had to be down there by 6:00 a.m. to reserve one each day! Had to stand in line by 4:00 each afternoon to get in any of the ala carte restaurants at least by 6:30. And then you may only receive a beeper to be paged later (if your beeper worked at all!) First night did not get beeped til 10:00 p.m. Buffet had same food every day and nothing hot and not very good. Friends had a sink fall out in their room, lights fall from ceiling and no air conditioning for four days! Met a lot of people there as everyone spent the entire time sharing horror stories and complaining to each other about their experience here. Will never return nor recommend to anyone.Save your money!

<Content>Real Hassle Just returned from Edenh on March 10. Had hoped the problems previously mentioned were exaggerations or would have been resolved but unfortunately neither was the case. Was given a room on the fourth floor (2401) facing the pool so mosquitoes were tolerable. However, our traveling companions we$re on 1st floor (room 2103) and the mosquitoes were ridiculous. They were up all night swatting and killing literally hundreds of mosquitoes. Next day we let them sleep in our room and the following day they were given a room on the second floor other side which seemed to make all the difference. Our Jacuzzi leaked and Maint. came twice to fix it. Beach chairs were a big hassle and dealing with the guards at 6:00 am who were trying to enforce the rules (which changed daily) was almost comical. No place to get take-out coffee early in the morning. Lines for restaurants early in the week were horrible and a lot of angry people were taking their frustrations out on the hostesses. Situation did improve as the week progressed. Service at all the restaurants was unpredictable but often very poor. Had to clear a table in the buffet the first night and beg for a table setting and something to drink. Was told they were out of red wine then witnessed tables all around us being served red wine. Servers and cooks would seldom make eye contact. Drinks at the beach were empty calories with seemingly little alcohol. Often had to wait more than 5 minutes to be served. Was passed over for pink bracelets numerous times. Some safety issues: I personally tripped twice going from the lower section of the beach restaurant to the elevated section. I also witnessed a man carrying two drinks walk right into the glass wall at the sports bar breaking both glasses. And finally, I saw two Sterno's get knocked to the floor. Once in the buffet where the employee knocked one off a table and had trouble extinguishing the flames which were very close to some table cloths and curtains. A second time in the sports bar where a guest knocked one on the floor and then just left so the flames (which are barely visible) could have easily caught someone's clothes on fire.I would recommend choosing another resort or switching or canceling if you are already booked . . . at least until the reviews start coming in better. I don't think that will be anytime soon. It鈥檚 a shame because there are some really good people working long hours every day doing the best they can. But management has not hired nor trained nearly enough of them.

<Content>A Waisted Vacation If you like;- Motor boats, seadoo's, parasails, gasoline smell, helicopter tours over your head, swimming in oil leaks, noise and air pollution at the beach.- Get up at 6am to secure a chair at the beach or pool.- Wait standing in line 90 minutes to get into one of the 4 restaurants (always only half full).- Ask 6 times at the buffet for water (and not get any).- Feel like your were at work.- Feel like an 'airline' customer.This place is for you...Positive side;- New and very nice installations.- Morning buffet is very good with competent staff.- Management is trying to make it better but seams to use the 'trial  error' approach on solving problems.Conclusion;Did not like it, will not go back and will not recommend it. This $6K school break vacation with my family was a total waste.

<Content>Excellent Vacation and Resort We were at Edenh from 2/29-3/7 and had a great vacation and experience. There were 12 of us in our immediate group and we had no major issues. We too were worried after reading all the negative reviews; however, went with an open mind as our group makes the best of every vacation we go on together. Let me go through the highlights:Check In - Check in was a breeze and we had no problems. Only one of our rooms were ready @ 12:00 or so when we arrived and the others were promised to be ready by 3:00, which they were. The front desk was very friendly and accomodating. Rooms - Rooms were very nice and we were all in building 2. No one had any complaints. One room did have an issue w/ mosquitos but some bug spray took care of that. As others have said, the maids and refridgerator fillers often leave the doors open which is how the mosquitos are getting in. Food - Food was great. Out of our 12, no one got sick, which is always a huge plus for us as usually one or two are running to the bathroom at some point during our trip. At times the food in the main buffet was cold and I think part of the issue w/ that is that they haven't quite mastered the heating elements for the dishes and being that the entire buffet is air conditioned. The pasta station was excellent and you were always guaranteed a hot dish from there. We ate at the restaurant by the pool for lunch and that food was good too. There was always the staples - french fries and pizza if you couldn't find something you liked.We did eat in the Grill - and had the steak and lobster. Steak was good but lobster was a little odd but we expected that. We also ate in the Romantic restaurant one night and the chicken stuffed with crab and lobster was great. One of our group got a beeper around 6:30 for the grill and we did not get seated until 9:00. I think in the future when the staff are more experienced, the turnaround time will definitely increase. Keep in mind too in these restaurants you are getting a full course meal. There were definitely people lining up to get into the other restraurants, especially the Japanese. Our view was - that spending 2+ hours in line for Japanese on our vacation to the Dominican was not worth it. We could have that at home.Pink vs. Green - we upgraded to the pink, which was nice but saw really no huge advantages, other than the premium alcohol (absolute, jim beam, malibu, etc.) and having our own swim up pool bar. Not sure where people are coming from re: the pink getting served quicker, etc. Often when I went to the bar, I was standing and had my hand w/ my bracelet on at my side. Pool - If you do upgrade to pink - you will have fantastic bartenders - Ramon and Carlos. They were so much fun and made fantastic drinks. Pool is very nice in the Paradise Club section; however, the main pool has all of the activities. Beach - beach was beautiful and we never experienced any broken glass, etc. There is the issue w/ the chairs and the resort does need some additional chairs. One day I did have to spread my towel out and lay in the sand but it was not going to ruin my vacation as that is exactly what we do here on vacation to MD or NJ beaches - we have a blanket and our towels. There are some nice souvenier shops if you walk down the beach to your left.Steve's Corner Bar - Would definitely recommend if you are looking to leave the resort. See Punta Cana Mike and he will hook you up. Great atmosphere and alot of fun. It also is right by a bunch of shops so if you want to take a break from drinking, you can.Grounds - grounds are nice and will be even better once everything continues to grow. The resort is set up nice and is not too big nor too small. We never heard any loud construction noises during our entire stay either.Staff - staff was fantastic. We never once encountered a grumpy or non-speaking worker during our stay. We received a pleasant Hola from everyone we passed from the greeter at the buffet to the grounds workers to the maids. Entertainment - this was OK and would be an area that is lacking compared to other resorts; however, keeping in mind that the resort is new - this too will improve with time. The casino was fun and we did have some winners in our group. Additionally, the sports bar was cool and we played some pool. Finally, the tantra bar on top is really cool and was nice to just hang out at after a long day in the sun. A special Hello to Punta Cana Mike and Ivan. Thanks for a fantastic vacation and we highly recommend this resort. This is mine and my wife's 5th trip to Punta Cana + 5 other trips to the Riveria Maya in Mexico and this vacation ranks as one of our top vacations. Please email me with any specific questions.

<Content>Hated the Experience There were four of us who went over on an Apple Charter. We thought we had been given a complete tour. We were never told about the theater that has Las Vegas-type shows nightly. We discovered it on our own the night before we were leaving and the show was almost over. Also, we never saw a first aid station and went looking for one. Found the doctor's office, but even though the sign said he was supposed to be in, he wasn't. One of our friends needed to see him, but he was out of luck. It's a good thing it wasn't an emergency. Even overlooking the dead bodies of the mosquitoes on the lampshades,walls, mirrors, etc, one has the idea that housekeeping doesn't really care about keeping house. They take 35 minutes to clean a room and then give it a short spray of insecticide just before they leave - by no means effective to kill all the critters they let in while they were cleaning! I demanded that my room be sprayed the first night we arrived and they finally showed up at 12:30 AM! Waiting 2, 3, 4 or more hours for a table at any of the restaurants is not my idea of a vacation, I go on vacation to relax, to enjoy the sun, to sit and talk to friends. But, we couldn't even do that, because we couldn't get chairs on the beach or at the pool. We had to spread our towels on the hard ground, and we could never find a patch of shade to get any relief from the sun after we became sunburned.Tipping is to insure promptness. At Edenh Real tipping really means bribery. In order to get decent service we had to slip $10's and $20's to ensure a table in a restaurant (obviously still waiting in line); and constantly slip money to waitresses to get drinks (and we're not heavy drinkers)!I went to the Renova Salon for a manicure and they used dirty instruments on my hands and feet, and then used the same dirty instruments on my friend. I had a French manicure and pedicure, and she caused my foot to bleed and she dabbed at the blood with an orange stick wrapped in cotton, which she dipped into the acetone container, contaminating the entire container! The French polish came off within an hour or so. I had them re-do it and they wanted to charge me but I refused to pay them any more money. We saw people falling over wires and into water troughs that surround the fountains that were supposed to be lit but weren't., We saw exposed electrical wiring. It's a very unsafe environment.Very, very disappointed.....this was supposed to be a wonderful place. An Eden and we were all so excited. It was our first vacation in five years and we were so looking forward to relaxing.We made the best out of a really bad situation, but it wasn't easy.Bring plenty of insecticide! And patience!

<Content>Fabulous! We had a fabulous time at the EdenH. We stayed from March 1-March 8. The hotel was making new improvements each day! The beach is beautiful....entertainment was wonderful. We enjoyed the Asain resturaunt the best. The itailian was good as well. The buffet was also tasty! You do have to wait in line at 5:00 if you want to get into one of the resturaunts. The casino and spa are up and running! Nightly entertainment starts at 9:30 every night! THey have different activities around the pool during the day (water areobics..salsa dancing classes etc.) They have a kid's club..which is fabulous if you have small children. Our nephew wanted to go to kid's club every day. They started a new rule for beach and pool chairs. You have to wait until 7:00a.m. to put your towels on the chairs to reserve them. The rooms were great! It was a great time! I would definitly go back!Ashley and ErikAge: 24-28

<Content>Had a Great Time But... We went to EdenH from Feb 17-24.  I won't go in to the details of all of the negative aspects of the resort because everything that has been written so far is accurate.  The chair situation, reservation situation, VIP service, the staff......all were disappointing and frustrating.  The beach is fabulous, just remember to wear sandles at all times as there is glass (and a syringe was found beside us) buried in the sand everywhere. Garbage cans would be great. The water was amazing (this is the first time I was in Punta Cana).  What I would like to say is that where I come from (Nova Scotia) we pride ourselves on our hospitality. Tourism is a big thing for our economy. If a resort here was owned by a large chain ( as EdenH is), and it was newly opened, we would transfer some of our top customer service people from other resorts to make sure that all the visitors to this new resort went away with a positive opinion. Not the case here! I have heard the comment about the fact that this is a spanish country, so therefore it is expected that the staff would speak Spanish. If I opened a resort in NS that was catering to the German population, I would make sure that I had front line staff that spoke German. At the VIP lobby, the first staff you meet cannot communicate with their English (or French) guests! At all!! Very few of the staff could actually communicate with you. So be it! But management were not helpful at all when you had an issue or complaint. Maybe because they've heard so many of them. The other thing I would say is that it is a beautiful resort, clean, the weather was hot, the food-ok.... the staff-terrible (for the most part).  As to your initial arrival, no fruit basket, rum, robes, and for some, no rooms. That's how you start your vacation. Transat rep met with us the first day to go over things. Asked the group who had gotten their Welcome Basket, No One! She took everyone's names and room numbers, and we finally got our rum 5 minutes before our bus left to take us to the airport 7 days later (and we asked every single day) Depending on who asked me (and how well I know them) I would probably recommend it to some (non-discriminating travellers) and not to others (who expect 4-5* service, which it isn't).  Enough said!

<Content>Counting the days until we return My husband and I just returned from a one-week stay at Edenh Real in Punta Cana. This was our third trip to the DR and we were not disappointed.We read the reviews prior to our arrival and were needlessly concerned about the resort. Seems like the biggest complaint was the chairs. Our experience was that it is not the issue of the resort, but that of the guests. While on the beach we saw many people who placed their personal belongings on chairs and did not use them until late in the day, if at all. This caused others who were on the beach to sit on the sand on their towels. We understand more chairs are on their way.Another complaint is the restaurant policy. Again, we found this to be caused by the guests, not the resort. The resort has a no reservation policy; first come first seated. You must be properly dressed and ready to have dinner when you arrive at the restaurant. For some reason guests wait in line for a dinner pager and wait for long periods before being seated. My husband and I went to dinner at the a la carte restaurants between 7:30 and 8:00, got a pager and went to the bar for a cocktail before dinner. We never waited more than 20 minutes for our table. Large parties take longer to be seated.Neither of these negatives per other reviews were an issue for us. Also, the whole notion of differences between pink and green wristbands is a joke. We NEVER saw any preferential treatment.Now for all the wonderful things:Staff: The Dominicans are very friendly and very willing to help. Not all speak English, but the Dominican language is Spanish. Guests should try to speak their language. Carlos and Ramon at the pool bar are great guys and a lot of fun. Tip them well. Ivan the Great, the Reception Manager, is a very warm and caring person.Rooms: Comfortable and a nice size. The smoked glass on the shower and toilet doors offered enough privacy and was not an issue for us. The rooms were clean.Grounds: Beautiful and nicely laid out. Food: We found the food to be very good, including the buffet. It was as good as any other five star all-inclusive we've been to.They are still experiencing growing pains and the resort will only get better with time. We plan on returning next year.

<Content>Great stay We were quite nervous about this trip-- had booked awhile ago, before there were any reviews, then the reviews started coming out and they were all bad. However we were pleasantly surprised, we had a great stay. There was a little confusion at the front desk at check in-but that was due to a large group arriving just before us. Ours rooms were ready, so we were able to change and get down to the beach. The buffet by the beach was great. The rooms were clean and nice although the bathroom set-up is a little weird it wasn't as bad as we thought it would be. The restaurants were all very good, the service was fine. Overall we liked the place, it was beautiful but a little disorganized. I think they are getting better every day. The biggest complaint was not enough chairs at the beach or pool. If you have already booked-don't worry you will have a good time. We did consider upgrading at check-in and was told it was $35.00per day, per person, we are a family of five adults so we decided not too-we have no regrets over that decision-don't think it would have been worth the money.

<Author>AJTTomahawk_Wi
<Content>Be ready for waiting in line Ok, just got back from the Dominican and the EdenH Real in Punta Cana, The owners should have did there homework or at least gone to Hotel 101, The weather was perfect..thats where the good things end. First when we got there Apple was the tour company we had, they had us meet several hrs after we arrived and explained everything (we thought) she never tood us that the resort had a Theater that had night shows, we found out the last day we where there. also we had to start to stand in line at 4pm to get thechance to eat at the resteruant.at 6;30.only a chance.also the service was not there what so ever,we had to pay (bribes) to get service no longer tips (to insure prompness) there are several workers that made the stay good and we told them that ,The food was equal to most High School cafatera food.Now lets talk about the lack of chairs, lets just say they need to purchase about 400 more. The Hotel management team has no idea how to treat guests I had to help people that fell and tripped on exposed wires, and hazard with steps..Some people say it will take a year to fix, you can't change a dog into a cat. i belive you need to fix the management, before you can fix the line staff..

<Content>Sorry, I would not go back!!! Returned from an 8 day stay on 3/5/08. The Eden itself is beautiful. Give it a couple of years for all of the new plantings to grow and it will LOOK wonderful. Unless they make some changes, they will only LOOK wonderful. Guest services is absolutely useless. If you call them, they will tell you that your problem will be solved in 10 minutes. Mind you, that is Dominican time - if it happens it will take at least 2 hours. Our maid could not understand that we had 4 people in our room even though it was written on her sheet. We could not get 4 towels and 4 washcloths to save our lives! One day the maid comes knocking at 8 AM, the next I had to call at 7:15 PM because they hadn't been there yet and we needed to get cleaned up for dinner. Speaking of dinner, the reservation system is a joke. If you don't want to wait until 9 o'clock to eat (unless you want to go to the buffet every night) plan on getting in line at 5:00 and standing in line for 1-1/2 hours to make reservations. The food is mediocre and there are always empty tables. I don't think their chefs can keep up. The absolutely best meal we had - it was wonderful! - was in the Asian restaurant at the hibachi grill. And Felix in the buffet could make you an awesome omlet in the buffet in the mornings. There is not much hot or cold food in the buffet. Most of it is room temperature - that's not to say it was bad though. Lunch is prepared on the beach every day. That is really good. Most of the staff is very friendly. Two bartenders at the bar by the pool and buffet, not the swim up bar, really didn't act like they wanted to be there. And the mini frige in your room - you only get two of each drink each day. Two regular sodas, two diet sodas, four waters (two for the coffee pot), and two beers. Not at all like they claim in their advertising. We had been reading the reviews before we went so we knew things were not perfect. We went to have a good time and we made sure we did that. Next time, I will go somewhere else. I do not need the headaches and hassles that come with this place. And for beach chairs, set your alarm folks. The beach is absolutely beautiful.

<Content>Military State at the EdenH Real Arena We have now experienced it all...police state within a democracy. All the negativity is unfortunately true. We are very low key and easy going Canadian Carribean travellers. We have been to five other 4 to 5+ Carribean all-inclusive resorts, including Mexico (where, the the way, the Carbonieros routinely patrol the beaches), Puerto Plata, Cuba, and Punta Cana and have never been accosted by security for taking a chair to the beach or having them apprehend our beach towel. The issues previously referred to (ie., the low quality food and alcohol; the glass and garbage on the beach, the horrific beach chair issue, the a la carte dinner system fiasco; the substandard hygienic practices; the continual changing of rules and regulations regarding various aspects of the resort, are all true so I will not go into those details yet again. I have no problem with the issues per say...my problem is with the EdenH's solution - more security. It is beyond belief ...security at the each of the three beach entrances, security between the beach and pools; security at all of the a la carte restaurants, security at each of the hotel entrances...and so on. It was distrurbing and unsettling to say the least. If you have already booked and paid for your vacation...well enjoy and see it as a lesson learned...if not, DO NOT GO...it has been the absolute worst vacation experience of our life. By the way, Punta Cana Mike, the ex-car salesman from Toronto, told us that the beach chair ratio is consistent with all other resorts (i;e., 85% capacity) in the Punta Cana area.. right...sure Mike...keep talkin'...he also supports the military tactics of the securilty. The resorts next door, The Melia, invited us to use their beach chairs.

<Content>It's getting there... My parents and I stayed at EdenH Feb. 26 鈥?Mar. 3. A little background: I鈥檓 in my mid-20s, parents are in their early/mid 50s. This was our second trip to the Dominican Republic and fourth time staying at an all-inclusive resort. We booked through Signature Vacations and flew with SkyService out of Kitchener. We were pretty nervous and unsure of what to expect after reading all of the mixed reviews, so we were pleasantly surprised. The place was beautiful, the staff was very friendly and helpful despite being overwhelmed by the large crowds, and we had a good time.CHECK IN/FRONT DESK: We had some issues with our plane so we didn鈥檛 arrive at EdenH until 5:00 am on Feb. 26. Check in was quick, no problems there. We had requested an ocean view room when we booked the trip but didn鈥檛 get it, though we were not really expecting to. We learned while checking in that the hotel was fully booked for that week so we didn鈥檛 bother requesting to change rooms or to upgrade (we had green bracelets). We stopped in occasionally throughout the week to ask some questions at the front desk and staff was always friendly and helpful. No, their English is not fluent but they do try their best to help you out.ROOMS: We were in rm. 1217 facing off the resort. Previous reviews have mentioned that these rooms overlook a local 鈥渟lum鈥?but when we were there, that area looked clean and was pretty quiet. The room was nice and clean. The beds were the most comfortable hotel beds we鈥檝e ever slept on! The room was cleaned every day and our toiletries got replenished as well. For some reason, kleenex and washcloths weren鈥檛 replenished, but the woman who did our room that week was very nice about getting those things if we asked. Our biggest issues with the room were the lack of privacy in the bathrooms and the mosquitoes. The glass and tile in the bathrooms really do create an echo chamber and the lights shine right onto the bed through the opening in the wall. We came prepared with an old shower curtain and painter鈥檚 tape, so this wasn鈥檛 too bad for us but it really is an awkward setup. As for the mosquitoes, we killed anywhere from 6-10 of them in our room daily and did come home with several bites despite using repellant and despite EdenH staff fumigating daily. Again, we came prepared with a fly swatter, but we didn鈥檛 enjoy having to fight off mosquitoes every time we were in our room. FOOD/DRINKS: The food at the main buffet is pretty average all-inclusive fare. They change up some of the dishes from day to day, but it does get monotonous after a week (as it would anywhere). At peak times, it was hard to get a drink or get tables cleared until people were almost done their meal. It seemed like they were understaffed. The beach buffet was great and that鈥檚 where we found the freshest, best cooked food. The food temperature was hit or miss but most of time, mine was at least still lukewarm when I got to my table. The highlight was Felix at the omelet station every morning. He is fantastic! He gets to know everyone and is a big fan of hockey and baseball, so he knows your local team and the results of games from the night before. He鈥檒l remember you when you come back the next morning and always greets you with a big smile. We found the best drinks were made at the pool bar and the sports bar. Other reviewers are right, each bartender makes the same drink a different way so you never really get the same thing twice. For non-alcoholic drinks, Yanira at the sports bar makes a great cappuccino. The a la cartes鈥e managed to try all four of them once. On our first day, I got in line for the Shore Grill at 5:30, and then waited until 6:30, when the hostess would start going down the line with pagers. I was able to get one, but the lines were quite long and many people weren鈥檛 so lucky. The next night, the system had changed and they were giving out pagers at 5:30 instead. They continued this system for the rest of the time that we were there. We thought this worked pretty well; it prevented the lines from getting too long and we were happy not to have to spend all of our afternoons in line. The food everywhere was good, the Italian restaurant had some of the best lasagna I鈥檝e ever tried. The white wine was also excellent. The service was inconsistent, though. The Shore Grill and the Italian restaurant were very understaffed. There was only one person taking orders on the nights we were there, so they were limiting the number of people that could come in. The food was very slow to arrive after we ordered there. Be prepared to spend at least 1.5 hours in the restaurant once you are seated. The French/Romantic restaurant was our favourite, the staff was well trained and efficient. Yes, the d茅cor is tacky but we just had fun with it. The Asian was good as well, we sat at the hibachi and enjoyed it. Unlike some of the previous reviewers, we had a good experience with Nancy, the hostess at the French/Asian restaurants.BEACH/POOL: The beach at EdenH is gorgeous. Easily the nicest, largest, and best maintained beach in its area! It was generally clean, though after a few days (when the wind picked up) we did start noticing some broken glass and other random debris in the sand under some palapas. The pools are all beautiful as well and the water was not cold. The chair situation wasn't too bad for us, but it was pretty ridiculous in general. The first two days, we didn't bother with chairs but on the third, my parents started getting up to watch the sunrise and then saved some chairs between 6:30 and 7:00 am. They had no problems finding three chairs at that time. During the day, walking along the beach, at least half of the chairs were not being occupied and we did see people saving multiple sets of chairs for themselves in the sun/shade. A notice was put in the hotel鈥檚 daily newsletter about chair etiquette, but it appeared that most people either didn鈥檛 see it or just ignored it. Yes, there is a chair shortage but there is also an abundance of selfish people. I have since read that the shipments of new chairs are starting to arrive and some form of chair policy is being enforced, so hopefully things will settle down.ENTERTAINMENT/ACTIVITIES: There were shows every night, usually in the central plaza area (though I believe the indoor theatre is now open) starting at 9:45. We saw the Dominican Folklore show, which involved traditional Dominican dancing and music with a group from Santo Domingo. We also saw 鈥淎 Swinging Affair鈥?(my personal favourite), with two singers covering some of the classic jazz and swing songs. There was also a White Night party, which was pretty much an hour of dancing to club style music with men on stilts, mimes, and other people in white costumes dancing around with you. It looked like fun, but we were too tired to stay up for the whole thing. During the day, there are dance lessons by the beach buffet (lots of fun!) and occasionally a bar show or cigar show there too. There鈥檚 a daily newsletter in the lobby that tells you what鈥檚 happening that day, but beware: when we were there, the daily schedule was the same every day (except for the nightly shows) even though there were different things going on at the beach in the afternoon. Be sure to ask around so you don鈥檛 miss out on anything!OVERALL: We enjoyed our time at EdenH and had a good vacation despite the bumps along the way. We were treated well and never felt like second class citizens with our green bracelets. Would we recommend this hotel to others? It depends on the type of place you're looking for and the type of person you are. They are trying to respond to guest feedback, we felt like they were genuinely interested in improving things. They really do work hard to accommodate people as best they can. So, if you're the type of person who is willing to be patient and doesn鈥檛 mind the growing pains that come with staying at a brand new resort, then I'd definitely recommend EdenH. On the other hand, if you're looking for a 100% relaxing vacation, where you're totally catered to and don't have to worry about a thing (nothing wrong with that, you are on holiday!)...this isn't the place just yet. Also, if you're looking for a resort that has the traditional island atmosphere or more of a party vibe, this isn't it. EdenH is quieter and has more of a modern, stylish feel.

<Content>A Great Time at Edenh Real Arena We arrived at Edenh Real Arena on Feb 29. A family of 8 in four rooms. We checked in immediately on arrival at 2:30 pm and went directly to our rooms, no bellman, just directed to stay to the left. We were given an envelope with our room cards, towel cards and a letter describing the amenities of the resort and restaurants hours of operations.  We had green wristbands but stayed in Paradise Club rooms which were in order and clean. The rooms are spacious with large bathrooms. The mattresses are really firm. If your TV is in Spanish only check the menu and change the language to English. The room was cleaned and towels replaced every morning and our toiletries were replaced when used up. Every evening fresh towels were brought in during the turn down service. We tipped a dollar in the am and another in the pm and left a dollar in the fridge each day for the mini-bar re-stocker.  Breakfast was good with lots of choice and great coffee. Only once did we have trouble finding a table and waited a couple of minutes until it was cleared and reset. The beach is beautiful and we stayed everyday from 10 until 4. The lounge chairs were secured by waking up before six and tying towels to the backs. I never reserved 8 as we were never all together at one time on the beach but usually had 6, The shortage of chairs is really a problem and I didn't see people reserving at beach and pool as we saw the same people near us each day and they stayed most of the day. I also rarely saw unoccupied chairs for hours. The day after we arrived white plastic chairs arrived on the beach but did not help much to provide the necessary seating. We ate lunch everyday at the beach grill. The food was ok but repetitive. We could have walked up to the buffet if we had wanted more variety. The al a carte restaurants for dinner were great, the Asian excellent. We waited in line for reservations each day some days for 10 minutes others for 45, not much longer than many restaurants in Toronto on Friday evening.  My kids aged 19,20,23 met lots of people and hung out at the Sports bar and Tantra Lounge after 10. They had a great time. My 11 year old also met friends on the beach and had a great time at the spray paint activity on Thursday eve. Everyone enjoyed the entertainment in the evening especially the Circus and Jazz nights.  If you want a great off campus activity try zip lining. We booked it through our Sunwing tour guide at the hotel. We took a bus 45 minutes up to the mountains and glided on cables wearing a harness from platform to platform. This was a fantastic holiday for our family and we look forward to returning to Edenh Real for Christmas Holiday next year.

<Content>Loved Edenh We stayed at the Edenh from Feb 29 - Mar 7. We were very nervous because of all the bad reviews, but we loved it there! The resort is beautiful, the pools are great and the beach is beyond words! We did not have any problems while we were there and heard very few people complaining. Of course, there is the not enough chairs thing, but I think that is worse because people are saving chairs in more than one spot. (We saw chairs with towels on them on the beach that remained empty for most of the day.) The a la cartes are on a first come first served basis now and that seems to be working out. If the restaurant was full then you got a beeper -- so go and have a drink and enjoy until you get in! I can not say enough good things about the staff. They are exceptional! For those of you who have booked Edenh and are worried, just go and enjoy-- we sure did!

<Content>Teacher Sub Loved the Beautiful Beach Vacationed at hotel from Feb. 22-29, 2008. We had no problem with reservations desk, although others had commented about long waits. Our 1st floor room was ready and fully equipped. A major problem, however, was the mosquitoes. We killed them for a few days and after complaining the room was treated promptly. Unfortunately, treatment did not help. The problem is two-fold, the 1st floor with its ground plants and the maids leaving their carts in the hallway with the door open. We endured this for too long and finally complained to our Apple rep. She was great and immediately walked us over to reservations and secured us a room on the 3rd floor. A bellhop came promptly to move our bags. Moving higher solved the mosquito problem even though the maids continued to leave the door open when cleaning. Another negative is the food which was fine, not great. The specialty restaurants are too small to accommodate most guests and they need to become much more efficient since often we waited 1-2 hours even though many tables were empty but not cleared. Food at buffet was very good and plentiful. Last and perhaps biggest negative was insufficient number of beach chairs. Getting up at 5:30-6:00 am on vacation to find 2 beach chairs and twice not finding any was annoying. Every day chairs at the pool would be dragged down to the beach. I was told more chairs would be arriving but that did not do us any good.Now for the positives. The standard room was spacious and always clean. The room jacuzzi worked and was a nice touch. The balcony view was lovely and the complex itself is very beautiful and large. The beach is magnificent with large palm trees and small huts for shade throughout the beach. The water was clear and any sea weed was raked on the beach. The nightly entertainment was good and varied while the drinks were plentiful and easily available whether on the beach, in a bar or at dinner. The service was excellent and the servers could not do enough to make you welcomed and comfortable. That goes for the maids, bellhops, waiters, bar maids, front desk etc...The Apple reps at the airports, hotel, on tour were extremely helpful and always willing to make our stay very pleasant.It's not a 5-star hotel yet but should be in a year or two at which time it's price will double. We feel that, overall, we got a good bargain even though some kinks need to be worked out.

<Content>Loved the Weather, Hotel, Not So Much My wife and I have traveled to Punta Cana twice in the last 6 months. Our first trip was to Excellence and this one to Edenh. We really wanted to go back to Excellence, but Edenh was a great deal financially. We decided on Edenh. NH Hotels is worldwide and we figured that they would know what they were doing. We booked Feb 29 thru March 7. You have heard all the complaints about chairs and lines and some service issues, so I will only go there if I find a new twist.Here is the main difference. Excellence is in the hospitality business. They will do anything they can to make your stay incredible. Edenh is in the hostility business. They will do anything they can to make a new rule cause a confrontation or just plain aggrevate you.Example: At Excellence if you are walking down a hallway and you run into a staff member, they stop walking, back out of your way and give you a warm greeting. I had several managers at Edenh cut me off. As we were leaving, my wife and I were carrying our bags to the lobby. We were following two managers. As we got to the lobby doors, the manager opened the door, glanced back toward us and let the door close. A guest in the courtyard, jumped up and held the door for us. Where I come from you, you hold doors for people. It is just common courtesy. The management at Edenh is just plain rude.Waiting for food: OK, rules changed while we were there so let me fill you in. When we first arrived, you would line up for the restaurant starting about 4:30. At 5:30, they would start taking reservations. There was no difference if you were pink or green. That lasted until Tue. Then with no notice to the guests, they decided to not take reservations any longer, but would open the doors to the restaurant at 6:30 and it would be first come first serve. Once the restaurant was full, they would hand out beepers. Not a bad system if you were willing to start lining up at 4:30. This is where it gets to be fun. One day I was in line, and there was a gap because of a walkway, and two guys from Pittsburgh decided to fill the gap and cut the line. According to them, if there is a gap, it can be filled. They assured everyone that was the way it is where they come from. Well I too am from Pittsburgh and can assure you, that is not the way it is. I had to get security and have them removed. This is just one example of peoples frustration caused by management and their policies.The next big issue waiting in line happened on Wed. The restaurants are located right off the courtyard. As people started lining up at 4:30, they would take a chair from the courtyard because of a two hour wait. When we got there, the chairs were gone. For awhile, it was ok. Soon a man with a cain showed up behind me. He had a bad back and would have trouble standing for two hours. My wife was in the shower, but joined me in line by 5:15 and has a steel rod in her back. Standing would also be a problem for her. I went to the front desk for answers about the missing chairs. They told me they had been removed to be cleaned. I asked to speak to the GM. No way there. I took it upon myself to go the the theater and grab two chairs for my wife and the man on the cain. As I left the theater, I was pursued by 3 or 4 managers and security. I delivered the chairs and then had to deal with the problem. One manager Jose Marie, told us that no one was allowed to sit. If a guest had a problem, they could leave the line and come back later. Trust me, if you leave the line, you might as well go to buffet. There will be no restaurant for you. Fortunately there was a man in front of me that spoke spanish and negotiated us keeping two chairs. At one point, it looked like I may be arrested for caring for the hotel guests. Jose Marie seemed to be at the center of most problems. His solution to issues never included the comfort or contentment of the hotel guests. This whole line situation could be fun if they served drinks and waited on the guests. You really got to meet great people in line. Interesting thing was that when you came out of the restaurant, the chairs had come back. Our last night there we decided to go to Asian for hibachy. Great meal. We lined up at 4:30, as usual. This time the chairs were gone again, but the first guy in line had a chair. As we sat there, I saw a manager with two security guards enter the courtyard. Now these security guards were much bigger that the ones that chased me the night before. They approched the guy in the chair and basically removed the chair. Told him he must not have a chair. They then left a security guard in front of each restaurant door. Everyone is there on a beach vacation. They treated you like there was going to be a coup. Anyway, we were in line to make a reservation for the second hibachy sitting. We let all the people going to dinner at 6:30 pass us and then we could get reservations. While waiting, Jose Marie came to the door. We asked for hibachy at 8. He told us that we would have to take what became available. The hostess just rolled her eyes and when Jose went to bother someone else, she gave us the reservation we asked for.Hotels are in the hospitality business. The staff at Edenh are really good and seem to want to serve. Management on the other hand has made the decision that they will make choices for you and that they will be the right ones. These people need to go on vacation themselves. They seem to be wound way too tight.Survival tips: Thanks to another review from TripAdvisor, my vacation was great. Every morning, we went to buffet for breakfast. Pretty good food. As we were leaving, we gathered some food. We then packed a cooler with water and beer. If you head toward the ocean and make a right hand turn and walk about 30 to 40 minutes, you come upon a Nature Park. As a land mark, once you pass a pier, it is probably another 10 minutes. Once there, chairs and privacy are plentyful. My wife likes to lay out topless, but not among hundreds of people. At the park there are hundreds of chairs but on any given day, only 5 to 10 people were around us and they were spread out over about 50 yards. We spent the day there and then headed back to Edenh. When we got there, I got in line for restaurant. My wife showered. She would come and relieve me and then I would go and shower. I would be back in time for dinner. We ate at the restaurants everyday.If you paid for pink wristbands, you waisted money. We met a couple that paid for pink to avoid the problems. They were treated as if they were green. We met a guy in pink that could not get the better alcohol. It all comes down to the management. They as a group need to be replaced and the new ones reminded that the guests and their comfort come first. This hotel when it first opened was at number 14 on TripAdvisor, now it is at 52. Nh should do the math.Love Punta Cana and its weather and its people, HATE the management at Edenh.Hope this helps.

<Content>Awesome beach We overall had a wonderful vacation at the Edenh Real. We had a bit of a rocky beginning because at check in we met people who had been there a few days, and still did not get their room. They were shipped to another resort until they had a room for them. We did not not have that experience. We had a room a few hours later, but it was a little tense. I too had read many reviews before we left for our week long vacation on Feb. 17, and was a little nervous about what we would find. We were fortunate because we had a beautiful room that angled out so we could see the ocean from our balcony. We faced poolside which is important to get. There were minor glitches in the room, doors to shower and toilet areas not hung correctly, but other than that we were very pleased with our clean large room. The pool area and the beach area are both lovely. Only dilemma when we were there, was that you had to get up by 5:30 a.m. to secure chairs at the pool or beach for the day. Supposedly more chairs were on the way. It is true, if you had a pink wristband you received a different type of service that the green wristband we had. That became very annoying as the week went on, and that really was our biggest complaint of the resort. You really were treated differently if you had the wrong wristband. We found the food to be very good at the buffets and average at the individual restaurants. Again, at the restaurants you had to wait in line beginning at about 5:30 p.m. to try and get a reservation for the night. That really has to change. I believe our disappointment was that a supposedly stress free vacation often became stressful. If you are booked for this resort, you will go and have a great time. Enjoy the beautiful resort but realize that you can't get too uptight about all the kinks still visible in this new resort. If you haven't booked it yet, I would choose another resort while this one gets its act together.

<Content>Have Not Arrived and it is tripling in cost I have not even arrived at the hotel yet and the cost is about to triple. I thought I was getting a good deal with the upgraded Apple Club Room. However, after reading the reviews on this site, I decided to upgrade to Paradise Club. APlle says that they are just a wholeseller and can't help. My travel agent says that she cannot help and to call the hotel direct. I did. The hotel wanted to charge me an additional $682.00 for one level upgrade. Then I asked what type of view I would have. the reple, you will probably be looking over the garbage cans. I then asked what an oceanview would cost. Reply, oceanview will cost $385.00. I wish that had been explained in the beginning. Oh yea, internet extra . No 0one seems to want to help at this point. I am already disappointed. I will be one of the many standing in line behind the pink arm bands wishing I could eat.

<Content>Way far to be a 5 stars We stay at the Edenh Real Arena during Feb23-March 1rst 2008, i read a lot of reviews before on here and i kept saying to myself that people was exagerated, but that was the truth.That resort is not ready at all for customer yet, there's plenty of things that it's not complete and the VIP Manager Clara keep saying that it's a 5 stars and that she don't care bout the comment on Trip Advisor. Well im telling u guys she SHOULD CARE.We were 4 of us and we had booked a VIP (Concierge Room) Ocean view with a Whirlpool tub on the balcony, as we got there, the check in for the VIP is seperate from the other guess,and now i know why(there's so many prob that they don't want the other guess to notice everytime somebody complain). As we check in right away we been told that it will be impossible to have the room that we paid for, cause they were overbooking. Just to let u know we paid $2200.00 per person for a week, So i freak out a bit and they told us that we will have to come back the next morning to have one, that story when over and over until i got pissed and i give up. Very disapointed.And the restaurant a la carte, Forget bout that, unless u feel like argue all week and fight with the management which it doesnt give any result u won't be able to get to it. Even if u are VIP is doesn t mean [---], So don't spend any money at all for that section cause u dont get nothing else then the other guests.Normally we are probly go at the A la Carte restaurant once a week when we travel (which is around 3-4 trip a year) as we got 4 business it our only way to escape, but regarding the restaurant we try to use all the one that was included in our package cause the buffet was very very not variate, same things day after day without a lot of choice.All my week i was up at 5h00 am on the beach to be able to get some chair for us and our guess that we took with us, and even at that time the choice was almost 0, for bout 1000guess they got around 600 chairs, so good luck everybody. It was bad cause when we take vacation we are going there for fun and relaxation not being fustrated all week bout the anoiing stuff.No music at all on the site, ITS TRUE THEY ARE NOT READY AS THEY KEEP SAYING. Well to me when u are not ready, specially for a 5 stars, well u don' t open.If u are looking for a 3 stars hotel and u got it very cheap u can go there, but if u are expecting something classy forget bout that place.I been at the LTI last years and they considerate themselfs as 4 stars but i can tell that they are a 5 stars, that place was amazing.Anyway to yu Mme Clara that u said to me last week that u don't care bout Trip Advisor comment, u should read all those reviews on here, and also ask to ur American Manager, who cancelle all our reservation by sending u an email without notify the guess.WE CALL THAT NO CLASS AT ALLI will never go back to ur hotel even if i had a free week., i stop now cause there's to much thing to complain bout and i dont want o loose some other time with uMorin/Gee

<Content>I know what the real problem is... I know what the real problem is...Most of the problems I saw at the resort (02/28/08 - 03/04/08) were due to the fact the folks who didn't upgrade to the VIP package (pink wrist band) wanted to be treated like they had.The resort is new so obviously the best rooms were completed first.We had no problems with anything related to check in, our rooms, folks at the hotel, bartenders, etc.Everyone we dealt with was great.All facilities were great and we had a blast.We had to reserve our chairs early but that was it.The food could be better if they want to be considered a 5 star resort.The only real complaint I would have is that the bars don't open early enough and the lack of tunes throughout the place.Oh yeah... and all the yellow and green band people whining all the time.These folks were down right rude at times.I never saw any of them tip and they were always barking orders.And yes... when you came to my VIP pool and bar I told you to leave because I paid extra so I wouldn't have to listen to you cry all day long.We met some great folks... Buck and his brother in the topless bar and many vacationing brothers and sisters from north of the border.I had a great time and look forward to going back.

<Content>Not so Edenh... Time of stay: February 23-29, 2008. When we arrived, we asked for a room upgrade but were told that presidential suites are not available because they are still under renovations. Our check in was quick since we were VIP but we got a room on the first floor. When we asked to change our room, we were told that the hotel was overbooked and were put on a waiting list. When more rooms became available no one from the hotel bothered to call us to offer another room, even though we were on the list. At least our room faced the pool area and not the construction so there was none of that sewer smell that some guests have complained about. Shortly after settling into our room we found out that the person who told us that presidential suites were not available lied because we saw people going in and out of those rooms and relaxing on their huge balconies, and those people were guests and not hotel workers!This resort is still under construction so expect to see plenty of construction workers walking around and eyeing guests of the hotel (female guests). The masquitos are a huge problem and they are everywhere. The walls in our room were covered with squashed bugs or stains from that. Only part of those stains came from us...Regarding the problem with beach chairs: if you are not prepared to get up at 4:30 in the morning (the latest!) to get a chair on the beach or 6:00 to get a chair by the pool, don't bother coming to this place. If you are VIP you can at least get a chair by the pool reserved for VIPs only untill around 7:00. After having problems with restaurant reservations (hotel guests fighting!) which were also for VIPs only, they changed their system to have all guests wait in line when restaurant opens instead of making reservations at front desk at 7 in the morning every day (if you were not there by 6:15 the latest, good luck getting a table). Restaurants are small and tables are limited but VIPs should get tables first so upgrade if you can. This change was effective the day before we left so I am not sure how well this new system is working out. The buffet is OK since it seems that they serve a lot of same dishes for lunch and dinner, but it gets boring after few days.The staff is a little unorganized and most of them speak very little english or none at all. I think by the end of the year this is going to be a much better place to visit. Good luck to those brave enough to make reservations now!

<Content>Beautiful resort, but We stayed at the EdenH from Feb. 2 to 16. The hotel is absolutely beautiful. We arrived on the 2nd and were quickly given a room and driven in a golf cart by the bellboy. The room was beautiful but we had booked a Le Mirage package with Air Transat which was supposed to be closest to the beach with ocean view. The room was on the fourth floor facing the side with no view except someone's laundry laid out to dry on the ground. The elevators were not working at that time and as my husband had had a knee replacement surgery th 4th floor just wasn't going to work. The bellboy realized this and called the front desk and we were then taken to a room in the 2000 bldg. on the first floor with a side view of a plastic fence hiding a construction site. The room was very nice, but the mosquitos were wicked, so when we went for our orientation meeting with our Air Transat rep the next morning we complained and were told to come the next day and we would be given a better room. We did so and were given a beautiful room in the 1000 bldg. on the second floor with a view of the pool and ocean view.The room was beautiful, but we don't understand why they built that big opening into the bathroom from the bedroom. It was okay for us as a couple, but I don't think adults would like to be bathing in the jacuzzi tub on view to their children. We were also warned that the locks on the door did not always lock when you left your room, so we always checked that when we left the room. We went to all the restaurants and the food was very good at all. The same could not be said for the buffet. It was boring, and the atmosphere was nil. We have been to a lot of resorts and they usually have theme nights where the buffet is decorated accordingly. Not at Eden. The food there was definitely not 5 star. We also went most days to lunch at the restaurant by the pool. Same thing, boring food. If you choose hamburgers make sure they put them back on the grill for a bit as they are cooked rare and put in a container on the side. The restaurant also was not big enough for the size of the resort and understaffed to the point where you had to wait a long time to get a drink of water or anything. We usually got our own before we sat down.We hated the discrimination of the colour of band that you wore. If you didn't have a pink band you could not use the pools in front of either building, nor the bars there either. People with pink bands could also get reservations for the restaurants and it was very annoying to go line up at 6:00 for the 6:30 opening and see a group with pink bands just walk in ahead of you.The staff at the front desk were the most annoying. We have never stayed at a place where the bell boys spoke better English than the front desk staff. They also acted as though they were doing you a favour to even speak to you. They would be looking at their computers when you walked up and purposely made you wait and then made a big show that you were interupting them.Now for the problem of the chairs and towels. When we were there they had no towel tickets and everyone could get as many towels as they wanted. People were saving chairs both at the beach and by the pool. We always got up early so had no problem, but things got nasty around noon when the people who slept in got up and were looking for a chair by the pool. It got very bad and some security people were telling guests that if chairs had hotel towels on and were empty that they could just take them. Needless to say this caused a riot when the owners of the chairs returned. Yes you had to get up early to get chairs by the pool or beach (we were out by 6:00 every day), but I think that is tyrue of most resorts.One day this will be a wonderful resort, but they need to do something about their front desk staff and the discrimination of arm bands. Everyone should have the same colour and be welcome to use any of the facilities at the hotel.

<Content>beautiful with frustrating issues the hotel is beautiful. I like the layout and it has a beautiful and large beach. The food is good.Here are my frustrations. We just got back this morning after 8 days. We have visited DR 6 times so we do have something to compare it to.(1) the beach is dirty, we found many pieces of glass, cigarette buts, plastic wrap, straws etc. They need to place garbage cans around. People are on vacation but we're not pigs and if you put the garbage containers there, we will use them. (2) the lack of beach and pool chairs is ridiculous. People were getting up at 4 am to put towels on chairs....not acceptable. Other people would then come out in the morning , throw them on the beach and take the chairs. Tempers got very hot over this issue. They easily need twice as many chairs as they have now.(3) food at breakfast and lunch was very good and the system seemed to work well. However supper reservations is the most ineffective system I have ever experienced. Once again tempers got very hot over this issue. You cannot book in any of the a la cartes until 6:00 pm. People actually come and line up for an hour or more, to book a seat in the restaurant and are then told they don't know how long it will take for a table. One couple stood in line at 6:00 and finally got seated at 9:50 that night .They were very upset naturally. They definitely need to change this system and move people through their meals more efficiently.the food is good when you finally get it, but.....(4) The lobby bar and sports bar which are the only 2 available at the time that you are waiting, forever, for your dinner table, are unfortunately very slow. They need at least 5 bartenders going flat out at this time in each bar. When people are angry about the wait for food and then they can't get a drink at the bar, it gets nasty(5) my final comment will be on the shower rooms provided. The men had the luxury of hot water while the women, when the tap is turned to hot, the water actually stops running. So it's cold or colder for those of us that had a late flight out and were showering in the community showers at the front of the building's entrance.These issues are all easily fixed but have not been addressed since the place opened in January, as you will see when you read through the reviews, as I have done since the place opened.You only get one chance to make a first impression and mine is that I will not be returning because although we are very low maintenance travellers, a clean beach, a chair, a drink and a meal are the basics for us.

<Content>BAD Patio door would not lock. They fixed that. Could not open from outside since it did not have a handle. Shower door did not have a knob so it was hard to get out of the shower. Bathroom door did not have a door knob. Tub had no stopper. They brought a stopper that they just set in there and then you could not get it out. Not enough hot water to fill tub. Did not always get coffee for the next morning. Had to call and have it bought up. Could not get diet soda for the mini-bar and could only get 2 beers per day in the mini-bar. No wash rags. Did not always leave clean hand towels or bath towels. When reservations were made, reserved room with king bed, got two double beds. Never got king bed room.Watched maids clean room every day. Never got clean sheets. They washed the drinking glasses in the bathroom sink with just water and dried them with a used hand towel. Sometimes it was 5:00pm before they came to clean room while my husband and I were trying to get showered to go to dinner. The buffet was good. I feel there should have been more signs to tell you what you were eating. The restaurants where not good enough to wait 2 or 3 hours to eat. It was not explained that there were different levels of ALL INCLUSIVE when it came to liquor (you could not even buy better liquor at the bar), eating and swimming, so when you wait in line for 1 陆 to 2 hours to eat at 6, and someone with a different color arm band can just advance to the front of the line, it makes for a bad situation. I was really mad, the times that happened to me and then had to wait til 8:30 or 9 to be able to eat in that restaurant.The first time or two we went to the buffet there seemed to be enough people to bring your cola, tea, coffee, wine, etc. By about day 2 or 3, you had to wait until you were almost finished eating before you got a beverage of any kind.Bartenders did not understand English, You had to point at what you wanted. If they acted like they understood you, they made you a drink and it was not even close to what you ordered. You could not get the same drink made the same way twice in 7 days, no mater what bar you were at. Ran out of beer and diet soda everyday. Sometimes they didn鈥檛 even have diet soda the next day.Entertainment was good, but seating to be able to see entertainment was poor.Pool was nice, but trying to get a lounge chair was a joke. People got up at 6am and put towels on them to save them and then maybe never came til 4pm. I have never in my life seen anything like it. After you spend your day on the concrete, you are not very happy considering the amount of money you have spent on a week long vacation and then find out that people who flew from the same location we did, spent $200 to $400 less per person for one week. Why were the people with the pink arm bands allowed to use the pool where the green arm band people were? We could not use their pool, because I tried and was asked to leave. Then on the last evening we were there, they have the nerve to put a nasty letter under the door about saving lounge chairs. They need more lounge chairs.........The beach was very nice, but it was the same problem with the lounge chairs. We never got to the beach to sit and enjoy the view and the sun.Check in is a real joke. First of all we get there at 1:30pm. We realize we will not get a room until 3pm, that is ok, but then they take you to a room that is already occupied. Then you go back to the front desk and go through the entire process again and don鈥檛 get a room until 6pm. By this time I am very tired, hot and mad.......see 1a above........... check out was better, but then when they told gentleman he could not have a Coke to take his medicine because he had already checked out of the room, that was the last straw. I WILL NEVER RETURN AND APPLE IS QUESTIONABLE.........WHERE IS THE 5 STAR SERVICE????????The overall attitude of the hotel staff was not real good. There were some that were real nice but could not help you with any problems or issues.Took 1 陆 hours to check in with luggage and get through the metal detection area when we left. They only had one metal detector open and the rest were closed. Doesn鈥檛 seem right to make that amount of people wait for so long.No one met us at the airport when we arrived. We were just herded around. Finding the bus to get on to take us to the hotel was rather hard since everyone you asked told you a different row and direction.I do not feel that we got our moneys worth. The only real positive point was the weather. It was wonderful, but I was ready to get home, now that is sad..........The only way I can rate it is poor.

<Content>Hate to say it but...I agree with everyone DON"T GO! This is not our first visit to DR....we love it....Our experience at Eden was booked for 25th of Feb until the 3rd of March. We made it Feb 25th and 26th (all it took) and then nicely asked to be moved somewhere else or go home! Everything that you read is true about this resort. It will be Ok maybe in about 3 years but for now....change your plans or go somewhere else. Everything involved, waiting and listening to the guest whine. I read about this resort for months (booked in October) knowing it was new. We are not hard to please, but when on vacation, we did not want to get up at 5am to hope to enjoy the day on the beach. No chairs, fist fights, hollaring and down right rudeness of the guests. I just got up in the morning of day 3 at 6:30 walked around the beach to see if I could find a chair at the beach or at the pool and NOPE....so I waited and made the decision to go to our travel rep, who was wonderfulby the way and. I explained that I wanted to be moved she didn't even ask why, I am assuming that this is happening alot. She told me to come back at 11 and by 4:00 we were in a wonderful spot and enjoyed the rest of our stay in wonderful Punta Cana. (one wasted full day + the wait for our room on Day 1, we arrived at 11:45 or so and were not in a room until 4:45 (bottom floor with a bathtub on the balcony, which was very useful...LOL!)Talked to people on the plane home that were at Eden and stayed the full week and there wasn't one that had anything good to say and said they had wished that they had did the same as we did and moved. I feel bad as alot of them will probably not return to the beautiful Country of Punta Cana and there are nice resorts out there....but Eden is not one of them

<Content>EdenH - change if you can Just got back from EdenH last night - not a 4 or 5 star...I would say 3 or 3.5.Check in was fine - no problems. Very quick and efficientRoom was fine... a very strange layout. I'm sure it would be a problem if you had more than 2 people, but OK for us. We had a great view.Staff worked very hard and for the most part tried. However they were understaffed and undertrained.Beach and pool area was beautiful. Clean.Lots of small problems not worth mentioning, could happen at any hotel.Major problems - not enough chairs which everyone is aware of. I had to get up at 6:30 or 7 every day to get chairs for 4 people.We left on Monday, March 3rd and the resort was very, very crowded that day, more families with kids and some spring breakers so I'm guessing this week problem will get worse.Restaruarants - .....food was OK - not good, not bad some things were very good, some terrible, but what you'd expect at an all inclusive.... Lunch at restaurant at beach was the same every day...got very old quickly....again I could live with that.Reservations were a disaster. People were in line at 4:45 for dinner reservations for 6:30 or later. At 6:30, people still in line on several nights were told all restaurants were filled. So you had to wait 2 hours or more to be told you had to go to the buffet.They need a reservation system. Several people told us they walked into restaurants at 8:30 or 9:00 and just refused to leave until they were fed. There were always empty tables in restaurants....they just would not fill them. The entire problem could be fixed by opening restuarnats at 5:30 instead of 6:30 and just having people get in line to eat....or even better taking reservations when you checked in for your stay,not getting in line and then getting a beeper for 3 hours later (if you're lucky). Some people had beepers and still didn't get in. At the French restuarant our last night, people walked past the line, past the staff seating people and sat at tables and were served......Just a mess. People were angry all over the place.....I I don't want to go on vacation and fight for pool chairs and dinner reservations......Quite honestly this won't be a 5 star resort ever. It's ok, but I would never go back. I went with an open mind and had read the reviews prior to, but its just not worth the aggravation. It was not relaxing. We were next to some young people (about 25 years old) and they loved it....but they didn't care about the restaurants and ate at the buffet every night, so I guess its what you want from a resort.Yes what everyone says about the drinks are true. Stick with beer, wine and very simple mixed drinks (rum and coke, etc).If you order anything different, every bar, every bartender makes it different. We even ordered the same drink from the same bartender and got different drinks....as I said not a big deal in the scheme of things but when added to everything else, its annoying.We asked to see the hotel manager on several occasions but he was no where to be found.....At 7:30 with people very upset all over the resort, he was out to dinner!!! Very poor management at the resort, but very hardworking staffIf you have the opportunity to change hotels, I would recommend you do that. I tried but Apple basically lied to us about all the problems. It's just not worth the hassle.

<Content>I guess we were just lucky... We just returned last night from EdenH and were fairly pleased with the resort after spending the week from February 24th to March 2nd.We are a couple in our late 30's with 3 younger children (who were left at home with Grandma) and have been to Punta Cana on 3 previous occaisions ( Barcelo Palace, Catalonia Bavaro and the former Ocean Bavaro). we consider ourselves as easy going people and generally have a good vacation no matter where we are.After following along for months on TA and Debbies Domincian we booked a Mirage Concierge room with our travel agent in January as well as Club Class seats for the flight. At $80pp each way they paid for themselves in the quick check-in at the airport without a line and the weight of the luggage. Our bags were No. 1 and No. 4 off of the conveyor belt. Lucky.Check-InAfter arriving at the hotel around 10:30pm, we found our way into the VIP check-in on the right side of the lobby where we were welcomed with drinks and cool cloths. There were two couples and one family checking in at 3 desks so check-in took about 5 minutes total and we were off to our room with Rami our bell-boy who pointed out the sites to us. He and every other front line worker we met were terrific.RoomOur room was 1172 in the buildings on the left side of the resort, facing the pool on the first floor. We had requested a pool side upper floor so we were pleased with getting half of our request. Now I am from Ontario so I know what a mosquito looks like and we had at least 40 in the room when we arrived. Not a problem. Either they come in when the maids are in the room or my wife was suspecting the ventilation system. So after a few minutes of swatting the room was clear. Previous efforts of previous guests could be seen on the walls, curtains and even the ceiling (some pretty tall guests) After the second night's turn down service we actually started hanging the do not disturb sign on our door when we went down to dinner to stop the maid from coming back at night and letting more in. It must be a first floor thing because other couples in similar rooms on the upper floors had little to no mosquito activity. The room itself was nicely appointed and since we had the concierge room the whirlpool tub was on the patio and there was no opening looking into the bathroom. The only things missing were a coffee maker (we had plenty of coffee and sugar) and no bathrobes which would be useful since our patio was a fairly public space looking onto the kiddie pool. We asked for four days in a row before we gave up. However, everything was where it should be, no sinks falling off the wall or doors coming off the hinges. There were several minor things (glass door needing adjustment, pour paint job, door rubbing on floor) that we didn't bother to ask about but hopefully that will all be cleaned up soon. I consider ourselves lucky.BeachThe beach is typical of any beach at the south end of punta cana beatiful white sand and calm wave action. There is no snorkelling in front of the hotel. We walked over to the next property (just past the aquatics centre) and tried in a marked area of red buoys. We did find two large starfish (about 12 inches across) and some small fish in amongst the sea grass but that was it. They have a trampoline anchored out front and it was used quite regularly by old and young alike. The aquatics staff at this hotel is the friendliest bunch of guys you could meet and were always willing and eager to help you with anything to get you out on the water.The Chair GameYes there is a chair problem, but I believe a good part of that problem is the amount of hype associated with this hotel and that particular problem on this and other websites. Once the hype is gone hopefully the chair situation will work itself out. When I met Mike Bryant he said the hotel had only planned, as other hotels in the area do, on chairs to accomodate an 80% occupancy rate (due to changeover of guests and daytrips). Although most guests were waking up very (and I mean very early) we would arrive on scene around 10:00 AM everyday and only on Monday were we unable to find chairs and on Sunday we could only find one chair. Again lucky. The PoolsWe only used the family VIP pool and outdoors jaccuzzi located at the north side of the property. Dany was by far our favourite bartender. If you go try to see how many Dany Specials there are. My favourite was as he called it Dany's Special No. 5 Don't ask wht's in it just try it.The RestaurantsThis is where the hotel needs some serious reworking. When we arrived to check-in I made a point of asking about reservations. I was told to call or come down the next morning to make them for the evening. So the next morning at 9:00 we stopped in the VIP lounge and were told that all of the reservations were full. We were then told to come down the next day at 7:00 or call to make reservations. Excuse me but I am on vacation so we let it go. The next day I just happed to wake up at 7:05 so I called the VIP Guest services and made reservations for the American. That afternoon a note was left in our room which said that the reservation system had changed and all reservations made were now cancelled. It was now to be a first come first served method and you could come down to the restaurants (not call) starting at 5:30 they would give out beepers. Well it worked for that day and the next but by the third day if you were not in line by 5:00 you might not get in. I believe part of the problem lies in the fact that the restaurants were never fully occupied during each seating. I would guess that 40% of the tables sat empty. I can only assume that had to do with lack of staff because the demand was certainly there. I also believe that the hotel falls short in service here to VIP guests. As a VIP guest I paid more for my stay and would expect something like phone reservations to be one of the perks of paying the extra amount. Also, as a VIP you are entiitled to have a sit down breakfast in the Italian restaurant which the hotel failed to notify me and several other VIP guests about. Only through speaking to another guest did we find out.As far as the food goes we found that all the a-la-carte restaurants were good with our favourite being the Asian for both quality and quantity. Edmuson Kawasaki our hibatchi chef put on a good show.The buffet itself was decent as well. At breakfast Felix at the made to order omellete station always had something to say to everyone and was pretty entertaining. We found the service to be best (at both breakfast and dinner) at the seating area looking directly up the middle of the resort.EntertainmentDuring the day you could participate as you wished in avariety of activities like tile painting, cocktail making, dance and exrecise classes.There was also a strange lack of music around the entire resort. There was music at the lunch restaurant by the main pool but pretty subdued and it could hardly be heard anywhere on the beach. We typically go and enjoy evening shows at other resorts we've been to. At this resort the shows although not all terrible were not what you would expect at a resort in the DR. On Monday Le Cirque show was good. One night they had a live singer (no band) singing everything from Celine Dion to Ray Charles to Minnie the Moucher. Not bad but strange in the DR. On other nights they had a Romantic night with four singers singing various Boys II Men style songs. Another night they had Dominican folklore dancers which were good but since they are not offering shows in the theatre yet a short rainfall cut the show short. Another night they did karaoke for a show and another night was called a Swinging Affair with jazz and blues music. The craziest night was the so-called white night which was more of a techno dance club night. Fine if you are looking for that sort of thing but looking around at the faces of many older guests with their jaws hanging open was hilarious. I guess I just would have preferred more Dominican style music, dancing and more audience particiapation because once the show ended the resort pracitcally shuts down except for the Tanhtra bar.Day TripsFrom the watersports building located on the beach at the south side of the property you can book a snorkelling excursion for about 90 minutes basically out in front and to the right of the resort for $30 USD pp. The snorkelling was decent but not fantastic.We chose to do the Reef Explorer which in my opinion is the best snorkel trip we have ever taken anywhere instead of the more partying style Marinarium trip where you only spend an hour with the sharks/rays in deeper water. For the same $83 USD pp, they pick you up in the morning, at 12:30, or in the late afternoon and take you to the same starting location as the Marinarium. From there you slowly take a small boat out to a floating platform with at least 40 lounge chairs which is right beside the stingray and shark pens. The pens are separate from the Marinarium tour so you are not crowded at all. Once you arrive at the platform you can do one of six activities which are snorkelling tour for fish, snorkel with rays, snorkel with sharks, sea kayaking, floating beds (similar to an air mattress) and massage. The beauty of this package is you can pick and choose what you want to do and for how long. Also from what I could see the water at the Marinarium pens was always around 6-10+ feet deep while in the ray pen of this tour there were areas which were either waist deep or knee deep where you could actually stand and touch or even hold the rays. My wife and I spent the entire afternoon with the rays and sharks and near the end of the day our gude Leonardo swam over and hand fed the rays while they swarmed all around. They also have a small buffet where you could get snacks, juices and pop (all included but no alcohol on this trip). By the time we left the platform it was just after 5pm and we were back at the resort at around 5:40. I believe we were on the platform for just over 3 hours. There was also a wide variety of other fish in the pens as well. Not to worry about the rays they are very well cared for and actually seem like pets to the guides. The stingers have been removed from the rays and the sharks (some of which were about 8 feet long) are nurse sharks which I believe sleep during the better part of the day so they were only swimming when the guide would tickle their tails. As you can tell we had a great time and I would highly suggest this trip to anyone.ConclusionSorry to go on so long but I wanted to say it all and although this really is not a bad resort I can't see myself returning without some major changes happening. We typically travel with our three kids and the whole chair/restaurant reservation/show thing would not have gone over well with them in tow. We also like resorts where you can snorkel right off the beach (like the Grand Sirenis in the Mayan Riviera or even some minor snorkelling like we could do at the Catalonia Bavaro or even the Barcelo Palace). With all of that said we consider ourselves lucky that everything did go relatively smoothly. Others we met were not so lucky.

<Content>Growing Pains but wonderful! Our family traveled to EdenH from Feb.23-March1st. We took our 3 adult boys(18, 20, 22). We had no problems with check-in or our rooms. In fact, we requested an extra bed for our boys room so that they could each have their own beds. They responded very quickly. The staff are wonderful and, yes, there were a couple of staff that could be replaced but 2 out of??? was not bad. Loved Felix, our omelete maker. He is so personal and definitely gives you a feel good feeling each morning. Yes, the chair wars are still on. My husband got up very early each morning to secure our chairs on the beach. He didn't mind-after all we are on holidays and it gave us a little humour each day.. The reservation system for the a la carte restaraunts was improving by the time we left. The nightly entertainment in the open courtyard was wonderful! We didn't miss a show. The Tantra(rooftop) bar was lovely. The boys enjoyed the sports bar as it had 2 pool tables and they met alot of people there. It is a beautiful resort and given some time, it will be a wonderful resort. We had no issues and enjoyed our stay immensely. Yes, I do think some people had issues--we were lucky. But, I do believe, some people just can't relax and expect perfection. Remember--we all knew it was a brand new resort when we booked-right? This resort will go through growing pains as any new resort would. Go and enjoy! Enjoy some of the excursions, the fabulous beach, the lunch grill on the beach, the shows, the a la cartes, the pools and the grounds. We met more people that thoroughly enjoyed their stay than complained about their stay. Have fun!

<Content>Great Holiday!! My wife and I just returned from a fabulous week @ the Edenh Real Arena. Feb.22 - Feb. 29First of all I want to say that reading some of the reviews before we left really had us worried about this trip.That's not to say some people may have had a few issues while there, but there are some people I think you just can't make happy no matter what you do.The people who work at the resort can't do enough to help you and they always have a smile on their faces.The food was great and there was a lot of variety.They cooked on the beech every day; the restaurant on the beech was great for a quick bite whenever you wanted something.The buffet Restaurant had tons of food!!!The other restaurants you had to get a beeper and wait for a table!!!! (I have to do this here at home)(Big deal) while you were served free drinks in the court yard or went and sat in one of the many bars.We would get the beeper and go over to the Casino (YES IT'S OPEN) or get a drink and chat (great break after being in the gorgeous sun all day).There were some issues with the lounge chairs, but it's the people there who are out @ 4:30 am saving chairs that they don't even use, or saving 6 or 7 chairs an only using 2 of them (I saw that a lot of that).A batch of chairs came in when we were leaving and more were on the way we were told (Big Deal) laying on a towel wasn't so bad (and I'm an old fart).The nightly entertainment was Great, a different show every night!!!!!I saw a few people abusing and being quite rude to the people working at the restaurants cause they felt they had to wait to long.If you are nice to people it's amazing what they will do for you!!!!!!We met really nice people from all over the world!!We had a great holiday and enjoyed every minute of it!!!!

<Content>its all in the way you look at it I went down to Punta Cana to enjoy the sun,relax, and enjoy the company of friends(4 couples went)...i got what i wanted.yes there was a few minor mishaps but nothing that was goin to ruin my holiday.it was a newly opened resort and for those people who thought they were going to get top of the line service here need to give their heads a shake or book somehwere else.yes there was times when the food was not as hot as i'd like it but i push it back and go get more....there was nights at suppertime when there was no seats available or dirty tables so we noticed the time and made sure we didn't go there at that specific time the next night..we went earlier or later ..no big deal.we didn't try any of the a la carte restaurants .after being in the sun all day we just wanted to eat and get to bed for a early rise the next day....yes to get our loungers on the beach..i seen the sunrise for the first time in my travels south and i must say it was beautiful.we usually chatted with fellow sun worshipers on the beach and watched out for each others chairs if one of us had to leave(to perhaps take a walk on the beach )....the beach grill had certain times it was extremely busy but again we noticed what time it was and ate before or after...its not like we had to be back to work by 1.I must agree with the wow factor on this place though..i think the first impression says alot when you walk into a place..this place don't have it.yes the grounds are going to be beautiful and the rooms are nice but i don't understand why they would put up a solid wood bathroom door with a lock on it and have this huge opening over the tub...duh...we have stayed at the Majestic Colonial and Excellence and when you walk into their lobby you get that WOW factor.. this is still nice..just different .there were a few bugs but i knew that before i left so i bought bug spray and coils to burn in my room when i was out... plus the cleaning lady left me a can of their bug spray.i only got bit once.the ladys in our group was happy just to sprawl in the sun and swim in the gorgeous ocean . we didn't have to cook ,clean or run any one around and the guys were happy to have their bubbas full..what more can ya ask for..

<Content>Somewhat SI, Somewhat No We stayed Feb 13/20th. I will say our room was nice and the food was average but edible. Don't get a first floor room the mesq. were terrible. The downside is if you dont upgrade to VIP you just cant get service. If you don't flip money at the pool bar, forget getting waited on. Also the nightclub was a joke. The nightly entertainment was OK. The best thing is the beach, can't beat if for beauty. Hopefully it will get better and the bartenders will get an attitude adjustment!

<Content>Loved the Edenh We just returned yesterday from the EdenH and had the best time ever! We have ben to the dominican 5 times previous and this was the best. The resort is everything we ask for in a trip. Food was great and the resort has everything a person could ask for.For those who were dissappointed with this resort must be very hard to please. You need to stay at a poor resort to appreciate this one. Every problem that they have is looked after very quickly. The only complaint we had was that there was a shortage of poolside and beach chairs but this is being dealt with quickly. This is a Spanish hotel and their chairs come from Spain which obviously going to take a little longer. When people reserve chairs at the pool and the beach this takes up more chairs than needed so the security has put the 1 hour rule in. Be in that chair within 1 hour or lose it. We were up every morning by 5am and went down and reserved our chairs. Lots of hot showers and lots of pressure which is different for us.The food is the best we have ever had!!! Felix makes the best omelletes.We are looking forward to returning next year.

<Content>Great resort Fabulous beach We came to the resort the week of Feb 17-24 with an open mind (despite any negative reviews) and had a great time!! The people and the staff were all very kind and quick to help with anything we needed. This was meant to be a trip to relax and we did just that. The resort needs some time to get up to speed, but the fact of the matter is that a vacation is what you make of it, so enjoy! Relax, take it easy, have a drink, and remember to switch your clock to Dominican time. We loved the hotel/beach/pools/food/entertainment. The only things needing improvement are that they need more lounge chairs and they need to change the reservation set-up for ala carte restaurants. The food exceeded all expectations, we enjoyed all the restaurants. The lobster dinner (served in room) was great.The staffs went out of their way to help and were very friendly even if they did not speak English (cleaning lady only). Be patient... don't get angry - and you'll get whatever you need! For example, we wanted some additional beach towels in our room. We had a little Spanish book, looked it up and we got our towels within 15 minutes. No problem. Our room was very clean every day, with plenty of fresh towels. I'm not sure what time the room was cleaned, but it was always done by the time we got back from the beach. Every evening, coming back to our room, we found fresh towels and chocolate treats. We tipped our waiters and the cleaning lady same as we would in Canada. The resort itself is nicely laid out, with time the landscaping will be fully grown and it will look even better. I can鈥檛 say enough about the Beach it鈥檚 awesome! Seaweed was cleaned up early every morning and also constantly during the day. Oh yes do have a massage on the beach, it was truly a luxury.Our trip overall was fantastic. I recommend this resort for anyone who wants to have a great time. I would definitely go back there again.

<Content>Wonderful Vacation at Edenh We were two couples that stayed for a week at Edenh. We had the pink bracelets that gave us all the extras. We had a room on the fourth floor of building one located on the back side. The other couple had a room also on the fourth floor but with the oceanview and pool view. Both rooms were very nice with King sized beds. One advantage to having a room on the backside was the privacy. There were hardly any mosquitos. They did spray everyday which worked well.We did line up for reservations at the a la carte restaurants. We usually went around 6pm and for most nights we did get into the restaurant for the first sitting at 6:30pm. Only once did we get a beeper which gave us time to have a drink and then we we had supper at 7:30pm. Our favorite restaurant was the Asian. You can have a choice of sitting at the bar, at a table or at the grill. The food was excellent. We also ate at the Italian, which was the least favorite. The American one was good. The lobster is not the same as at home, Atlantic Canada, but it was good. All the staff were very helpful and accomodating. We really enjoyed the Festival Buffet. Always lots to pick from and the service at our table was great. Someone was always around filling our water glasses!We did receive our fruit baskets and rum. Not necessarily on the first day but we did eventually receive them. We also did have turn down service but it wasn't always consistent. The mini bar was filled every couple of days, usually. The maids did clean our rooms everyday including the whirlpool tub on the deck. The beach towels showed up after a couple of days along with our robes, which were small in size.We did like everyone else and put towels on the beach chairs early in the morning. The beach was wonderful. There was always something going on in the water. Kids and adults enjoyed the water trampoline. The staff operating the katamarans were very helpful. It was easy to get to use any of the water sports equipment.The entertainment was great. We really enjoyed the cirque show and Chris Blizzard. We did go to the Tantrah bar one night which is a really nice spot. Whenever we went to the plaza to see a show there were always staff around to go and get chairs for you to sit on.A photographer came along the beach everyday to take pictures with some kind of animal. He would have a snake one day and then a monkey. It was fun getting a picture taken then that night you could purchase it for $8. Good souvenirs to take home!The bar staff were very accomodating and our favorite drink was the Miami Vice. You never had to look far for someone to take your order even when sitting at the beach.We often went into the VIP lounge to go on the internet. There were various snacks and drinks available there. The staff were very friendly and nice to talk to. The language barrier was minimal. I think they could communicate in English, French and Spanish very well whereas we could barely speak Spanish.One thing that they were working on was the elevators. There was always one working but not necessarily the one closest to your room. Hopefully they will all be working soon. The hot tub by the Paradise pool starting working the last couple of days that we were there and it was great. Things were improving everyday.Our only recommendations would be to fix the reservation system for the a la carte restaurants and to have more chairs available for the pool and beach. This would cause less stress for the visitors.Our vacation was very relaxing and would not hesitate to return to Edenh. Loved it!

<Content>Needs some "revamping" but will be great one day... This is my first review on TA but our 7th trip to an all-inclusive resort. Arrival - we arrived around 2:30 and we we're told to wait for our rooms. No problems...we had cocktails in the lobby bar until the rooms were finished which was about a 2 1/2 hour wait. We had 4 couples traveling together and had requested rooms together. We ended up with 3 couples in building 2 and 1 couple in building 1 but again, not a big deal. Rooms - Our room was a standard room with a king bed and the opened wall between the bathroom/bedroom area. The opening was not a big issue for us until we had some stomach issues and a little privacy would've been nice. Bars - loved the pool bar with Alex (the donkey guy). He's great and efficient but the bar did run out of beer and the slush drink machines broke on occasion. Alex tried to keep everyone happy during these times. The pool side service and service in the courtyard can be extremely slow as well as in the lobby bar. Drinks were good and we a great variety of things to drink even though we were the green bracelet people. Food - The food by the pool is excellent. Great rotissiere chicken, nachos, salad, ice cream, etc. The buffet food was average food that you see at most resorts. Breakfasts had many things to pick from with fresh fruit, smoothies, cereal, eggs any way you like them with a great chef cooking them, cheese, muffins, etc. I didn't eat lunch at the buffet so I'm not sure what they served and dinner was the pizza, spaghetti, and different dishes. The variety of food on the dinner buffet did get very redundant by the end of the week but our food was always hot. It would help tremendously if they would get a soda machine in the buffet area and let the guests get their own drinks. Sometimes you wouldn't get anything to drink until you were almost done or done with your meal. The staff in this area has their work cut out for them to remove dirty dishes, get drinks, re-set tables....too many tasks for the amount of tables. If they didn't have to worry about drinks, things would run more smooth. Ala-cartes - we ate at 2 of the ala-carte restaurants. The first night we tried eating at the gourmet restaurant. Nancy, the hostess, is terrible and rude. We were told we'd be seated at 9:00. At 9:20 we checked on our reservation and she stated that she wasn't ready even though we could see our table set right behind her. We were finally seated at 9:40 and then told by the waiter that the restaurant closed at 10:00. Needless to say we left and ate at the buffet. We did eat at the shore grill which was great and the gourmet a different night which was good too. The Asian was a very long line so we never tried but it smelled fantastic. The reservation system is not good and should be changed so guests don't have to waste their vacation time by waiting in line.Beach chairs - we did manage to get chairs everyday by the pool but we did get them early. I'm hoping they really do have more on order and that they arrive soon. It is definitely a necessity at the resort. We witnessed a lot of frustrated people and people resorting to taking chairs from the restaurant to have a place to sit by the pool. Mosquitos - we had a room on the 4th floor overlooking the construction next door. We did kill anywhere from 5-8 mosquitos daily and I ended up with 3 mosquito bites. They do fog for them so they should subside. Construction - we were there during some construction in the spa/gym which we were located very close to. The only time we heard any construction noise was when we walked directly by this area to go to the buffet restaurant and even then, it wasn't anything that bothered you...very minimal noise.Beach/pools - one of the most beautiful beaches I've ever seen. We did see some broken glass on the beach area. The areas around the pool are nice, but, due to being understaffed, isn't kept as clean as we've seen in other resorts. Entertainment - the evening entertainment was better than we've seen at most resorts. There really isn't much of any entertainment by the pools or music and can be a bit boring. We were told they are gearing this resort more towards relaxing poolside so I don't expect that to change. We would've enjoyed both music and poolside entertainment to break up the day. All in all there are some issues with this resort. We did see some broken tiles, sloppy finish work, and plumbing issues, but nothing that wrecked our vacation. We had a great vacation but we like resorts that offer more activities for the guests with a great entertainment staff.

<Content>Pleasantly Surprised After reading all of the negative reviews we almost canceled our trip. WE ARE HAPPY WE DIDN'T.We stayed at the resort for 7 nights and wished we could have stayed longer. The staff was very helpful and friendly. Each day we could see the staff and workers making improvements.They still have a problem with beach chairs but we were told they have more chairs on order. The Casino is now open with tables and slots. The nightly shows were good entertainment. In the evening the Roof Top lounge was a great place to relax before heading off to the Sports bar.The 4 a la carte restaurants were small and to get a early seating at 6:30, you had to be in line no later than 5 to pick up a pager.It is our opinion that within a year this resort will be one of the top places to stay in Punta Cana.

<Content>This place is not Eden We went to Edenh February 8th through February 15, 2008. We have never been to the Carribbean this early in the year, but I wanted to take my Husband on vacation for his birthday. (We are 49.) This was our 4th time in Punta Cana and this is also the first time that I have felt compelled to write a review even though we rely on tripadvisor when selecting vacation resorts. The Edenh is not ready for guest. Everything bad that you have read or heard about this place is true. We have had many wonderful vacations in Mexico and throughout the Carribbean and have never had an experience like this one. This resort is the pits. There is no vacation-like atmosphere, whatsoever. You are lucky if you get a room when you arrive and not have to sleep in the lobby until a room is vacated. Oh yeah, people actually had to do this. Some people who arrived late at night were even taken to rooms that were already occupied and the people were asleep in bed. There are no signs for any of the buildings, only paper names taped to the wall. There are broken elevators, no ice machines, broken marble tiles everywhere. They only give you two towels in the bathroom per day. They don't replenish the soap, shampoo, creme, etc. If you are lucky and you find a maid's cart, you may be able to find more soap, etc. They give you one washcloth per day. The mini fridge stocker only gives you two beers, water, etc. per day unless you can find him and give him $5.00 to give you more. Good luck. The pool and swim-up bar: The pool by the bar is very small. There are not enough chairs, tables and umbrellas for all of the guests. We witnessed many fights, some physical, over chairs, etc. By the 4th day of our vacation, nearly every umbrella was broken. There is no entertainment during the day around the pool, not even music. The bar ran out of beer everyday and one day there was only 1 bottle of vodka for the upper bar and the pool bar. They washed the dirty glasses by rinsing them under the water and then reused them.  The food was okay. The romantic specality restuarant was anything buy romantic. Brightly lit and very cheap looking. Our room on the 4th floor had a great view of the pool and ocean, but we couldn't get the airconditioner below 77 degrees. The air is only on while you are in the room. By the time you eat dinner and try to make it until the entertainment starts at 9:45 PM (if the boredom doesn't kill you) and you go back to your room after 11 PM your room is very hot. We are used to resorts that have games during the day by the pool or some silly antics by the entertainment staff to get you laughing. There is nothing here.  If you didn't pay for the pink bracelet or didn't have money in your hand, you could stand for 20 minutes or more before a bartender or even one of the girls walking around taking drink orders even looked at you and, when you gave them a tip, you were lucky if they came back to your table. I could go on and on but, if you truly want a relaxing vacation and not waste your hard-earned money, don't book this resort. If you have already booked this resort, do change to another one that can truly take care of its guests and knows what they are doing. I would never recommend this resort to anyone especially first time travelers to the Dominican Republic.. This place gives all of Dominican Republic a bad name.

<Content>We had a great time My wife and daughters, aged 3 and 1, have just returned from the EdenH from a one week trip February 19-26, 2008. Overall, for us, this place was great.Architecturally, this place is spectacular. Dozens of rounded archways, thick rounded columns, high ceilings in the rooms and in common areas, tile/marble pathways and floors - with these, it is truly five star calibre. The gardens and the fountains add to the sense of elegance about the place.Our standard room, by my best estimate, was approximately 13x28, or about 360 sq ft. What made this room slightly larger compared to conventional standards was the size of the bathroom, probably taking up about 2/5 of the room's space. Both the shower and the jaccuzzi were over-sized (and the girls loved it). However, a couple of other bathroom design innovations are questionable, and have been referred to elsewhere. Certainly the massive glassless window between the bathrom and living area needs a blind (which could be easily installed). But more problematic, the shower floor is essentially the same level as the rest of bathroom floor, without any stopper or barrier in place to contain the water in the shower area. Although asthetically neat, water flowed everywhere, including into observable cracks in the floor grout outside the shower. It also made the floor incredibly slippery, so we had to keep the door closed from the little ones. I'm obviously bothered to read other postings where people have experienced water damage, but based on what I saw in our room, there seems a bit of inevitability to it. We had no mosquitos in our room the entire trip, though were prepared with nets just in case. The balcony, probably about 10x10, overlooked the inside/courtyard of the complex, and it seemed that the daily 5.15-5.30pm mosquito truck spraying was having the desired effect.We would get to the buffet nightly not too long after it opened (by 6.45 usually) and had no problems with seating. We did not attempt an a la carte restaurant with the kids in tow. For us, the food was above average - even superior restaurants with buffets in our home town have difficulties maintaining all foods at a hot temeperature - with lots of healthy selections. We lunched at the beach restaurant, which for a beach restaurant doing the fast food type fare, was by far the best I've seen in terms of variety and size.The pools and beach were obviously the centre-piece of the trip, and were great. The kids pool, off to the side a bit, was a nice size, probably 15-20 feet in length and C shaped. The lack of chairs, both at the beach and pool, is probably the single biggest strike against the EdenH from our perspective. It just seemed inconsistent that such an opulently laid-out hotel would short-change on something like a $20 beach chair. I played the game the first couple of days, racing down with towels, first at 7.10am (when all beach and all the shaded pool chairs were taken), then the next day at 6.30, only to find exactly the same thing. And that was it - forget it - I'm on vacation, and if we have to lie on the beach, we will - and we did! And eventually a whole bunch of others did too.The service and staff were excellent. Just about all staff we encountered were friendly, and especially so with the kids. I think nearly every day at least one order wasn't quite delivered as hoped, but this was no big deal at all - we felt badly for not being able to speak better Spanish (though my wife surprised me on more than one occasion with vocabulary), and they were quick to rectify any mistakes. I was surprised with some of the attitude that I saw from fellow travellors directed at the staff - it is still a Spanish speaking country. Finally, the weather was excellent, the one morning it looked like rain (and I mean black clouds all the way to the horizon) actually cleared within an hour and wound up being the clearest day there. We never felt a drop of rain the entire trip. Overall, a superior vacation, very relaxing at a beautiful resort, hope you enjoy your stay! Who knows, maybe the bad word of mouth will keep people away, which will keep the prices low, and we'll be able to afford to go back!

<Content>The Good, the Bad, and the What the...? This is a relatively new resort and still has a few organizational problems. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Over 50% of the guests spoke a foreign language other than Spanish. But really no problem. The food is nothing special and does lack seasoning. However, the breads and fruits were very good. Bring your own salt shaker. The humidity plugs up those on the tables. There are 4 special dining rooms and you need advance registration. This was the most frustrating part of our vacation. Get in line by 5:30PM so you can get in early or you'll be waiting until after 8 for a seating. Wines were acceptable, and tropical drinks with local rum were excellent.The beach and grounds were beautiful. They do need at least another 200 beach chairs. They were scarce. Get to the beach before 6:30AM if you want chairs and then guard them !! The rooms were very nice with an outside porch with chairs, the living room with two beds, (very firm), a 26 updated monitor with at least 70 channels, a safe for valuables and a light shut off contraption on the wall, that turns off everything when you leave the room.Now then, there is the What the.....were they thinking. As you walk into the room you pass a wooden door to the bathroom, tub and shower. When you are in the bed area, turn and look back to a 5 ft. x 5 ft. opening in the wall and you see everything in the bathroom !! The shower and toilet are behind frosted glass doors. There is no curtain or shade over the 5 x 5 area. Privacy ??Then you see the wooden door WITH A LOCK ON IT ?This design only exists in one of the buildings, the others have a different bathroom disign.Overall this is a potential 5 star resort, but is short a couple of stars at the moment. Give them another year to get the bugs out.

<Content>Don't panic Edenh was the best by far for all of us I can't believe the negative reveiws I read. There was absolutly nothing wrong with this new resort. Anybody with common sense should see that this resort opened bearly 8 weeks ago and it's normal for them to still be working on certain things. I've been to only 3 resorts in Punta Cana and Edenh was by far the best. As for the food, it was excellent (5+). We had the VIP bracelets and it was worth every penny (look it up). If you have already booked your Edenh vacations I fimly encourage you not to panic and change resort, for this resort will be (and should be) twice the price next year. My word of edvice is if you stay away from those negative vacationers (they will always find something to complain about wherever they go), I promis you'll have way more fun and have a great vacation stress free.....

<Content>A Long Way to Go! Booked through Apple Vacations.  Check in was fine. We were 3 couples traveling together from Baltimore. We arrived at the hotel at a little after 3:00PM, and our rooms were not ready, but that's fine. We went to lunch, had a drink, and when we came back, we were given our rooms. All 3 couples were put in the same wing of the resort, same side, facing off property. My husband and I and the one of the other couples were on the 2nd floor, 3rd couple on the first. Our room was a little bit closer to the beach, so our view was of the adjoining property, which seemed to be some sort of dorm or apartment complex for locals. There was an empty lot with what looked like the construction of the beach huts. It was very close to us, and therefore, we really weren't able to sit out on our balcony at all. Plus, every day at around 6:00PM, trucks came by spraying some sort of pesticide which created big clouds and a very unpleasant smell. We kept the patio doors closed, but it was very cold in the room, and it didn't seem to make any difference what we set the thermostat to. The room also had a very weird smell the first day or two. We think it was from housekeeping. We observed them using the same bucket of water going from room to room. They would take a string mop and sort of slosh it around on the floor a little, then go to the next room. The view from the other two couples rooms was of a fence.We had two double beds, which is not comfortable for us at all. We sleep in a queen at home, and are used to either queen or king on vacation. In addition, the mattresses were not much better than sleeping on the floor; hard as a rock. The 1st floor couple did have a queen or king size bed, however. I noticed almost right away that we did not have any pillowcases on any of the pillows on our bed. When we went out for dinner, we stopped by the front desk to tell them, and were told they would take care of it. Came back after the show, and still no pillowcases. Called the front desk, was transferred around 3 or 4 times, then cut off. By that time, we were so ready to go to bed, that we just slept on them, but, ewwww. They did put them on when they made up the room the next day.I'm sure you have heard plenty about the layout of the rooms. I've never seen anything like it. Although, there were frosted glass doors on both the toilet and shower areas, the 6 foot square opening facing into the bedroom gave you no privacy. Oddly, they did have a door with a lock on the bathroom. Strange. If we had brought our teenaged son, we would have had to vacate the room each time someone was showering. They had one of those systems that you had to keep a card key in a slot in order to keep the lights on. No real problem, except that mid-week, they brought alarm clocks to all of the rooms. They didn't simply plug into the wall, they were hard wired into an outlet. But, it was one of the outlets that was connected to the key card, so if the maid took the keycard out, you had to reset the clock every time. Goofy.There was one tiny trash can in the room that was in the toilet area. It was metal with a foot pedal to open it. It barely held an empty water bottle, and I kept moving it out into the main part of the bathroom, but then housekeeping would put it back. No big deal, but annoying.Apparently, getting a room that faces into the pool area, is just by luck of the draw. We talked to people who had those rooms, and they said they didn't pay any extra or request them. So I guess we were just unlucky. The Apple rep did offer to put us on a list to change rooms, but we weren't willing to repack and unpack again.The next big problem was beach chairs. Our first morning, one of the guys went out around 7:00AM to get some chairs together on the beach. He was only able to get 4. It took us the rest of the day to accumulate 2 more. There just aren't enough. We were told that they had ordered more, but they wouldn't get them for 6 more weeks. The rest of the week one of us would go out by 6:00AM, to get them. That is ridiculous to have to do when you're on vacation. On top of that, they were the most uncomfortable chairs you can imagine. They looked nice, but were as hard as the beds.The beach was really beautiful, though. It was very wide and deep, and the sand was like powder. Really nice. The water was very beautiful, too. There was an awful lot of activity, though. There were so many boats of all kinds right out in front all day long. Plus, what really got on my nerves were the helicopters. They must give tours in the helicopters, so they are buzzing around all day. It just wasn't restful.The next annoying thing was the food service. As in most all-inclusives, there is a main buffet for breakfast lunch and dinner, then individual a la carte restaurants. Normally, you just pick which restaurant you want to go to, make a reservation sometime during the day, and then just go. But here, you can't do that. The restaurants open at 6:30PM. People start lining up as early as 5:00PM! It's the same line just to make a reservation. So, if you want to eat around 7:30, you have to get in line with the people who are waiting to get seated immediately. Wait, put your name on a list, which isn't really a reservation, and then they give you a beeper. It wasn't too bad, in that we pretty much got seated within a few minutes of our requested time, but, you had to send someone down by 6:20 or so, just to get on the list. The service in the restaurants was pretty good. The food was just passable. When we went to the Apple orientation, the Apple representative told us that you can either have breakfast at the buffet, from room service, or at the continental breakfast that they set up in the pavilion by the beach and pool. There was never any breakfast there. When I asked her about it, she asked the other representative, and she said no, that was wrong. There definitely should be something there, though. It's a perfect space for it, and it's all open. Much nicer than the inside buffet. They do serve lunch there every day, but it's so crowded, that you have to stand in line to get to the hot food, then you get up there, and it's gone. They replenish, but then you have to get back in line. By mid-week, they had started to set up a small grilling area right on the beach which did alleviate the crowd somewhat.The atmosphere in the buffet was very disappointing to me. Instead of an open air tropical feel which is what you normally find, it was a closed in room with very bright lights. It felt to me like a college cafeteria. There was some outside seating which we tried to get every morning. But, to go in and out the doors, you had to have a hand free. The doors had a handle which turned, which was very difficult if you were carrying a couple plates. It was very cold inside, too. It was the same in the lobby. It wasn't open like you usually find in the islands. It was closed in, freezing cold, and all tile, so it was noisy. That brings me to the tile. In the main walkways, the tile looked to me like it was made from coral. It was very porous, and has already started to crumble in many places. One of the women with us stepped in one of the holes in her heels, and went down. I can see that happening on a regular basis. The tile right outside the rooms was a highly polished marble. Luckily, we didn't have any real rain, but I can imagine that it would be deadly slippery when it's wet. The nightly entertainment was pretty good, and I did like the way it was right out in the main plaza so you could move freely around, instead of an auditorium-like setting. The casino opened while we were there. So that is good, if you like to gamble. The fitness center was just opening. Not sure about the spa. We did have massages right on the beach which was nice, but there was confusion on how to go about making an appointment, and paying, etc.There is only one shop on premises right now, and it is very expensive. My husband went in to buy some sunscreen, and they wanted $52! Yes, dollars, not pesos. There were a lot of problems with electricity not working at times, water leaking, things like that which will most likely improve as time goes on. Bottom line is, they have too much to do, and not enough staff with which to do it. For the most part, the people who work there are pleasant and willing to help you. But, you never got the feeling that you were being catered to, which normally, you do find in the islands. The bottom line is, this resort should never have opened as early as it did. There are so many things that are just not up to standard, and I think it is very difficult to get things done when the resort is full to capacity.So, I wouldn't go so far as to say we had a bad vacation, but it could have been a lot better. I would recommend that Apple does book anymore clients there until things improve. I would venture to say that Apple will not remain there for much longer.

<Content>Fun in the Sun We just returned from a week at the Edenh Real Arena Resort and we had an amazing time. Before I went to this resort I read every single review and was getting depressed about the choice we made. My boyfriend and I knew this resort was brand new and would have a lot of growing pains and we were expecting the worst. Well after reading all the reviews we were nervous of our decision and terrified of our first vacation in three years. So, my first bit of advice is to take the negative remarks with more than a grain of salt, take them as pointers and ways to beat the system. Don't let the negativity get the best of you. Just so you know we had the green bands...what some people consider lower class....ummm...not really. Check in and rooms : Bellmen super nice, greeted us with a drink while we waited in the lobby. Check in was 15 mins tops. Bellman walked us to our room and as he did this he pointed out all the different restaurants, bars, and the casino. He answered all our questions. If you need a map of the resort ask when you check in. They can provide you with some. Room was spotless. Super nice. Now remember check in isn't until 15:00. We arrived at 17:00. We had towels, working showers, bathroom , TV and clock. Now a pointer-- when you walk into your room there is a little light switch looking thing, you put your room key in there to turn on the AC. They do this so people don't run the AC while not in the room. Also when you open your patio door the AC kicks off..again to save energy. Our rooms were cleaned every single day. Now people complained about this...please remember they don't know your personal schedule they don't know when you are leaving, coming or going. They knock on your door early AM and if you are there then your room gets cleaned in the afternoon...big deal? Not for us. Oh the bugs...come on people you are in the tropics its full of bugs. And the white smoke that they blow at nights ---its to help with that...smells funny but not harmful. The beach...yessssssss WAKE up early to get a chair. Its a pain. But do what you have to do to get a chair. Don't steal and be rude. Just wake up early it takes 5 mins and go back and go to sleep (They ordered a lot more chairs). The beach is super nice, clean, no rocks or glass. There are servers who go around, however, not often enough. But not a big deal just walk up to the beach bar and get a drink--at the most we waited 3 mins for a drink. Every bartender was nice and made a mean drink. Okay, sometimes stronger than another but if you go to any bar anywhere in the world and you have two different people make them...I would guess they are a little different in taste. So suck it up and drink. At times they would run out of beer...BUT come on-- the keg runs out when all us thirsty beach goers keep drinking--You wait a few mins and they switch out the keg. Not the end of the world people. Another complaint was the mix up in the drinks. I was a bartender, and there are so many different names for so many different drinks then on top of that everyone speaks a different language...the bartenders are doing their BEST. Their very best to make what you want. If its not good then order another one...don't get upset and let it ruin your trip. FOOD. Holy crap there is a a lot of food. My personal favorite was the food by the beach. The chicken and French fries. I ate we only ate there for breakfast. We sat ourselves --sometimes the tables didn't have napkins, forks, knives, etc. but you just called someone over and they cleaned up the table. There was a lot of choice of food. Now keep in mind this hotel is a EU based hotel. They do things differently and you are in a DIFFERENT country they aren't Americans....so have an open mind. I thought there was a lot of choices and a lot going on. I always got plently of food. yummy. The other restaurants....they were alll GOOD! Different flavors but over all great. Good service and nice people. OH, they do need to change the reservation system but I found it fun to get a drink and stand in line and talk to people around me. My boyfriend and I always ate around 19:30-20:00 and had a great time. So instead of complaining just make the best of it. The shows, I saw one. Not really into shows. But the one we saw was great.. It was a circus. Check that one out. Night life. The casino opened when we were there. I don't gamble but it seemed cool. Sports bar open with a pool table...Tantra bar upstairs under the starts was super cool. I'm in my late 20's and I've partied enough in life. We weren't searching for much night life more like lounging. However, it would be cool if they had a disco where you could dance. But really, I bet I wouldn't have made it. So over all this place kicks booty. I'm giving it a 4 because its not a 5 star. Please please keep in mind, this place is new and when you booked that you knew that they have some growing pains. But sitting around upset about it will ruin your vacation. I laughed about the small stuff and I realized that no which hotel you stayed at their would be kinks and something that rubbed you the wrong way. I feel bad for the people who got sick because we didn't. Hopefully you don't!Another thing, you are in a different country. They do things differently. Everyone at the resort is happy to help and to be there but when some one starts being mean to them its hard for them to keep the friendly smile on their face. OH last tip, Take out money before you get there. We couldn't' find an atm anywhere. You will need 20 bucks right off the plane for some type of visitor pass. Don't feel like you have to tip everyone. I know I didn't and had outstanding friendly service even though I had a green band (the people who complain about the differences in the band colors make that up in their heads). Enjoy your vacation if you have any questions please feel free to ask! herzogmn@hotmail.com

<Content>The Only Luxury is the Chairs Stayed at the Edenh Feb.18-25. Previously stayed at a newly opened resort, and loved it so we figured we鈥檇 try another new one, but were quickly disappointed. We are about as easy going as they come so we tried to take all the negative reviews with a grain of salt and figured people must be over exaggerating. How wrong we were. Chair situation is as bad as everyone says. With each passing day, time for reserving beach chairs would be earlier and earlier. But the chair shortage didn鈥檛 end there. It was everywhere. The buffet, the courtyard etc. Everywhere you go, you see people standing around looking for a place to sit. Clearing tables quickly is a very common problem. People at the buffet would actually clear a table themselves, just so they could have a place to eat. Unacceptable for a so- called 5-star resort. Rooms-Nothing special about the rooms. We didn鈥檛 have any plumbing issues, so I will consider us one of the lucky ones.Food-Buffet had poor selection and quality . A la carte restaurants better, but the system of having people wait in line for hours needs to change. Service very poor at times, especially if you have a later reservation, and they are behind schedule. You will either be ignored or rushed.Bars-Pool bar service slow. Not enough staff. Usually had to wait 15-20 minutes to get a drink. Most of the time could not be bothered waiting, so went without. Sometimes waitress would come around taking orders, but it was hit or miss whether or not she came back with your drink. Entertainment-Besides the constant game of musical chairs going on, their really wasn鈥檛 much. Shows geared toward an older crowd. Casino had just opened day before we left, so not much happening there.Staff-I do not blame the workers. They work very long hours with seldom a day off, for very little pay. Some were exceptional, (Alexis, the bartender at the swim up bar, and Rafael, the very enthusiastic coffee server at the breakfast buffet, who was always cheerful and trying his best to communicate with the guests. In the evening he would wait tables in one of the restaurants, and still be smiling after all those hours on his feet). They are trying their best, but are powerless to make the changes. They do not deserve to have guests taking their frustrations out on them. For their sake, I hope management gets their act together and solves the staff shortage. I would not recommend this resort. For anyone who鈥檚 been to an actual 5-star resort, it鈥檚 obvious that the Edenh is not deserving of that rating. Spend the extra money and go somewhere else.

<Content>Still don't have their act together We just returned from a four-night stay at Edenh (Feb. 21st 鈥?25th). The check-in process was pretty painless for us and we were shown a room immediately. We had a few minor issues with the room: a missing chair on the balcony and a missing coffee pot; no lock on balcony door, hangers on a closet shelf, but none of the hanger rings that you need to make them work; quite a bit of plaster dust still in the bathroom. No deal-breakers, but it seemed a little sloppy for such a new place.We had to call about service issues on a few occasions 鈥?the toilet never flushed well and then stopped flushing. The jacuzzi didn鈥檛 work on one day and the next day the motor started gunning and smelled like it was burning out (we turned it off at the breaker and reported it but I don鈥檛 know if it was ever fixed.)The beach was gorgeous, but we ran into the beach chair problem that you鈥檝e read about. We didn鈥檛 want to wake up early on our vacation, so we had to settle for towels on the beach. We did always manage to grab a spot under a palapa鈥攋ust no chairs. People would usually let us know when they were leaving the beach for the day and we鈥檇 take their chairs (around 3 pm or so). There are several bars near the beach (even if you鈥檙e not a VIP) so we rarely had to wait too long for a drink. Service was really inconsistent. As an example, we called the front desk because we had no soap. They told us to call housekeeping. Housekeeping said they only dealt with laundry. We called guest services who said they鈥檇 take care of it. We still hadn鈥檛 seen the soap several hours later, so we stopped by guest services on our way to dinner and they told us again they鈥檇 take care of it. No luck. For the most part we enjoyed the food, particularly the chicken at the beach grill. We went to three of the a la cartes: Hibachi, Italian, and Romantic (hibachi was the best, Romantic our least favorite.) We never could get a straight answer on how the reservation system worked, so we just walked down and hoped for the best. If you鈥檙e flexible about where you want to eat, we didn鈥檛 find it necessary to wait in the lines at 6:30, but you might not get the restaurant you want. We usually went at 7 and got a beeper for a 8:30 spot. There are plenty of places to grab a drink while you wait. However, they really do need to straighten this process out 鈥?it was confusing and frustrating. The buffet was fine and we always had a lot of selection, but service was again an issue (tables not bussed quickly and hard to get coffee and wine.) They had coffee stations in each sitting area with cups and coffee, but they wouldn鈥檛 let you serve yourself (which many people tried to do). I think they鈥檇 free up some much-needed extra hands if they just let people get their own coffee.Desite the problems, we really did have a great time and we tried not to let things interfere with our fun (most of the staff are trying really hard, the place is gorgeous and you鈥檝e got unlimited drinks). But, there were way too many problems to give it a better rating.

<Author>IowaRunner
<Content>good time, long ways to go We stayed Feb. 18-25. We did have a great time, but I can appreciate and totally believe all the horror stories that people are posting, we were just very lucky. Check-in went quickly, tho there were only 4 other people there at the time to check in. We got room 1359. It was an outside room, but did overlook the next resorts swimming pool so view was okay. I did ask if we could get switched to an even numbered room at check in, and was told I could check the next day around 3, but then decided our room was okay, so I never did. The room was clean, A/C worked GREAT (I like it cold!!), had only a few mosquitoes each day, shower was awesome, toilet worked fine, and jacuzzi in room was awesome. I'm glad we had an indoor one. I did not care for the opening b/t bathroom and bedroom, but it was hubby and I so not a major problem, except for the light if you got up during the night. It was actually nice cause we could watch TV while we were in jacuzzi. Safe worked fine. Washcloths showed up occasionally, rest of things were replaced quite well. We were very near the elevator, and I never heard it from our room. The elevator always worked quickly also.My hubby cheerfully? agreed to get up (5:30)early each morning to get us a palapa, as we are ocean people. We knew from reading this prior to going we would need to do this, and it worked fine for us. On our very last day, security told hubby he couldnt save one til 7am. Others were already saved, so he asked about that, and basically just sat there til they left, and we still got one. Very strange that the policy?? changed on that day!Towels were never a problem for us.Buffet was good, tho any all inclusive gets pretty boring after 7 days. We had some very good waiters who made dining fun!! Eliodoro introduced us to flaming sambuco (sp?) which my hubby swears cured his diarrhea, (had for 2 days, origin completely unknown.) Food at poolside was great...........loved the chicken and fish and fries and ice cream, altho you could tell the quality was changing by the end of the week as a previous person wrote.Our only negative with food was the one and only ala carte we waited in line for. The grill. We had reservations at nine, so got a buzzer. Buzzer went off about 9:15, Nancy the hostess was very rude and said first we didn't show up when she called, then said the buzzer never went off, then said our reservations weren't until 9:30.........which was it??? Multiple lies told, did finally get seated but were treated with complete indifference, and actually I felt like I was interrupting them!!! Another couple in there at the time, also with green bracelets, were quite obviously being treated with kid gloves for some reason, while we could barely get any of our waiters to even acknowledge our presence. The head waiter I believe it was, actually ran to the door when they left to open it for them, even tho when he came to our table he just said what do you want fairly rudely. I felt so badly after that experience we decided not to even try another ala carte since we really weren't hearing that many good things about them. Standing in line for an hour, to get a buzzer which still ended up being a pain in the butt, to not being treated with any respect does not equal quality dining. Something definitely needs to be done with the reservation/service situation. That was really my only negative,...............but it totally made that evening unpleasant!!Entertainment was okay, circus night was neat, but the rest were pretty boring. Beaches are the best I've ever seen, we've travelled only to Mexico before, but it's true that the areas around palapas are dirty/broken glass etc. You need to be careful. I left my sandals on when I was walking around, and in fact hubby cleaned around ours with a frisbee. We pretty much read/walked the beach/sunbathed and vegged out. We didn't try the equipment.Drinks were good, tho I heard lots of complaining about the liquour. We aren't huge drinkers, so it was fine for us.All in all, we had a wonderful time. The hotel can/could be fantastic when/if they ever get all their ducks in a row. They were still telling us on Sunday they had 200 chairs coming in 2 weeks but it seems like they've been saying that since opening. I believe we were extremely lucky being in bldg 1 and upper floor. Seems like most problems were in bldg 2??I'd be happy to answer any questions if anyone has any. We felt we got what we paid for for the most part,and went knowing some things weren't finished. They did open the casino on Saturday or so. We didn't go in. Gym was just in a room, had a couple treadmills and weightroom. I just ran outside on the service walks, they had security all along the way so I did feel safe. I hope this helps someone, MJ

<Content>still developing This hotel opened in January '08. It should have waited until everything was complete. There are just so many things that are incomplete and/or not working properly. This has surely damaged its reputation. I would definetly NOT chose this property again.  We loved Punta Cana's weather. I believe our vacation would have been much better if we had stayed somewhere else. The food was repetitive and the dining room attendants need further training. We seldom could find a clean table to eat at. The reservation system they have implemented for the specialty restaurants need revamping. You have to line up at the specialty restaurants every night and you are given a time and a beeper to return for your seating. The wait can be as long as 2 hours. The lounge chair/towel availability is dismal. We seldom could find a vacant chair on the beach. Ridiculous. Who wants to deal with this stress on their vacation. Mosquito's are plentiful and makes leaving your doorwall open impossible.  Many issues we heard about or experienced were: lack of hot water, no electricity in some rooms, need to relocate guest due to construction issues. Overbooked hotel and some guest slept on cots in the lobby while some guest were sent to other resorts. This is the first time I've written a travel review but I wanted to let you know that if you have the option to stay somewhere else....do it.

<Content>Not what you pay for My husband and I just arrived back from Edenh real arena. We were there feb 18 to 25th. It was not what we expected.We arrived at 3 am and were taken to our room. Looking closer the next morning we found that the ceiling in the bathroom was full of mold and the smell in the room was bad. I suffer from alergies and asthma and requested to change rooms as I had problems breathing. Nothing could be done, had to come back next day.next day I told them i could not breath and was given another room after lunch.(after much talkin) This one was full of mosquitos and had to be sprayed by the maids.The resort is not ready to handle the amount of people that have booked, there is not enough staff, seating in the buffet restaurants and to get reservations in the al la cartes is impossible. We were told no reservations till 7am and by 720 ( one morning) they were completely booked, Funny because we were sitting in foyer and no one had been in paridise club to book. Hmmmmm...You have to get up about 5am if you want a chair by the pool or beach and then there is a steady stream of people putting towels on the chairs to save them. They need more chairs at both pool and beach.If you book Conceriage or paridise club, it will not be as advertised, We had no beach towels, no robes and no plug for jaquzzie, No privacy either. Save your money and book a regular room as we talked to other couples and they had it just as good as we did.All they did rectrify problem was to send someone to look and if you did get what you were missing, the maids took it next morning and you did not get a replacement, therefore you were back at square one again)Overall, I would not recommend this resort at all until more staff, seating arrangements and eating arrangements have imporved. And they are building another building so this will be ever biggerBeware.. they bring around parrots and a monkey for pictures and also a very large snake for you to hang onto. I was not impressed with the snake.LOL...I also found that tipping is highly expected at this resort and the more you tipped the better the service. Needless to say , this is our last trip Puna Cana and we will go back to Porta Plata in a heartbeat.Email if you has any questions and I will be happy to answer as this is our 4th trip to Dominican.

<Content>Honest Review Just returned back on Feb 25. We were a family of seven. Ages range 78-14. We booked 4 rooms. Arrival at the airport went easy. It only took 15 min. to arrive. We arrived at 11:39 am. Are rooms were not ready told to come back at 3:00pm. They do not hand out any maps of the resort. After reading this forum I knew it already. We went back at 3 and got our rooms. We were in building 2 on the 3rd floor overlooking construction sight. This did not bother us. Each room had an Ocean View.Beach - GREAT they need to clean it more, but you can't beat it.Woke up at 6:16 every morning to get chairs. By 7am they are all gone.Rooms - Nice, no big deal about no wall in bathroom.On the 3rd day by sons room flooded. Water was coming from the bathroom thru a ceiling light. They cleaned it up and wanted them to stay. We said NO after 10 min. They moved us to a Paradise Club Room. SAVE YOUR MONEY. The room was on the 4th floor. Great view as the others. Bathtub on the deck. there was no plunger to keep the water in 3 out o 4 bathtubs.There was a telephone in the bathroom if that is important to anyone. I am just very glad I did not pay all the extra money.Food - Buffet cold food 5 out of 7 days. The servers were not trained well. Had to wait 10 min. for a drink (water). By the 6 day they were getting better.The other ala carte restuarants ate at the Hibachi 2 times. GREAT food. ask for Geronamo what a show. The first night after waiting in line 1 hour for a 8pm reservation we sat at 8:15. At 9:05 we were told we had to leave only one hour allowed. We did not even finish our meals. The 2nd night I asked up front if we were going to be asked to leave. They allowed us to stay till we finished eating.Bars - I can only say about the Main, and pool bars - there are also two private bars for the Pink bands. This is our experience. My three kids, 17,15,14 were all ignored by the bartenders. They would wait their tern and the bartenders looked right past them to the person behind them. Finally I watched to see this happen and I spoke up. They also did this to my Father and Mother. For those who say tipping helps well it did not for us. For the first 3 days we tipped everyone. We have been to other resorts and this was very much apprcieated. We felt that tipping did nothing. After the third day we only tipped if someone really put and effort out. Excursions. - We went Scuba Diving, GREAT the guys down at the water sports could not have been more helpful. we did tip them. Vollyball everyday for hours - Met alot of great people.Shows - These were the best we have seen yet. After speaking to our Aplle rep. she said more beach chairs were on order,. So any one traveling latter should be okay. More staff will be hired and trained. To many guests not enought staff ie ( cleaning rooms, waiters, bartenders) Even after all the issues we did have a great time. You make vacation. We enjoyed our time away as a family and met great people. Two were from Texas. and became part of our family.If anyone has any questions lrafer@mchsi.com

<Content>'Beware of your safety!!!!' Room entered in middle of night! Five star-apple my butt, this hotel is more like a 5 star prune! We returned from our vacation on 2/22 from the Edenh  like all the other reviews it sucked! At check-in our room was not ready  like all the other people also waiting we were told to come back later. If it hadn't been for the Apple Rep we would probably still waiting for a room. The lack of urgency, lack of communication, and poor management all are leading for a disaster for the hotel. I can'not understand what is wrong with the management. The fact that they would risk their clients health  safety is just unimmaginable. Four of the six of us were also plaqued with diarria. After reading the other review about food poisioning I now have to wonder what we had. Our brother had hot water in the toilets, and we also witnessed the flooded rooms. The doors were open in the rooms for all to see, water layed there all week long! We encountered many power outages, and saw wiring nightmares.We witnessed a truck blowing a white Fog at the lower rooms. I'm assuming this was for the mosquito issues. Hopefully no one with respitory issues breathed in whatever it was!The beach was beautiful  the guys working with the water sports were great! The buildings were beautiful, especially the fountains!The musical beach chair game was outragious. I spent my vacation getting up early every morning to try to get a beach chair, only to find the beach chairs reserved with brown towels  no one showing up till after lunch. I asked if I could take an empty beach chair from the pool  was told he had a poblem with that! Between our family we spent $10,000 to stay there  he had a problem with me using a beach chair!! Imagine that!Trying to get a table at the buffet was also a battle. Lack of staff, seating  a rude waiter by the name of Armondo. He nearly broke his neck waiting on the managers in the dining room the he was trying to impress. We had to get our own table  hope to get water or a drink.The specialty restaurants were very good BUT be prepared to be there by 6PM to stand in line for a table. When we eat there half the tables were empty  they turned away people. Obviously not enough help to serve everyone. Room service was very unpredicable. Usually when we were getting ready to go for dinner they showed up to clean the room. We never did get wash cloths. We also had an issue with some one from the Edenh coming in our room at 2am  walking out after my husband asked what he wanted. Our sister checked their deadbolted door with the room key  it also opened. How scary is this! The next day we could not get in our room because the key did not work. After my husband got the taken care off he was ready to hit the beach. Wrong! Next the safe would not open. After spending a day resolving issues he finally got to the beach late afternoon.The drinks at the bar are very incosistant, not enough bar tenders. Some drinks we could not even drink.The entertainment was good. Started too late at night. Also not enough seating outside. Another chair battle.We were green second class bracelets also. I really enjoyed standing in line for drinks or whatever only to watch the pink bracelets get service first!  I really am tired of reliving this nightmare. Please reconsider before going to this place. We actually paid our hard earned money on this abuse . I just wanted to go home! After having someone come in your room in the middle of the night in another country was enough of a scare for me!

<Content>A Long Way to Go We were at Eden from Feb.16-23. It was a very busy week as it was Reading Week for many Ontario universities and I suspect some American colleges. Unfortunately most of what you read in the reviews is true, it will try not to go over the same points but try to give some information that has not been posted. We did have a great week, the weather was wonderful, beautiful beach, decent room and food, we had no major issues but the resort has a long, long way to go before it receives more excellent ratings.Room: safe worked, iron and ironing board, clock radio (arrived mid-week but has to be reset every time the power is off, which is when you remove your card), requested a cot and got it immediately, plasma TV with great reception and good variety of channels, awful bathroom with a huge space (6'x6') open to the sleeping area (we brought a cheap shower curtain and pinned it up but that didn't block the light) Building 1- even numbers overlook the pool and gardens, odd numbers overlook a parking lot and palapa making site, Building 2 -even numbers overlook the storage area of construction materials but you can see the ocean, odd numbers overlook the pool and gardensFood: good for the most part, hot things needed to be hotter, great rotissiere chicken first of the week then they couldn't keep up with the demand and put it in the oven and then a quick grill, it was cold and often undercooked, great hamburgers first of the week then some frozen mystery patty by the end of the week, great soft serve ice cream but often ran outDrinks: great assortment of drinks even cranberry juice, good beer but at times they...ran out of beer, ran out of ice, ran out of slushy stuff, bartenders were scrambling to make drinks, very, very understaffed, drinks were served in reuseable hard plastic glasses but when they ran out they used disposable cups, more than once I saw glasses being re-used that were only rinsed out. again there does not seem to be the time to run the dishwasherSun Loungers: horrible, horrible situation, up between 6-6:30 so we would not have to lie on the sand (be very careful of broken glass) or on the concrete around the pool, there was an attempt to have some chair rules but no one and not even staff followed them, a staff member apologized to a couple who were sitting in the sand that 200-500 chairs were on orderService: the staff works really hard but they are so short staffed that I really felt sorry for them, my husband was next to a man at the sports bar who demanded don't you see me standing here, I want 7 cans of beer and 4 Miami vices over there!! no one deserves to be treated that wayAla Cartes: food is good, service is inconsistent, prompt service in the Italian and Asian, seated at the Grill at 6:30, received our meals at 8:15, lining up at 5:30 for dinner is not my idea of a first class resortSmoking: if you a non-smoker you may find the lobby, the lobby bar and sports bar and one section of the buffet uncomfortable as there are many smokers and these are enclosed areasActivities: great activities staff sexiest man in Punta Cana-Jose! dance lessons, beach volley ball etc. special activity at 4:00, try for the finger painting on Monday you will be really surprised! evening shows were hit or miss, sometimes in the courtyard, sometimes in the theatreParasailing $85 for 2, for 10-15 minutesSnorkling $30 for 1 hourBanana Boat rides $?Kayaks, small catamarans free, you could get one of the staff to take you out on the catamaran tooThe resort has many, many minor finishing things to do: painting bathrooms, light fixtures, signs... these don't affect your holiday. But when will they ever get done. The resort is so understaffed yet they continue to fill the place but have difficulties meeting the demands of a full hotel.Please contact me if you have any specific questions and I will try to answer them. Do remember that things are changing on a daily basis, some good, some not so good!

<Content>some issues but amazing resort! First off I would like to state yes there were some issues, but if you are pleasant with them and not flying off the handle they do a lot to make your stay comfortable.I stayed at this great resort from Feb. 18-25 with four others. We arrived and even though only one room was available for one couple we were with (the other couple and I did not have allocated rooms yet). We were told to come back in about an hour or two. this gave us a great chance to look around the resort and find where Ala-cart dinners and other ammenities were. We went back after about 90min. and we found out that all our rooms were very close together 2143, 2147, 2151 but only my room was ready. So we decided to have our bags put in my room and freshen up and take a swim in the gourgeous pool!Luna was the gentleman who without a second though grabbed a golf cart loaded our bags and us, and personaly took us to my room and made sure we were comfortable and everything was ok. the rooms were great sure open concept bathroom is not the norm but different in a good way I thought (but I did not have kids or others in my room) after about an hour the other rooms were readyhere are some pros and consPros: GREAT SERVICE in the am we ate the best omletts ever!! Felix in the buffet was great. he was friendly and loved to strike up a conversation. afternoon, at the poolside grill Eddie waited on us hand and foot anything we needed he was happy to help! as well if at the swimup bar Alex was the man (WHY NOT!!) you will see what that means when you talk to Alex!evening, ala-carts a little unorganized but grat selection of foodlatenight, Luis at the Tantra bar definatly did not hesitate to get you a drink!FoodI was really impressed with food selection and variety. like I stated earlier the omletts were amazing, and the fresh squeezed juice was the best I have ever had. Didn't do lunch at the buffet because the poolside grill was really good pizza burgers fries chicken veggies all really good! Dinners were good as well the buffet had a great selection. and the Japanese grill was delicious! enjoyed other ala-carts. If you were still hungry later in the evening the sports bart had some really good snack foodsbeach, resort, and entertainment great turquois blue water warm and seaweed was cleaned every morning but even at night was not bad at all ( I was out most nights) great resort layout! nightly shows were interesting (Kareoke should go longer the whole lounge was having a blast!)Cons:Alcohol definatly needs work as I paid good money to get all inclusive I would have killed for some crown royal!! not just domestic stuff. (this was by far the worst set up I have experienced at an all inclusive resort)beach and pool chairs even at 7am few if any chairs left at pool or beach! another horible set up. after a couple late nights being on the beach at 4am saw that a lot of people put sandals and towels and even clothing on many chairs so they didn't have to get up like everyone else to get a chair (but I did see a guest going around and removing the articles from the chairs doing his own regulating, and later in the week I guess it got the security doing what they were to be doing all along!)Staff, and this is not all. just when in a front line job they should be able to comunicate with guest this is more previlant at the fron desk

<Content>VIP a MUST!! Well here goes...I read every review that I could read every day up til the day we left. I went with VERY little expectations. I had called the hotel directly two days prior to see about an upgrade to VIP because I heard that was the best route to go. Not only were there no upgrades they did not even have my name at all anywhere. I was told to go anyway and report back to the travel agent what happens. We got to the airport and were greeted right away yo be taken to the resort. Got there went to VIP check-in asked about an upgrade and my my room in general that was missing the day before. Edward in VIP was GREAT! Not only did we get a room but we got a HUGE villa looking straight at the ocean with living room, dining room, his/her seperate vanities soaking tub and two (yes two bathrooms) hotub for 5 on the balcony and an outside rain shower. It was heaven! We had to pay extra but was given a discount for all of our troubles, it was well worth it! VIP is the way to go, you get private pools, premium liquor and upgraded service all the way. I spoke to other guests with green wrist bands and they did not like it at all. This resort does have some kinks but for the most part is fabulous. Carlos 1  2 at the VIP pool bar are great while Henry in the other bar off the lobby is wonderful. I will for sure go back here but only with the VIP upgrade, not for anything else less.

<Content>Don't do it - vacation from hell We just returned from the EdenH on Feb 23/08. If you have already booked at this hotel (and I use the term loosely), please give some serious thought to rebooking elsewhere (the Majestic and Riu's are wonderful). Upon arrival at the airport, we were informed that the hotel had once again overbooked and we were carted off to a 2 star at best. Finally the next day we got to the EdenH and were told that they were no rooms. After waiting for hours, we finally had a room. Once there, we entered to find a couple already in that room. We were then sent to another room which had not yet been cleaned - the toilet situation was not pleasant to say the least. After 4 hours and 3 phone calls to the front desk we finally hunted down housekeeping and paid someone to clean our room. All in all, it was a nice room however the tub did not fill as the plug was broken and the shower was a joke. You had to have someone let you out of the shower as there was no handle to get out. The toilet would not flush and when we mentioned this to housekeeping we were told it was because we were putting toilet paper in the toilet. When we asked what we were to do with the paper they advised that was what the garbage was for - what?????? The other problem was the workers that kept coming in to the room for some reason or another. I honestly don't know how many workers saw me naked because they would just walk in even though the do not disturb sign was on the door. I would just be getting out of the shower or getting changed and in they would come. They would even walk in at 10 at night, just walk around the room and then leave????? This didn't just happen once or twice, it happened constantly, to the point where we put the chair under the door so they couldn't come in. The restaurants were a joke - if you even wanted a chance at getting in you had to line up at 5pm to get in for 6:30pm. Just what you want on vacation, to line up for an hour and a half. The buffet was really bad. The food was horrible and there was a very minimal selection. If you wanted anything off the grill or pasta, there was always at least a 20 min wait as they could not keep up with the demand. The buffet is much to small to handle full capacity at the hotel. The bar service also left something to be desired. Someone asked for a drink and were given the wrong thing. When they pointed this out to the bartender he said Jesus Christ and threw the drink across the bar into the sink. On another occasion, we witnessed a group of 4 all take a sip of their shooter which was supposed to be gin, they advised the bartender that it was vodka and he proceeded to take their drinks that they had already sipped, pour them back into the bottle and then give them the correct ones - gross!The other issue is the beach chairs. They informed us that they have just over 600 chairs and 1200 guests. If you weren't up by 6am you would not get a chair. We saw several couples in their 80's trying to plunk themselves down on a towel in the sand as there were no chairs. One morning, the hotel was taking an advertising picture by the pool and they had taken most of the chairs off the beach and put them by the pool to make it look like there were chairs available in the picture. Needless to say, with one pool closed for pictures and even less chairs on the beach, it did not make for happy guests......And the topper - we both got food poisioning and spent 2 days at a clinic on IV - when all was said and done, we had 2 days of vacation total.......I do have to say that the beach is beautiful (the 2 whole days I actually saw it....) I'm not sure that the hotel will ever be up to the standards of a 4 star. The front desk service is atrocious to say the least and management would not even come out to talk to any of us. Service in the restaurants is much the same, with no coffee or drinks served - had to fend for yourself. We felt bad for the waiters as they were very obviously short staffed.We have travelled extensively and stayed at numerous new resorts and have never had an experience like this..........if you can, run as fast as you can, right to another resort!

<Content>EdenH Real Reality feb 08 Hi Everyone,Returned 2/21/08Edenh real Reality. A very nice resort. Excellent food for taste close to American. Resort has levels of class. Most staying are at lower end for all inclusive. If you are looking for Entertainment beyond suntanning and reading a book, Edenh Real is not your place to go. Edenh wants an Upper class customer. Little poolside entertainment beyond Water Aerobics and dance. Night life ? None. Small scale shows in Square after dinner. No casino as stated by others. At least we didn't find it. Resort has quite a ways to go before becoming a 5 star. Beach is plentiful, very nice for walking barefoot. Pools are very nice, clean. Beach/pool chairs. If you get up late , you get whats left. watch for unoccupied chairs for lengthy time and take them if not used in timely manner. Poolbar lower class end needs more than just one bartender. They run out of beer  alcohol. Reserving a Dinner at special restaurants is time consuming and useless at times if not Upper class customer. rooms are of different sizes. Most do not like Open window from mainroom to Bathroom. No privacy, resort needs to install curtains or blinds. Getting a room can be easy one time and hard for another. They need a better system for assigning rooms. Maybe computerised would help. Bringing kids? They will be bored. Mostly older people. Over all nice resort for Suntanning  Bookreading.

<Content>No Mas No Mas Just got back on Friday. The place is beautiful. The beach is nice.BUT, Service was spotty at best . The food was horrible. We tried the place for four nights. We were not impressed. It was a similar theme from everyone I spoke with in the Edenh.Management needs to regroup and get it together or they will have an empty hotel. By now the majority of the bugs should be worked out, but it was a new experience every day. Problem areas encountered:Lack of TowelsLack of chairs near pool or beachInability to make reservations at restaurantsFood was generally bad (even in the restaurants)Think twice about this place.H D

<Content>A vacation is what you make of it! From Toronto, ON Canada ... Stayed at the Edenh from Feb 16 - 23, and as my title says, a vacation is what you make of it. If you tend to always see the glass half empty instead of half full, this resort is probably not for you. Yes, this is a new hotel, yes there are problems, and yes there is not enough beach chairs. But as other reviewers have said, every day there are improvements, and go with the flow. The beach is beautiful, yes there is seaweed, but the workers are out on the beach every morning raking it up. There is beach volleyball all day long and if not just ask Joangel to get one going! We all had a massage at the spas on the beach and they were great. The pools are beautiful, the main one is a swim up bar, the pool beside it always has a volleyball net up and two basketball nets. There is water aerobics everyday, by Kelvin who is hilarious, an activity everyday at 4pm, from flower arrangement making to painting; both were a lot of fun, and all free. Lounge chairs are still an issue and yes I have heard more are on order. Because we were a group of six and wanted to sit with each other, we did have to get up by 7am every morning to get six chairs together at the location we wanted. One day we did not get to the pool until 9:30 and we only got two chairs and that is all we had for the day! The food varied. Our group felt the Asian was the best, and being served at the Hibachi was entertaining. It is a stir fry dinner made in front of you with lots of interaction with the guests. The Italian and International were okay, the American was a bit of a disappointment, although the steak was good (and please remember you are not at The Keg....). They still do not have a system in place though for getting people in for dinner. We were a group of six and had to line up every day at 5:15 in front of the different ala cartes in order to ensure we would get in. One night we were a little late in lining up and did not get in the restaurant until 10:30...which was a little late for dinner. One night we had to split our group up as they mostly have tables for 4 and did not seem interested in putting any tables together. Also as others have mentioned, there are many tables empty and you wonder why as they say they are full. The problem is they still do not have enough staff to serve all the tables. In the Italian restaurant they only had two people taking orders for all the tables. The buffet did offer some variations during the week, and as others have mentioned, your hottest food came from 'made to order requests'. For breakfast the omelets were a hit, and at dinner you could always have beef, chicken or fresh fish grilled for you. The lunch grill by the pool and beach was good, offering hot dogs, hamburgers, pizza, fries, chicken and every day there would be a 'main item' featured, such as roast of pork, beef, or fish. Salad bar, fresh fruit, desserts and a soft ice cream machine were also available. The rooms were very nice, and yes that is an opening between the bathroom and the bedroom. We did bring a vinyl table cloth from the dollar store and some tape, and it worked great for the week. The opening is framed in wood, so no worries about taking any paint off the wall. Room placement is key though in this resort. There is construction on the outside of building 2 (not Edenh construction ... something else is going on), and there is a private apartment and homes on the outside of building 1. Neither is something you want to look at from your balcony. We originally were in building 1 on the outside, but one call and the next day we had two rooms in building 2 overlooking the courtyard/pools. We were on the 3rd floor and there was a 'few' mosquitos in the room, but again, we brought a fly swatter to deal with that. Mosquitos were not an issue for us at all. The nightly entertainment was outside and no one in our group experienced any bites. They have a temporary gym opened and the spa is open. The casino was opening on the night we left. We did a tour through Air Transat (all the tour companies offer different tours) and it was a day trip for 85$ with the Bavaro Runners. We had a great time and our tour guides Eddie and Everesto were the best! Bottom line on this resort is if anyone has booked (or is booking) this place I think if you can see the glass half full, go with the flow, you will have a great time. We choose to have a lot of laughs this past week, in situations where we could have gotten upset, but why would you want to be angry on your vacation. Negatively breeds negatively ... don't let it ruin your vacation. If you are the type that is expecting a Marriott or a Hilton as you would in New York City ...you are not going to get it here. Also, communication with most of the staff is very limited as many do not speak any English. Be patient with them they really do want to help you. The weather was perfect, the beach was beautiful and the pools very inviting. Also, people always ask what to bring as 'gifts' for the people. While yes they do want 'dollars', I think they take these dollars and buy necessities as they make very little per hour. So...if you want to bring any 'treats' for your housekeepers, and their children, they very much appreciate colouring books, crayons, stickers for their kids, and they do like perfumes, makeup and soaps for themselves. These are very expensive in the DR. Also, a 280g bag of chips is 9$ dollars in the store, so if you can slip in some Pringles and candies I know they like these too!

<Author>IowaLuvtotravel
<Content>What was I thinking a new resort! Vacation 2/13 thru 2/23I booked our vacation back in November along with 2 of my brothers so it was six of us total all arriving at different times. We all realized we were taking a chance with a new resort but never in our wildest dreams did we think we would experience the problems we had or witnesed. I am usually fairly passive and accepting when it comes to most things that the general population complains about but in the case of this resort, they deserve every review they are getting.First of all the good things are: Should be a fabulous 5 star resort by next year. The architecture is beautiful, the rooms are very nice if you get one with full appointments and no structural problems. I'd say the food was a step above what I've experienced at other resorts (I've been to 6 includingin DR and also Jamaica and Bahamas.) What I did not like - The sewer smell (Horrible and a health issue) in our first room. The Class System represented by the bracelets. If they want to have an adult only area or an upgraded package system they need to find a different way to handle because the current situation is extremely offensive for the lowely green people. The alcohol situation is -- where do they get these brands bottled because they are not in anyway close to alcohol content we have in states. Sometimes you could get a good drink sometimes it was horrible. Dining in the buffet was stressful. If there were more than 2 of you,you could never get a seat, or silverware, or napkins. We had one dining room manager who was rude - we joked that he had our picture hung in the kitchen because whenever he was on at dinner, it seemed like everyone purposely ignored us. Some of the help were very very good and we made sure we tipped them accordingly. Four of the 6 of us had diahrrea most of the time. Have no idea from what.Entertainment started too late. Uptstairs bar should have opened about 7:00 PM. Front Desk never had a clue - they need people who are bi-lingual.My brother is a plumber. He had a suite in the front which was lovely but the toilet had hotwater going to it, the AC was broken, the Hot Tub did not drain correctly. He actually fixed some of the plumbing problems himself. The room next to us has water laying on the floor for about a week and they just left the door open. How healthy can that be!!!!!!!! My brother had an incident of someone walking into his room in the middle of the night claiming to be security. The next day I checked the deadbolt and we found that even when the bolt is thrown the keycard still gets you into the room!!!!Bottom line - they should have opened 1/4 of the resort in January. This would have given them time to get the staff up to speed and work out some of the kinks before subjecting all the patrons to the nightmare that was our vacation.This was our 4th trip to the Dominican Republic because we've always had such a good experience. Our trip this year has made us seriously consider if we ever want to go back.Do not book this resort until at least the end of the year -- if they are still in business.

<Content>Everything they say is true I concur with all of the bad reviews! I am sorry but that is the way it is. Not the fault of the VIP staff at check-in - but the fault of top level management! We have been to the Dominican 11 times and will go back again, but never to this resort!! If we had wanted a stressful vacation we would have stayed at home and dealt with Road Rage rather than beach chair rage. Come on now we all go to the Dominican for the beach and the sun - how hard is it to order sufficient chairs to accomodate your guests? Very poor planning. Give this resort 2 or 3 years and perhaps it will be a 4 star.

<Content>Edenh Feb 15-22 review nice but?? Just got back last night Feb 22 from Edenh and We enjoyed our vacation.FOOD: buffet was very good I think we all gained weight. I am a meat and potatoes guy and had no problem finding something to eat. The reservation resturants-(Shore Grill)-(Gourmet ) was very good ,excellent steaks and service was great.Entertainment:The resorts we usually go to have something going on all the time and there is some kind of lively music.This resort has none maybe one volleyball game in the morning and some water excercise and that is all.The music volume is so low that you cannot hear it.We asked about this and were told that this resort is going for a relax atmosphere and not a party place.The shows were okay but not great except White night.Bars:The drinks were a hit and miss you will find one that you like but then you go back and it is not made the same.The bartenders were slow.There is no disco yet I loved the vodka lemonade slush at the pool bar and I could get it as strong as I wanted.The drinks at the lobby bar were the best and more consistent.I think the bartenders are not quite trained yet on how to make drinks the right way.Rooms:Clean,Nice big tub in the bathroom.put money in the fridge with a note of what you want and it will be there the next day.My wife did not like the big hole in the wall because when she got up in the middle of the night she would wake me up.Staff:The staff were very friendly allways smiling if you treat them with respect . They will do anything they can for you. If I would ask for something with a smile and be nice I could get it.Beach and Pool:Great beach soft sand and is cleaned everyday.The pool bar is great. Now for my experience I enjoyed my time here but Edenh is not for me the room was very nice but on the second day the tub above us started to pour down thru the light in our our room.My wife and I laughed about it We called the staff and they had us moved the next day so no problem for us because we got closer to the beach.The reservation system is not working here the Pink bands get first chance to book in the mornings then the rest have to wait in line starting at 5:30 to assure a spot for the night and then you are not garanteed a spot which sucks because the men have to wear pants. A group that we met got all dressed for supper and still did not get in.Edenh should have the pink bands sign up in the morning like from 7:00 to 11:00 then let the rest sign up so we know we can dress up and have a nice dinner.When I was in line I counted 40 people at 6:00 plus more came after and that was just 1 line out of 4.We looked like a bunch of cattle being herded in.Beware if you are going to this resort and want everything you have to pay extra for the pink bands about 50 dollars per person per day because otherwise you will be treated like second class.The pinkys as we call them get top treatment thruout the whole resort ( restaurants, bars, drinks,their own pool) but big deal it looked too booring over there,even Malibu is top shelf for the green bands - 4 dollars.If you dont believe me look at the reviews that get 5 stars all the way thru those are usually the ones that had the upgraded rooms.I have no problem with the upgrades but such a big difference between green and the pinks?I liked this resort and had a great time nice weather, great beach,good beer,beautifull resort,but they have some issues to work out.If you are looking for a resort to relax and sit around this is for you but not for my wife and me we like something more.

<Content>Wonderful Vacation at a Great Price We loved the hotel/beach/pools/food/entertainment. The hotel is having some growing pains as all new resorts do; however, I think some people are extremely critical and are giving the resort a bad reputation which is unjustified. The only things needing improvement are that they need more lounge chairs and they need to change the reservation set-up for ala carte restaurants.The staff went out of their way to help and were very friendly even if they did not speak English.. The pool waitress Gigi was fabulous. We did not encounter any construction noise and sympathize with any guest who had problems, e.g. leaks, not getting rooms, etc.; however for the great price that we got this package for, we cannot complain. The food at the buffet and ala cartes was the best we have had at any all-inclusive in the Caribbean.Can't wait to go back!

<Content>Not a five star resort We are a party of six staying at the Edenh Real from 2/10-2/17. We have traveled together for the past 12 years. This by far was the worst resort we have visited. It took 5 陆 hours to even get into a room. We paid for a five star resort and got barely a three star resort. Not all advertised amenities are available and some are not usable by all guests. The differential in treatment to the 鈥済reen band鈥?to the 鈥減ink band鈥?was unacceptable. Rooms: Rooms were okay but nothing great. Maid service was very late in the day, about the time you would be getting ready for dinner. You were provided no washcloths and many times had to run down your own towels. Peepholes in the doors had to be stuffed with tissue. Although the resort had only been open a few weeks, it looked like it had been open sometime. It needed painting and the hallways and stairwells were dirty. The elevators were not operational most of the time. The overall workmanship of the resort was second rate and not that of any other five star resort we鈥檇 visited.Food / Drinks: Food was average at best. The variety was lacking and as the week wore on we got very tired of the seemingly same dishes everyday. The Asian Restaurant had the best food at the resort, but difficult to get into. The drinks were vastly inconsistent from one bar to another. I was horrified one day to see how the drink glasses were cleaned. I watched as they merely rinsed the glass and put it back in the holder from where they were serving new drinks. Beach / Pool. Though these areas were nice, the resort seemed to be either overbooked or under facilitated. There were never enough beach chairs to go around. I have never been to a resort with such a beach chair issue. The pool area did not seem big enough to accommodate the guests.If you have time to change to another resort by all means do so. They don鈥檛 seem to have their act together here yet. It is definitely not five star status. If you can鈥檛 change resorts, enjoy the weather which by the way was fantastic when we were there.

<Content>Management needs to take control Check in was actually a breeze but I think it was due to the fact that we were the first big group that has booked into this hotel. There were 123 of us. We were in the mid-range Apple orange bracelet people. The reason I say bracelet people is because they offer this new gimic. If you check in as just an all inclusive you are a green bracelet person. If you upgrade, (which we heard different quotes from different people) you were a pink bracelet person. The green bracelet people are treated like second class citizens. We stood at the bar for over 30 minutes to order a drink, it was finally our turn when a pink bracelet person walked up and they took their order first. Guess it is all part of the perks. The perks are better booze for pink. Generic booze for green (example, Absolute for pink, Smirnoff for Green) Jump to the head of the line at the bars and restuarants, two private small pools and swim up bars for pink bracelet people. That was about it.  Speaking of perks, pink bracelets get in line first for the four speciality restuarants. No reservations. If you want to eat at 6:30, better be in line by 5:30. The buffet was ok, stuff was usually cold. I don't blame the staff, they are heavily understaffed, I would say 1 sfaff member to every 5 to 7 guests. We actually made reservations to an off site restuarant one night just to avoid the whole line deal. Our room was cleaned daily, turn down service was in our package, we got it about 4 of the 7 nights. The bottle of rum and fruit came about 2 days before check out. Don't even get me started on the mosquitos. We had a bottom floor room and these aircraft carriers were buzzing everywhere. Thank God I read about this on this site and we bought mosquito coils from Walmart and this kept them at bay.  Now for the horror story of the beach chair situation. Everything you have read is true. Be up by 5am if you want a chair. My husband is an early riser so he had it under control But he actually saw people reserve 4 poolside chairs, 4 cabana chairs and 4 beach chairs so they could move wherever they chose during the day. That is just greedy. Hopefully they will resolve this, we heard 500 more chairs are ordered but people who were checking out told us they had been hearing that for the whole two weeks they had been there. The beach is beautiful, seaweed cleaned up every morning.  This resort has a long way to go. It is new. Don't blame the staff, they are doing the best they can with what they have. I never saw one staff member not hustling about, I actually felt sorry for them.  Oh, and the sinks falling through the roof and plumbing breaking and causing leaks is true. One couple we traveled with had the pipe break above their ocean front room and there was 2 inches of water on the floor before they got it under control.  The casino and bowling alley are not open at all and the gym and spa are in a temporary location. If you choose to get a massage, go to the beach unless you like hearing hammering during your massage.  We also got the diarreah plague, all four family members and we did not drink the water so I am not sure what is going on there. Hopefully it is not the ice machines.  Good luck if you are traveling there, believe it or not, I did see improvements daily.

<Content>Average We had read the reviews and were bound and determined to avoid being the uber-picky guests who complain about every little thing. After the first full day brought a flood into our closet that completely drenched 90% of our clothes, we found ourselves squarely along side the moaners and groaners. Ugh. Had it not been for this flood and need to pack up and move rooms so early in our trip, the other issues would've probably seemed minor enough not to mention. It is what it is, and our views were probably tainted by this experience. If you get lucky and have no room problems, your vacation will probably be pretty smooth.The Good-The beach and resort in general are beautiful. Most of the fountains were working, and the ones that weren't look like they will be nice once functioning. The gardens are obviously just starting, but look like they will be stunning in the future. The beach is easily the most scenic one around....a quick walk either way shows that to be true very quickly. Many palapas scattered on the beach, along with two massage huts....very nice. The catamarans are readily available (I believe there are four), as well as kayaks. We used the catamarans and had a blast.....they will give you a free lesson if you've never used them before, and it's quite simple to get the hang of.The staff is the friendliest I've come accross in my limited A.I. travels which include Mexico and Jamaica. No, they don't all speak fluent English, but they all try their hardest to accomplish whatever it is you are asking for. We booked the Paradise Club Adults Only (more on that later), and the VIP check-in process was completely painless and prompt. That private lounge was always staffed with fluent English-speaking managerial types who were always ready to answer any question or respond to any problem. There was rarely even a slight wait to speak to someone eager to attend to our needs. The needs didn't always get met right away, but they were trying.The ala carte restaurants were easily booked through the VIP reservation system days in advance, which was nice. Those who didn't purchase the upgrade looked to have quite a nasty time of it, though. It seems they've been trying different systems, and the current one didn't look too smooth (we were there from Feb11-Feb18). But, as Paradise Club members it was as smooth as butter, and we were always sat promptly at our reservation times. We found the service at the restaurants to be very good, with the food being the best at the American (steak was very tender). We never made it to the Asian, which seemed to get good reviews.....the Italian was good, and we didn't care for the French at all (have had better at other resorts). The pasta station at the buffet was excellent...probably the best food in the entire resort, if you like pasta.The paradise pools were very quiet and enjoyable...the main pool was always teeming with activity if that's your thing. Again, the sprawling pools made for a very scenic look, especially with the palapa style bars at each one (three swim-up bars, two of which are VIP). The snack bar had long hours, providing pizza, burgers, hotdogs, and ice cream, among other things. They also set up food stations on the beach (grilled chicken, burgers, hotdogs) on a daily basis, which was another nice touch.The Tanhtra rooftop bar was very romantic....a great place to go for drinks after 9 pm. Really they could stand to open that one earlier in the day....I know we would've spent more time there if we could have. Beds draped with white flowing sheets, and great service from the waitresses.....it was perfect.The Not-So Good-The food on the whole was quite average, even for an all-inclusive, and this was especially true of the buffets. If you can be there when the tray comes out, no worries....but if it's been there for any length of time at all, there's a good chance the food will be cold by the time it hits your mouth. This was especially true of the burgers and hotdogs which they seem to cook in very large numbers to leave under the heatlamps. The food that was hot was simply unimpressive, aside from the pasta station that I already mentioned. The resort isn't up to par when it comes to construction, it seems. As noted there were pipes bursting, and this is after only a month or so? In addition, broken tiles could be seen throughout the resort. One broken tile outside of an elevator had a danger sign on it, and the danger sign was held down with broken pieces of tile! One of the main steps up to the Tanhtra bar was also broken while we were there. Watch your step, bottom line.The resort was quite packed...overbooked it seemed. They didn't really leave room for error, as we were moved into what Clara (manager) referred to as the last remaining Paradise Club room in the ENTIRE resort! No slush, apparently. This created problems for anyone wanting to move rooms. Our view wasn't very good...luck of the draw I guess. The inside views are great (pool/ocean), but if you get stuck on the outside as we did you get a view of neighboring apartments (I think, couldn't tell), in addition to extra mosquitos. The mosquitos seem to enter the room while the maids are cleaning, as we always came back to three or four of them in the evenings. Bring a flyswatter...we forgot to, and I was smacking them with a rolled up plastic bag all week.Both of the rooms we stayed in had a rancid, raw-sewage type smell emanating from the pipes. I'm not talking about the musty smell you are used to encountering in the tropics....this was nasty, nasty stuff. A tip from a fellow guest really helped us out in that department....light candles and cover the drains with wet washrags. It made a huge difference.The maid service was very inconsistent. The first day on the second floor we seemed to get a very good maid....extremely clean room, and she even organized our shoes and such. After moving I think we got one that did the bare minimum to get by. For example, there was a used mouthwash left from whoever had stayed there previously, and after looking at it for three days we finally had to throw it away ourselves. No new toiletries or even washcloths for us after the move....we had to get them ourselves off a nearby cart once we figured out they simply were not going to be replaced. Also after the move we got a TV that wasnt even hooked up....that was only a minor issue, as it was fixed within hours of a complaint. The VIP upgrade was supposed to include beach towels delivered to the room.....we didn't get a second one for a couple of days. Again, it was a minor issue. Also not included was the room service menu, but the people at the front were happy to accomodate.The Adults Only area simply does not exist that we ever found. We were told that our building was the one designated as Adults Only, and apparently they try to put the adults on the top floors, and the children on the bottom floors. Doesn't happen, period. There were children on our floor and directly above us, and the paper-thin walls and ceilings made that apparent very quickly. There was no designated Adults Only pool, and make no mistake there were little children in every pool. There is supposedly a sign ordered, but there is currently no designation on any of the temporary signs (which were everywhere, including the paradise pools), which is curious to say the least. I highly doubt an Adults Only section will ever be enforced at this resort. That's fine, but don't advertise and sell a feature that doesn't exist. It's false advertising, and we feel we were duped on that one.That about sums it up I think. I'm happy to answer any questions on the forum, don't hesitate to ask.

<Content>Lack of Customer Service My friend and I arrived on February 09, 2008. At first, the few was impressive and very sheek. The check in was fast but we did not recieve the ocean view room that we requested. Our rep Mandie (sunquest) was amazing and seemed overwhelmed with all the complaints. She apologised, and did the best that she could under the circumstances. The beach chairs were a challenge at the resort which made the days very long and tiring. Every morning, we would have to get up at 7:15 just to get a chair around the pool. If you wanted one on the beach you had to go even earlier. By the end of the stay, people were snatching towels and taking chairs when you stepped away for a few minutes. The accomidations were very nice but the maid service was not consistant. We were told that a late check out was permitted; but when we went to sign up for it; they told us that it was not possible due to overbooking. We were forced to stay on the resort all day and our bags were stored in a little room where everyones' luggage was kept. Employees were sorting through luggage and appeared to be offering us cigars from someones bag. A la cartes are nice; but unless you have a green band; u will be treated different. Some guest say that the pink bands were worth it; others did not. If you are young, (under 30) you may not enjoy your stay. Make the most of your trip, but I would look at other options before choosing this resort. It is nice but it is understaffed and the customer service did not accomidate the a family that had a special needs child. Its a shame that we work so hard to getaway and when we leave we are left with nothing but dissapointment.

<Content>Think Twice Before You Go... CHECK-IN AND ROOMI am not sure where to start so here goes it. Hubby and I stayed at Edenh from 2-8-08 to 2-15-08 and we experienced many problems. I too read reviews and forums everyday before I left and never wanted to believe what I heard but now that we were there first hand I know exactly what everyone is talking about.When we arrived at check in the staff were clearly having many problems. We asked for our room, which i emailed and our TA emailed ahead of time for, on the 2nd or higher floor. we were given a room number and proceeded to the room and it was ground floor and the staff member told us it was not ground floor. I went back to check in and was told i would have to pay for 2nd floor and it would be $420.00. We did pay and then asked for the pink bands cause we had the green ones on, but was told that the money only went to the room and that it was $700.00 for pink bands. I was not too happy but proceeded to a room which she told me was ocean view.When we arrived to the room in the 2000 bldg 2nd floor it was not ocean view . I then went to check in and demanded my money back which with some fight finally got it and a new room closer to the pool on the second floor. The room was nice but no working jucuzzi for 4 days. one day hubby had to stay with the workers for 4 hours while they tried to fix it and no luck so he wasted a day in the room . He was not too happy. I will say now that our room when we left was in perfect working order. thanks to all our problems. I have to say during the week we talked to lots of guests only to find stories like we were experiencing and some guests told me they bargined the price for there upgrade. someone got the $700 upgrade with pink bands for $300 and someone else just slipped the check in desk $50 and got two pink bands. FOODThe food overall was pretty good. We ate in all the restaurants. The Habachi was the best but long lines to get in. we waited one nite for 3 hours. All other restaurants were good and had many open tables but they always said they were full. could not understand that. The buffet was good but they never cleared tables. One nite i cleaned a table so we could sit and then i had to go and get a guy to get us two sodas. Alcohol would of taken too long. I will say the beach buffet was really really good. DRINKThe drinks were too inconsistant .. never the same taste and the cheap alcohol was just that cheap...The pool bar within the 8 days we were there ran out of vodka for more than 3 hours one day and beer the next day and then vodka again.. hubby was not happy since he is a vodka drinker.. and then ice sometimes during the week.. the staff just does not seem to care how long you wait for service anywhere. they don't seem to friendly to help . They really need alot more people to accomodate the guests. I sometimes felt like i was bothering them if i asked for something. There were only two girls walking around the pool servicing it. and the same with the beach and they never asked if you wanted anything, I had to wave them over and tell them what we wanted. by the end it was just easier to go myself.CHAIRS AND BEACH AND POOLThe pool is nice but cold and you do not need cards to get towels but some people were given cards.. again the staff does not know what is going on themselves. Hard to get chairs around the pool as well as the beach.The beach is beautiful but the chair game is going on quite heavily. When we first arrived we got chairs by 8am at the latest but by the end of the vacation it was more like 7am. we walked up and down the beach and other resorts seemed to be ok. If they would only order more chairs it would settle some problems and i heard they did for 150 of them but i think it should be alot more. this is the first resort i ever stayed at that there were lots of people on towels around pool and on the beach. There were alot of fights over chairs including security to be called. We encountered many problems with inconsistancy of the staff . The shows started too late and there is no theatre. there is only one shop on hand and you really do need to be careful cause they will over charge. There is a mosquito problem but I have seen worse in the dominician. You can see the the marks on the walls. we killed a few each day in our room. As for cleaning service.,you never knew when the room was gonna be made up and it was ALWAYS missing things. they cleaned rooms from 8:30am till 10:00pm. Bring lots of ones for tipping cause, in my opinion, i feel they really do look for it down at this resort. one day it cost me $12 to get the room cleaned. I left $2 for the maid and the person who fills the refrig. took it so i felt bad and looked for the maid at 5pm and gave her $5 to clean the room and she said 5 minutes and then 20 minutes later someone else came in to clean it so i gave her another $5 so $12 later i finally got my room cleaned. We met people that on some days never got there room cleaned.During our stay there were rooms that ceilings caved in and sinks that feel out and broken plumbing .The hotel has experienced alot of problems since it opened. It should have waited and opened a little later. There are dark corridors and lights burned out in just about all hallways and elevators are not working and concrete is busted which i can not understand considering they just opened. one nite while in my room i heard someone yelling and a buzzer going off and came out and it was the elevator. someone was stuck in it and i got front desk who then called 5 other people who just stood in front of it saying we will be helping you right away but some 10 min later she was still in there and i then had to leave for dinner. Never found out how long she was left in there. pretty scarey.Over all this was the worse vacation we ever took and we go away every year at the same time. I could of changed hotels but chose not to cause i did not want to believe what i was reading and now i know it is all TRUE. It might of been a good deal but it was not that too good of a deal to have problems every day. and not just one problem.Where ever you chose to vacation I sure hope you have a great one and I will be happy to answer any questions you might have

<Content>It will be Beautiful/once it's done We expected what we recieved after reading the reviews. We arrived on Feb 12th at the airport and were told we would not be going to Eden until the 14th. They yes shipped us off to another resort, but they took us to the wrong resort from the airport and once we tried to check in we were informed that this was not the resort we were supposed to be sent to. Thank god we had Mike's phone number and after begging the guset services people at the resort that was wrong and phone calls to Mike we were shipped to yet another resort. This only took 6 hours but at least we got a room. When we did get to eden on the 14th, we were told that we did not have the upgraded pacakge which I did pay itravel for so we had to purchase the upgrade seperately. Anyway we finally got checked into our room which was beautiful,but as we were uppacking another couple came to the room with the bellboy and realized that we had just arrived. Make sure when your in your room, that you keep your deadbolt locked all the time. There was a lot of talk about wrong room entereing. Getting a chair was not good until a group from Hamilton left on Sat. We all called them the chairhoggs and that they were. The chair issue is pretty well under control now. They still need to work on the reservation thing for restaurants. You cannot get a reservation at all, but if you show up at one later in the evening they will slip you in or give you a beeper which works well. Overall we had a great time for rest and relaxation but the hotel still needs a lot of work. We will return there in 2 years, by then the management team there might be more receptable and the employees will have learned more English and the resort will be finished. By the way the mosquitoes were well under control, we only got bit once while we were there.

<Content>Not the Best Resort The concierge VIP service was not worth the additional cost. Guests who did not pay received rooms with ocean views while VIP guests looked at a 12-foot construction fence. The hotel would do nothing to help us get the room we paid for.There are insufficient beach  pool chairs and guests were forced to sit on cement and sand.The sand was riddled with glass and you had to be very careful where you stepped.Misquitoes were very bad if you were on the first floor consruction side. It made using your jacuzzi tub and patio impossible.Food at the buffet was cold excepting the pasta  egg stations. Many guests, including ourselves, suffered with diarrhea.Towel service for VIP's was for arrival only. AFter that you were on your own. On the last day they changed the rules and you couldn't get a towel without a card which we didn't know about.The private pool area was not marked private and open to anyone to use. It was not monitored by guest services or the bartenders. No butler service was available.The 20 minute massage took forever to arrange and lasted only 15 minutes.The fruit basket  bottle of rum, on arrival, did not materialize until two days before departure.The resort itself is lovely and the completed the rooms are fabulous. The resort will eventually be one of the premier resorts in Punta Cana but first they must get control of many small issues on a mangement level.This is my seventh trip to Dominican Republic and the first time that I have been so disappointed by a resort. I would not stay there again when there is such a selection of great resorts to choose from.

<Content>2 words------- dont go!!!!!!!!! 13 of us just got home on feb. 17 we were never happier to get away form that night mare!!!!! we have been going for 12 years and this is by far the worst!!! would not go back even if offered total free trip!!!!! we tried to get on earlier plane out, but they were full. i put a lot of blame on APPLE VACATIONS! our travel agent and myself both personally called them when we first saw reviews signaling problems and were given all the reassurances in the world this was a 5 star plus resort. B.S. this resort was way overbooked way under staffed and little or no apparent management. this resort was put in service before completion to get a cash flow started. dead flys everywhere and not cleaned up, including eating areas, we referred this area as the fly cementary! 5 days without being able to get beach or pool chairs. 2 hr waits at speciality restaurants, unpainted restrooms, not only unpainted but final plaster cleanup never done. everybody that checks in gets put on what we referred as skid row area, then its up to you to raise hell to get moved ! if you dont complain then they win. its either have to be mad all week or accept that this is what your hard earned money went for!!!! email with any furthur question moemoe.52@hotmail.com SHAME ON APPLE VACATIONS!!!! 5 star my butt, again please DONT GO!!!!! sincerely stephan moore

<Content>Had a great week with some minor issues... Stayed at the EdenH Real Arena from Feb 10 to the 17 with friends of ours, and while the resort does have its fair share of issues to deal with, there is no reason that you cannot enjoy yourself.Rooms: We upgraded to the Paradise Club section (Mirage Concierge with Transat Vacations) and had beautiful rooms close to the ocean. No problems with sinks, toilets, televisions, etc... although we did lose power for 20 minutes one evening and did not have hot water for a day - no big deal, the ocean was warm enough!The room was missing the robes, beach towels and rum as promissed, but one quick phone call and the problem was fixed. Food: Food was excellent at the restaurants and the buffet, although it did lack some variation. If nothing else, it is consistent. The biggest problem at this point is staffing - all servers, bartenders, etc... work extremely hard to please, although they are most definitely understaffed. For those who say that it is impossible not to get mad I say - relax, take a deep breath and realize that they are doing the very best they can.Restaurants: The A-La Carte restaurants are definitely disorganized at this point, and they have tried different methods to cope. Best advice - get in line at 6:00pm and make a reservation for later on. Enjoy the beach, have a shower and a few drinks, and you'll be ready for your reservation. The Oriental was by far the best experience!The Beach: The beach and water are absolutely amazing! Fine white sand and relatively calm waters, although it was quite windy while we were there. Beach chairs and loungers were definitely difficult to come by, and the rumor is true that you should be out early to get a chair, although I must say we often woke up at 7:30 or 8:00 and did just fine finding a spot. The hotel has ordered 300-400 additional chairs from what we were told, so there should be more in the near future.The water was absolutely gorgeous and there were plenty of things to do - waterskiing, diving, snorkeling, sailing, cayaking, banana tubing, parasailing, etc... and the beachfront staff are amazing - always ready to give you a lesson and teach you how to do things you may have never done before.The dive hut on the beach was apparently still in the process of being finished, but I'm told the diving instructor was incredible!We spent nearly every day at the beach, and while we did get up relatively early to get chairs, I'm sure this will be resolved soon.Beach towels are always available at the dive hut - just be sure to get your towel cards at the front desk - a policy that was just initiated.Drinks: Plenty of drinks to go around, and wonderful staff at all bars. Do not expect to be served Guiness or Corona, and don't hold your breath for Grey Goose or the like. Lets get serious here - you're on vacation, you want a vodka and orange juice, do you really care if it's Grey Goose or Absolut (which is standard)? Do you care if your Gin and 7 is made with the very best or with Bombay Saphire (which is standard)? If so, then lower your expectation - I like a good drink, and I like a stiff drink, and these bartenders will give you both. Beers are Brahma and El Presidente - don't come here expecting Corona or Heineken. Flip the bartenders a couple of dollars here and there and they will definitely take care of you - we routinely had drink service at the beach, and knew all of our bartenders quite well. Take the time to tip and thank them, and they will in turn take care of you!Staff: Always smiling and working their hardest to meet your every need although there is definitely a language barrier for many of them. Be patient... don't get angry - and you'll get whatever you need! Many of them are equally frustrated, and while they still need some seasoning, things appear to be going in the right direction. Not once were we treated rudely - we found it entirely disapointing to see a number of individuals berating and yelling at staff members - have some class people. These are human beings and they are doing their best. This resort has only been officially open for 6-8 weeks - there are definitely some things to iron out.Mosquitos: I'm typically attacked by mosquitos here in Canada and only had three bites while in Punta Cana. Contrary to reports, we saw very few in the hallways, and had virtually none in our room.Bottom line: The resort is definitely not running at the level of a five star resort, but it is not as bad as many will point out. Construction noise is minimal - they are building a new resort beside the EdenH, but work did not typically begin until the middle of the day, and at that, the noise was minimal - the waves and wind offen drown out any sounds whatsoever!Grounds crews are out continually planting new trees and shrubs - the resort was incredibly lush given it only just opened, and they are constantly planting more and more.Many tradesmen can be found around the resort filling cracks, fixing tiles, painting walls, etc..., but unless you take the time to notice, you'll never really see them, and they do not seem to bother anyone whatsoever.Go with an open mind, and remember that many of you are paying a considerably lower price for this vacation given that it's a new resort. If you want to stay at a true 5 star, then pay the $4,000 to $5,000 and go to Sandals, Club Med, Paradissus, etc... For my money, we had a great vacation and given some time, would definitely consider returning to the EdenH. We have stayed at 5 star resorts in the Mayan Riviera, and in time, this resort will be much better than any of them. Relax, take it easy, have a drink, and remember to switch your clock to Dominican time. The resort needs some time to get up to speed, but the fact of the matter is that a vacation is what you make of it, so enjoy!

<Content>Getting better but still needs work We just retuned from the Edenh Real Arena .stayed from feb9-16I had read the reviews so I was prepared for the most part.Let me preface my review by saying my wife is handicapped andwe took her wheel chair with us. We where greeted by Ramseswho made us feel very welcome. He changed our room to thebottom level as we where on the third floor . We arrived earlySunday morning at about 1:30 AM . We where checked in and he took our luggage to our room. He was wonderful.The room was fine and the fact there was no partition betweenthe bed and jacuzzi was a non factor for us. We did have trouble with bath towels and face clothes not being replaced. However we had booked through Apple Vacation and they have an office in the hotel. I told them my issue and never had a problem afterthat, Room had a few mosquitoes , no problem.My wife and I enjoyed the entertainment , Particular when it was outside, However as with most things at this Hotel you need to get there early to get a good seat. Also I had to bump the wheel chair down as there are no ramps.The food was excellent for the most part. Especially the Asianand the American restaurants, However you need to be in line by 5:45 for the 6:30 sitting. It was a common practice for twopeople to be in line and then right before the restaurant opened6 or 8 of their friends would join them . There needs to be a better way to do this . Going back to reservations makes sense for me. My wife and I enjoyed the buffets and we espeically enjoyed the fruit native to the Carribean .Service at all the restaurants was fine for the most part.The Beach The Beach is wonderful , the weather outstanding,The beach was kept clean. Now for my biggest problem the beach chairs. This has been stated before however to experience this is a challange to say the least.. The first twodays no problem. The third day I got to the beach about 9:00 and I went to get chairs I was told that all the chairs on the beach where taken by this man anfd his friends, I explained to the man my wife is handicapped this made no diffrence. Afterarguing with this man I found two chairs that where not occupied.I was not gioing to let this man ruin my vacation so I was at the Beach at 6:30 after that. Twodays latter my wife went to get our chaiirs which I had saved at 6:30 and I was told they where not my chairs. I explained to the man that they where my shirts on the chairs and he let me kept the chairs. The hotel needs to buy at least 100 chairs for the beach to take care of this problem.We also found it difficult for my wife to get to the beach as thereare no egress for her so she used her crutches . .Also there are no automatic door openers and this presented challenges.To sum up we had a good time but the hotel needs work to get to the five star level

<Content>"Great Time" Glad we did not switch We stayed at the EDENH Feb 10 -17th. The resort is new and improving every day. We booked the concierge package and recomend the upgrade as far as being able to reserve at the al a cartes and the private pool and bars. (also the private breakfast at the Italian resturant).We traveled as a couple (no kids) and actualy downgraded our room to an great Ocean View with the tub inside. Our choice and loved it. The staff were very helpfull.We overheard lots of complaining from guest who felt it was not fair we had two private pools to choose from (not crowded) and no line ups at the bar. The wines both Red and White are excellent, we would normally puchase wines from Italy, Chili or Ontario.The Swedish massage on the beach was great, we did the couples deal twice.The food exceeded all expectations, we enjoyed all the resturants. The lobster dinner (served in room) was great and we took advantage of the room service menu for late night snacks.I recomend this resort for anyone who wants to have a great time.

<Content>no complaints Just came back from Eden h on Friday. Wanted to let fellow travellers going soon to relax. My husband and I with 16 other friends have just returned and we had a good time. Check in was no problem we were met by courteous staff. The rooms are very nice, and room service was great. We never waited no longer than 15 min. We had brought our own wine with us and there was no problem someone bringing us a cork screw ( which we forgot) The staff we found to be very nice and for the most part would go out of their way to help us. Look for Andre on the beach, he is the best! We tipped our waiters, the cleaning lady and most of all Andre. The reason we tipped is because we felt if we were in Canada and had this service we would so we should also to these hard workers. The resort itself is nicely laid out, with time the landscaping will be fully grown and it will look even better. I cant say enough about the Beach its awesome! Oh yes do have a massage on the beach, it was truly a luxury. We had a great time in the main lobby bar and the Tantra bar. Even though the other facilities were not open we didnt mind the staff kept everyone dancing and singing. Ok so I said no complaints and I wont. Just to let you know there are mosquitoe's in some of the rooms. We thought they were coming from the air cond. system?? Not hundreds of them just enough for you to have a towel fight before bed! The food was very good. The Ala cartes were better than the buffet, but hard to get into. We did mange to eat ala carte 4 times during our stay. All in all I cant say too many bad things occurred during our stay. I know others may have a different story, some of our freinds had minor problems ( phone not working, sink plugged ) But I think I can say all 18 of us had a good time and it was well worth the money. So go and have fun, relax by the beach and put your feet up!

<Content>Dissapointed and never to return The place itself was very beautiful. The pools were quite nice and the beach outstanding.The problems were many;Service was poor, drinks were awful, getting a beach chair was a chore. If your idea of a holiday is to sleep in until 9 then have a leisurely breakfast, then head for the beach; then forget this place. If you were not on the beach by 6:30 to 7 am you would not get a chair. Unless of course you would resort to stealing one. That could result in a fight as occured occasionally during my visit.Bring a lot of 1$ bills for tipping, because if you don't have change they expect a tip for making change on a ten. Believe it; everywhere I went they had a hand out for a tip. I know the average income in the DR is not great but at an all inclusive resort I do expect some service without required tipping.The food was generally marginal and waiting in line each night for OK food isn't something I would do at home.The deal seemed like a good deal financially, but if you feel the little things are what make a holiday; I suggest you spend a few more dollars and find someplace other than Eden H.

<Content>Nice vacation We just got back from EdenH, we were there for a week, Feb 8 to Feb 16.Basic, delux room package (green wristband).We arrived at the resort around midnight on Saturday. We were in our room in less than 10 minutes. We did not experience any issues with checking in or out.Our room was on ground floor. The following morning we noticed that the patio door lock was broken and our in room safe was not working. I reported both items to customer service that morning.By the time we got back from the beach, I would say around 4pm, both items were fixed. The room itself was spacious and nicely decorated. I did not like the opening between bathroom and sleeping area. I get up early and my wife sleeps in. I had to turn on the light in the bathroom to get get myself ready. Because of the opening, the light spills out into the sleeping area. Privacy is another issue. If you are there with kids it makes it very inconvinient. Although the glass doors to both shower and toilet are sand blasted, one has to go inside the shower area to get some privacy (i.e. for changing). It was really funny to see a lock on the bathroom door, right next to 5x7ft opening. :)Room itself has plenty of storage. We had no issues with anything in the room other than the couple of items described above.Our room was very clean every day, with plenty of fresh towels. I'm not sure what time the room was cleaned, but it was always done by the time we got back from the beach.Although we were not affected by the chair game on the beach, this situation is horrible.The reason why we were not affected is because I'm an early riser. I was up early enough to get our chairs under a hut. I loved watching sunrise every morning. After sunrise I went for breakfast and than back to the beach. My wife would usually join me around 9am. I feel really sorry for people that had to get up early just to reserve chairs and for people that could not get chairs because they wanted to sleep in on their vacation.In my crude estimate (based on how many people were walking around between 9 and 10am looking for chairs) about 50-100 more chairs would solve this issue. There is plenty of room on the beach to place them. People that do not get there early might not get a hut, but at least they would have a chair.Other than 1/2 hour after sunrise I was on the beach from about 6:30am to 4pm. I can not believe how many people would show up to claim their reserved chairs around noon and sometimes even later. I did notice people reserving more chairs than they were using. I do not know how bad it was around a pool as we were always on a beach. The beach was very nice. Seaweed was cleand up early every morning and also constantly during the day. There was a second guy on the beach walking around all day picking up garbage. Security was in place to prevent vendors aproaching EdenH visitors. Few times in the morning I did see broken glass on the beach. Since the glass was green, I assume that it was from the beer bottles. I do not know this, but I believe that guests drinking on the beach were responsible for this.We got two towel cards, but we never had to use them.I had no problems with getting service at any of the bars. Sometimes I had to wait few minutes, but I was served in what I believe is a reasonable time. I believe that waiting time was less than a typical semi-busy bar/club in Toronto. I drank beer during the day and vodka7 at night. I had no problems with their domestic vodka. Few times they served me vodka7 with Absolut and it did not taste any different. If you were to drink thir vodka straight up I'm sure there would be a difference, once it was mixed into in a coctail it was fine to me. We had no problem with food. We went to American Grill, Italian restaurant and buffet.Service at above restaurants was inconsistent. We experienced service from excelent to average. We never had poor service. Entertainment at night was fine, but I'm not big fan of sitting around watching shows. I rather spend my evenings in one of the bars.During the week we were at EdenH, there was a lot of planting going on, I do not think it bothered anybody. Also in that week railing was installed at the beach restaurant. I noticed that they started work around 7:30am and stopped around 9am. They worked on it again in the evning once most (if not all) people left the pool area. I did not see other construction activities.Overall, we had a really good vacation. In my opinion there are areas that this resort has to improve on (consistent service in particular) to become one of the top resorts in the area.One other thing, I really like the design and decor of this place. Inetrior desing is very different from a typical Dominican resort.Cheers!

<Content>Relaxation! My husband bought me this trip as a Christmas gift and selected the property specifically because it was a new resort! I was very nervous because I read vast reviews at this website almost on a daily basis. Let me first say that if you don't have a good time it is your own fault - you are too uptight!! We came to the resort with an open mind (despite any negative reviews) and had a great time!! The people and the staff were all very kind and quick to help with anything we needed. This was meant to be a trip to relax and we did just that. However, there are some things that would have made the experience a little better. For one, the rooms have no clocks whatsoever - in fact, we did not see one clock throughout the resort. Therefore, if you have a massage scheduled (which I did on the beach - heavenly!!) and you don't have a watch - you need to ask people what time it is. Also, bring your bug spray. The only place we had mosquitos was in our room. I was a little disappointed with the outside jacuzzi as it faced the small thoroughfare that goes through the proprty and other buildings (no privacy). It would have been nice to have some sort of privacy blind. Our room itself was very nice and the bathroom was very private. The food was very good and the beach was beautiful - however, there is A LOT of seaweed along the shore. The restaurants were very nice, but they were not clearly marked when we got there - but I'm sure they will be taking care of this very soon. The worst part of the whole trip was getting through customs when we got back into the US. Many international flights coming into Altanta at the same time causing thousands of people flooding into customs at one time. My suggestion would be that if you need to book a connecting flight to be sure you have at least a 3 hour layover (just to get through customs!). For all of you who have scheduled a trip to this resort - relax and enjoy (I recommend the rum punch)!

<Content>Stay away from Edenh Real We just returned from the longest vacation week of my life, 2/9 thru 2/16/08. The resort is grossly understaffed and we certainly found out the meaning of you get what you pay for. The staff is undertrained and ,at imes, I saw nothing short of rudeness.You have to be on the beach at 6:00 am in order to get a beach chair. By 7 am everything is taken. You cant get waited on even when you go to the bar yourself to get drinks. And you will never get the same drink twice, no matter how many times you order it.The plumbing is a disaster with horror stories of ceilings falling in, sinks falling off walls, toilets overflowing and taking 3 hrs. to get someone to help from the staff.Our t.v. didn't work part of the time and the jacuzzi didn't work at all. We saw floor tiles busted all over the resort and cracks in the walls. Only 1 elevator worked in each building, even though there were 4 floors and 4 elevators in each building.I could go on forever with the horror stories but the positive was the food. It was INCREDIBLE, but the drinks were pretty crappy.Do yourself a favor, spend a couple of hundred dollars extra and go somewhere you can enjoy yourself!!!

<Content>Not Ready!!! My husband and I have been to Punta Cana 5 times in February and we always have a blast. We figure that anywhere is better than snow, temps in the teens and icy roads!We read reviews and expected less than 5 stars and that is exactly what we got. The weather was perfect, service (if you could convey your request) was good and food was acceptable.Arrived at noon and didn't get into a room til almost 5. Numerous complaints from guests we met as to rooms not being finished and things needing attention. Seems the upgraded people (pink bands) have special sections where regular people are not allowed. These areas are not marked so when you visit them and actually sit in them or order drinks, staff asks you to leave, customers are complaining. This proved highly embarrasing on more than one occassion. I can certainly stay where I'm not wanted - just let me know my boundaries. Entertainment was held on the outdoor plaza so if there is rain, shows are cancelled. This happened twice. There is an air conditioned auditorium on site, but shows were not moved indoors, just cancelled. Shows we saw were not as good as previous visits to other resorts.If you didn't get up by 6:45 a.m. and reserve a lounge chair, you had to use towels. Why can't the hotel furnish one chair per guest so everyone has a chair???The gym was not done, casino was hardly started on construction as well as the bowling alley. The night club/disco was located up 3 flights of stairs. After drinking and partying, we felt this location was dangerous. Elevators to rooms were not operable - we were on the 4th floor. Lots of exercise everytime we wanted to get to our rooms! Like I said, we made the best of inconveniences, but the hotel was a 3 star at best and hardly ready for full occupancy, which is what it will be this week according to guest services.No arrangements for Sunday worship services. Other resorts we have stayed at have provided visiting priests. Mosquitos!!! There are swamps on either side of the drive to the resort and apparently have not been sprayed for insects. There was a truck everynight to spray the property, but we had mosquito killing sessions every night in our room. Numerous bites from walking around after dark on common areas. Looking forward to a better run facility next year.

<Content>Wait About 5 Years!!!!! When we arrived at the hotel it was approx 1 am. We never received the hotel room we paid for when we arrived. When we called the front desk, the language barrier was a problem except for the pharse we have noting available, all sold out, check tomorrow. The room came with a jacuzzi on the balcony, and the drywall at back was ripped down at the top. The hot water was room temp all week long. Our ocean view was another building. We had an adjoining room next to ours, only thing is that our door did not have a lock. So much for sleep for the night. If you want to eat, make reservations at the vip area of the hotel or you will go hungry. We also paid extra for this trip so that we can have our own area. This came with the Le Concierge rooms. Don't expect a private pool, because the other guests came to our area, and nothing was done. If you want a chair at the beach or pool, get up early!!!! Heed the old saying, buyer beware. In 5 years this may be okay. However, I won't be coming back ever again.Steve B.

<Content>H in Edenh is for HEAVEN We had the privilege and honour to stay at this resort from Feb 1-8th 2008. My fianc茅e and I were the first to get married at this resort. I have been to a few true 5 star resorts in the past. Secrets Excellence Mayan Riviera and Riu Palace Mayan Riviera. At this moment I would consider this resort a 4.5 star and will be a 5.5 this time next year. I have read some negative reviews on this resort. They are ridiculous! We saved money knowing it was under construction. Before booking you should always do some research on the resort you are paying for. Construction should be done by mid April 2008. It is the final touches not major construction being done. Unfortunately the people complaining are princesses and should have never booked this resort in the first place. I am sure that some of the people complaining about this resort would probably be upset with the 7 star hotel in Dubai. The only negatives were 1. The negative whiners, which dwelled about their little issues for their entire vacation. Chill people, it is really hard to sit on the beach with a drink and enjoy the weather. If you spent hours in your room then sleep on the beach or stay home. 2. Having to get up at 7am to reserve a chair. The resort is working on the problem. I counted 5 mosquitoes in one week. As for the staff speaking English, well we are going to their country not the other way around. Some staff was very fluent in English and all staff tried hard to make you happy. If there was any employees that should speak better English it is the hostesses at the al a Carte restaurants.Now for the good stuffWe eloped to Eden. Ruth the wedding coordinator greeted us. From the initial handshake with her until we left was absolutely amazing. We will be back. If you are thinking of having wedding in the Dominican pick this resort. Ruth was very professional, polite and most of all patient. We sat down a few hours after we arrived and went over the details of the wedding. What can I say; the room, beach and bars were amazing. The Asian restaurant was the best and then the Italian. The wedding was smoooooooth. My soon to be wife arrived on the beach via a dressed up golf cart. The setup was AWESOME! We did elope so we were by ourselves. We ended up having 70 people that we did not know standing around taking pictures and clapping. We had a 3-man band walk behind us, which was fantastic. The judge spoke Spanish and Ruth translated it for us. Jorge the photographer that Ruth recommended took some of the best photos we have ever seen especially for a wedding. As we walked around the resort taking our pictures people would be clapping and saying congratulations. I would like to thank all of you that were there. Carlos at the beach bar and Juan#1 (he calls himself) at the lobby bar were fantastic. They would remember your drink every time.

<Content>We loved this resort!!!! We stayed here from Feb. 02/08 to Feb. 09/08. We were the only people from our bus to check in so our check-in was very easy. The two people that helped us spoke enough english to make every thing smooth. The baggage porter who helped us to our room also spoke excellent english. This resort in my opinion is a perfect size - short walk to the room, short walk to beach or restaurants, lobby, theatre etc...making this resort very elderly friendly. We are in our late 30's and saw a good mixture of all age groups here. Our room was very clean and cleaned well every day of our stay. Some people were saying that they went a day without maid service but everyone around us were happy with our service. The bathrooms are an open concept / european style, that some may find offers little privacy. This did not bother us as we have stayed at places like this before. The grounds are nice and you can see that in the future when the plants are mature everyone will enjoy their surroundings. The beach was nice and not over crowded. Every morning someone would rake up any sea-weed that may have gathered from the previous night. The whole saving or reserving beach or pool chairs was a pain in the rear end, but this practice goes on at every resort that we have been to and Mike and the resort brass are working on a system that may make some people upset, but I think that if they set a precedent with this idea other resorts may follow. They are proposing a system where someone watches the chairs and if you are gone for more than an hour, someone will take your belongings to a secure spot on the beach somewhere. I have read that since we left they have implemented a towel card system to help combat people requesting too many towels. We have never stayed at a resort where there were two different room categories and this bothered me a little bit because our T.A. did'nt offer us an upgrade and I was not about to haggle with the desk staff for an upgrade. I have never been denied access to a bar or lounge before. That being said I probably would'nt have spent a lot of time in these places anyway, I just want to have full reign over all the resorts offerings. Some nights we were there, no reservations were required at the a-la-cartes, and other nights they were required. The resort brass are trying hard to find a system that will fit everyones wishes but a full resort of hungry people can be hard to juggle to make everybody happy. We ate at all the restaurants and did not have a bad meal. One night we waited a little long between courses at the steak house but we were not in a hurry anyway, we just had a couple more drinks. The staff at these restaurants work very hard and we tipped relatively often. We never had a problem with the english / spanish language issue. The staff try their best to communicate with you and I always tell myself, I'm in their country, they are not in mine! A smile goes a long way. The centre courtyard was where most of the nightly entertainment was held because the theatre is not 100% just yet. I have not seen entertainment like this at any of the four other resorts I have stayed at in Punta Cana. They had a Super Bowl party that had to be seen to be believed. Another night they had a Dominican version of Cirque du Soleil. A circus show that was fantastic to watch. I was glad to see this type of entertainment as opposed to audience participation shows doing silly stunts and skits with vacationers, as was the norn at other resorts in the area. We really did not have any concers to worry about while staying here but I can see how some people may have complaints. One person that we met said that their toilet ran the whole time that they were there. They called the front desk numerous times and no-one ever came. They laughed it off as background noise. When we first arrived there were alot of bare wires hanging out of sockets in the hallways, but by the end of our week the staff were hanging fixtures in those sockets. We overheard other people complaining about staying on the fourth floor and most elevators were not working. For these reasons I cannot give this resort a 5 out of 5, although my wife and I had a great time and would deffinately return if given the opportunity. In the future when all the growing pains are taken care of this is going to be a great place for everyone to try. Some of the other little touches offered by EdenH was the fresh fruit served on the beach by wait staff, and the quick service by the waitresses on the beach serving drinks. The animation team on the beach were very hard working. We especially had a good laugh at happy boy wearing a different silly hat every day. I even saw happy boy and Jose helping people find and carry beach chairs up and down the beach - which was definately not in their daily duties. These guys and gals work from 8:30AM to well past 11:00PM every day for 11 days straight, then they get 3 day off, then they start over. Try to cut the employees some slack, most of them break their backs trying to make your vacation one to remember. My advise to anyone going here is to keep in mind that it is a new resort and they are trying hard to differentiate themselves from other resorts in the region by trying new ideas on beach chair saving and a-la-carte dinner service etc... Go with an open mind and you will have a great time like we did.

<Content>Great Vacation Spot!! I traveled here with my parents, and myself on Feb 9-16. We had a great time.We booked the conceirge package, apon arrival we were taken straight to the VIP lounge where we were checked into our room within 10 minutes. And named Saul, took us and our bagage to our room 2361. We had a view of the 3 main pools and the ocean. Everything in our room worked, and was completley stocked except for the rum, fruit basket and the complimentary robes and slipers. The slipers however werent at the hotel yet. And the manager of the VIP area made sure we had the rest of our stuff right away. All week we had at tops 8 misquitos in our room.All the pools are beautiful and nicely kept. The bartenders are all nice and are willing to get you anything. My favovrites were Ramone, Carlos, and Jan Jouse. One day we needed some umbrellas by the pool and one guy went and got us two of them. All the staff was extremely helpful and nice to us.The beach is nice, there is lots of shade, and two beautiful massage huts. They have a water trampoline which is alot of fun.The parasalling is great, so are the catamarans and the kayaking. All the water staff is polite and helpful.The resturants are all good if you like the kind of food they serve. My favorite was the Italian and the American Grill. If you order the steak and lobster and ask for an extra tail they will give you as many as you want. One night it was really busy and the waiter brought us out some extra tails to say sorry for the wait.For breakfast if your book the conceige you can have a private breakfast at the italian resturant if youd like.The nightly entertainment is amazing. The Karaoke, Circus of Dreams, and White night were my favorite.We went on two exscursions, the speed boats and the anaimal adveture park which were both fun.All the locals are extremley nice, and even the store owners are even though there prices are high you just have to bargin with them and you can get some awesome deals.All together I didnt have one bad exsperience while at the resort. The people are great, understand english fairly well, the place is nice, clean, the construction noise you can hardly even hear. And every day the place gets alot better, I would recommend this place to anyone to go to. Its truley amazing.I hope you all give it a try while the price is low, as one day this place will be exspensive to go to but will be well worth the money.

<Content>Switch if you can ! EdenH Real Arena is not the place to go this year. I took the reviews with a grain of salt too,  was sorry I did not heed the warnings. If you are one of the lucky people who get a room that is ready on time  has all the things in it that you would expect,....ie....handle on doors, peepholes that are finished  not just a hole in door, a ceiling that does not cave in, not have someones water from room above coming into your room,....get my point? Then we have the service.... or lack of. Don't expect your plates in buffet to be cleared too soon, get more coffee, get a CLEAN plate, have hot food, get a drink too often around the pool,(the few girls that there are must make rounds, then go back to bar  make their own drinks, then make rounds again). Be extremely careful walking around. The floors are very slippery. When it is dark, watch your step. Many, many people have fallen. If you get JUST THE DELUXE wristband, you get cheapy....cheapy...alcohol. You can drink all day  never even get a buzz..... THE TRUTH!!! No people in our group were happy, nor were many others that we spoke with during the week. We honestly feel that they ran out of money  had to open early to get more funding. Running a so called 5 star on a 1 star budget won't get them very good reviews.

<Content>we loved the Edenh My husband and I had a wonderful time at the Edenh resort from Feb. 1 - 8. Our room on the fourth floor was absolutely terrific. We had a great view of the pools and the ocean and enjoyed our whirlpool on the balcony every day that we were there.We did upgrade to the Mirage concierge accommodations and it was well worth it. From the moment we arrived, the concierge guest services took care of everything we needed. We were whisked up to our room upon arrival by Rami, who gave us a tour of the resort on the way, making sure that he pointed out all the restaurants and facilities that we may need during the week. Our room was tastefully decorated with a wall separating the bathroom facilities from the living area. There was a large plasma television with probably 100 different satellite channels, a mini bar that was always stocked, plenty of Dasani water always available, in-room safe, iron and ironing board, plenty of closet space with hangers, hairdryer, hair products, lotions, toothbrushes and toothpaste, mouthwash, combs, bath gels, lots of thick bathtowels, and, with a simple request, beach towels left for the next morning. We couldn't have been happier with the service we received.We were located in a room that was right next to the oceanfront suites which were still in the process of being built, but it really didn't bother us at all. I am awake quite early and I heard the construction crews trying to be very quiet in order not to disturb the guests. If I had not been awake already, I would not have heard anything. You could tell that they were taking great care to not make noise. During the day there was noise due to construction, but, really, why are you spending time in your room when it's so beautiful by the beach and pool?There is a pool available with butler service for the concierge guests. If you don't find chairs available, all you have to do is ask politely and they will be provided. We spent a lot of time at the other pools and the service there was just as good with staff coming by regularly to ask if you needed a drink or to clean up empty glasses, etc. The pools were clean and refreshing. I, personally, don't want to swim in a pool that is body temperature. They were perfect for me.The beach grill always had lots of choices. Hamburgers, freshly grilled chicken, of course, french fries, roasted beef or pork and, one day, even turkey, lots of fresh salad with a selection of dressings, fresh guacamole, and pizza that was as fantastic as the homemade pizzas my Italian friend makes. At no time did we ever have to wait for a table, and if we took a table that was not ready, the staff were there immediately with new cutlery and glasses. Personally, I don't think I would work that hard for people who would rarely dip into their pockets to tip!We were always greeted with a smiling face and prompt service.Jose and Danny at the Beach grill were always ready with a smile and great service to whip up any drink you requested. We appreciated their efficient and personable attitude. Muchas gracias!We realize that there were problems with the reservations for the a la carte restaurants, but we have run into similar circumstances, even with resorts that have been open for much longer. People always seem to complain about either waiting in line to reserve or not being able to get in when they are supposed to. Instead of lining up first thing in the morning ot make dinner reservations, we opted to just show up and were usually seated within an hour or so at the restaurant of our choice. You're on holidays... lighten up! We loved the Asian restaurant. The food and service was great. Franklin, our waiter each night was fantastic. I don't think we have had more attentive service here in Toronto. We ate a la carte each night, rather than at the hibachi table, although the show at the table was wonderful and fun to watch. The vegetable tempura with shrimps was lovely and the sushi was terrific. We thoroughly enjoyed every dinner.We really loved our lobster dinner served in our room as well. The lobster was huge and very well prepared. The waiters did a beautiful job preparing our table, complete with tablecloth and bottle of wine, chocolate truffles for dessert, very romantic indeed.The resort itself is beautiful. Lots of fountains, serene surroundings, very clean public areas, great beach and pools, large lobby and convention centre. The Tantra bar at night was fun to go to after the nightly entertainment. Sometimes, they would have very talented dancers there to entertain the guests as well. Service there was always very good, and served with a smile.The lobby bar was very good as well. There was always a full selection of premium liquors.The entertainment at night was very good. The circus night was very upscale for a resort. All the singers were very talented and put on wonderful shows. Although the shows were very well attended, there were always enough chairs provided. The shows started at about 9:45 and lasted at least an hour or so. The night of Superbowl, a huge screen was erected in the courtyard so that everyone could enjoy the game. During the day, aerobic classes were held in the pool, salsa dancing classes were held near the beach grill, painting classes and handicraft classes were available as well. There were lots of kayaks and windsurfers on the beach. We enjoyed the massages on the beach as well. Very relaxing.Although we did not take advantage, there seemed to be a lot of activities that were available near the resort. We saw a lot of parasailing, helicopter rides, jet boats, horseback riding, and there was a golf course nearby as well.As far as tipping goes, think about what you tip when you are at home. These people work so much harder, sometimes working three weeks at a time without going home to see their families. It bothered me to see people not leaving a tip after receiving service that they surely would tip for if they were at home. It is all inclusive, but I don't believe that everyone benefits from the amount you pay for your trip. Be generous, it will only come back in good karma for you.All in all, we had a most relaxing and enjoyable trip and we would have no hesitation in returning for our next vacation. Muchas gracias to all the staff at the Edenh! It made the beginning of our 25th anniversary year together just wonderful.

<Content>Skip Edenh Real Arena Overall: THE GOOD: very clean, comfortable beds, Asian Restaurant excellent, great pool. THE BAD: too new, inconsistent service, staff not trained thoroughly, buildings not completed, food just so so.Alcohol: poor quality, forget top shelf, you're getting below bottom shelf, wine is undrinkable, if you ordered ten rum and cokes all ten were different, only presidente and one other local beer available.Staff: Some very good, some very bad. Don't trust exchange rate in gift shop. They don't have a clue. Take a calculator or they will rip you off. Housekeeping staff walks right into bathroom even if you are in there. Wait staff around pool very slow and not very good understanding drink orders.Buildings: Half the room doors are missing the lens in the peep hole, so you can look in rooms. Bldg. 2 elevators either don't work or the one that did work we got stuck between floors in. Only stuck a minute but that was enough. Wall between bathroom and beds is a 4 x 4 opening. no privacy.Entertainment: None at all until 9:30 at night. Should have live music in courtyard from 5 pm on.Stayed at Ocean Blue last time and had much better experience.

<Content>Best time ever!!!!!! My wife and myself went to the edenh from feb 08 to 15, and had a blast. The food was great, service great and there was lots of great people that we met. Hi to MOM and DAD (joan and denis), susan and sean, jackie and mike etc..... We took the upgraded package for a few bucks more, and believe me it is well worth it. There is a vip breakfast restaurant, vip pool area with premium booze, the rooms are bigger and have a tub on the balcony, you get a lobster dinner brought to your room with wine, apps, fruit and dessert. There was nothing to complain about on this trip. I have been to 14 all-inclusive trips in the past 10 years and I felt this one was the best. Your trip is only as good has you make it, and believe me, we had lots of fun and met some great people too.

<Content>Edenh-New Review-Book Elsewhere Let's begin with the positives. Weather was increadible. Hot, Hot sun and warm tropical breezes. Bring lots of sunscreen (I went through 2 bottles) and a light sweater or jacket for A/C at night. Majority of staff was very friendly and tried their best to be accomodating. Asian Restaurant around the 3 bars (particularly the middle one) was excellent. Others not in our party of 12 said menu seating was not so good. Breakfast bar at Festival was good. Lots of selection and good coffee, but needs to open earlier (7:00 a.m.) Tried to get room service coffee prior to 7, but phone rang and rang. Food at pool side restaurant was good. Security was abundant.Negatives: Nothing new here guys, all the same, and all true. Place opened way,way too early. Not even close to being ready. LOTS of confusion with check-in, rules, housekeeping service, dinner seating, etc. Be prepared by having a swimsuit or lighter clothes readily available because you may not get into your room until late, late. Alcohol is of poor quality, unless you upgrade. If you are a wine, scotch, beer,or vodka drinker you'll be disappointed unless you upgrade. If you're going with a party of more than 2, I would suggest that someone in your party upgrade so that you can get better quality. We even offered to PAY for better drinks, but could not.Bar ran out of numerous items throughout the week including, ice, vodka and beer. Chairs at poolside were at a premium and if you don't get down there at 6-6:30, you will not get one. Lots of fights between guests over chairs. Chairs on beach were even harder to get.No reservations at restaurants. If you want to eat at 6:30, you need to be in line by 6. Even then, you may or may not get seated...NOT because there are no tables available, but lack of wait staff and chefs (I'm assuming) because there were always plenty of tables still available at cutoff. Food, with the exception of Asian is average at best. I would recommend packing Florastor, a probiotic that can be obtained without prescription. 7 of 12 in our party were sick by mid week.Absolutely no privacy in rooms whatsoever. If you are not traveling with spouse/significant other or traveling with children, be sure and pack a sheet or shower curtain with good strapping tape. Suction cups or regular tape will not hold. Someone in an earlier review wrote bathrooms are virtual echo chambers -TRUE!Very inconsisant housekeeping service. Sometimes cleaned at 10, sometimes at 8:00 p.m. Always something missing,i.e. towels, hand towels, bath mat, bottled water. SAME bucket of water used for entire floor. If your room is late being cleaned, water is filthy black.Elevators: Ours did not work and we were on the fourth floor. LOTS of exercise. We finally did find one that worked three corridors down, but got STUCK in it mid week...VERY SCARY!Quality of construction is extremely poor. For being only one month old, there was broken concrete, peeling paint, burnt out light bulbs in significant places (like stairwells), toilets not flushing, leaking pipes, holes drilled in main doors for peep holes, but no peep Had to put kleenex in hole for privacy. No bathroom door handle. Had to grab moulding to get door opened. Be extremely careful of main room door. You must slam hard for lock to catch. Twice we came up to room after maid service to find our door wide opened. Major accidents waiting to happen at this place, floors, although beautiful, are very slick, dark corridors, saw 3 people (including one in our party) run right into glass doors because of no writing on them. Pool, although beautiful, was slick and sometimes hard to get in and out of. Not that we used it very much...water was extremely cold. Beach needs more maintenance. I can handle the seaweed, but not broken glass, which was abundant.Only one store for shopping in resort. You are a captive audience. Very pricy and be careful of exchange rate. MAKE SURE what you're paying before you pay. They WILL over charge you if you don't bring it to their attention. Also, never had change, so you just say..keep it (Was this on purpose??) Entertainment was very limited and started way too late.I, too was a reader that laughed at the comment someone made about not speaking English and thought to myself how arrogant of us....now I understand what they meant! I know some Spanish, but had a difficult time with many service oriented employees who should have been somewhat trained in limited bi-lingual conversation.I know that many of you will be disappointed in this review. I, too only wanted to hear great things before I left and was on trip advisor constantly. But it is what it is.... If I had it to do again, I would taken our travel agents offer and book somewhere else. Your call.....Have a wonderful vacation wherever you choose. Be happy to answer any questions via private message. Best of luck.

<Content>Serious Disappointment Our trip to Edenh Real Arena in Punta Cana from February 1 to 8 was a serious, serious disappointment for me, my husband and my brother-in-law. We paid for a potential five star hotel and received 鈥?at the very best 鈥?two star accommodations. We have been to the Caribbean fifteen times 鈥?eight of these to Punta Cana 鈥?and all booked through Apple Vacations. On all of these trips we have booked luxury/deluxe accommodations so I have a basis for comparison.After a 2 陆 hour check-in process, we found our room unacceptable. After three calls trying to get through to the front desk, I was told there were no other rooms available. I was told 鈥淵ou can ask for my supervisor or your agent and they will tell you the same thing.鈥?I again explained I was not happy with our room and asked if there were rooms available at different hotels and was told, 鈥淣o. Is that all?鈥?br/>Since we鈥檝e traveled to Punta Cana numerous times, we are accustomed to the 鈥淒ominican minute,鈥?asking a few times for items until the language barrier is broken, the slower pace, and explaining there are three of us in the room and we need additional towels. Most things can be overlooked when traveling in the Caribbean 鈥?some cannot.Many of the problems with the Edenh are due to opening the hotel prematurely:鈥here were wires in our room hanging from outlets wrapped in electrical tape.鈥here was one functioning elevator that required us to walk most of the length of the resort then back again to get to our room on the 4th floor.鈥n entire electrical box pulled from the wall when we removed the plug for the coffee pot (it was repaired twice during our visit).鈥osquito infestation of rooms including blood smears from, I鈥檓 assuming, previous guests.鈥here was a hole in wall on porch where a light will be installed in the future.鈥here was a lack of signage indicating restaurants, or directions to venues.鈥oilet tissue in public areas was left on the back of the commode with no dispenser 鈥?very unsanitary!鈥onstruction soundsSome of the problems with the Edenh are due to lack of organization:鈥n check-in, we received a key and followed a porter to our room. No maps or literature explaining the facility, restaurant times, activities. (When we checked out, I found a photo-copied newsletter on a table while waiting for our bus to the airport.)鈥ecause of the lengthy check-in process we missed our appointed time for orientation with the Apple representative.鈥laying the usual beach chair bingo we 鈥?along with most of the other guests 鈥?set towels out by 7:00 AM for a spot on the beach 鈥?no problem 鈥?everyone does it. One morning, without notification, hotel employees collected all personal items and informed guests searching for their books, bags, sand toys and towels that everything placed on the beach prior to 8:00 AM will be removed. (Being honest, I didn鈥檛 claim to be missing a Rolex watch.)鈥hree days into our stay, we were told reservations were no longer accepted at the a la carte restaurants. It was then necessary to stand in line to either be seated or acquire a beeper for notification when a table was ready. After 8:00 PM, everyone dressed for the a la carte restaurants were eating at the buffet because of the limited seating in the restaurants.Two of the problems with the Edenh that cannot be fixed are:1. Since there are three of us traveling together, this is the main reason I requested a different room. There is a six-by-six opening in the wall between the bathroom and the bedroom. The opening leaves the entire room open to the sights, sounds and smells of their traveling companions. The only people able to use these rooms are married couples. Having my brother-in-law in our room (or anyone with children over 12 years-old) these conditions were very, very uncomfortable. There is also no ventilation in the bath area that really, really compounds the problem. When I requested a different room, I was assured by Guest Service that all rooms have the open wall. Later in the week I found out they do not. We were told this type of room set-up is common in Europe. A man from the UK told us this type of room set-up in common in the United States. 2. Our 鈥淕arden View鈥?room along the left side of the hotel faces a Dominican barrio. There is a five foot wide path and a fence topped with barbed wire that runs the length of the hotel. Directly on the other side of the fence we had a shanty made of corrugated steel, laundry lines for the neighborhood, a parking lot that included bull dozers and dump trucks, fires (either trash or cooking), a congregation area under a tree where men play a domino-type game with a boom box as background music, roosters, goats, and it seems everyone who lives in the area, owns a dog that barks when people walk by.The day before we left for home, my husband talked to a couple from Minnesota who stayed at a different hotel and had left for the airport when they found out their flight was cancelled because of 18 inches of snow. They couldn鈥檛 return to their original hotel so guess where they got a room for the night? Yep. The same Edenh Real Arena that couldn鈥檛 move us to a new room because they were full.We will return to Punta Cana because of the friendly people and the beautiful weather and beaches. We just won't be staying at the Edenh.

<Content>We had a great time! My husband and I stayed at the EdenH from Feb. 3 - 10. We are26 and 27 years-old and this was our first visit to the Dominican Republic.I was an avid reader of the posts and reviews on this website before our departure, so I heard of the many issues guests had had and was ready to expect the worst. Some of the issues they are working out that you have read about seem true, but I guess we got really lucky because we really didn't experiece any of these problems. For those that did, and who didn't remind themselves that they were staying at a brand new resort and paying a discounted price, I can understand their frustrations.We personally did not have trouble getting our room (we had booked just a standard room) and it was ready for us at the 3pm check-in time. It seems people with the most room trouble were those that booked a VIP room.We were on the fourth (top) floor and had a very nice view. We only notice one or two mosquitos in our room the entire 7 day stay and I didn't notice any on the property as they fumigate nightly.The bathroom are very open as everyone says, but my husband and I are very comfortable with each other and since you couldn't really see throught the frosted doors to the toilet and shower, we didn't have any problems. But can totally see why others would.The hotel and the grounds themselves are absolutely beatiful. They are stil putting finishing touches around.There is a large construction (where the casino, etc. will be) that is blocked by a fence, but I wasn't usually near that are and agian, seems the VIP people were probably closer and more affected by this.Gorgeous beach and water, great weather.Food: We personally were pretty happy with the food. The buffet was fast and easy, but my least favorite as far as food goes. The resaurants need to get their act together on seating and reservations, but we thought they all had great food (especially the Hibachi at the Asian restaurant). The pool-side grill does serve pretty much the same thing everyday...but hey, it's simple lunch by the pool!The workers are so nice and hardworking, but some do speak very little english. We didn't really have any problems those when communiciating.The evening entertainment shows are great and fun to watch.All said, we had an awesome time and would go back again. If you are booked in the next couple months, just come expecting a few kinks and understand that you there at a discounted price helps serve their needs to figure out what's working and what's not. Enjoy yourself and relax. It's the Domican Republic!

<Content>Very nice but little unorganized Just got back from the EdenH, we reserved Le Mirage from Air Transat and stayed from February 4th to February the 11th 2008. When we arrived (11h45 a.m.), there was a lot of confusion at the front desk, our room was not ready and they told us that we did not have a room with an ocean view. I told them that my package garantied an ocean view and I had my package desciption print out with me so I showed them Room with Ocean View. Immidiately, they switched us to the V.I.P. check-in and we were upgraded to Le Mirage Concierge Room with a Ocean view plus better amninities, V.I.P.'s private bar with upgraded drinks and private pool, plus a special Lobster dinner in our room and two private massages on the beach. The room was nice, but the fact that there is no wall separating the bathroom from the bedroom is a bit disturbing. If the person you are with uses the bathroom at night or eary in the morning while you are still sleeping; it will wake you up for sure. I heard that they are working on a solution and are going to put up some shutters or something to give more privacy to the bathroom. The beach is very nice but you have to get up at 7 a.m. to put a towel on a chair to reserve a spot for the day. The water sports are very well organised and there is a lot to do.Over all, they really try to please you the best they can. Since it is a new Resort, they are a bit unorganised which is very understandable but you can see the Management everywhere trying to improve everything (animation, restaurants, service) they othen ask your opinion on the service and the food. They have their eye on everything and want to make sure that everybody has a good time.

<Content>We enjoyed our stay!!! Okay, I have never written a review, but since I read so many of them before I came, I thought it was only fair to give my 2 cents worth. First of all, you can never make everyone happy. My opinion is that people on this website our being far too critical of the resort. You are in paradise people!!! And on vacation, so act like it. Also, we all knew this was a brand new resort, and to expect everything would be perfect is just not realistic. My husband and I travel alot, and this was our 3rd trip to Punta Cana. We have stayed at Secrets and the Iberostar before. We preferred the Edenh to both prior places. Secrets and Iberostar are extremely expensive, and we got the Edenh for $1500 to $2000 less and also took our 3 year old son. The food at the restaurants was the best we have ever had at any All inclusive property. Breakfast was also awesome, however we were not too fond of lunch, it just got very old and boring after 2-3 days, but we managed. The drinks were good, but bar service was a little slow. People are correct that the beach chair and towel thing is a problem, but our Apple rep said if you only see towels and no personal belongings, go ahead and take the chairs. Alot of people are complaining about the room design as well. I love it. This is the same set up at Secrets - it is supposed to be an open atmosphere for couples - get comfortable with your families people! We had our 3 year old, so it was no problem, however I can see if you were with teenagers, privacy might be an issue. The thing we were most upset about was the difference in green and pink wrist bands. Before we went, we were not aware that there was a VIP option and did not know how much it cost, therefore we got the bare bones - no top shelf liquer, 1st floor room looking out to the workers apts, etc. If we would have known about this, we would have definitely upgraded. The higher up rooms and nicer views would have been worth the money. Normally we are never in our room except to sleep, however we had to come back for naps everyday for our 3 year old. Overall, I would recommend this resort but remember we got a really good price. If you are paying as much as a resort that has been established for a year or more, I would pick the latter. However it was nice to have things brand new!!! My advice is to just go knowing they are new and are still working out their kinks - they are working - everyday you will see something new. And remember, you are on vacation in the beautiful DR, not in the freezing cold of the US or Canada!!!

<Content>Expectations.... Edenh Real Arena was my first Resort experience in Punta Cana. I loved it, but it's probably because I had nothing to compare it to. All the reviews I read are correct, but they are also coming from people that have not gotten what they expected. I was expecting a nice relaxing time with my family, where I didn't have to worry about anything, besides which swimsuit to wear or what to eat. I got exactly that! The beach is great, even though it almost impossible to find a bad, but it didn't bother me at all- tere are ways around that...The food was great, and the most important- the staff. They were amazing- extremely nice and helpfull. the only time when they couldn't help was when they didn't understand what Iwas trying to say. But when you come to a spanish speaking country, you can't expect everyone to speak french or german. I think this resourt would be perfect for middle-age couples or families of different ages. It would be perfect for just relaxing and doing nothing. There was a lot of time not filled with activities where we were just chilling at the bar, talking or getting a tan at the beach. If you are looking for a fun place where you will have no time to relax, then this resort is not for you. If you like to relax, do nothing and enjoy a lounge bar scene, then this resort is perfect for you. As far as all the unfinished things, I wouldn't complain. Those people that said this resort is not ready, well, that's why the price is still low. After everything will be complete and all the negatives will be taken care of, the price for this resort will also change. If you pay a price of a 3 star resort for a 5 star resort, don't expect a 6 star service. But for everyone who is considering this resort for their next vacation- just remember, it depends on what you are expacting from your vacation. I loved this resourt and I know it will get a lot better with time.

<Content>A really disappointing week We stayed at the EdenH from January 18 to 25. We expected some minor glitches because it is a new hotel, but we didn't expect to spend so much time in the lobby fighting for what we had paid for. We knew several things would not be open when we went, but did not know we would be in the middle of sawing and pounding for a week. The construction was not minor the week we were there.The problems:Room: We had paid for VIP,but were given a room at the back of the resort. We finally were moved after spending 2 days in the lobby. We then were given a room overlooking a work site with construction next door. The hallways were not lit at night.There were a lot of mosquitoes on the ground level room. Room Service: You had to call several times to get your room service to actually come.Lobster Dinner in Suite: The meal did not come at all, even though we spent an hour trying to order it.VIP Pool: Construction right next to both VIP pools. It was noisy. They didn't even play music to drown out the sawing and hammeringVIP package: We didn't get the rum, fruit basket, robes or slippers that were included in our package.Bracelets: We were given the wrong bracelets and did not get the correct ones until the second last day, even though we tried to explain that we had the wrong ones.Entertainment: It didn't start til almost 10pm and it was too late for mostLobby Service: We couldn't get anyone to actually listen to us and do anything about our issues. They just wrote down our issue and ran away. Not once did anyone get back to us.The Good:Beautiful BeachThe grounds will be lovelyBuffet had a great selectionRamone at the VIP bar was fantastic!!! I think that the resort will be wonderful once they sort out the overbooking and they figure out what they are doing, but they were not ready for customers the week that we were there. It was a very frustrating week. A real disappointment. I was glad to leave.

<Content>will be a 5 star We stayed at Edenh 1-13-1-20-08 and knew it was not going to be perfect. We have stayed at 5 and 6 stars in Mexico and our first time to DR. I was not dissapointed I knew what I was getting into by booking a new place. If you can't figure that out then you need to go somewhere else.The resoort:;It was great! The people friendly as you can ever ask for. The grounds , just getting finished, but pretty. Room:Our room had a great view. People complaining the Jacuzzie on the patio not private. Well If the people across the resort at the other buildings can see us in a tub, GOOD for them. I can understand the people that had them on the bottem floor, not sure what that was all about. The maid survice a little off, but funny. You have t o understand they are not American. Everyone says they need to learn English. Guess What? They don't need to learn English YOU need to learn Spanish!!!. I can't speak much Spanish, but I took a cheat sheet, It help alot.If I go to another country I don't think I would expect them to learn my language, I think we should learn theirs. We had to laugh because we would leave notes for water and get candy bars, but we did laugh. Thats what you have to do and make the best of it. Food:It was OK, I have to say a little off when I was there, but have been reading more good things about that on TA. We had VIP and did not have options of Lobster dinner in our room, but have just read other people did. Like I am trying to say alot of changes comming with opening.Bars:I am a pretty simple person as drinks go, I usually only drink beer, and I have to say anyone that drinks American beer, the beer is good. Mixed drinks a little off. The bartenders the BEST!! Carlos One and Carlos Two you can't beat them. Danny good also. They were all good . When we got to the resort It was not to busy and then it got real busy. People where B-------, Because they had to wait for a drink.. Do people need a drink that bad they can't wait, when someone is clearly busy! I like to drink as much as the next, but I work with the public and know how stupid people can be. You have all day to drink, Chill out.!! Beach:Great I think better than Mexico, I did not likre the fact I could't find any shells. I like walking the beach and getting shells. This was not the end of the world, just something I like to do. What I did like is the waves where not has strong as Mexico, you could walk the beach and not get knocked over.Overall go have a good time and just remember your on vacation and everyting will work out. I would of been happy sleeping on a chair on the beach. That is how pretty this place is!Hi to Seri and Darrin, Bob, and all the Hamel, Alhambra and Staunton Crew. We had a GREAT TIME!!!

<Content>Don't bother with the EdenH Real Resort As others have said, this resort just isn't worth it. I have never bothered to write a review before and although I read all of them on this site before any of my vacations, I assume that there are just some beyond picky people in this world. Such is not the case with respect to the EdenH and the negative postings you are reading here. It is all true... this resort is just not worth the trip. This was our third visit to Punta Cana, and there are far better resorts than this one in the DR. We were there from Feb. 2 - Feb. 9 and arrived with open minds, knowing full well that it is a brand new resort. We expected glitches but it was downright ridiculous at times. Everything that others have said is the absolute truth... repetitive food... booking problems... battles over chairs... rules changing daily... poor service in some areas... construction noise... sinks falling out... toilets not working... shoddy workmanship everywhere... it's ALL true. Mosquitoes are really the least of the problems here. It has no business being open right now and even when it is complete, I just don't see how it can rate itself a 5* resort. There's just nothing that makes it distinguishable and makes you go wow, and even with a casino and a coffee shop, I just don't see the wow factor at all.The poor front line staff... they are taking the brunt of all of this so when you do have to complain (and you will, no matter how easy going you think you can be), be nice to them. None of these problems are their fault and they are frustrated with it all as well. When people write glowing reviews about this place I can only assume they were still giddy with the fondness of having been on vacation. And none of us likes to admit that we made a mistake and paid hard-earned money to stay at a place that caused stress rather than alleviated it. But the glowing reviews are few and I can't suggest enough that you take them with a grain of salt. All this being said, if you are already booked at this resort, or insist that all this negativity is just a pile of picky whiners and you want to book anyway, do yourself the favor and at least upgrade to the Club Service or Concierge Service (different names for different tour operators). You do get the better rooms (walls around the bathroom area and better view), and the premium liquor goes a long way in getting you through your week! Between the premium liquor and the absolutely fabulous people we were privileged enough to have met around the pool, we had a good week. But we won't ever be back at the EdenH again.

<Content>Far from paradise We arrived here on Jan 28 for 12 days. While the beach and pools were beautiful, you were lucky if you could find a chair at either place. The chair situation became quite stressful. I witnessed many fights over chairs which made my vacation less than relaxing. In fact, management decided to stop all reserving of chairs during our 2nd last day so they had security go around removing peoples' things. Not knowing this had happened people were going out and taking a chair and then, understandably, being accused by others of having removed their articles. Management did not bother to put up a sign or warn anyone. We met some very nice but distraught people this way. This resort was not ready to open when we arrived. I had to contact the general manager with my room issues (things not working or completed) and he seemed less than interested. He promised me that when I came down to the front desk the next day his supervisor would take care of things for me and assured me that the supervisor would be expecting me. Guess what? The supervisor was not informed about anything. I felt very bad for him because he was taking alot of flack from some VERY disgruntled guests. I felt the front line staff were put in a very bad position by the top level management who decided to open the resort prematurely and not make themselves available when things went wrong. The animation team, the bartenders at the beach grill and GG, the pool waitress, were great. They were the best PR we witnessed for this resort. The resort is beautiful but shows signs of poor workmanship and faulty installations. A sink literally fell to the ground and cracked in the snack bar ladies' bathroom and was left there for at least two days and then I stopped counting. Locks on doors didn't work and hence people were getting late night visitors. This resort, in my opinion, is very poorly managed. Anything that is successful at this resort is a result of the hard work of the frontline staff such as Kelvyn and the rest of the animation team and Jose and Danny at the beach grill bar who were working hard to keep guests happy. The food was good but repetitive and we enjoyed the company of all the people we met there. Those who go in the future will more than likely have a better experience as far as the completeness of the rooms is concerned. But beaware of the lack of privacy when using the toilet. The glass and marble act as an echo chamber and the glass door may not close properly. Housekeeping did a great job but you may have to remind them to replenish things like soap, shampoo or facecloths. They play techno music in the Tantra bar at night even though I really went there for the Dominican music. I had great dance lessons by the beach grill during the day but nowhere to practice my dance steps at night. They did play Dominican music for about 45 minutes there one night and that was the only time I saw the place hopping. That was a big disappointment for me in addition to the fact that the bartenders wouldn't serve us anything outside of the local stuff because they claimed it was not included (although it was). In short we enjoyed ourselves but I was left wishing I had booked another resort for the same amount money (not all of us got great deals).

<Content>Lovely... Returned on Jan. 25th. 'Had a wonderful time....The beach is one of the best!Can walk for miles each way. Food is excellent...Reservation system needs some work, but the buffet is Very good. Rooms looking over the pools are best, but, of course only half of the rooms are situated that way. They were doing A LOT of work when we were there....Some people were complaining about the view and/or their rooms....then they would say what a cheap deal they got on their vacation, so I don't know what they were expecting.... We got to meet Punta Cana Mike and he was very helpful to many people....The bathroom set up is a little different, the beds and linens are wonderful. I think they need a towel system because some people were taking lots of towels and leaving them all over the place which makes the chairs look semi-occupied which makes people mad!I would go back here in a heartbeat!

<Content>Zero service We stayed in EdenH from Feb-4 2008 till Feb-8 2008. First I want to mention that beach, whether, see - all God created things was awesome - better than in Cancun. All this was ruined by terrible service in EdenH Real arena. In the beginning I spent more than 2 hours in Reception to get my room ready. Staff does not speak English. The very first day reported AC and TV problem, but nobody showed up till I left. No matter if you leave do not disturb sign, staff may enter room day or night ( yes, our friends had visitors at 4:00AM! ) Not enough recliners at the pools and beaches, so have to run there early to reserve them for you. Otherwise you done for a day. No reservations in restaurant, so you need to get in the line early if you want to get a table9 IIf you are lucky). Food in Japanese restaurant was good, buffet is tolerable, but it was uneatable in French, and American restaurants. I did not bother to check Italian restaurant. SPA, bowling, Casino was not finished yetMost bizarre room design: Toilet and shower rooms had semitransparent doors facing the room, so there is no privacy while you are using the bathroom. About our travel agency apple vacation: They knew that the hotel was not finished, but they sold us the tickets, Representatives gave us misleading information about toursOverall: I would definetly go back to Punta Cana, but never to EdenH Real Arena!

<Content>Great Time at EdenH What a fun week! We went with 4 other couples, no kids. The room was not ready when we arrived at 12 noon but it was no big deal. We changed into our swimsuits and went to the pool for the afternoon. The weather was beautiful and had a great time. We got into our rooms late afternoon.Our room was wonderful. We had a room facing the pool and ocean. Loved the bathtub with the jets. Our friends wound up with rooms facing the outer sides of the hotel and they did have mosquito problems. We had none.The buffet was excellent the first night. We had wonderful lobster tails. The Italian restaurant wasn't that good. The Hibachi restaurant was great. The buffet after was average. Breakfast was very good. Made to order omelets made it! We had lunch by the pool at the buffet everyday. It was average. The pizza, when it was cooked, was good. Had a few undercooked pieces which we did not eat. Did the cataraman one day. Lots of fun but didn't realize you could only take it out once a day while your there. The water trampoline was a hit with our group.Overall, we had a great time. If you are really picky, choose somewhere else. If you have the attitude where happiness is a choice, it's a great place! We enjoyed our stay. Alexis, the pool bar bartender was alot of fun. The entertainment at night was very good. Go to the Tantra bar at night for some great disco!

<Content>Great Garden of Eden Just returned from this resort. It is a terrific place--great room, food, friendly staff, wireless innernet. The EdenH is a newly opened resort and does have a few problems to iron out. But the problems can be found at any resort (keep in mind that this place has been open for only about 1-1.5 months while the others have been open for years). The staff are willing to go the extra mile to make tourists happy. How many resorts have lobster and spine shrimp on their buffet nearly every lunch and dinner. The food was absolutely delicious and I am a very picky eater! Yes, there are mosquitos, if they are bothersome, just ask for a can of bug spray. No pushy timeshare people, seaweed, or vendors on the beach in front of the resort. If you do want to shop, a few flea market type stores are within 1/2 mile in both directions. The resort held a truly fun Super Bowl Party. They filled the center courtyard fountains with beer and ice, had hot dogs, chicken nuggets, soda, etc to eat and drink; set up a huge screen (about 6-8 ft); staff personnel dressed as refs who blew whistles every time the crowd reacted to a play; gave out glow braclets; and the best -- it was held out under the stars!! Cannot say enough good about this place.

<Content>Thank You EdenH! My husband and I stayed at this beautiful new resort Jan. 20 through the 27. We had an excellent time! Yes, they are still under construction, and yes, there are some things they are still working out, but overall we were extremely impressed.We have travelled extensively throughout the Carribbean and Mexico (usually two to three trips each year), and would rate this resort an easy 4.5*, with the potential to become a 5.5*. We stayed in one of their deluxe rooms, which was in the construction zone.This was not an issue with us because firstly, the workers didn't start making noise until 9 a.m. at the earliest, and secondly, we don't leave our Canadian winter to spend our tropical vacation inside our hotel room. This is not to say that our room was not beautiful -- it had the most comfortable kingsized bed we have had at any resort, a double jacuzzi, a plasma tv, and a huge patio.We have seen a few reviews complaining about the service, from the front desk on. We only had wonderful service, from everyone! Maybe we were exceptionally lucky, or maybe we realized that as guests in a Spanish speaking country, we should not expect everyone to immediately understand our every English-spoken request. In all of our travels, we have always found a smile, and a little patience go a long way. We ate at all of the restaurants, and found the food very good, and sometimes exceptionally good (the Hibaci in particular). Their evening shows were way above average for an all-inclusive. The jazz night in particular was my favorite! I would recommend this resort to anyone who goes on vacation looking for a beautiful beach, lovely accomodations, and warm, friendly people. If you expect everything to always be perfect, perhaps you should stay home. The ONLY thing we were disappointed with during our stay at the EdenH was the obnoxious guests who did nothing but complain -- even as they were served their frosty tropical cocktails in the warm Dominican sun!Thank you again to all of the staff at the Edenh Real Arena for a wonderful holiday!

<Content>Loved Every Minute We Were There We just came back from this resort and we both said what a wonderful time we had. We knew ahead of time that is was brand new and not all of the facilities would be open and some of the work was not done and that workmen would be there finishing things. I can truly say that is was a wonderful resort and when completely operational it will be top notch. The staff went out of their way to make you feel welcome and their favourite words where no Problem and it wasn't. They sure work hard for their money. The beach area is just gorgeous with white sand, lots of Cabanas and very nice wicker style chairs to lay on for sunning. The pool areas are large and again lots of lounge chairs and lovely shade areas as well.There are the chair hoggers, but I think the hotel is aware of this and they will implement some sort of system soon.. The beach restaurant offered really nice food at lunch time and had a very nice area to sit in while you ate or you could take it back to your sitting area. We chose the consierge package which afforded us our own private pool and bar area. Our Bar men Carlos and Carlito were just so accommodating. The package gives other perks as well such as check in service, butler service, which we didn't use and few other things. The check in area offers friendly staff as well. Our Bellman Radhemas, was just one big smile all the time and always asking are you happy. Lovely snacks drinks and internet. (concierge area I am talking about) The Lobby its self is very nice as well and the staff there is just as friendly . We were on the 4th floor with an awesome view of the ocean and the pool and garden areas.. I found the food in the Buffet good and lots of it . I like breakfast the best, so when a hotel serves good crispy bacon I am happy. The theme restaurants were okay, but the best of the bunch was the Japanese. It was really very good. (The Show Cooking) and the American ranked 2nd. Anyway you won't starve or go thirsty. By the way, there really is a Punta Cana Mike. He is very nice and very approachable. In fact that is what he wants. He is the eyes and ears of the Hotel and he wants to hear what makes us happy or sad, and he will tell you if you are being unreasonable, or what the reason is for what ever... All in all we had a great time and didn't worry too much about this or that as we are on vacation in a beautiful country whose only white stuff is sand. so enjoy - joyce and sten..

<Content>A great resort My husband and I just returned from the Edenh Real Arena on Sunday. We loved the resort. This resort has only been open a month and yes, they are still working out some issues, but we did not have anything to complain about. We knew that it was new and we expected some gliches. You do need to make dinner reservations and that was our biggest issue, we had to wait in an hr. long line in the morning to get a reservation for dinner. By the end of our stay, the lines were very short, so they are still making adjustments and improving. They do let you make reservations for 7 nights if you want, unlike other all inclusives that limit you to 4 nights with a 7 night stay. The food was good at all the restaurants. We had a few mosquitoes in our room, (the ceiling fan keeps them away) but they never bothered us in the evenings outside at the entertainment. I don't recommend the snorkling tour that the resort offers for $25.00. We only saw 2 kinds of fish and you only go out in front of the resort a ways. We enjoyed all the other water sports that they offered. The crew is very nice and wait on you constantly. We had a great week and the weather was beautiful.

<Content>70 yr young Mom's great 2 week vacation. Mom returned on Feb.4th from Edenh after a glorious 2 week's. She travel's by herself,I arrange the location for her.She has traveled on 9 occasion's to the Carribbean,this the 3rd time to Punta Cana. I alway's research the resort's thoroughly.I take all aspect's into consideration,and I will make contact by phone to the perspective resort,and speak to the major player's there,explain my concern's,want's and need's for Mom,and decide which resort will have the pleasure of guesting Mom..I found out about Edenh at the beginning of Jan08,by researching on Tripadvisor,an invaluable tool for all or travel's!There was a fellow by the name of Mike Bryant whom many had contacted regarding Edenh,he was at the resort,with actual update's as to the going's on there,live! I contacted Mike,he was quick to respond to my querrie's,alway's took the time,even though he was very busy,I was sure.I decided Edenh would be Mom's home for 2 week's.And according to Mom, my decision could have not been better!I booked a Mirage concierge room,the top room grade available from Toronto through Air Transat..Flight went well from Toronto,25 minute ride from the airport to the Edenh. Upon arrival to the front desk,she was asked her name,given a bracelet, then a moment later Mike Bryant showed up to welcome her personally to the Edenh,he asked Mom if he could have a picture with her to email me for proof of her arrival! He had mentioned to me in communication with him that he would try to be there to welcome her,what a man of his word!From the time of Mom's arrival in the hotel to her standing on her porch beside her Jacuzzi overlooking the ocean was under 10 min's.Her room was outstanding.She ate at all the restaurant's,the buffet.Quality was very good,the staff could not do enough for her!She had NO ISSUE with bug's,NO ISSUE with construction,even though it was going on around,her location was awesome!The Maid Service,Room Food service,Service's throughout the Edenh were OUTSTANDING!We,Mom have been in the food service bussiness' all our live's.We,she remember's the way we she liked to be treated,give courtesy, in return to get some back,Yes she brought many gift's,U.S. dollar's to tip,but she is of mind that if you can spend $3,000 dollar's for 2 week's,you can afford to spend another $200 dollars cash,and $100-$200 on gift's.That's my Mom!There was a language barrier sometime's,but universal smile's,hand motioning ,facial expression's said it all.You are visiting a country were English is NOT the first language.Deal with it,she does!Once everything grow's in,mature's over the next year ,this will be a spectacular resortOf all her trip's south,this was, as she told me THE PLACE.Yes there were some shortcoming's,but no big issue's.We will be forever gratefull to Mike Bryant,Tanya,Whyte,for alway's being there,any question's,any time! And ALL THE REST OF THE STAFF at Edenh,for making my Mom feel like FAMILY.In closing I asked her,the big question Mom would you go again to EDENh?Son,I can't wait to go again next year!Mom has never said that before,I made the best choice! It brought a Big smile to my face!Regard's,A very happy mamasboy

<Content>The front desk staff was not at all helpful . We have just returned from a week at Edenh Real Arena.Check-in : The front desk staff was not at all helpful and seemed very indifferent. The management is absolutely terrible and don鈥檛 expect them to do anything if something goes wrong.  The rooms are above average. Each has a jacuzzi tub wich was nice  plazma TV and balcony. NO SMELL  NO BUGS.There is room service and there is a food menu in your room.The food at this hotel was excellent. The main dinner buffet offered a great variety. The beach was Gorgeous. We never had trouble finding a chair in sun or shade and the servers were generally available for beach service. .Nightly entertainment was pretty good each night. Overall, a great vacation!!

<Content>Very Nice Vacation My husband and I stayed at the Edenh from Jan 26 through Feb 2. Overall, we had a very nice time here. Upon arriving at the resort, we were greated with Chamagne/OJ in the lobby as we checked in. Check in was very fast. The gentelman checking us in liked my husband's hat...We told him we would give it to him if he gave us a good room...Well, we got to our room and it was a Paradise Club room. So he did upgrade our room! We had a tub outside which we were very excited about, however, we were on the 1st floor. So...there was a secrity gaurd walking past all day/night and during the day/early eveing, workers were walking by. At first this bothered us b/c we were unable to enjoy our outside tub, but then we just built a little baracade with the patio chairs, table and spare beach towels to create some privacy. This worked great and we enjoyed the tub every evening we were there! Our room was very nice. I thought it was quite large for 2 people so we had plenty of room. We did have some mosquitos each day after returning from the beach, but nothing to complain about...we were in the Caribbean for goodness sakes! We would just kill them when we saw them and that was that. I got maybe 5-10 throughout the whole week....Resturants: We did have an issue with dinner reservations when we first arrived...I will not go into small details because the situation was rectified and by mid week, they had the whole reservation thing under control. We were frustrated when our issue happened, but the rest of the week, everything was fine...I think they have it figured out now! We are at the Japanese Rest. 2 times and had a wonderful experience both times. The food was wonderful!!!!! We ate at the Romantic French and the Italian, both one time, and both were very good as well. The buffet was also very good with a lot to choose from. We ate by the beach everyday for lunch and had wonderful food, chicken, pizza, lamb, etc...We had NO complaints about the food at all. It was all very good in our opinion. Each evening we went to the Tantra Bar and had a good time. If you like to dance or just chill, this is a great place, as you can do both...This roof-top bar is open till 3am so its nice to go after dinner...we really enjoyed it here. The resort overall is very nice. Obviously they are still working on it, painting, planting plants, mulching, etc...We saw a lot of progress as the week went on....They are working very hard to get everything up and running. Obviously the plants/flowers won't be fully grown in for some time and it will be beautiful when it is. It already looks nice and its just small baby plants everywhere....The fountains are very nice too although they were having problems with them while we were there. They worked on them all week so we only got to see them running a few times...Should be fixed soon I would think. Some pointers: When we were for breakfast and dinner at the buffett, would would often not be able to find a clean, set table....All you have to do is ask a staff member and they will get it ready for you, no big deal. The staff is very nice and willing to help whenever they can. Language can sometimes be a barrier if you don't speak spanis....we know little spanish and had little to no problems so in my opinion, I don't think its that big of an issue. I know some people complained about having to save chairs at the beach and the pool...this is true, you must get up early and go out to claim chairs...I have been to several resorts that are like this so again, don't think its a big deal. I would suggest putting some sort of personal belonging on the chairs in addition to the towels....We saw several people throw towels on the ground and take chairs that were already claimed because there were only towels on them....We had this happen to us in the beach....Maybe lay a book, shoes or something like that at your towel. One complaint...our shuttle to leave the resort left on Sat. at 6:00pm so we had all day to enjoy the beach/pool. The day before, Friday, I went to the front desk and asked about where we could shower before our shuttle came. The girl told me to just come to the front desk when we were ready to shower, they would give us a room key and we could go shower. So on Saturday afternoon we did just this, however, when we got to the front desk, we were taken to a a community type shower area. There were to seperate areas, for men and women...There were 2 rooms/showers in the women's room so you did have privacy. But there was NO hot water at all and it smelled like sewage....The whole experince was not the greatest but it was nice to get a shower. My husband went to use the mens shower and said that the drain wasn't working so there was 3 inches of water just sitting from previous showers. The men had no hot water either. So again, thankful that I got to shower but the experience was not the greatest and not what I was expecting....Just a heads up!Overall, we had a great time. I would be lying if I said everything was perfect, but we didn't expect it to be. There were issues here and there but nothing that ruined our vacation or anything like that. We had a very nice time and a very nice resort. I think you make your own vacation...if you choose to let little things bother you and ruin a weeks vacation, thats your fault....We chose to laugh at the kinks and have a blast. This resort will only get better and better in my opinion as time goes on. If you have any specific questions, I would be happy to answer them, just send me a message! Hope this helps and enjoy your vacation!

<Content>Not a relaxing vacation We stayed at the Eden H the week of Jan19-Jan26 and although the resort will be beautiful in time, it is far from organized efficient or well run. Upon arrival, there were innsuficient staff on check-in, there was zero management staff on hand yet the front desk staff continuously disapeared to speak to a manager that was non-exsistent. If you get fed the line come back tomorrow or come back in 10 minutes, do not expect any action or answers upon your return. The staff are poorly trained (not to paint ALL staff with the same brush, we did find a FEW exceptional hard working staff that tried to please as best they could....Valentin the bell boy, Carlos and Carlitos at the private pool bar), they do not have 5 star etiquette and are lacking basic english language skills. Mid week, the first spanish manager showed up and was spoken to directly in regards to the problems we had in the first 3 days of our vacation. He explained that it was his duty to ensure that he and the hotel made up for our continuous problems, guaranteed we would be satisfied by the end of our vacation and then did absolutely NOTHING!!Rooms were not ready, construction noise continuous, lobster dinner promised never showed up, wrong coloured braclettes given, which means they tried to bill us for premium drinks, booked ocean view room, but ended up with a view of local slum-like residences. We were eventually moved to another room, but not the room we paid for.This trip was sold online by Air Transat and should have never been offered to the paying public. Our Transat rep was of no help to us at all and more concered about selling over-priced off resort excursions.Now for the good...being a new resort, everything is fresh and clean, sheets are crisp and white, rooms nicely decorated with a retro flare. All pools are nicely laid out, well maintained and refreshingly cool. Lounge chairs were plentiful and shaded areas were available. Food at the buffet was quite good although some dishes were cold. The Italian and American a la carte restaurants were very good. In time the trees and native plantings will mature and look beautiful. Gym and casino were not available at the time of our vacation.We are not first time travelers to a 5 star resort or to the Dominican, in time and with great improvement in customer service and language skills this resort should live up to a Dominican 5 star rating.

For all you people out there that are difficult, picky, want a hastle free vacation,not patient, you know who you are DON'T BOOK edenh real not yet anyway, they need another 3-6 months min. to get there act together because right now they are so dissorganized it is unbelievable, there is stil some constructions going on mostly in the rooms, so yes we did hear alot of hammering anyway here is the play by play!!check in..... any groups of 6 or more your check in will be slow, ours was very slow the staff try really hard but they need more practice, alot of people got rooms that was still occupied, very frustrating, communication wasn't a big problem they speek english pretty well, on the other hand check out very fast!!!ROOMS.....very nice and big IF EVERYTHING IS WORKING, there are 2 buildings 1and 2, 3 is still under construction so forget about 3, building one you want even number rooms because you are facing the pool and the garden odd numbers you have a view of well nothing much a parking lot, building #2 you want odd number rooms because again you are facing the pool and the garden and even # rooms well your view is palm trees at best! concerning hot water some people had some and some people did not after 8pm, we were in building #2 on the fourth floor and our water was ok !FOOD..... the a la carte restaurants were excellent, the first week we were there no reservations necessary so that = to long waits ranging from 10min to 45min the second week you had to reserve in the morning at the entrance of the buffet, much better you had 2 sittings 6.30 and 8.30 pm still with reservations there were some delays... the best for us in order were the Asian, The American, the Romantic and followed by the Italian, all 4 of them were excellent for us no complaints for the food, now for the buffet it was pretty much the same thing with a little twist each night, the food was ok but on the second week we did notice lobsters every other night so that was good for us cause we love seafood, nobody that we knew or heard about got sick so food wise your good!!BEACH.... we did not have the cleanest beach but on the other hand we did not have the dirtyest beach either so it was pretty clean, concerning the seaweed they are every where we walked every day 2km each way and there were seaweeds every where the questions was if they picked up every morning, now for the chairs there is a shortage so by 9am you don't got one well too bad its too late, the water was, clean not too wavy!!POOL....for the chairs after 8am forget about it no chairs left, there is a shortage at the pool also, all 5 pools were clean, the children played mostly at the main pool and the kiddy pool the rest were mostly adults.Mosquitos yes there are plenty so come prepared, there not at the beach nor at the pool mostly in the halls and in your rooms, they do fumagate but its useless why i will tell you, when you go through the main gates look at your right and your left, on the right big swamp and on your left small swamp so that = to alot of mosquitoes cause its a breading ground for them!! after they clean your room before you go to sleep make sure you kill those bugs or else you will be the buffet!!This hotel during our stay was mostly older couples and families, well that explains why there were no more chairs by 8am, single people stay away unless you really want to relax, or else there is always the Tanhtra bar thats as close youll get to a disco.Bars... the main lobby bar was the best for the drinks, the one at the beach service was very slow and mostly local drinks, lobby had premium drinks so did Tanhtra bar.Snack bar at the beach was good , mostly fries, pizza, burgers, and chicken with a small salad bar and deserts we never ate at the buffet at noon so sorry no input on that!You don't need to bring an umbrella because its covered pretty much everywhere which was very convenient.Staff very very friendly and nice most of the them spoke english very well, 95% of them were super, they did what they could at their bestLook this hotel has the potential to become a 5**** hotel but right now they are not ready, i personnaly think they opened to fast they should of waited another month or so but that is there choice, alot of rooms are not finished so there is alot of overbooking going on right now, we know alot of people were sent to other resorts because edenh was full, if you booked the fancy vip rooms overlooking the ocean well you are in for a surprise because they are not ready yet as of the 3rd of feb. and it looks like at least another week or so before they will be ready!

<Content>Not quite ready My husband and I recently returned from a week's stay at the Edenh Real. I am writing this review feeling very qualified because this made our 9th trip to the DR. We have stayed previously at Iberostars and Rio Bamboo, Natura Park and Princess Caribe. Also we stayed last year at the Bahia Principe.  this is going to be a very nice resort. Very much at least a 5 apple, maybe golden even.  not yet. They have much to do to get there. Comparing it to our other experiences, we found it to be very large....nice...... spread out.........nice, beach....... nice........ lack of seaweed.....nice......... rooms.........nice...... . The main thing that we struggled with was communication with the desk people at the lobby, when you wanted to ask a question... the people working at this resort lacked English skills more than any other resort we have been to. We worked through that. The specialty rest. were trying to be great, but not that great. At two different ones, they forgot our soup, and at the end asked us for coffee with our desserts and never brought it. I think that this will get worked out eventually, when they all get used to working there.  All of the reviews that talk about bugs........ i would like to ask them WHERE WERE THEY???? they had flies.......small flies...... ( but, hey your're in the tropics) we saw a few tiny tiny ants one day on our balcony,... i see them at my house...... and that was IT NO BUGS for us the entire week. Not one time did i have a bite on me, and believe me...........bugs LOVE ME ... the walks were pretty, getting you around, and the circus show in the courtyard on Monday was the best show i have seen at any of the places that we stayed. The lobby was pretty and AIR CONDITIONED. i have never seen that down there at a resort, and also the buffet was with AIR.... that is not seen anywhere either. that was nice.  ROOM service was good, and free, if you follow the sheet of paper that they give you to order from, there are no surprises... and on time.  they are pleasant to try to help you if you have a problem IF you can make them understand. Take a Spanish book with you if you go to this resort.  the buffet food was OK i have had better, but it was good. great pasta.....and meats......... i was not impressed with potatoes on the buffet any night.... even the mashed...... they need to improve that. I love potatoes. At lunch one day at the lunch place at the beach....... they had roasted baby pigs. MY husband was crazy with this, and he said that they were delicious!! i say they, because he ate that day three times and each time it was a different little pig. He and i thought that was very special for lunch... even the heads were still on them. Back home, that would cost a bundle......... the ice cream machine was to die for. Better than homeaid. ( it broke our last day :( :( ) beach towels need to be given out with cards as people take advantage of them not keeping track and ask for way too many......leaving them short . need more beach chairs, but workers are more than happy to 'carry' you down a chair from the pool. that was nice.... we were very upset of the misleading that we had about the casino . you can't get a straight answer from anyone down there as to when it is opening. They DO provide a shuttle to this one casino........small and mean LOL ... but sometimes this shuttle does not bother to show up. Happened to us 3 times, and we had to end up getting a taxi and paying. I hated our view off our balcony, but they said because of overbooking that they could not change our room. NO ONE should have to pay for a week and look at the scene that we had to look at. SLUM AREA with locals playing / slapping dominoes all night. other than that , our room was nice...although i don't think that it is very smart to put those large jacuzzi tubs in all rooms ( wastes water ) and the openness to the bed area is bad if you would have others in the room that might care if you see them bathe.  the TV was great...... 100 chanels, and they DO have chanel stations that tell you what is on.  I would say that i about a year, this will be a great place to go....... i was not sad about being at this place......... one more thing that i would like to mention. Out of ALL of the places that we have stayed ........ this beach........ in front of the Edenh resort...... had the MOST going on in the waters...Parasailing sometimes 4 at a time, speedboats.... catamarins.... the trampoline.... just a whole lot of action to watch which made it very exciting. beautiful. i have not put my pictures on the computer yet, but when i do if anyone would like to e-mail me for some, feel free. also , if you would like to ask me any questions.... e-mail me at Corkihp@aol.com. i would love to answer anything that you might be concerned about.. i feel that i am a good judge because of how many times i have been to Punta Cana...... we are a couple in our early 50's.

<Content>The Garden of Eden(h)......not yet. Just returned from the Edenh Real property in Punta Cana. The reason we booked was because the price was much reduced due to the fact that the resort is so new. It only opened the first week of 2008. Paid $880 pp for 5-nite stay. Probably a bit higher after it's open for a while. It's advertised as a 5-apple (Apple Vacations rating system) and it might be that next year, but it's not there yet. But as I explained, we knew that going in. So here is my review. Arrived on Sunday, Jan 27 around 2pm. Check-in went smoothly (10min). We did get the impression though, that maybe the investors put the pressure on to open the resort before it was really ready. Room was very nice except for the fact the you can look directly into the bathroom from the bedroom. Not sure who came up with that design. I think all the rooms are like that except the deluxe rooms if you have that package. I thought that while the materials used to construct the resort, the marble, the tile, the stone, etc was top quality, the workmanship was a bit sloppy. But I have an eye for that so I noticed it while someone else might not. Many mosquitos in the room. You can see the evidence of guests swatting them onto the walls. And remember, the resort has only been open 3-4 weeks. Bring bug spray along or ask for it from housekeeping or the front desk. It may be just a temporary thing. Nice flat screen TV in the room but no channel guide. Phones are not marked on who to call where. Just dial 0 I guess. Patio doors have no screens so you can't leave it open to get fresh air without letting the bugs in. Also, it was quite noisy when guests walked by on the way to their rooms. However, soundproofing between rooms was fine.  Landscaping is going on all the time. Every day something new is being put in. Might be 2-3 months before all is complete. All pools are open and beautiful. Nicely laid out. Swim up bar quite nice. Hot tubs are NOT open as yet. We were told maybe a week or two (who knows). If you want a beach chair under a palapa or a pool chair, you must get up between 7  8 and throw a towel or book on the chair. Too many people, not enough chairs. Beach has no vendors or timeshare people and is nice and wide. Just a bit of seaweed but no liter at all. Quite nice. A big trampoline raft right out front. Very fun.  Reservation system for the al a carte restaurnats is terrible. They are talking about changing it, but for now it's a disaster. You must get in line by 7am to reserve your restaurant choice for that night. Sittings are 6:30 or 8:30. I got in line at 7:20 the first day and had a 45 minute wait. You must do the same thing every day. If you want to eat in the buffet, you do not need a reservation. As far as the food goes, my wife and I both thought it was quite good. Above average. Lettuce, veggies, burgers, desserts all tasty. As a matter of fact, the pasta at the buffet with the marinara sauce and garlic was some of the best I've ever had (I had it 3 nights in a row)............and I'm Italian and eat pasta all the time. The pizza at the pool restaurant is also top shelf. We only ate a the American al a carte restaurant and the Filet was very good. My wife enjoyed the chicken very much. Good pacing at the 6:30 sitting. Slower at 8:30 we were told. We were also told the Asian restaurant was good as was the French. Waitstaff is new so they are still on a learning curve. A smile goes a long way. Be patient.......you're on vacation and they have a culture that moves to a different clock sometimes. Casino was not open as of Feb 1. We were told sometime in the next month it would be. Also, the bowling sometime after that. If you want to go to a casino, they provide a free shuttle at 10pm to the Majestic casino 15minutes away. It's small but OK. Tennis courts looked beautiful but we did not use them. Entertainment at night always began about 10pm. It was always very good but we thought it was a little late. Magic, singing, dancing, karaoke, live bands, all was good.  Overall, my suggestion is to wait a few months or til next winter for this resort. It's only 15 minutes from the airport and has a lot going for it. A nice blend of Americans, Canadians, and Europeans. Beautiful grounds, good food. Be sure to ask for a layout of the property. There are things there that we didn't discover till the end of the week (rooftop bar  pool). Also, a small tip here and there for the waitstaff will get you a little better service. You're not suppose to have to tip but a little bit helps. Be sure to leave a dollar or two a day for housekeeping. Adios.

<Content>Had a Great Week Just completed a week at the Eden H-we had no major issues-basically the resort changed before our eyes daily! We were upgraded to the Paradise Club-no worries checking in at all.We did hear of some rooms with no mirrors-no remote for TV. We were on the ground floor and the mosquitos were a bit heavy-just bring spray. Some people seemed to be having some issues but I suppose we were lucky. One woman got locked in her bathroom-Lucky for her she was in a room with the opening between the bedroom and bath so she crawled over the sink and out-some people seemed angry but most would share their stories and we would all have a laugh.Basically the employees are still learning the ropes but you have to remember they are people too and are doing their best. We have stayed at 4 other Punta Cana resorts the past few years and the last thing I said when we left Eden was this place is going to be INCREDIBLE in 3-6 months. I did meet several women from Canada one day at our pool- They had walked down from the resort they had been Bumped to - they were dealing with it just fine. We talked of the current shortcomings at the Eden and what they had going on at an older property they were.You know what - It was 80-blue skys-had a cold beer in my hand. How could any of us be upset for long.Asian food was very good ...Italian not so much. No casino yet. No bowling alley yet. Sports bar was unique.Smaller billiard tables and very small TV. The shows at night were superb.We thought the buffet was excellent!We had waiters at the pool-they had pool staff that would get you an umbrella - all you had to do was ask!We used the comped catamarans on the property. Straw markets were within walking distance.There is a special menu for the room service-make sure you ask for it when you arrive. We had some confusion ordering..Happy Travels!

<Content>Almost There! Four weeks in, and Edenh Real Arenas is almost there!Our stay spanned January 26 through February 1. Continual construction and upgrading was underway the entire time we were there. I will say that the construction in no way interfered with our stay.Our room was extremely nice - well appointed, with lots of room. The bed was comfortable, and the furniture nice. The bathroom had plenty of room, and the shower very luxurious. I know others had complained about no spacing between bathroom and main living area - we did not have that, with a three-quarters wall in place, and full-sized mirror in place in the bathroom.All that said, we did meet people whose issues spanned the gamut of problems. One had no mirror in the bathroom, while others there the week before had no hot water for a couple of days.Our room was one that had the jacuzzi bath out on the balcony, which was rendered useless by the mosquitos that inhabited the balcony area. There was at least a swarm of 50-100 on duty at all times, and we never went on the balcony.The mosquitos created an issue in the room as well. Sad to say, I splattered a few on the walls, but if that's where I could get them, that's where they ended their stay ... All that said, I only saw staff spraying for mosquitos once while there. As you walked down the interior corridor, you could see them hanging out outside the entrance doors.The mosquitos were a nuisance and bother, but not a trip-breaker. I was simply sorry to see not more attention paid by management.There was, surprisingly, no orientation upon check in. We checked in, a porter carried our bags to the room, and we were on our own. No explanation about pool-side towels, when restaurants were open, etc. You pretty much fended for yourself.We liked the nightly entertainment. There was a variety of performers, many of which performed outdoors. The sports bar was interesting. One of these days they are going to realize that a sports bar has real large flat-screen TV's. The grounds were just recently landscaped, so it was hard to imagine what the place will look like in a year - but it will be fabulous.The pools were great. Towells were plentiful and easy to get. The poolside bar was great - ask for Alex (Alexis). He's a hoot, and a good bartender to boot.The pool-side restaurant, open in for lunch and the afternoon, had fabulous burgers and rotissiere chicken. We could have lived in that restaurant.Overall - a very good time. There were enough issues, minor at that, to keep it from five stars right now. Come back in a couple of months, and Edenh will probably have most of the kinks worked out. We talked to some folks that had been there the week before we arrived (they were staying two weeks), and they said you wouldn't believe the progress made in their first week. Given the progress we saw, Edenh is well on its way.

<Content>Wonderful Vacation A group of 6 from Wisconsin stayed at the Edenh from 1/18/08 to 1/25/08. The group consisted of myself, my wife, my son and his wife, and my daughter and her fiance'. We had 3 rooms total and all three were the Edenh Club Adults Only catagory. Just letting you know that this is my first post on Trip Advisor. When we started planning our vacation I was informed about the forums on TA. I never knew about the forums before this trip. We had picked out the Edenh from Apple Vacations mainly because of the great price that was being advertised at that time. Before we booked at the Edenh I was reading the forums numerous times daily and quite frankly I had bad vibes from what I was reading. It sounded like the resort would not be ready to open on time. From following the forums I learned about Punta Cana Mike. I emailed Mike a couple of times and he reassured me that the resort was opening on time but the casino, spa, gym and bowling alley would not be open when we got there. Then I read the first two reviews that came in around the last week of December and then the video testamony from laurie from California while she was staying there. After hearing and reading the few reviews and the assurance from Mike we decided to take the chance and we booked at the Edenh. When we arrived at the resort we entered the VIP check-in area and immediately were greeted by Wendy. She said they were waiting for us and she was very pleasant. Within 10 minutes two of us were off to our rooms. The other room was not ready yet but Wendy said within an hour that room would be ready. When we got into our rooms we were very happy. Everything was clean, bright and cheerful. Our chamber maid was cleaning the room next to us so she immediately came over to our room to make sure everything was OK and at the same time the person who fills up the mini fridge on a daily basis was there also so he came to make sure everything was OK. So within the first 2 minutes of being in our room we meet the two people that would be taking care of our room for the week. Both were very nice and said to let them know of anything that we needed. I did tell the maid that we were supposed to have bathrobes in our room. She said she would bring them right away. She brought them to our room within 10 minutes. While we were unpacking our stuff someone delivered a fresh fruit basket and someone else brought us a bottle of rum. Talk about service, within the first 1/2 hour we were in our room and received everything that we were supposed to get. Our room was on the 4th floor and had the whirlpool on the balcony. We had a wonderful view of the ocean and of the pool area. My daughters room was 4 doors down from us and her room was exactly like ours. My son went down to see if his room was ready and it was. His room was on the 2nd floor and was identical to ours. He really wanted to be on the same floor as us but Wendy said there were no more available but to try in the morning to see if they could move him up to the 4th floor. All 6 of us then went to explore the resort. First stop was the lobby bar. Met Miguel who was a great bartender. He made our drinks with Absolute vodka. Next stop was the Tantrah bar which was not open yet but Bladamir the bartender was there and he made our drinks with Grey Goose vodka. Next stop was the Paradise Club bar and swimming pool. This is the area that was supposed to be adults only but there were a few kids in the pool. No big deal but we were wondering why they were there if this was the adults only area. This is the area and bar that we pretty much hung out at all week. The bartenders name was Carlos. He was an absolute joy to be around. He took care of us like we were royalty. He never let our drinks get empty. One of his favorite expressions was Carlos is happy everyday. He sure lived up to that expression. Always had a smile on his face and sincerely seemed happy to see us and wait on us. We asked Carlos if this was the adults only area and he said yes it was and it also was for VIP people only meaning those that had pink or yellow wristbands. Not trying to be demanding or anything like that I asked him why then are there kids in the pool and why are people in this area and bar with green wristbands. With that Carlos went and told the kids they had to leave and told people with green wristbands that they could not be in this area. Some of those that he kicked out evidently were not happy about this and must of complained about it because Carlos left for a while. When he got back he explained that his boss questioned him about the incident. As it turns out that was a good thing because from that time forward Carlos said that no more green wristbands or children would be allowed. Throughout the week I witnessed Carlos kicking people out of the area that were not supposed to be there. The problem with this was that there were no signs posted anywhere to let let anybody know that this was adults only and for Edenh Club guests only. I think if signs were posted that would have solved any problems with who was allowed or not. Just letting you know when we left a week later, there still were no signs. The 2nd day we went down to the same area and Carlos was there and again he was very happy. He introduced us to another bartender and his name was Carlos also. So they were called Carlos #1 and Carlos #2. All week long both of these guys wonderful to us. We ate at the buffet every morning for breakfast. They had a nice selection of food and they made you eggs and omelets any way you liked them No complaints about the buffet. Every afternoon we had our lunch at the buffet down at the beachfront. Again they had a good assortment of food but much less than the regular buffet. Every night we at dinner at the ala carte restaurants. The first night we waited for about an hour to get seated. It was well worth the wait. We were at the Shore Grill and had a very tasty steak and lobster dinner. The 2nd night we at at the Italian restaurant but we got there right at 6:30 when they opened and we had no wait at all. Again the food was very good. We decided that we would make a point of having dinner at 6:30 every night so we would not have to wait. 3rd night we ate at the Asian at 6:30 and again had no wait. We sat at the hibachi cooking station which is were they prepare your food in front of you. Again great food. 4th night we went back to the Shore grill at 6:30 and we had to wait, and wait, and wait. We finally got seated about 9:00. Obviously we were not happy about waiting so long. The next morning when we went to the buffet for breakfast there was a table outside that was there to make reservations for dinner. We were told there were two times that we could make reservations for 6:30 and 8:30. We made our reservation for 6:30 for the Romantic Restaurant. We were ok with the new procedure of making reservations after we had waited so long the night before. We showed up at 6:30 and we waited about 30 minutes before we were seated. Don't understand why as there were 7 empty tables when we finally got in. The food was good, not great. 6th night we went back for more steak and lobster at 6:30 and we were seated within 15 minutes. 7th night back to the Shore grill and we waited for about an hour. I don't know if the reservation system was any better than no reservations. Either way we ended up waiting. The wait was not that bad, we just went with the flow. Also the lobby bar is right there so while we waited we just kept going in there to fill up our drinks. Over all, all 6 of us enjoyed all of our meals. I am happy to report that none of us had any ill effects for the food.  As for the bars, like I said our favorite during the day was the Paradise Club at the adult pool. At night before and after dinner it was the lobby bar. For late night it was the Tantrah bar and for the wee hours of the morning it was the sports bar. The problem we had with all the bars(except the Paradise club) was that sometimes we were served premium liquor and other times we were told that we had to pay for the premium. Even after telling the bartenders and showing them our pink VIP wristbands we still were not served the premiums. Again we went along with the flow. As long as we had a drink in our hand we were happy. However, part of the reason why we upgraded was to get the premium liquors. On Sunday the 20th there was a party atmosphere all afternoon and evening in the lobby bar were the playoff games were shown on a huge TV. It was alot of fun. Only bad thing was that the Packers lost. Met PC Mike the 2nd day we were there. VERY nice gentleman. He actually took the time to sit and talk with us for about 1/2 hour. We brought Mike a Packer t-shirt and he said he would wear it on Sunday. He did. We also met Carmen during the Packer game. Muy bonita! During the week we saw Mike a couple more times and once he was walking around with Mike Fisher. Mike Fisher again was a very nice guy. While we were there we heard some of the horror stories about people getting bumped to other resorts and other stories of how people had to change rooms 3, 4 or 5 times because of various reasons. I definately feel sorry for those people. You go on vacation to get away from the hassles of everyday life. You don't need hassles while on vacation. I believe the resort did the best they could do to help guests out but the overbooking of rooms and sending people to other resorts just is not good business. Don't know whose problem that is whether it is the Edenhs' or the travel companys. We heard about some of the problems from the very first day we were there. So my son decided that his room on the 2nd floor was ok with him. He did not change rooms. Overall, we had a wonderful vacation. Rooms were great, food was great, beach was beautiful, pools were nice and the drinks were cold and plentiful. I believe once some signs go up and all the workers know all what each catagory of guest is supposed to receive, things will be much smoother. I do not regret going there and I would go back there tomarrow if I could. Hope you all have as great of a time as we did!

<Content>would go back! I have vacationed in Punta Cana 3 times during the last 3 months. This hotel is by far superior to the Riu Bambu or the horrific Sunscape Beach. I was prepared for construction and sparse landscaping. We had to change rooms a couple of times before we were satisified. The hotel was overbooked probably due to not having rooms ready. The buffet poolside and in the dining area were very good, however service was very poor and disorganzed. I did not like the Japanese or American restaurant, better selection at the buffets.The room was large and nicely furnished. We had problems after a few days with the shower and toilet. Within 10 minutes the problem was fixed.The entertainment was the best I have experienced on a cruise ship or resort. We reakkt enjoyed the Jazz evening. The singers and musicians were supberb. Also the techno night with the white theme, glow sticks etc was amazing. I usually bypass the enertainment but look forward to returning and enjoying the shows. Congrats to the lighting and sound crew!The Tantra lounge on the rooftop was a great meeeting place before venturing out for the evening. A variety of music. Hopefully when I return the disco will be operational. Would definetly return.

<Content>Never will go to newly opened resort again I have to agree with most of the previous posts. It was a tough week to say the least, spotty service, most staff knew almost no english whatsoever. We have been to some highly rated 5 star resorts and know what to expect. This resort does not have what it takes to be five star, at least not yet, maybe in one to two years. There are no clocks, directions for the phone, room service menu, wash cloths (we had wash cloths first 2 days), we had robes in our room for 2 days mid-week, there were so many mosquitos on our porch we really could not handle it for long, sewer backup in some of the rooms and restaurants, there is honestly so much wrong I can't remember it all. Soup being served cold in restaurants, sending it back and it still came back cold, my wife gave up and did not eat it. Not as tough as my Brother-In-Law and his wife, their ceiling caved in inside their bathroom, changed rooms, had sewer backup, which was their third room. They gave up and just had the service staff clean it up, it was their third room. Price was cheap but still high for what we got. We almost stayed at the Natura Park resort for the same price which has one of the most incredible beach fronts I have ever seen, kicking myself for that one. Anyways consider yourself warned. I would like to add in a few positives, the bars were run pretty well, the beach was decent and the pools were nice although swim up bar was inconvenient. All in all we made the best of a somewhat bad situation. On the good side, we did make some really good friends and had some funny stories to tell about our bad experience.

<Content>An unfinished five stars Hi alls,My wife and I have just returned from Edenh on Saturday (Jan 26th, 2008). I am new here however did review most of the topics posted in this forum before and after I went. Just to give my 2 cents. Based on my own observation, guests who have stayed in Edenh have a wide spectrum of rating from 1 to 5. I believe the rating really depends on which part of resort you stayed at, your degree of pickiness, and obviously your expectation. Noise: Let me just describe a bit about the layout of the hotel. Once you pass the lobby which located at the centre of the resort, you should see 4 a la carte rest. and the buffet. Then you should see two blocks of permise, one located on your right hand side, the other on your left. If you are staying at the right sided building (room number with 1xxx), then the construction noise shouldn't be that bad as most are already finished. On the other hand, you will have a totally different feeling if you are staying on the left (number with 2xxx). You can hear noise and hammering all day long. We were unfortunate enough to be assigned to the left unit (24xx) and got waken up by the construction noise everyday at 8am. Since the resort is trying to finish all the room that are facing the ocean (VIP or Le Mirage Concierge Room are closer to the ocean, but not facing it), Le Mirage Concierge Room guests should hear noises too. We did raise our concern, however, we got no luck (people are too busy dealing with other angry guests who couldn't get a room.)Food: For a la carte rest, we personally prefer the French and Italian cusine. We found the food prepared in both Asian and American were too salty. As this is a new resort, inconsistency of food quality may happen. Nevertheless, I would give a thumb up for the buffet. It has a wide variety of food to choose and some especially prepared in grill section are delicious. This is a beautiful resort, but not ready enough to satisfy all guests. My opinion only reflects my experience when I were there between Jan 19 to 26. It might be totally different now.

<Content>Not Ready To Be Open  I just stayed at Edenh Real Arena Punta Cana I booked it here knowing the resort was new and that there would be some bumps, I am not a complainer but ever since I got there that is all I found myself doing. Here is the story:Upon arrival at the hotel we were greeted by very nice bellhops who took our luggage and were give warm towels and drinks while we waited in line to check in. It took about a hour and a bellhop showed us to our room he quickly explained the sites as we walked by. When we arrived in our room we were stunned by the number of misquotes in the room (you can get bug spray at the front desk) and to see the wall that connected the bathroom and the bedroom was not there. There was a huge cut out in the wall connecting the two rooms. We had two double beds I could litterly lay on the one bed reach over and turn on the water in the bath tub; a little too close for me. We asked the bellhop if they had a curtain we could put up he said yes that he would have someone come and do it immediately. We left the room and toured the grounds. The grounds are beautiful there are fountains and a huge pool with swim up bars. The beach is breathtaking and the ocean a lovely site of green and blue water. We got some drinks the bartenders were not the friendliest but we did not care. We arrived back at our room about 3 hours later and saw the curtain was not put up so I went to the front desk and they said they would not put a curtain up for us that was the design of the rooms. I talked to the Apple rep (since we booked through Apple and this was not noted on Apple's site) she asked if they would put up a curtain and they said they could not do that. We said can we hang a sheet and they said No. I said then we would like to change resorts the Apple rep Silvana said that all the rooms on the island were sold out (yeah right she did not even look, however they do have VIP at EdhenH and those rooms have full walls it would be an extra $30 a day per person and this would include VIP services private concierge, top-shelf liquor, use of internet, 2 private bars/pools and express checkout. We decided we really did not want to stay in a room with no bathroom privacy so we agreed to do the upgrade. We moved into our new room which had the wall YEAH for bathroom privacy not something I ever thought I would have to pay for, however we had no remote control (not a big deal) the jacuzzi did not work and had no drain plug, but to top it off we still had misquotes and the toilet did not flush. We went down to the VIP guest services to explain the toilet was not flushing and they said go back to your room and someone is currently waiting there for you. I waited about a 1hr 30 min and went back down again they said someone would be there in 10 min so we walked back to our room which is on the other-side of the resort we waited about another hour and then called VIP guest services again to say no one has come yet they told me I should not be sitting on the balcony when I am waiting for someone I said I am sitting on the bed and no one was here. Again we waited time went by we called down again to VIP and they hung up on us when we walked all the way down there they were closed for the night (now that is some VIP service!!!) Needless to say we sat in our room the first night of our vacation from 10:00 to 1:30, now just about when we were ready to go to bed there was a knock on the door of a repair man for the jacuzzi he fixed it, turns out the jacuzzi was never hooked up and someone did drop off a remote but no one came-up for the toilet. The next morning I went back down to guest services and Apple to explain the toilet was backing up and they promised me it would be fixed by the time we came back from the beach. When we arrived back at our room from the day at the beach which did erase the horrible experience from the night before the room was clean and toilet looked good well until the first flush when the toilet quickly overflowed and leaked so fast from the bathroom into the bedroom it filled the rooms in no time at all. I tried to call guest services but they did not speak English and I did not know how to say that in Spanish I ran down there to talk to VIP and Apple once again. They did have someone come to the room right away. They cleaned the room and someone looked at the toilet however in the middle of the nigh it overflowed again. The following morning I went down to talk to the Apple rep Silvana and they said they could move our rooms I also asked for the refund of the what we paid for the VIP as this was not VIP at least not any VIP I ever experienced. She agreed the hotel should reimburse me and to come back later and she will talk to the manager. We moved rooms this time our toilet worked however in the shower there was black mold and water was dripping out of the the light in the shower stall, now lets think about this to me this spells DANGER. I did go back down again to guest services who did not seem to care about the shower matter and I talked to Silvana and she informed me that I could not get the refund. I asked to speak to the manager and she said he was busy checking in other guests. I said I am already a guest here I think he should address our situation as it is a serious one. She said she already talked to him and I COULD NOT GET A REFUND I said that I still wanted to speak to him so he can fix his hotel. She raised her tone so I did; then I yelled to the people checking in not to do so so she told me she would no longer work with me I was on my own. I have been a Apple customer for 10 years and was planning on using them for a destination wedding of approx 100 people guess I will be using a company that stands by the rating they provide because this place is not a 5 apple it may the goal they have but it is not there now and then for a rep to drop you just like that. I did speak with a manager and he was extremely friendly and did apologize for our experience and did compensate us which would led me to believe Silvana did not talk to him. When they address the problems they have I would consider using EdhenH because they recognized the problems they had however I do not think I would travel with Apple Vacations.

<Content>Satisfaction depends on the price you pay.... We stayed at this hotel 1/25/08 to 1/30/08. We had a great time and were very satisfied. This is largely because we paid a low pre-opening price and expected there would be some frustration. In return, we got an extremely nice room (we booked the Junior Deluxe) at a very nice resort, on a beautiful beach. Having said that, if you are considering booking this hotel in the next 6 months, and paying something comparable to other 5 star resorts, I would definitely choose something else as you will likely face a good amount of frustration. Here are some specific thoughts:-The a la carte restaurants had the best food (the beef dishes were particularly good) but you had to make a reservation. Reservations are made just outside the buffet entrance during set times in the day. Be prepared to wait in line to make a reservation. The Asian restaurant is most popular and you can reserve to either sit at the Hibatchi or at a table and order off a menu. Hibatchi reservations are gone very early in the morning. The food at the Hibatchi was excellent.-The seatings for the reservations are at 6:30  8:30. There were long lines to be seated. Our last night, we stood in line for 45 minutes waiting to be seated and there was an empty table for us the entire time. Not sure what the problem was.-When you pack, bring a swimsuit and summer clothing in your carry-on. While our room was available on time, we knew of others who did not get rooms until much later and you likely will not have access to your luggage.-The front desk staff was not at all helpful and seemed very indifferent. Our room was not ready when we arrived since it was before check-in. The front desk person just put our wristbands on and told us to come back. That was all the direction we were given and we felt very lost. When you arrive, I would ask for (1) a map of the property and (2) The sheet which lists the activities, entertainment, etc. for the day. Keep in mind there is no information about the resort, restaurants, etc. in your room. When we had questions, we found that the tour representatives (ours was Apple) spoke the best english and were the most helpful. They are located at desks in the lobby. Providing some written information to the customer upon arrival and in the room would go a long way to reduce some of the frustration.-The competition to obtain chairs was fierce - especially at the beach. Most chairs were gone by 9:30 AM. We made it a habit to put towels on chairs to reserve them right when we woke up in the morning. There is plenty of room for more chairs and this is very much needed.-The mosquitos in the rooms are very annoying. However, we were not so much bothered by them while outside on the resort. I think the fumigation they do each day is working - except for in the rooms. The mosquitos get in the room each day when the maid comes to clean since they leave the door open. I would put your do not disturb sign out if you do not need your room cleaned to minimize the mosquitos. You can also ask for spray (or bring some) at the front desk.-I would also make sure you obtain a do not distrub sign if you do not have one. It was not uncommon to be bothered more than once early in the morning. There was the maid, the person who restocked the fridge, and another person who came around to see who was in what room to see where the empty rooms were.-The room service menu was dissapointing. We were in the deluxe rooms and there was nothing hot on the room service menu. Mostly bread, cheese,  salad. -The casino and bowling alley were not open. They were doing many spa services and they had some gym equipment (treadmill  eliptical) in a temporary location.If you are booking at a great price and can handle some frustration, book this hotel without worry. If you want a hotel that is without frustration, book elsewhere for now.

<Content>Very Unorganized I stayed at the Edenh from Jan 21-28, all I can say is that this hotel is not ready for customers. I have travelled to quite a few places and this hotel was so unorganized. First of all, we waited for our room for a good 3 hours (there were people waiting for 5-6 hours) after we got our room, 2 hours later a family showed up and entered our room stating that the front desk gave them the room as well. Then the rest of the week they front desk called asking for these people...like is there not any communication after numerous occasions calling and visiting the front desk. It had to be the most frustrating thing ever. Mosquitos we all in the room, be prepared. Food not so great. I would recommend the Asian and American A La Carte, but u have to book outside the buffet. I think in time it could be a great vacation spot I mean the hotel is just beautiful the beach is amazing the staff is great (besides the front desk, who had no idea what they were doing). All in all we had great weather which made my trip. At this point I would recommend others to stay away until all the resort is actually finished, unless you want your first couple of days to be filled with annoyance and frustration.

<Content>Should have stayed elsewhere We stayed there Jan 21 for 1 week. Things started off badly with the disorganized and unacceptably slow check-in. We were fortunate to have our rooms (4 people) within 2 hours of entering the lobby as we spoke to numerous guests who waited up to 6 plus hours to receive there rooms. Also numerous reports of the same rooms being issued to multiple guests ; Spoke to two couples who had arriving guests walk into there rooms more than once. I also experienced this one afternoon as I was taking a nap and in walked an newly arrived couple who were assigned our room. After that we kept the deadbolt lock on when in the room. Other annoying things were the open concept bathrooms ;looks great but not practical. Pros: Beautiful new resort, large rooms, okay to good food at the 2 buffets and the Asian restaurant, friendly and hardworking staff if undertrained.Cons: mediocre to fair food and under staffed at the Shore,Cinque Terra and Senses restaurants.Moderately crowded beaches and pools, beach area could be cleaner( I was appalled at the amount of litter my fellow guests were leaving on the beach, Please show some respect as a visitor and clean up after yourselves!) . EdenH should be a fantastic place if and when they improve on the shortcomings and have things running smoothly.That being said, I would not stay here for at least the next 2-4 months.I did speak to Jose' Allase the Executive Chef and one of the Operation Managers to share my feedback and they were well aware of the problems and stated that things would be much better within a month.We'll see based on future reviews...

<Content>What a wonderful week! We recently returned from a one week stay at the Edenh Real in Punta Cana(1/14-1/21). Despite the fact that the resort was still undergoing final construction (Some rooms were still being finished, and around the resort, details like accent lighting were still being put up.) we really enjoyed ourselves, and loved the property.When our bus first entered the hotel grounds, we were shocked at what we saw. The entrance grounds were not at all complete. It looked like a construction zone. Don鈥檛 let this scare you! Once we entered the reception building, everything changed. It was beautiful. The staff couldn鈥檛 have been more attentive. After we checked in, we were greeted by Saul, who then proceeded to take us to our room. He was wonderful! We had a problem with our key card getting us into our room. Saul immediately got us into another temporary room so that we could change and go directly to the beach. He then took care of everything. Later he found us at the beach, to give us a new key card. He then took us back to the temporary room, gathered our luggage, and took us to our new room to make sure everything was satisfactory. Whenever we ran into him during our stay, he called us by name and asked how we were enjoying our stay.The staff couldn鈥檛 have been more attentive. We were never in need of anything. Drinks were being delivered all the time, new towels were being handed out after a brief rain shower. The food was fine. Try the Italian and Japanese restaurants, they has some wonderful items! The shows were fun and entertaining, and the drinks were excellent! You should definitely try the Funky Monkey (it's a drink) it was very tasty. We had a wonderful week. I鈥檓 just sorry we couldn鈥檛 stay longer.

<Content>Needless Frustration! Just arrived back from a stressful week at this gorgeous new resort on Bavaro Beach. We bought two Mirage Deluxe units, exclusively sold in Canada by Transat Holidays (in USA by Apple Vacations). If you make the same choice, be ready to fight for what you have purchased! Some holiday, eh?This resort virtually runs itself, thanks to the committed  friendly Dominican staff. We only wished the predominantly Spanish fleet of managers were as sincere  responsible, instead of always passing the buck to eachother! We wasted three days of our precious vacation in the hospitality salon, only to be told we had to stay in two Deluxe back-facing, back units until our ocean-view Mirage Deluxe rooms became available. If we had caved in  left that salon or lobby, I KNOW they would have simply forgotten about us! I also point out that Transat Holidays was fully paid more than two weeks before we went. The difference between these two delicately labelled accommodations is incredible, especially if you love watching the sun rise over the tall beach palms, or checking the action at the heart of the resort,- its 3 pools (fountain, tanning  activities).Your identical unit becomes an enjoyable part of the all-inclusive experience, not just a place to sleep  clean up. If that's all you want, buy the Deluxe room at the best price available from any travel company. GOOD LUCK!Special thanks to the communications manager, who finally came to our rescue. This proves to us that Canadians truly are very compassionate  Trip Advisor works miracles!

<Content>go somewhere else Save me....I am here now with my husband and we can not wait to go home. This place is horrible! I am writing this review to hopefully stop someone else from making the same mistake I made. The earlier positive postings were probably not legitimate because everyone staying here is upset and complaining. First off, I paid $98 per person per night from an offer on travelzoo. And even that is too much for this place. The food is really bad. If DR had a board of health they probably would have closed this place down. None of the food is served at the proper temperatures and there are tons of flies on the food. Even the reservation only restaurants are not good. We actually had to walk out twice rather than continue eating...once from Gourmet Senses and once from Americana Shore. The only food to order on room service is cheese, fruit, and deli meats so not much choice there. The only thing to eat at lunch by the beach is pizza and fries because nothing else is edible. That would be ok for a day or two but not for an entire week.The room..we had to move rooms three times. The only rooms that are acceptable living conditions are overlooking the pool. Everyone and I mean everyone has been fighting to get those rooms. The front desk will lie and tell you they will move your room in the morning when pool view rooms open up but do not believe them. Tons of people here were lied to and were not able to move. The only way to get a pool view room is to not check in and not move your luggage until you have seen your room and your confirm it is a pool view because once you take a room you are stuck. Let me add that the pool rooms will have lots of issues but at least you are not overlooking construction or a run down seedy hotel. The rooms are all infested with mosquitoes inside the room, in the hall ways, and on the balcony. I counted 33 mosquitos on the balcony last night and we killed 12 in our room. Needless to say everyone here has tons of mosquito bites. But wait there is more...the air conditioning is not working and the walls are all covered with black mold which I have heard is dangerous to breath in. The black mold is behind the pictures on the wall and covering the ceiling. How could this be if this is a new hotel??? we found out that the construction of this hotel was started by a company who went bankrupt and just left the building structures unfinished and open to the outside elements. That is until this hotel chain bought this swamp and named it Edenh Real.Every evening the hotel does mosquito fumagating and there are huge fogs of pesticides that are sprayed around the entire hotel. I am no scientist but I am pretty sure these huge amounts of powerful pesticides are not good for anyone to be enhaling. They are being sprayed over the entire propery and into the pools.I heard that 200 people were over booked into this hotel last weekend and were sent to another hotel. They probably do not realize this yet but they were the lucky ones.I could go on and on but my best advice is to suggest to anyone considering this hotel -no matter how cheap the rates are- to stay somewhere else. You will thank me for it.

<Content>Under construction wait 6 months before booking We experience several problems that needs improvements.,First, poor management. The rooms are over booked. We had to moved three times. Some people had to transfer to another resort. Recommend buying the basic package since is no preceive $benefit paying for the extra. Beware of the mosquitoes especially on the first floor. Ask for the pool side view since the other side is overlooking the construction. The wine is terrible! I had better home made wine. The good side is good beach, clean beautiful room but beware there is no privacy in the bathroom since there is a large opening from the bedroom.

<Content>Hamburgers Just a quick note on the burgers at the Beach grill buffet. I didn't want this lost in the forums.You need to give the burgers to the grill chef to be cooked. They are sitting there for you to take, but you give it to the chef and he cooks it as much as you want. No need to put the raw meat on your plate. I hope this helps and everyone remembers.Again we had a great time the first week it opened. Sure they have wrinkles to iron out.....but hey you're on vacation!!!

<Content>Beautiful hotel but not 5**** We have returned this evening from our week at the Eden.The hotel is beautiful and is the presetation from the beach is nicer than any we saw on our walks. Many beach walkers asked which resort it was. Alot of reviews have said its a new resort and is having a few problems. Yes, the resort is new but the company that owns it have a few other resorts. So there should be some expericence on the managment side but it is not visiable . We asked to speak to mangment and the VIP staff said we had to deal with them. To bad they did not know how to handel the problems and customers. You should put your best personel out in front and the personel to customer ratio at an opening should be high. If you have purchased the VIP package it will not meet the discription or value. If you book the deluxe package you will get value. The rooms are 5**. The rooms with the view into the bath room need some blind or curtain. The door has a lock but you can climb throught the bath tub window???Security needs to be inproved. The door locks did not always work and at night we heard of many having people enter their room; either staff or new guest sent to rooms already occupied. The bar and wait saff did work hard there again not enough staff and not enough experienced staff. BY the end of our stay and three rooms later we did see a change in staff and a few more managment around . BUt the word is out , this resort is not a 5**** . The food that should be hot was cold and the cold food was cool. The ala carte dinning was a good but they changed to a reservation of either 6:30 or 8:30 seatings. You need to line up to do this each day at breakfast, more time wasted. The beach is beautiful the weather great but the first weeks of this opening could have had fantastic reviews if managment had been front and center. Maybe next year

<Content>Bad timing - False Publicity on the Hotel Edenh real arena - Bad timing - Poor choiceWe were there for a romantic getaway and to rest from January 11 to January 25. I guess we were not there at the right time. The publicity on internet was over rated. It will maybe a 4 stars in a couple of years, but they are sure not there yet. - No music on the Beach- No music at the pool- Mosquitos in the room - Poor training of the staff especially at the Public services and at the reception- False publicity - Internet was not free, There were no Iron and Ironing board in the room, we only received an iron on our 11 day there but no ironing board. THe Spa and Gym were not available - not ready- - The day we arrived, our room floor was full of concrete peices or other construction product . We couldn't walk bare foot and there were half drank bottles of pop in the mini bar. Not a good beginning when you arrive tired.- No face cloth for many days - We had to wash with the bath towell most of the time. This was unpleasant.- Noisy and Disturbing (For the first 6 nights - Construction went on at his best - Constructors were yelling at each other from one end to the other - - No insulation between walls - we heard everything that was going on from the other rooms when we were at the room.- Someone always knocking at the door for no reason - we couldn't understand what they wanted - some were saying ^^Report.^^ - When we askek report of what - they did not understand a word of what we were saying and were leaving after they had wakened us up. - Activities begins too late - Almost at 10 pm and the second week, the same activities were rescheduled. It was a repetition of the activities we had seen the first week. Nothing much to do at night time except if you like to drink at the bar.- Not enough chairs at the beach for everyone- No advice or message to tell the customers that they had change their mind on reservation at restaurants. When we arrived at the Hotel, they told us that no reservation was needed to go to restaurants. In the middle of the second week, we went to a restaurant, and we couldn't go because they decided we had to make reservation. Absolutely no message or advice - How could we know? We had made our mind on a good onion soup at the French restaurant and we had dressed up. We had to go to the buffet. Il was not fun. If you look for a 4 or 5 stars - I recommend Melia Caribe or Melia Tropical . Last year, we had the same deal as this year ar Edenh and I can assure you, it is a lot, but a lot better at all points. The publicity on Melia is real. I really think that we were at Edenh at the wrong time. The Hotel was not completed on time and we were the victims. Many rooms were ok, but it was not the same story for everyone.- Many people were complaining - even some crying without being able to receive help from the staff because of their language Maybe in 3 years this hotel will be great, but for now I don't recommend it for a romantic getaway. The good : The Beach if you have a chair and The Food which was excellent.

<Content>Not quite what we expected We just returned from Edehn- new resort only open 3 weeks. Lots of things to work out- not finished- no bowling alley or casino like advertised- and won't be done for close to another year. The pools were great- the beach was great. We did not dine in the restaurants- only the buffet- which was above average, but unless you ate the things cooked on the grill, most things on the buffet were cold. Entertainment each night, but did not start until almost 10pm- we took a child- so couldn't participate that late. The hotel was overbooked- so many people had to be put up at other resorts as they had no room at the inn. We had to complain about our toilet that did not flush- after 3rd day of complaints- we got moved to another room, but had to get nasty with the management first. Lots of people not satisfied with things- No clocks in room- no clocks anywhere- so take a watch. Lots of mosquitoes- so take bug spray. Don't take money for the casino- not finished yet. Take advantage of the special rates, cause when it's done and up to snuff- it will be a pricey place to stay- just our feelings. All in all, we had a good time- just the little inconviences- like nobody speaking English good enough to really understand what you are saying.

<Content>Not Too Bad Landed January 19, 2008 and left Januray 26, 2008. The Edenh is about 20 minutes north of the Punta Cana airport, whic isn't as bad as everyone claims as an airport. This hotel is new and just openned afew weeks a go. The rooms are new and awesome. The water preasue and hot water is great as is the size of the bathrooms, along with a two person jet tub. The place is located at one of the best beaches and their several pools with simm up bar is good too.As a new place there are a few kings to be worked out but for the price I paid it was excellent. For couples, with or without e and older people over 65 is was a delight. I went their single in my 40's and there really wasn't much avilable in terms of other singles. The food was good and they has a great blend of different types of food.The crew there was very hulpful, except for this one .....women in the free interent location who was very nasty and if I were the boss would have been summarily fired. She implied that the free interent was for the paradice members only when it should have been available to all quests, They tried to charge $4.00 mim for 15 minutes on the internet which in today's age is criminal to me for a hotel. Waiting your turn is bad enough, only had 2 computers, but to charge guests such a rediculus price is beneath a class establishment in my opinion.They nightly shows were nice and the one they did on Friday the 25th was by far the best. All in all, I would recommend this hotel and you must take the Outback jungle ride, it is absouluetly wonderful!!Daniel, Long Island New York.

<Content>Most Potential on the Beach I think everyone took a chance on this hotel and it has worked out very well for those people who were expecting a few wrinkles as the hotel gets established. A lot of the issues that I am reading in most of the reviews boil down to communication with the staff or just simply the fact that the facility is not quite finished. Personally, I had the same issues but for the price I paid, I expected a few problems but they sure didn't ruin my vacation. Overall, the property has the most potential on the beach and the pools are beautiful.I do have one word of warning for those people who are booking mirage rooms or mirage concierge rooms with an oceanview. Don't go there expecting an oceanview because your chances are about 50/50. Half the good rooms face inward at the pool and you can definitely see the ocean but the other half are out the back and you are really just looking at adjacent property or a big empty lot under construction. We were lucky enough to be on the inside with a spectacular view on the 4th floor. We also had a hottub on our balcony that we used everyday that had lots of privacy. If you were on the first floor, there was not much privacy to use your hottub but you had the convenience to walk out to the pool area.Ride from the airport was at most 20 minutes and don't forget to buy a beer at the airport for the bus ride to the resort.Our first day was our worst. Trying to communicate with the staff and get a proper room for what we had booked was a frustrating time but like the others, we made it through. For those that upgraded, there is a room off to the right that can be used to register but we missed that opportunity as no one could really communicate this to us.Days two to seven were awesome - other than one day that had rain, we loved sitting by the pool, meeting new freinds, getting served by the bartenders and just enjoying the view. The staff was trying as hard as they could to keep everyone buzy and I simply think there was quite a few lazy guests (which is fine) while we were there. It was easy to keep busy if you put your mind to it.The loungers were easily the best in Punta Cana. What they didn't have in comfort, they made up for in looks. All the other vacationers were commenting on the loungers at our hotel.Breakfast, like anywhere I have been, is the best meal of the day. Great omlettes, fruit, bacon, breads - whatever you wanted. We ate lunch by the pool area. They cooked whole chickens and would cut off a half chicken for you if you wanted. If you stuck to this and a few other simple lunch items, it was quite good. Dinners were at best average at the A la carte restaurants. More so because of the communication issues than anything which made service slow. I am confident they will work through these issues and adjust the menus to the items that are pleasing the quests. When we arrived, no reservations were required for dinner but by the end of the week, reservations were mandatory. No huge lineups to make reservations which was nice.We ate our final two dinners at the buffet which was actually quite good if you went up to the grill where you were quaranteed to get your food hot. Deserts were very good.They had just finished off there entertainment room and had their first show the second last night we were there. It is an indoor facility and better than any other facility I had ever seen. Catch a show while you are there.It is going to be a great place with tons to do in the very short future. They still need to finish the bowling alley which attaches to the sports bar, the casino and the ice cream parlour but once they do and the staff gets familiar with the English language, it will be a place I will definitely need to go back to visit.

<Content>Save your money and Stay Home! My husband and I returned from this resort after a long weekend (Jan. 18- 21) very disappointed. This resort is far from finished and we encountered many issues during our stay. Unfortunately the staff and managment could care less about these issues. First of all, we had to wait over 3 hours for our room. When the room was finally ready the keys didn't work. Upon finally entering our room (which was basic, not the suite that we paid for) my husband leaned on the balcony and got fresh paint all over his new shirt and arms. We did not have robes, a stocked mini bar or a remote for our t.v. (when the staff brought us our remote, 2 hours later ,they entered the room without knocking and I was standing there fresh out of the shower- with no robe, if you catch my drift. We tried to make the most of it by going to one of the supposed 5 star restaurants only to be served cold food, covered in plastic wrap no less.We did travel with friends, so we did have a blast with them. Please note this resort is not for the late 20's early 30's crowd. The next morning while my girlfriend was brushing her teeth, the entire ceiling above her fell in and a waterfall came pouring over her. I guess she didn't have to use the shower that day, better than cutting your feet on the plaster chunks left in the stall! Needless to say her husband and mine used their entire day (the only sunny one we had) to acquire a new room. When they finally did and entered the new room, there was a couple in bed. I guess the front desk didn't realize that it was still occupied!(The people staying in the room next to us had to catch the next flight home because their toilet didn't work and the hotel would not give them another room!)The next morning we were awakend by a phone call at 5:30 by the front desk looking for someone who had ordered room service, and then proceeded to call EVERY room on the floor. I guess it wasn't that big of a deal since we were waiting for the construction noise to start any minute!!!!This is only the tip of the iceburg. Punta Cana Mike does exist, but made no effort to appease us.If you are accustomed to 5 star quality and great service, this is not the place to stay. Everything from the drinks, to the self serve icecream and even the hand soap in the bathrooms are watered down- no joke. The grounds are beautiful and the beach was gorgeous. But I think you need an even balance when you pay a lot of money for a relaxing weekend. If only the hotel and travel agency cared enough to make it right. I think that is why I am having such a hard time with this experience- NO ONE GIVES A HOOT! I really hope for the resort's sake that they get their act together, it has a lot of potential.

<Content>Awesome Vacation Hi All:First of all, I would like everyone to know how hard Punta Cana Mike works. He works 16 hour days, and hasn't had a day off in two weeks. We returned from EdenH yesterday, and we had the pleasure of meeting Mike. He has a wonderful personality, always a smile on his face. When we arrived he showed us around the resort so we could find everything easily. We found Mike amazing. This vacation was by far the best vacation we have had in the Caribbean in 5 years. The staff were very friendly, the food great, the atmosphere wonderful. There is so much offered at the EdenH. Drinks are served pool side and on the beach. We tipped them well, for the simple reason, they did not expect to be tipped. The servers treated everyone the same. Remember: You are on vacation, and if you cannot have a good time at this resort, the fault lies with you.Any new resort has its problems, which they will work out in time. These people bend over backwards to satisfy the tourists. There is absolutely NO reason to be rude to the staff.We would go back in a heartbeat to the EdenH.

<Content>All packed no place to go I wish that I had an opportunity to rate this resort....but Edenh cancelled our reservation with only 5 days notice! They are shut down to finish construction! Our travel company called to inform us that we are now in another resort. One that I did not chose or that I would have if given the opportunity. So, now I spent a lot of money on a vacation that I do not want and I am sitting here with my bags packed with no compensation offered for the hassle and headache that I have. Thanks Edenh for throwing us out and chosing our vacation for us. Can't wait.

<Content>Paradise My 3 sisters and I went to the Edenh Real in Punta Cana Jan10-23. I may never go back to Mexico after being in the D.R. The applerep was at the airport and we found him easily. The apple rep at the Edenh had a deskin the lobby and was there from 8-12 and 4-7pm. We went to her with anyproblems (the phone wasn't hooked up with it being new, our key didn'twork,we wanted to go snorkeling, etc..)The resort was only open a weekso we expected some problems. (We were the first to sleep in ourroom.) We had upgraded for $40 to the VIP or Apple club. Our building wasthe closest to the beach. No children on our floor. (Very few in thewhole resort to begin with.) We were greeted with private check in, nothaving to go throught the main desk. Everyone is greeted with adrink and wet towel in case you were hot-it was 82. The room had a bigbottle of Rum, a fruit basket, robes, all the goodies in the bathroomlike toothbrushes, luffas, etc. Our patio had a Jacuzzis and lots ofbath salts to use. We had our own pool, pool bar and servers. We werepleased that we didn't have to make reservations to eat at the 4restaurants as there were not that many people. The buffet looked more like therestaurants at the other resorts. The 5 pools were usually emptybecause most people were at the beach. The servers came to the beach so therewas no reason to leave. Free 30 minute massage on the beach was nice!We are sea food lovers and so we enjoyed the lobster and sushi. Nowthat you have my review book I'll stop. I tried to book another trip andthey are full til May. Price is still good $940. before tax  ins.Mysisters want to book for next year. The casino,bowling alley and theaterare not finished.They will transport you to another casino if youwant. Not knowing the beach is private we were surprised and pleasednot to have sales people with their jewelry, t-shirts, etc.. It was alsonice not to have time share people. I was so ready this time that assoon as someone started talking to my sisters I would pull them away.One person was really a resort person trying to explain where the barsand entertainment were. I apologized later to her.

<Content>Hated one thing - leaving! Trip from the airport is short compared to most of the resorts we have stayed at in PC. Instant gratification upon arrival - the bar by reception had a football game on a huge screen and plenty of beer and chips and hotdogs to offer while we waited for the desk to assemble our room key package! Our room had an edgy, unique design, but a definite lack of privacy. I was not relaxed with the glass panel doors on the shower and WC either - sounds are amplified, and the thought of a panel coming loose where bare feet tread gives me chills. There were a few mosquitoes dancing around the ceiling, but by the end of our week they were gone. Our maids did a fantastic job, and our room was always spotless with chocolates on the pillows each evening. The toiletry collection was extensive and delightful, and there was a hairdryer and heaps of fluffy white towels, and new beach towels every day. The fridge was stocked with beer, coke, water, candy bars, olives and peanuts, and there was a coffee maker with coffee packets. We didn't see an ice machine, but room service would no doubt bring it.Speaking of room service - its included, and available 24 hours. We had a bottle of bubbly sent up for our anniversary which we sipped in our jacuzzi tub full of bubble bath. A rare treat!!!The ala carte restaurant food was excellent. Some of my favorites were filet mignon and broiled carribean lobster, shrimp tempura, cheesecake and hazelnut mousse cake. At the buffet and Olas restaurant by the pool I always enjoyed pizza, salads, olives, and grilled, baked or fried fish, and lots of fresh tropical fruits and drinks. Waiters Daniel, Antony and Mateo were especially attentive and helpful, and the bartender at the service bar was lightning fast. Carlos and Ramon were pushing the pina coladas at the two small pools along the beach, and Fernando was great at getting the swim up bar crowd rowdy and feeling good.Stretching class was a great way to start the day - and water aerobics helped burn off some of the extra calories. Other great activities were beach volleyball, the trampoline in the water, rum and cigar class, and fancy mixed drink lesson. Carlos Garcia runs the watersports and gives lessons at 9:30am so you can take the equipment out later on your own. (I think I probably would prefer another lesson)The theater is not finished yet so the shows are in the plaza beyond reception. Each show is different and greatly entertaining. My husband likes the dancing and I liked the big band night. We both really liked the roof top Tahntra bar under the stars - sea breezes gently stirring the curtains surrounding the deep red cushioned lounges and the flickering scented candles. There is even a small pool up there if the dancing gets too hot and heavy. (careful what you wear though - there is a window through to the view of the plaza below!)Sad to say our only complaint was the unbelievable rudeness and prima dona attitudes we overheard from some of the other guests. We sincerely hope our host country will excuse us the ignorance, dishonesty and poor manners some of us so brazenly have displayed. We had a wonderful time and give much thanks to all the staff at EdenH.
