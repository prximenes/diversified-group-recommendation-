<Content>we really loved this hotell!! We arrived at the patra on the 14th Nov 08 and stayed for 1 week.we stayed in a delux suite which was large and very nice.huge king size bed and comfy pillows. nice ensuite with spa!!yes i must agree with the other person the mini bar was small and 4 x2ltrs cokes wouldnt fit in. also we brought ice trays to use bottled water to freeze our ice but the freezer took 2 days to freeze them over! just call room service and they will bring you up a hole bucket for free.(no bill for this) and yes they use bottled water! they do the best mee goreng too!!ok the only gripe if i had to would of been that the sofas could of been a bit cleaner. they smelt a little sweaty and yes a bit of grime in the shower corners ect but nothing to really worry about and it certainly didnt ruin our holiday.You cant hear the planes from the airport at all in your room. They didnt bother us at all. The breakfast was massive and had everything you could think of. we never had dinner at the hotel--a little too expensive. the pool-bar is awsome and happy hour cocktails were buy one get one free from 5-7pm. very tasty.!beautifull views out to the ocean. The bar staff even let us take our cocktails into the ocean and jump back in the pool.!!The staff are lovely and the hotel in general is well kept. beautiful gardens and a nice feel to it.it is a bit out of town so if you want to step outside and join the night life this is definatly not the hotel for you. a taxi only costs you $3 so it didnt bother us one little bit. the hotell was certainly value for money. i would definatly stay here again but upgrade to a pool villa next time. they look wonderfful.!!

<Content>fantastic hotel We stayed at the Patra end of Oct beginning of Nov and absolutely loved it. Mostly the grounds were immaculate and vast; my husband has a back injury and is unable to walk far so we always had use the buggies to get around the hotel which the staff were really great about, they even let my 3 and 4 yr old sit on thier laps and help steer! The buffet breakfast was amazing with a huge choice of cereals, fruit, cooked breakfasts and continental choices available. Breakfast went from 6.30am - 10.30am and we found if you went after 9.45am the service was poor with plenty of dirty tables and no-one available to serve tea/coffee. We stayed in a deluxe suite - on arrival they showed us to a deluxe room but when we explained that this was not what we had payed for we were immediately moved with the smallest amount of fuss possilble. The 2 bedrooms (had a sliding door to separate them) were massive and clean, though after the first night of the kids constantly rolling over and kicking/hitting each other in thier sleep (their bed was a thin saggy pull out sofa bed) we requested another single bed, but the next day 2 single beds appeared and they fitted easily into the room along with the sofa.Our bed was king size and contributed to, along with the most fantastically comfortable pillows, very comfortable sleeps. There was a TV in each room so kids and adults were happy.The bathroom was immaculate and the toilet sprayer of great entertainment to the 3yr old! as were the 3 phones in the suite!The fridge in the room is small if you are trying to cater for constantly hungry /thirsty children - we invested in an esky!The staff were always happy and extremely helpful especially the concierge staff.We used the kids club 3 times during our stay and though the hotel boasts it is the largest in Bali, We were not really impressed, it was average. We took our kids once to swim in the small kids club pool and they had a ball, though parts of the pool edges were very slippery with slime so extreme care had to be taken. The grounds in the kids club certainly did need some work and the trampoline springs were rusty. On the second occasion we left the children with the kids club babysitter (3yr olds and under have to have thier own babysitter, $25000rp an hour) and the children certainly didn't seem to have had the greatest time when we picked them up - it was luck of the draw as the other kids were older and wouldn't play with ours. On the third occasion our nanny took them and they had a great time because she gave them individual attention. I would recommend the kids club if your kids are 8yrs and over - this was our first trip away as a family and us adults were looking forward to making use of the kids club, so it was a bit of a dissapointment.Hotel prices were very expensive (43000rp for a bintang) so be warned!The main pool certainly could have been cleaned better - we didn't notice any green slime but there were alot of leaves and flowers floating in it.When we wanted to go out we asked at the concierge desk to call for a Blue Bird taxi as they were always cheaper than the metered taxis that the taxi stand would call for. The taxi stand won't call for Blue Bird taxis.Overall our stay was fabulous but the hotel prices certainly put a dent in our budget, travelling with toddlers did not make us as mobile as we thought we'd be, many times they were just too tired to go out to get dinner, so we felt like a captive audience to the hotel restaurants.

<Content>The Patra was great, but a few problems that were sorted My husband and I and our twin girls (12 y.o) stayed for ten days, we booked two connecting rooms and they were nice, but a bit far out of the way, the kids didn't mind as you can take a ride in the chauferred electric buggies ( this can be a problem waiting around if their are conventions or special guests as we found out ). There were renovations being done to the hotel next door and it was quite excruiciating at times as a concrete cutter was being used, I complained two morning in a row and nothing happened, but I think everything was lost in the translation - but when I complained nicely on the third day, a manager went out of his way to offer a solution to the problem - ie moving us if we wanted and allowing us to check out at ten pm the night of our departure withoout an extra payment. A few days later it was my birthday and a cake was delivered to our table and the staff not only sang happy birthday, they each had signed a card they'd made for me! My girls didn't like the kids club they said it was boring, but they loved the pools, and the swim up bar. They had heaps of fun hiring pushbikes with us, a new pathway along the beachfront (which is also being 'renovated' is nearly complete) so we went around the local streets and met the friendliest people. Ther staff are all friendly, the security was really good, ( when we were there the 3 bombers were executed ) and every vehicle is checked right over and at night security roam the grounds, but it is unobtrusive and actually made us feel safer. The airport vacinity really isn't a problem, you really don't notice it and the Patra has this very quiet, cruissie feel about it. I'd definitely go back.

<Content>Patra bali - The only place to stay Just got back from 7 days in Kuta. Stayed at the Patra and found the whole experience fantastic. If you like a holiday where you're not immersed in the hussle and bussle, then staying at the Patra is what you need to do. It's only a short taxi fare to the main area of Kuta and a nice walk (about 20mins) along the beach front - which is currently being developed to make the beach bigger. Hotel facilities were great, staff were exceptionally obliging and friendly, I had breakfasts included in my package and could start the day with more then enough food to get me going - fresh fruit, coffee (great coffee!) cereals, pastries, hot food - eggs (of any kind you desire), bacon etc. I stayed in a Deluxe room (I think it's their basic suite) which was more than adequate for my needs. King size bed, fresh towels daily (not grey as I read in another review), the room was always made up after a day out. Anyway, who goes to bali to hang out in their hotel room? It's where you sleep, shower and dress. Excellent pools to relax by surrounded by resort grounds that were always immaculate. Someone had written in another review the grounds were terrible....maybe they'd just had a hurricane go through there because there is no way these grounds were anything less than pristine every day. Overall I would recommend the Patra to anyone wanting a relaxing place to retreat to after a day on the streets of Kuta. I will definitely return and stay at the Patra once again.

<Content>Best hotel south of Kuta Just back from a week at Patra Bali for our honeymoon - we were upgraded FOC to a deluxe suite. Last year we stayed at the much smaller but equally highly graded Komenka in Monkey Forest Road, Ubud, which we loved. We enjoyed the Patra more. The suite - bedroom, lounge and bathroom was very high standard. We'd had a couple of nights in a suite in the Sheraton in Perth after our wedding, and the Patra was a postive contrast to the competent but relatively soulless chain operator in Perth.Breakfast in the main restaurant area was fully equal to the offerings in most high end properties, and the staff were invariably helpful. At present there is a major beach reclamation project underway that includes the area in front of the Patra, so there is earth moving equipment about making a bit of noise 24/7. Surprisingly this didn't really seem to have a big impact on guests - or maybe it was just because we had our own earth moving thing going on? If you get my drift!One small maintenance criticism - a layer of mould around the water line of the pools was evident and did not seem the type of problem that should be there when maintenance on the rest of the property was of a high standard.During our week there we spent a lot of time looking at all the hotels along the beach south of Kuta to plot our next trip - in our view the Patra is the pick of them, the only real disadvantage being that it is a 10K to 15K rupiah trip by taxi to Kuta Square, and there's not a lot in close walking distance to the Patra.Overall we enjoyed our time at the Patra, and despite our preference for Ubud, we'd return if wanting to stay near the coast.

<Content>"Not what it used to be" I have to agree with the a few other reviews, The lovely peaceful beautful Patra was not he same this year, we have been at the patra for 3 weeks for the past 5 years and loved it, this year, I booked in april, we arrived had us in a room close as possible to to reception that I had apparently requested (I did not) south side of resort which again I didn't request, It was just a mess so we were in 1 room for a few nights and then moved to a room at the back of the resort, The breakfast room was a mess, tables were never cleared, I served myself coffee most days, the cushions on the chairs are filthy, some guy crashed tackle me for the pancakes, 'like there was never going to be anymore we were asked if would like to sit in the Bar for breakfast, which was OK at least it was civilised then they set set up tables and chairs in the walkthrough, which we got to sit at as well for breakfast , Prices have gone through the roof, 50% on last year for food and drinks. Lots of families with lots of little children. The rooms I though were still quite good, daily service sometimes not till 3-4pm. We were dissapointed with our stay this year, it simply is not what is used to be.

<Content>Not what it used to be We stayed at the Patra about 3 years ago and really loved it. So when we decided to go back to Bali (for the 4th time) we just booked the Patra without a thought. That was a bi mistake !!!When booking we specified a non smoking room ... but that's not what we got. After arriving in the room we called reception and let them know we weren't happy. After a lot of mucking around we were promised a move the following day. When time came to move (we had 2 interconnecting rooms as the were 4 of us) we had one room ok the other still stank of smoke. The problem was we were travelling with our teenage daughters and we didn't want to be in different parts of the resort. We objected again ... and after another few hours and a room 'treatment' to get rid of the smell we moved again.The final result was 2 rooms free of smoke smells but not interconnecting.All in all, whilst they were 'very sorry' it didn't help us. In short the first two days of the holidays were ruined.Last time we were there we thought the breakfast was great ... this time very, very ordinary. And the place is looking very tired. I heard that the place is about to undergo a major renovation. It's well overdue.I've previously said on this site that the Patra was great, and at the time it was true. But things change.We have booked to go back to Bali in March next year ... but the Patra is definitely off the list. A real shame !!

<Content>Very Disappointed My wifw and I stayed at this resort for 2 weeks and were very disappointed with the state of disrepair of the Gardens and Facilities. The Restaurants had soiled cushions throughout, the food was very poor in Menu and quality. The breakfast buffet was semi warm, poor in choice and not always clean. We have stayed there regularly since 1985 when it was a genuine 5 star resort and after more than 20 stays it should not rate even 2.5 stars at present. The problem appears to have started when the European managers and chefs were replaced with Indonesion personnel. Staff is aware of problem but indicates that management does not repond to concerns.

<Author>NeverAgain08_8
<Content>A 3-star property masquerading as 5-star. Booked Club suite. Rooms very good, grounds okay, location okay, staff pleasant. But from there on the rest was definitely 3 star. The food was poorly serviced, with the cheapest versions of everything, and the restaurant staff were poorly trained. A toilet that did not stop leaking and a shower that would not drain. A gym that was useless, The club that was used for sundowners (free at this level) had limited drinks and inedible food (try deep fried mashed potatoes). Our 10th trip to Bali, which we love, but can never stay again at Patra Bali. We advised management of all of the fixable things within first 24 hours; 8 days later we had heard nothing, nor was anything done to rectify them. And a 4-hour late checkout cost a further US$100! Conclusion: the management simply does not care.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel We have just returned to Perth Western Australia after a wonderful ten days at the Patra. We were attracted to the hotel by the excellent reviews of it on Trip Advisor. The hotel lived up to all our expectations and exceeded them in many areas. We are a family of four and went there with my two young daughters aged 8 and 11. They had a great time in the the very large spotlessly clean pool which overlooks the beach and loved the delux suite which had two TVs with Foxtel. At the end of the day the girls could watch TV and we could close off their area with two sliding doors. Sitting near the pool overlooking the ocean was pure bliss! As mentioned by a few reviews on Trip Advisor, the delux suite has two very large rooms and is well designed, including a large clean bathroom. It is also designed in a way which provided us with privacy and peace. The gardens are beautiful and very well maintained. Our stay included breakfasts and every morning there was a big spread with all we could have hoped for. All the staff were excellent and could not do enough to ensure that our stay there was the very best it could be. On the final day we had a late flight and the hotel happily accommodated our request for a late 4pm checkout without fuss or any extra cost. We highly recommend the Patra and will be going back there the next time we travel to Bali.

<Content>handy location My girlfriend and I spent three nights here whilst in transit to work in Timor-Leste. The location of the resort was perfect us; close to the airport and also the nightlife of Kuta.We organized complimentary pick-up from the airport with the hotel, which went well despite a delayed flight arrival. The hotel also returned us to the airport for our departure free of charge. The hotel also operates a free shuttle service [at set times of the day] to/from the main shopping centres in Kuta.We stayed in a Club Villa, which was in all honesty too big for the two of us. Especially given that we spent most of our time out of the villa. The accommodations were very good with a separate lounge/dining room, bedroom and well-appointed bathroom (with separate shower and huge bath tub. There were two small verandahs (one off the bedroom and the other off the lounge), which could accommodate two chairs and small table. The resort complex is located within a kilometre of the main runway so there is aircraft noise. It didn't trouble us but it does exist non the less, so don't expect a quiet tropical getaway when staying here. The pool areas (one [smaller] adults-only pool, and a very large general purpose pool area, which is located close to all the restaurants) were clean and well maintained. The larger pool has a swim-up bar, which was very popular with the guests. We had breakfast a couple of times, which was adequate and what you would expect of a resort of this type. We also had one meal in the Italian restaurant and the pizzas were OK. The remainder of the time we spent in Kuta.There is a business centre available but you are charged for Internet access. You need to purchase an Indotel card (from reception), which you can use also for wifi, which was available at certain hot spots around the resort but not in the rooms.Security is very strict here with vehicle searches upon entry to the resort. No touts were allowed to enter the resort though they did hang out along the beach front and called out to any prospective clients. As a point of interest we did try walking along the seafront towards Kuta but one part of the front has been washed away and therefore impassable unless you want to go swimming! There is a [beach] reclamation project currently underway with most of the heavy [machinery] work occurring at nighttime.All in all we enjoyed our stay and will be returning in a couple of weeks when we will spend a couple of nights there on our way home.

<Content>Fantastic - would happily return! Family of 2 adults and 2 kids 5 and 18 months, found this resort totally perfect for us!Booked a Deluxe suite and were upgraded on arrival to Club Suite which was huge, living room with sofa bed, large tv, dining suite, large bedroom with king bed, tv and separate terrace, requested floor level due to baby and got it. Bathroom was also huge with separate bath and shower with all ammenities in perfect working order, including inroom digital safe.Staff were consistantly welcoming, warm and attentive. Business centre was fine for internet access but was out of service sometimes but never for too long.Money changer was competitive rate and provided reciept and counted conversion on table in front of you and happy to watch you count back, always found to be honest and reliable - never had problems. Drug store was limited but fine for quick, emergency supplies (like icecreams and drinks) but quite expensive so we stocked up in Kuta most days and filled our minifridge in room with supplies.Bluebird taxi from hotel great (aircon and metered)- never were on time for hotel shuttle so didnt use it but taxi was cheap to kuta 20-30000 rupiah each way to kuta beach/poppies lanes. Hotel restauants were good but a bit more pricey than Kuta, used them for first few nights then ventured into town after that and found them more enjoyable and cheaper but room service was still affordable and satisfying and the pizzaria was excellent. Buffet breakfast was vast and delicious, egg corner make whatever style egg you want - yum!Concierge sometimes try to convince you to use hotel taxi but these are more expensive though larger in size than normal taxi so we used bluebirds.Hawkers on beach were very nice and not too pushy. Did my daughters and my hair braiding for $12 aud each but found kuta do for $9. Lady on hotel beach did our laundry there too and brought back next day perfectly clean and folded - best smelling clothes we have ever had!Kids club is only slight greivance we had, the inside was totally fine with ample entertainment and friendly staff but the exterior needs attention. The mini pool was dirty and mosquito ridden, the climbing forts had very dirty sand (kids returned black from playing in it) and the trampoline was rusty on the outside springs - not best for tetnus! although it did at least have a net around it but it didnt close properly. We found the kids mostly liked playing in the pool anyway so on returning to bali if we chose another location we wont need a kids club as they probably wouldn't use it anyway!Overall would stay at the Patra again in a second if we go back, kids felt right at home so we were happy and never wanted for what we didnt have. Airport proximity was never a problem with noise - only ever noticed planes when in the pool. Beach sea wall construction noise was also never a problem, only barely noticible in the still of night and even then just the occasional thumping that was distant and not disturbing.Staying here was on the majority the reason for our memorable and enjoyable first overseas family holiday so well recommended to anyone.P.s. we tried to extend our stay for four days but the Indonesian Prime Minister was arriving the next day after our due departure so the resort was booked out! Many Army officials and people checking out the complex the day before we left too. Also President George Bush has stayed here and several Australian government officials too so we were told by several taxi drivers.Hope you enjoy this report and your stay at the Patra :-)

<Content>Perfect Patra Having not been to Bali for over 7 years, we returned with some trepidation. However, upon arrival into Bali, and then transfer to The Patra Bali, all our concerns were completely erased. Our family of 2 adults and 3 children, along with our friends (2 adults and 1 child) stayed at The Patra for 8 nights and just loved it! The spacious club villa suits and beautiful grounds created a peaceful and relaxing break from the hussle and bussle of busy Kuta. The hotel grounds are just beautiful and the staff extremely helpful and kind. Our breakfasts buffet was always fresh with plenty of choice and variety. We dined in every night, with 3 restaurants to choose from as well as in-room dining, and the meals were great and well priced. We enjoyed after dinner strolls along the boardwalk between the beach and the hotel, just a fabulous view. The Day Spa ($US) and Salon ($Rupiah) were both well priced and the staff at both were very kind and professional. There were two groups of hawkers, but they stayed in their seperate areas, and apart from calling for you ocassionally, they kept their distance. They offered hair braiding, nail polishing, massages, clothes, watches etc. which were cheap! Certainly not off-putting, but offering guests the choice of buying without having to go into Kuta. There were many shuttle buses going into Kuta, as well as taxi's to drive you anywhere. There are 3 pools, with 1 an Adults pool only. The main pool is huge, as you swim you look out to sea! We all agreed that our stay at The Patra was great. We thoroughly recommend this resort to all families, as well as couples. The Patra is a place to return, we will definitely stay there for our next Bali holiday.

<Content>Great for Families We just spent 12 nights here with children 1 and 3yo in a club suite. We return to Bali every year and stay in different hotel and location every time. This time we chose the Patra as it seemed to best cater for the growing family. The good:Fabulous room for a family- kids in the massive close-off-able living room and us in the bedroom- we had 3 balconies and 2 tellies, enormous bathroom.Airport proximity- no noise problems and great entertainment for lil boys watching the planes come and go over the ocean. We often we to the airport side pool for a stickybeak.In house photographers- they patiently look millions of obligation free family portrauts over the period of our holiday and we got to choose the ones we liked for the most rediculously low prices.The swimming pools and pool bar- very friendly fun place to hang out - we met lots of lovely people - both guests and staff. Our kids were treated like vips.The spacious grounds and low rise, scattered room set up. (being in a the club wing stops you from being located too far from the pool/restaurant in the expansive grounds)The reasonably priced spa and salon in house.The reasonably priced drinks and food.The average:Can't walk to anything much from hotelMain pool a bit slimy here and thereGenerally a bit shabby round the edgesThe bad:Nothing! Would happily return. Excellent value for money and such a great set up for families. We didn't use the kids club so cannot comment on that but found a lovely local babysitter recommended by other guests and a nearby laundry that enabled us to go home with clean nicely packed clothes. We picked up lots of handy hints in the pool from regular guests of which there seem to be many.

<Content>best hotel in bali we have been staying at the patra bali for at least 10 years, it used to be the patra jasa, i think that must speak for itself, it is without a doubt the best place to stay in bali, the staff are always polite and helpfull, the food is wonderful the pools are the best, all three of them..... the hotel staff pick you up at the airport and take you back to the hotel which is only 5 mins away, they give you warm towels and cold drinks when you arrive. all the rooms are good ive tried most, my last trip i was put in the presidential suite room 200, amazing, out into my court yard and then into the pool only a few steps away, they do have royal suites but ive never been in one. the main pool has swim up bar and spa the little pool was outside our room, and the other pool is outside the royal villas, most people do there laps here, huge. they have an italian restaurant, the pizza is to die for, they have a japanese restaurant which i havnt tried but everyone says is great. the breakfast buffet offers everything you can imagine and the food in that restaurant at night is more traditional. they offer free shuttle bus or take a taxi for $2.50 we like to go into kuta to the markets and into the dvd shop were you can get the latest dvds for $1.00 each and then into starbucks for a cold drink, the hard rock is next door to that and a must for a meal one or two nights, the meals are so good and so big we often share, you can stay and party on at the hard rock till really late, lots of fun. the patra bali caters for everything and everyone, if your thinking of going to bali this is the place to stay. its close to the airport but you wont hear the planes, not a problem, and far enough from kuta to relax but only 5 min ride if you want markets or night life, you can just walk along the beach and you will hit the discovery shopping centre, go in and shop on its many levels and then out the front and your almost at the markets.

<Content>loved it!!!! i stayed at the patra with my mum dad and little sister..im 18 so i went expecting every night to be a big party but it was pretty dead. i was a bit disapointed at first but it gave me a chance to sit and talk with the staff. i was at the coffee shop bar fairly often and even though it would only be me the bartenders and a few other randoms i had the best time. i even met up with a few of them and treated them to lunch and went clubbing with one of them. the hotel itself is so beautiful although its so big it can be annoying getting around at times. the breakfasts were soo good as well. the patra is awesome just make sure you meet the bar staff they are the absolute best!

<Content>Realist Review Firstly, reviews that stated that this hotel was on par with Le Meridien Tanah Lot were out. We stayed at Le Med same time last year and wished we had done so again. Although we were only in the hotel for a total of 5 days (in transit to Sheraton, Lombok) so this was not convenient.  We were upgraded for our first 2 night stay to a Club Suite Room which was large yes, but the airconditioning was struggling to cool the room, big double bed was hard as rock and we were a fair walk from restaurants and swimming pool which was hard for my parents in their late 60;s. The Golf Buggies used by concieges came in handy for them when they could get one. The concieges, most restaurant and maintenance staff did not appear to understand any english at all and we had to resort to charades to request a Bucket of Ice, repair our TV and request a quote for car to Ubud. (Driver mind you was excellant). I dont expect anyone to speak english far from it but hotel staff should have a basic knowledge of English as I do of Indonesian.The Main Restaurant was not upto scratch either, ripped cushions on chairs, damaged furniture, cracked teapot and very slow service if any. On checking in for the 2nd time on our return journey back from Lombok we requested 2 rooms closer to Restaurant and Pool and were handed two room keys and told our room number and left to find the room by ourselves. We had no directions given and the baggage boy just walked off. Having not complained up until this point I finally lost it when the rooms we were given were slightly closer however overlooked the Petro Chemical Tanks of the Airport. Cannot believe we did not check into another hotel but we kept going and got moved back to our original upgraded Club Suites, bad airconditioning, leaky toilet and hard bed an all.Worst stay in Bali Yet!!!!

<Content>Great Room Our first visit to the Patra Bali, and it certainly wont be the last.Our Club studio suite was wonderfull, spotless, large bathroom, lovely bed, dining room and lounge. The hotel surroundings were lovely, and beautifully maintained. The Hotel staff were helpful and very friendly. Overall a wonderful place to stay in bali, and the standard of the hotel was spot on for bali standards.

<Content>Best Hotel I've stayed at in Bali! After having been to Discovery Karika, Le Meridien Nirwana, etc etc etc....this hotel blew them all away! The deluxe SUITES were amazingly large, and in perfect conditon. They contain 2 large new tv's and seperate bedroom, rest area, bathroom, sitting room and dining table. They are by far the largest rooms I hve seen or stayed in worldwide.The location is great in the quite area of Tuban, just a quick 1 minute taxi ride from kuta square. However this hotel is ON the beach. literlly jump over the infinity edge pool and your in the sand. The staff are amazingly friendly and it is oh so easy to strike up long conversations with them all. Food is great and the in-pool bar serves all the drinks you need. Look out for Soma at the pool, trust me, he will make your stay so much more enjoyable and is an asset to the Hotel.

<Content>Be treated like royalty We have only just gotten home from our stay in Bali. After reading reviews here on trip advisor and finding out that our other two choices were fully booked, we decided the weekend before we flew out to stay at the Patra. BEAUTIFUL! We were truly treated like royalty. My husband, daughter (7) and myself booked a Deluxe suite and were upgraded when we arrived to an embassy suite (2 storeys). When we first arrived they welcomed us with a nice cold towel to wipe our faces and a cold drink. I read a few negative reviews here before going and was a little worried about the aircraft noise, but I can honestly say that I thought it was louder when I went to the green day spa and had a massage I could hear them lounder overhead as they were directly over than I could at the patra. They don't fly directly over the hotel. It's quite a bit further down the beach. We did notice mainly Taiwanese and Indonesians staying at the hotel with only a couple of Australians and a few Europeans. I'm actually glad it's this way as I hate to be embarrassed by fellow Australians who write themselves off drinking as I've seen in some hotels in Bali. We celebrated our 9th wedding anniversary and had Tina from the kids club baby sit our daughter while we went out to La Lucciola's for dinner. We got home from a gorgeous night out to have someone from the hotel knock on our door with a cake incribed happy 9th wedding anniversary and signed card from the staff. They had been waiting for us to return to the hotel to give it to us all night. They are just gorgeous staff.I'm not sure if the hotel has read the reviews from here but everything I've read I can truly say didn't happen to us. We did notice a couple of ants, but it IS Bali, and it's impossible to stop them getting in if you have food around. We had a nice platter of fruit when we arrived, and they'd covered it with plastic so we didn't have that problem I guess the other reviewer here complained about with the ants on her chocolate. No problems with ants and food for us. Our room cleaner must've realised we had our daughter staying with us after day 1 and we were treated to little folded animals with a handtowel in the bathroom when we'd return to the room. Loved the elephant! haha.Eating in the restaurants were cheap also. We had the theme nights, (Balinese and Mongolian BBQ) and I still say they're cheaper than any mean you'd get in Australia. My favourite meal of all was the fettucine misto de mare in the italian restaurant, OMG I've never had one like it. My mouth is watering just thinking about it, And the pizzas are yummy too, cooked in a woodfired oven.The lounge and sunken bar have happy hour from 5-7 every night, (don't worry, you won't miss it, they ring a bell so you can hear it if you're in the pool area) 2 for 1 drinks. We tried the japanese restaurant, which was great, but on the pricey side (again, not for Australia, more the pricey side of Bali)Most guests we spoke to have tried other hotels in Bali and are very loyal to this one. I think we're going to be another loyal guest as I couldn't fault it. Another Australian couple we spoke to even asked the italian restaurant for a special order. They were only too happy to cook them lobster thermidor. Will be back to see Dwi, Tina and Sylvia for sure.NOTE: Complaints about the different prices in taxi fares are not the fault of the hotel either. Stick with bluebird taxis. Their taxis are metered and it never cost us more than AU$2 to get to Kuta. Just ask concierge to order you a bluebird taxi, sit in the lounge and they will come let you know when it's arrived and even open the door for you. How easy is that.

<Content>The perfect Balinese experience - WE LOVE IT!! My husband and I just come back from The Patra....the best thing that happened in our lives!!! We loved Patra. We come back yesterday, but I cannot stop thinking in that hotel, the lovely staff, the room, the breakfast (!) the swimming pool...every detail simply AMAZING.They treated us if we were the only guests in he hotel. Even with 2 days raining (a lot) we enjoy our stay in Bali. In the second day, was our 4th wedding anniversary. So then, in the morning we asked for a nice restaurant to have a special dinner. The receptionist ask us the reason and then we explain about our anniversary Guess what: when we came back for the bedroom in the afternoon, we found flowers, a dedicated cake decorated  4th anniversary and a gracious card, signed but the staff and management. How such care!! The know how to set up the ambience! The last night we were having dinner in the italian restaurant, and then, musicians came to play specially for our table...couldn't be more romantic!They don't have (yet) direct access to beach, but it's under construction...but you have many options of beach.The room was spacious and very comfortable (specially the bed!!!) The bathroom was huge and had a bathtub for two!! The breakfast: AMAZING! Because they received a lot of japaneses, you'll find sushis and sashimis in the breakfast...but also, pancakes, fruits, cereal, lot os bread, tea, coffee....The hotel is really next to the airport, but the planes didn't bothered us...and we enjoyed the hotel until the last minute (because you need only 5 minutes to do your flight check in.To go to Kuta, you gonna spend USD 2,50...but if you arrange in advance they have free shuttle bus for Kuta.Tis hotel is clean and quite new (5 years old). We definitely wanna come back for The Patra. A great hotel to stay!!

<Content>Overall a great stay We stayed at the patra bali in June 2007 for 12 nights. We requested a room close to the pool but when we got there our room was so far away from the lobby and the pool we had to get a golf buggy there. After complaining to the manager we were told that we had booked a deluxe room and only the deluxe suites are near the pool. After much negotiation and outlaying a little more cash we moved to a suite and were very happy. The suites are much bigger and nicer and it was a step away from the lobby and the pool. The pool is really nice and Gunawan the pool attendent is the nicer guy you'l meet. The breakfast was good, dinner nights were really nice and room service good too. The spa is really nice but expensive, they also have a beauty salon with much the same stuff but cheaper and not as fancy. The hotel was a little far out for our liking, but easy to get a cab or catch the free shuttle to kuta. The beach is under construction so a bit of an eyesore but didnt really bother us. Planes go over a bit but not that noisy except a few at night. Overall the patra was a very nice hotel, very friendly staff, probably won't stay there again only because we like to try different hotels and it was a little far out, but would definately recommend it to others.

<Content>Relaz and beatiful resort We enjoyed staying at the resort. The villa consist of spacious living room and bathroom (huge bathtub) and middle size bedroom. It was clean  comfortable.The spa was below our expectation as I think they employed the partime therapists. I was disappointed with the treatment, not only because of the skill but also the time. We signed up a 120 minutes treatment but it finished 1/2 hour earlier. The breakfast was good. We enjoyed sitting near the pool while having our breakfast. The pool view was great, overlooking the sea, but there was construction going on. But, don't worry, it is not too noisy.Staff were friendly and helpful. We like the resort landscapping very much. Although the resort just next to the airport but you will never been disturb by the noise.Dinner not much of variety.

<Content>xmas in bali In december 2006 my family stayed at the Patra Bali for the 3rd time in 2006. Once again we had a fantastic time, we were upgraded to 2 suites without any fuss. We considered staying at another hotel but you can not do better than the Patra.The rooms are fantastic, the staff are wonderful and the grounds are in perfect condition.They have introduced theme nights such as a barbeque night, a seafood night and others which are very reasonably priced and its all you can eat for the price.On xmas eve and xmas day the hotel put on special dinners and even santa claus made an appearance. Pretty impressive considering the balinese do not celebrate xmas.Another bonus is that they upgrading the beach area with walking paths and a swimming beach which will remove the sea wall between the hotel and the water.Overall for value for money you won't find a better place than the Patra Bali and when you go say hello to one of the pool attendants Goonawan who has looked after us on every visit.

<Content>Beautiful hotel too isolated We stayed for 2 weeks at the Patra. The hotel itself was beautiful and we stayed in a delux suite which was also lovely. The grounds are immaculate and the staff are friendly and anytime you went to tip the staff refused which is a change from most hotels to say the least.However I would not stay there again, the hotel is right next door to the airport and although the noise didnt bother us it was too isolated.There are no supermarkets or really anything surrounding the hotel. Which means if you do run out of drinks etc you do without of pay the expensive hotel prices. The shuttle bus runs about 4 times a day but the the times are not convienent to go out for dinner with the times being 3pm then 9pm. The taxis in the hotel compound will not put the metre on as they are looking for a higher fare. We did walk one day and had to walk for about 30 minutes before we found one coming down the road. The best option is to walk down the beach and there is a small lane way just past the Bali Hai hotel. Which was fine during the day but in the evening the lighting isnt good enough to do this safely.The swimming pool looks fantastic but isnt deep enough. On the hot days because it was relatively shallow it was like bath water, which is nice but not refreshing.Being a 5 star hotel things were expensive $5 AUS for a coke from the mini bar. We had one free dinner included in our package and ordered drinks 2 cocktails, a smoothie and a small bottle of water $30 AUS which was comparatively very expensive.The beach sellers which were permanantly camped out the front stretch of pebbles, there is no beach in front of the hotel. Were also very expensive compared to anywhere else. Not much action close by for kids, couples, young people I would not stay there again.

<Content>Awesome, best resort in South Kuta!!!! My girlfriend and I stayed at the Patra for the first time at the end of October 2006 for 12 nights. After walking through many hotels from Legian down to the Patra, the Patra stood out to us the most. The Patra had the largest grounds, it's huge! The main three pools are awesome and are extremely clean, the service from the staff is great and the pool boys are always happy and friendly and are always willing to go out of their way to help you in any way they possibly can. Our rooms were spacious and very, very clean. The concierge was great they always had our wake up calls perfectly on time and they would give us a call when we had the shuttle bus booked and we were running late so we didn't miss it. They even have buggies to pick you up from your room and drive you around the resort to where ever you want to go, Even when we came back to the resort at 4am after a big night out in kuta they would gladly take us back to our room from the taxi so we didn't have to walk. Thats's service!!Breakfast has eveything you could imagine and more from egg to chicken tandori, we also would get a pizza and drink deal for lunch by the pool which was perfect as we didn't have to leave our deck chairs. The hotel has a shuttle bus 5 times to Kuta a day and to walk into Kuta is 15minutes along the beach which is beautiful at sunset. By the end of our trip we made many friends at the Patra and after 12 night there it still wasn't enough as we didn't want to leave!! I would recomend this resort to anyone and we will be staying there again early 2007.
