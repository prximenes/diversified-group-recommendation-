<Content>Good solid hotel! Booked a week with the family at the Marriott Frankfurt. It is a good business/conference center hotel, with great staff. Only downside is the location, as not much was available around the hotel for eatting options.Was upgraded to a suite, and enjoyed the extra room. Valet was quick and efficient! Concierge lounge was plentiful, with plenty of room to sit.Would definately think about staying in Heidelberg over Frankfurt just for the location if I was going to stay in the area again and not need to be in Frankfurt daily.

<Content>Delivered what it promised (top hotel) I booked online using the hotel website (it was the only way where I found a very convenient family package for a Saturday night stay, called Escape! Family Package which included, buffet breakfast and a welcome amenity). My wife, two children (ages 3 and 7) and I were in one of the larger guest corner rooms with two queen beds, including access to the executive floor. On arrival we were greeted in our room by a large basket of fresh fruit and in the evening we got one complimentary pizza for each (just watch ouot that the room delivery is not complimentary, so it is charged). We requested a babysitter to take care of the kids on Sat night and even though it took several days of emailing and calling the hotel they finally confirmed it the day before. Once you get to talk to the hotel Concierge you are done, so don't talk with the lobby.In general the service is wonderful and the hotel is at the level of a 5-star hotel. It was an expensive weekend get-away with the family but worth every penny.Finally, I think the hotel works great for business travelers. Apart from the obvious things it is located in front of a tram stop and across the street there's a very big fair-exhibition site complex.

<Content>Loved It!! We stayed 4 nights, 5 days at the Frankfurt Marriott. Our room was on the 38th floor and we had a view of the city. Upon our arrival, we were greeted by a friendly staff that spoke excellent English. Our room was immaculate and fresh towels were given every day. We ate at the Champions Sports Bar  Grill twice and both times it was excellent with outstanding service. We needed directions to the American consulate one day and the concierge printed out directions. There is a cafe in the hotel and we had breakfast there - coffee and a scone. A full breakfast is offered but will cost 26 Euros. We didn't try it so I can't say if it is worth the 26 Euros or not.

<Content>Great hotel for Frankfurt I stayed here for business and was very pleased with the hotel. The location is great, the rooms were good, and the staff is great. The bar at the bottom of the hotel was also good and had nice food as well. I'd stay here again for business and would recommend it to anyone travelling to Frankfurt.

<Content>Very good location, comparable with Marriott standards elsewhere. The Frankfurt Center Marriott has a very goodlocation near the S line train, the convention center, and (a few S line stops away) the Hbf main train station. Excellent room and facilities with friendly staff. Just like Marriott hotels in other parts of the world.

<Content>Excellent Base for exploring or Business Spent 2 nights first weekend in March. Staff was OUTSTANDING! Very friendly... Hotel has multiple dining options, nice sized room for Europe. Very close to fairgrounds, downtown... Only drawback is parking... the adjacent parking garage is expensive (27E/day) - and no in  out charges... Othere than that, the hotel was outstanding....

<Content>Excellent base for a weekend in Frankfurt We stayed here for one night in May 2007.It was the 80th anniversary for Marriott so we had a special rate of 80鈧? great for a stay with breakfast at 37th floor with panorama on the city!The room was comfortable and large, the breakfast the best and richest breakfast we had in a hotel.This Marriott is not located in the city-center, but with a few minutes by tram or bus(just in front of the entrance) you can reach the city. Probably for the location it is the best for business, but also in case of tourism it is a great stay.

<Content>Great Experience Been through Frankfurt many times but never stopped to sightsee. Booked the Marriott Frankfurt for 4 nights in early February 2008 and was not disappointed. Taxi was 25 euros from and to the airport; direct and quick. If you are saving money take a direct train from the airport to the Frankfurt central station, then a quick Tram ride on line 16 or 17 to the front door of the hotel. We were upgraded to the Concierge level ( floor 39 and above) and had access to the free Concierge lounge. (including beer and wine.) The restaurants in the hotel were excellent and reasonably priced. The hotel has special two day unlimited Frankfurt subway/tram/train tickets for about 7 euros. Good for return to the airport also. Took a Frankfurt day trip to get to know the city, then used the 7 euro ticket to go everywhere else. The hotel is directly across the street front the Frankfurt Fair Convention center. Caution! Don't try to book the hotel during a Trade Fair. The price of all hotels rises exponentially during trade shows. Get to know Leonardo the Bell Captain. His assistance and knowledge was most helpful.

<Content>Okeish I guess, would not go back not fantastic, not bad, but soulless. The rooms are smallish by any standard, the decor is a lurid green that seems designed to hide dirt rather than please the eye and the food is nothing to write home about (breakfast particularly disappointing). The beds are comfortable but very soft, which can be baad for the back after a while (I foudn I enjoyed the first hour or so but worke up with backache).If you can get a cheap rate and are just after somewhere to sleep near the fair, go, otherwise find something else: there are plenty of good 5 star hotels in Frankfurt where you can get much more for your money (and better food too).

<Content>Good lively business hotel Stayed at the Marriott for a few business days in Frankfurt. The location isn't downtown but opposite the Messe center. This is a busy hotel with lots of airlines and corporates using them as their 'default' hotel. Rooms are quite okay and the breakfast excellent. The only problem I came across was the Japanse sushi place on the ground floor - totally incredible expensive - don't go! There is another sushi place 10mins walk away (towards the central station) that will cost you 1/3 of the place in the hotel.

<Content>Luxurious crash pad The Marriott in Frankfurt is what you want to see at the end of a long trip from somewhere, before you have to go somewhere else. Rapid efficient check-in, spacious rooms, and those soft comfy beds. OK, we agree this is a rather pricey stay versus what may else be on offer in Frankfurt but oh so worth it. (Years and years ago, I came into Frankfurt, dead sick with a bad cold, to fly out the next day and needed a really cheap place just to sleep. Went to the Tourist Office in the train station and after ascertaining my price range - extremely cheap - sent me to this place just opposite the station where the desk manager took my money and asked me if I wanted a woman as well. Gee, sorry, not tonight, ok?) Frankfurt is not - at least in my view - a place you want to spend any time in or those expensive euros. It is a crossroads and an airport, period. We stayed here on the way home after a long road trip and the rest made the remainder of the trip easy. Great expansive breakfast as well. Typical high end Marriott experience and highly recommended.

<Content>Exhibition grounds accross the road! Excellent spot! I stayed for one night at the Frankfurt Marriott and was very pleased with my stay. Despite the fact this is an older hotel; the views from your room on the 21st floor are breathtaking! As usual the bedding in the rooms is unbeatable and what you expect from a Marriott as well the service, which is perfect. The hotel is in a very convenient spot if you need to go to the exhibition grounds (Frankfurt Messe) and the financial district is literally at your doorstep. If you need time to relax or work, this is definitely the place to be. I would not recommend Frankfurt for a romantic getaway as there are many other places in Germany with more character (Wiesbaden, Munich). Overall experience: great! Highly recommendable to business travellers as the location is spot on!

<Content>Nice Hotel but elevators need new buttons I recently stayed at this hotel for 5 days. The rooms are nice and have most amenities. The bed was very comfortable. As others have stated, breakfast in the executive lounge is very nice with plenty of options. The common area of the hotel is a bit dated but overall the hotel has a pleasant atmosphere. The hotel is very conveniently located. The tram stop is right outside the hotel's front door and gets you to the central rail station in about 5 minutes.Like another guest, I had a bit of a problem retrieving a fax that I knew had been sent to the hotel. The hotel employee in the business center told me my fax must've gone to the the General Manager's office but she could not get it for me because the GM's office would not open until 9AM. I find it hard to believe that not one hotel employee could've immediately accessed the GM office's fax machine.Finally, the control panels in the elevators in this hotel are absolutely horrible. During my stay, guests were constantly joking in the elevator how many times they would have to hit the button before the button would light up. I can't tell you how many times I witnessed people miss their floors because they couldn't get the elevator button for their floor to register with the elevator.

<Content>Good hotel, nice location Stayed for two nights recently when we came for the Christmas markets. We had a Club room for myself, wife and 10 yr old. The room had a large King size bed, and would have been spacious enough for a rollaway, but the bed was big enough. The room was clean, the bathroom was clean with copious hot water. The lclub lounge on the 43rd floor gave a great view over Frankfurt. The snacks in the lounge were tasy and well proprtioned. Breakfast was good and service was very prompt. The location on Hamburger Allee, whilst not in the city centre was fine for us, as it was just around the corner from the Natural History Museum, which is a great place for a 10 year old on a rainy day.We didn't eat at any of the hotel restaurants, but the selection was certainly wide.Overall, a nice hotel, typical of the brand.

<Content>Great Business Style Hotel This is a great business style hotel in the heart of Frankfurt. It is easy to access from the train station, and only a few blocks away from the tube station. The rooms are very modern and clean, and the staff is very efficient. This hotel is a true testament to the financial growth in Frankfurt.

<Content>Splendid view If you insist on an even numbered room, and preferably --20 or --22, you'll get an astonishing vieuw of the city center, one of the most CBD-like you can find in Europe. Besides, this is the typical Marriott: tasteful room (on the smaller side), spotlessly clean, luxurious bathroom. Surprinsingly there is no pool, which is a shame. More surprinsingly, you can park free of charge in the area, and there is a tramway stop just outside the hotel. You could'nt find more useful. A sure bet.

<Content>Great Stay My wife  I stayed at the Frankfurt Marriott Hotel for 4 nights from Wed May 30 鈥?Sun June 3, 2007. The lobby is nice and modern. There is an American style sports bar, a French restaurant, and a caf茅 in the lobby. We did not dine at any of them, opting instead to dine at German restaurants in the city. The room was spacious, modern, and clean. We were on a high floor with an excellent view of Frankfurt. The concierge and front-desk staff was regular.The hotel is located across the street from the convention center. The area was pleasant and we felt safe walking around at night. There is not too much nearby, however. There is a considerable about of greenery around the hotel. There are no convenience or grocery stores nearby, so get what you need at Frankfurt main station. The street tram stops directly in front of the hotel and is just three stops from Frankfurt main station. There are plenty of cabs as well. Frankfurt main station is actually only about a 20 鈥?25 minute walk from the hotel. There are 2 or 3 small nightclubs in between Frankfurt main station and the hotel.The hotel deserves its 4 star rating. I would definitely stay there again if visiting Frankfurt.

<Content>Great Frankfurt Views  We stayed here one night (27 June) after a 5 day tour of Budapest, just before taking our flight back to Singapore. Had chosen this hotel due to its high tripadvisor ratings as well as its great city views and reasonable weekday rates. My top choice was the Steigenberger Frankfurter Hof but its weekday rate was vastly different from that of its weekend rates. However, the Marriott had offered THE SAME weekday and weekend rates, so it was the obvious choice ....I had booked a Superior corner room (a whopping 570 square feet!) as it was much bigger than most Deluxe and Executive rooms (a miserable 258-269 square feet). It was even bigger than a Junior Suite (398 square feet) but still cheaper cos it has no separation between its bedroom and sitting area. To our surprise, we had to open two doors before getting into our room, as this offered us much quietness and added security. And it had a huge 6 people dinning/office table, too. The bathroom has a double sink, and was huge as well. As we would be in Frankfurt for less than 24 hours, this Hotel had offered us the much desired, unbeatable aerial views of the city, which was great I thought!Free breakfast and daily drinks/snacks was to be had at its 43rd floor Executive lounge. Surprisingly, we had bumped into many Singaporeans (mostly Singapore Airlines crew staff) at the lounge and in the hotel's lifts. Minibar was free in the room (it had ample fruit juices, beers, mineral water and even small bottles of hard liquor!). And, oh yes, 3 apples of the much hated, green colour type! (why can't they simply offer the red ones?) Overall, this is a 1970's chain Hotel meant more for the Business people as it was a good 10 euros taxi ride to both the Romer for sightseeing and the Zeil for shopping. And so I had chosen the Schlosshotel Kronberg (on the outskirts of Frankfurt, see my review) on a pre-Budapest trip for some uniqueness and this hotel for a post-Budapest trip for some great aerial views. Though I wasn't disappointed with this Hotel, I wasn't too impressed with its chain hotel feel and its smoke filled lobby area either. Overall, its a good choice for a weekday inexpensive stay in Frankfurt.

<Content>Great stay at the Marriott I stayed at the Marriott for one night (7 Jun 07) while in Frankfurt. I booked on the Marriott sight and was upgraded to Executive Level by Marcus at the front desk . . . thanks a million. The Marriott is a beautiful hotel, centrally located in downtown Frankfurt with a great group of folks working there (friendly and helpful). The Executive Level was just what we needed after our stay in Africa. The food in the lounge was good and the beds in the room were like sleeping on a cloud. I didn't get to see much of the hotel since I was very tired but what I did see and the people I encountered were all great. I will be going back and the Executive Level is the way to go. The friend that stayed at the Marriott with me is a Hilton Honor's Member and he said he's changing to a Marriott Rewards Membership. I think that says it all.

<Content>Magnificent Marriott I actually stayed here in December on Christmas eve but didn't have time to write a review. As I will be returning next week to this wonderful hotel I thought I'd write my belated review now.Myself, my son, and my fiance spent Christmas eve here while attending a show at the theater. Check in personnel were quick, courteous, and helpful. It was a great first impression. The hotel is located on the higher floors of what seems to be part of an office building. As such, the view from our room was magnificent and breathtaking. I had booked a double room but upon entering realized I had been given a suite/family room. There was a sitting area with mini-fridge, dining table, and CD player. There were two bathrooms one of which was extremely spacious and contained the shower and bath. The soaps and lotions were of quite a superb quality. Our bed was kingsized and immensely comfortable and there was a smaller bed set up for my son. We had a beautiful sitting room with a lovely couch and chair. I was extremely pleased with the room. In making my reservations I put in a special request to have a cheese and fruit plate upon arrival. Not 10 minutes after we arrived the plate arrived and had a delicious assortment of various cheeses, bread, apples, grapes, and varied other fruits. I was in heaven! We'd made reservations for Christmas eve dinner at Brasseri Ici. Unfortunately I neglected to ask what was being served (goose) and as a vegetarian I could not eat there. However, the rest of the menu seemed superb and the restaurant was beautiful. I'm sure that a meateater would have been well please and the food would no doubt have lived up to the high standards as the rest of the hotel. Breakfast in the morning was unbelievable! A vast and varied assortment of fruits, cheeses, panckakes, waffles, juices, cereals, pastries, eggs to order, and many other treats. I think I'd return just to eat breakfast there again!Every time I visit Frankfurt I will stay in the Marriott. From the front desk personnel to the breakfast table this hotel is wonderful. It is definitely worth every penny spent!

<Content>Great Business Hotel The Marriott Frankfurt is a great business hotel, centrally located near the railway station and major roadways in Frankfurt. It is also situated in the tallest building in town, though in all honesty the views of the city, while panoramic, are nothing much to write home about. What I liked about the Marriott was that it was easy to get around town from. The parking though was ridiculously expensive, 10 Euro each time you parked! Keep in mind that in Germany there are parking spots reserved for women so make sure you park in the right spot! Another point to note is that a couple of wrong turns from the Marriott (very easy when your GPS talks to you in German) and you find yourself in this huge red light district, not the ideal place to be with family around. By and large this is a nice hotel though, decent rooms, though a little worn, but good food (nice sports bar and coffee shop) and excellent location.

<Content>Marriott Frankfurt is a great hotel for business travelers. I stayed at the Marriott Frankfurt for a week during October of 2006. The room was outstanding and a decent size for a European hotel. As to Marriott's usual standards, the bed was at the high end of what you can expect at a good hotel.For doing business, the Marriott is nice and close to the financial district (walking distance) and right beside the large convention center. There is also public transportation (trolley) immediately outside the front doors with easy access to all the tourist sites in Frankfurt.The main terminal is also within walking distance (10 min) and there is plenty to explore in and around the station. You can also catch one of the out of city trains for longer trips.The tower itself is extremely high and offers outstanding views of the city and park situated to the side of the building. There is also an American style restaurant off the main lobby that offers great tasting ribs and wings. I don't usually visit hotel restaurants (especially casual ones) but the restaurant is fantastic to have a beer and a snack before heading off to bed after a long day working. The staff at the front desk were outstanding and managed to process my checkin in only a couple of minutes. I also left my bags in storage on the last day while I toured the markets and musuems of Frankfurt. If you stumble accross a street vender in an outdoor market selling Brats on a kaiser, try one (they're delicious!)I hightly recommend a business stay while in Frankfurt at the Marriott!

<Content>Everything You Expect From the Big M Usually when I stay in Frankfurt, I go to a small, out of the way hotel near the Bahnhof for convenience and low price, but this trip I found that there was a major trade show in the city and all hotel rates were out of sight. Calling Marriott's international booking desk allowed me to get literally the last available room at this hotel and I was not disappointed. It was worth the price and I was impressed with the small touches which, of course, in an upscale property are expected. I think that Marriotts abroad in general manage to mix the Americanisms with the local culture enough to please most travelers, even the most jaded business persons who are used to and expect top services. All aspects fo the hotel were excellent. I encountered no problems and spent a peaceful evening in the great Marriott bed. Because I had a dinner engagement elsewhere in the city, I arrived and left in a taxi, so I did not see much of the local area, but it is true that the location is not the best if one wants to be near the central areas of the city, the railroad or airport. Prices, of course, are steep and a 2 night stay can easily exceed $1000 US. Otherwise, I will recommend this hotel to anyone and hope to go again myself.

<Content>Happy I chose the Marriott After reviewing both the Maritim and the Marriott, I am very happy I chose the Marriott. Great location - just a 5 min. walk to the train station. Great hotel - lots of food options. Great rooms - high speed internet, comfy beds, nice bathrooms. This hotel was the highlight of my Germany stay. Try and get access to the Executive floor by booking a business room. It's worth it - great food, lounge with beverages and 2 computers with free internet access. Only issues were the old carpets (everything else is renovated except the carpets) and slow elevators (they are due for an upgrade). Other than that, this place is fantastic and I will be back!

<Content>Good Marriott Hotel A friend of mine and I stayed one night at the Frankfurt Marriott hotel in early September 2006. This was the last night of our vacation prior to returning to the states. We booked our room at least six months in advance for a rate of $182 per night USD. Upon our arrival (I had requested an early arrival), there was not a room available. We were being picked up by a tour company shortly after check-in and needed to freshen up and store our bags. The hotel was able to put us up in a tiny room temporarily and by the time we returned, they had moved our luggage and items to our reserved room. The beds were extremely comfortable and the rooms were very clean. Frankfurt, as a city iteself, is not really a travel destination but more of a business hub and travel gateway city. There's not much to see or do in Frankfurt. Try the Green Line tours for options and get out to the Rhine River for a cruise.

<Content>Fine hotel Having recently stayed in a couple of small, idiosyncratic French hotels I was ready to dislike this example of large, corporate, standardised fare- but I have to admit staying here for the bookfair was a very pleasant experience.The huge views from the thirtieth floor room, the clean, welcoming room (six pillows on the bed- what a treat!), helpful staff everywhere; I can't really pick fault. The breakfast room was also a delight: call me naive and untravelled, but I've never had the opportunity to have steak and roast pork for breakfast (along with all the more traditional stuff) and couldn't resist. A tip for those attending events at the messe just across the road: if the taxis are as in short supply outside the hotel for you as they were for us, hop on the tram down to the central station just a few stops away and all will be well, with loads of taxis and not too many people after them.

<Content>A place to stay, for sure! I had booked this hotel for a very short trip in Frankfurt. I do know the Marriott standards, so I鈥檇 expect something good. That was the case.The room was booked directly from the Marriott website. Nothing fancy there. There was some packages to choose for and also regulars rates, with your choice of room. I鈥檇 choose a 鈥淩omance Package鈥? No romance as I was alone, but it comes with a free upgrade to Executive floor, a plate of fresh fruit, a bottle of Champagne, a three service diner at the restaurant, free in-room Internet Acces, free Minibar, and of course free access to the lounge, on floor 44.The room was small regarding US standards but correct in size for an European鈥檚 one. The view was really good (floor 39). Everything was fine in the room, with a king bed and a load of pillows.The bathroom was just perfect, probably refurbished recently. There was slippers and bathrobe.The health room on level 1 is big enough, with all you need to train yourself. There is also steam, sauna and whirlpool. Too bad that the last one was very very cold! Do not count on a pool (Yes, it鈥檚 a shame).My diner at 鈥淏rasserie Ici鈥?was really good, but the service far too slow!Overall, my experience was really good, with very helpful and friendly staff, from check-in to concierge, from lounge attendant to business center crew. There is still some point to improve, but the place worth your money.I will, for sure, stay here again in the future

<Content>Wonderful Hotel We stayed at the Marriott July 17th for one night before flying home. We actually wanted a good nights sleep. The beds in the room were extremly comfortable .. linens were good quality and pillows were plentiful.The room was large with a fantastic bathroom filled with soft towels ,extra mirrors ,huge tube and lots of tolietries. we took tram 16 across the street from the hotel to the main area for dinner. Our meal at Aldolphs was a traditional German dinner sitting at long wooden tables enjoying interesting conversation with a variety of friendly people The dinner for 3 came to about $40. 00 Euros this included apple wine and beer. We will defintely stay at this Marriott again.

<Content>Good stay at the Marriott I found the Marriott Frankfurt to be an excellent hotel. The location is fantastic for both business and pleasure. Rooms are nice with great bedding and boast fantastic views of Frankfurt. The service is attentive and the quality of the restaurants is great. I would absolutely recommend it.

<Content>5 star treatment We were three guys from Finland spending one night at Marriott Frankfurt.Hotel is luxurious as expected, not brand new but still a very positive experience. Two bathrooms in a hotel room was something new for us :)Great views because 26th is the lowest floor you can have a room in :)Sauna was very interesting experience from a finnish point of view. Champions sports bar in the lobby seemed to be very popular, great food indeed.

<Content>Great stay at Frankfurt Marriott We stayed for one night at the Frankfurt Marriott before flying out of Frankfurt the next morning. I got a great rate using Priceline. The bed was wonderful and we had a great view of Frankfurt from our hotel room.We enjoyed the sports bar downstairs and everyone we talked to from check-in to check-out was so friendly. We would not hestitate staying at this hotel again.

<Content>1st Class We have just returned from Frankfurt from a long weekend together. This hotel was excellent from start to finish. The staff were very professional and extremely helpful. As for the rooms, these were of a good size with excellent facilities and the bed was very comfy ( haven't slept on any thing like it before). We ate at champions bar and the food and service were exceptional. Would definitely return to this hotel although not a lot to do in Frankfurt.

<Content>Constant problems at Marriott!!!! I stayed at the marriott in Frankfurt for 3 days in November 2005 with a business colleauge for a series of meetings.From check-in to check out we had problems with staff being uninformed of our situation, having booked meeting rooms, requesting payment from us on a number of times when our company had sent full payment before hand by a bank transfer etc.We checked in and the lobby was less impressive than I had seen in photos... The location was out of the central area but it was only 10 euro in a taxi to the main shopping district.At check-in, they had our reservation but had no details that we had sent a bank transfer and that rooms were paid for etc. Also extra cash had been sent to the hotel to cover any additional expenses we may charge and a meeting room that we had booked, none of this was recorded.We had to explain everything to her and was then asked several times are we sure the rooms are paid for like we were trying to get away with something. Very Frustrating!!!!We were staying on the executive floor and got an excellent corporate rate as we had also booked a meeting room through the conference centre. Our rate was only 179.00 euro per executive room per night, with only 2 rooms booked... Excellent rate.When i went up to the rooms I found they were very small. I had tried to think when I had stayed in such a small hotel room before and only Paris entered my mind. Nice classic decor, not to my taste at all but comfortable bed with duvet.Bathroom was outdated and the shower was over the bath. I have not stayed in a hotel room for a very long time that did not have a seperate shower to the bath (I stay in a lot of 5 star hotels)...The mini bar was complimentary and re-stocked daily including a full bottle of red wine, also the internet in the room was complimentary so very good value.The executive lounge on the top floor was comfortable with drinks available all day, breakfast was also served in this lounge for the executive floor guests.Fantastic canapes were served from 5-7pm, we enjoyed them so much some nights we skipped dinner.Gym is located in the hotel with good facilities but no indoor swimming pool. Hotel had steam and saunas as well but they did not seem to be working...I have been lucky to stay in some amazing hotels around the world. This one in hindsight was pretty average and staff were appaling.However saying that the value rate of 179 euros per night for executive floor was well worth it. The rooms were adequate and comfortable, hotel was clean. I am just used to a lot better.

<Content>Nice but not the best location for Tourists The hotel of course is well appointed and they let us check in very early which was great seeing as we had just completed a long haul from Sydney and arrived at 7am very tired.The rooms are nice although the bathroom fogs up with steam and takes a while to clear which can be annoying if you're keen to get moving.Good views from up high near the Exec levels.Staff speak very good English and they're coffee is good in the cafe near the entrance, even if a bit expensive.The only real problem was the supervisor/manager of the American Sports Bar who very publicly and angrily would chastise his staff at the bar, to the point where it was really embarrassing for guests. Oh, and the Fosters logo with the map of Australia hasn't got Tasmania, which some may say is not a problem.As far as getting to the city centre, it's not a walk, but is an easy 5 minute walk to the train and once you work out how to operate the ticketing machine then it really is very simple. Watch out for cab drivers who take you all around the world to get home once you mention you wish to go to the Marriott.We had the luxury of a local friend who showed us around Frankfurt, but it is quite easy as it is flat and transport is very good and inexpensive.

<Content>Expensive The location is good for the Fair area of town, but not the best for tourists. It is very expensive, but nice. The rooms are small. I paid for an executive room which includes breakfast and drinks in the executive lounge throughout the day. This is worthless. The executive breakfast is nothing more than bread, cereal, and some cold cuts. Drinks during the day is your choice of 2 beers and some wine. So, don't bother splurging, as I did, on the upgrade. It isn't worth it. Otherwise, the hotel is ok, but a bit overpriced.

<Content>Corporate, Uninspiring Marriott with Great Location and Friendly Staff I stayed at the Frankfurt Marriott for two nights, Friday and Saturday, on a weekend break to Frankfurt. I had a great Priceline rate of $68 a night. The location is superb, just five minutes in a cab or a leisurely 15 minute walk into downtown. The tram runs directly in front of the hotel, which is opposite Frankfurt鈥檚 major exposition centre.The building is an imposing 1970s style tower block, easy to locate with a MARRIOTT sign emblazoned across the top.Arriving from London at midnight, with little inclination to double check local parking restrictions and the safety of the neighbourhood, I parked my rental car in the underground secure car park to the side of the hotel. This is not owned by Marriott. It cost me EURO22 overnight, very expensive. Midweek, I would imagine you would have no other options but to park here, at weekends, however, parking in the local side streets is unrestricted, and plentiful spaces are available. It is a safe residential district.The entrance of the hotel exhibited no signs of the ladies of the night mentioned in other reviews, perhaps at weekends most of their clients are not in town.Check in was friendly and I handed over my Marriott Silver Elite card, no mention being made of my Priceline booking by the Front Desk Manager.My room was on the 28th floor, one of the lowest hotel floors as lower ones appear to be offices. Had a great view of the TV Tower, but I think the other side of the hotel, with a view of downtown Frankfurt, might be the better option, if given a choice. Elevators to this level were satisfactory, but I can imagine with only four to service the whole hotel tower, things might get very crowded especially with luggage in the midweek mornings. You need your room key to request a floor, which ensures relatively good security.The room was medium sized, comfortable for two, but not large. Hideous bright green carpet was obviously not changed when the duvet cover, mirrors etc were recently upgraded to Marriott house style. Beds, with plenty of soft feather pillows, were extremely comfortable.Air conditioning was not particularly effective. With outside temperatures of 30C, the room never became cool, despite a/c being on HI and lowest setting, but the air flow made sleeping tolerable. Windows do open slightly. Noticed when the heat of the morning sun started, the windows creaked as they expanded, loud enough to wake light sleepers; if sleeping late after an international flight during the summer, request a room on the cooler 鈥榮unset鈥?side of the tower, looking out over downtown.A turndown service was provided, with chocolates, but no tea or coffee making facilities in my room. I noted comments about the poor and overpriced buffet breakfast. Instead I opted for a smoked salmon and cream cheese bagel (with suggestively placed bread stick sticking up from the centre!) which I ate in the Marriott Caf茅 to the side of the main entrance, seven euros for the bagel and a delicious freshly squeezed OJ, and chargeable to your room. Delicious.The ugly tower block, slow elevators and sluggish air conditioning mean you might be better off in a more up to date hotel, and if staying on business the nearby purpose built Radisson opening in the next few months will be a solid competitor to this property.So, I sound quite harsh, but really this is an OK place to stay if you just need a bed for the night, and can get a good rate. I am trying hard to give it an above average rating, but in all honesty I think if I was paying rack rates or my company was paying I would look to a newer hotel. VERDICT: Satisfactory yet uninspiring corporate high rise hotel. Great rates on Priceline reflect its true value. Reputedly poor buffet breakfast offering. Superb location, right across from Exhibition Centre. Noticeably friendly staff.
