<Author>NewlyWedTraveler
<Content>Half and Half We were very excited as we got off the plane. It was my husbands first real vacation/plane ride, and it was my first trip to the Caribbean. We couldn't wait to see our resort. We got off the plane and a man kept asking us if we were with _____. We realized it was the company taking care of our trip/excursions/transports set up through AAA. He took our bags. We were somewhat reluctant and tried to keep them but he persisted. He found the van we were riding in. We were a bit confused but he explained the bags would go in the back and they'd take us to our resort. He stood with his hand out for a few seconds and we didn't quite understand how he wanted a tip for practically wrestling our bags from us. The smallest bill my husband had was a 5 so he gave it to him. The ride to the resort was long and terrifying. I never get car sick and I was to the point all I could do was pray. The road was full of craters and at some points we wer playing chicken with trucks full of concrete. We nearly hit multiple motorbikes. YIKES!We promised not to leave the resort, even though we'd already paid for an excursion. We exited the taxi van and we were amazed by the entry and check in. It went very smooth. We were given a cookie and a glass of champagne. Then we were given our room number, information and maps. We ventured over to our room soon followed by our bags. The room was beautiful. Our room was on the ground floor and we could slip into the pool from our deck. The first night we got cleaned up and decided to look for LaMario. It was supposed to be an Italian eatery on the beach. We looked and looked. We kept coming to the ocean grill. We were very confused. While on our search for LaMario we saw a REAL taranchula! My husband wanted to get a picture but I was out of there. (Mind you we were lost and on a service road at the edge of the resort.) We finally gave up our search and went into the Ocean Grill. It was very good. We were told there was not a LaMario's and it was a mistake on the map. Whew, at least it wasn't us, we thought we weren't following the map correctly. Our room was always clean, with the exception of the deck. Our bed was turned down with a chocolate and the radio was on when we got back in the evening. NOTE: DO NOT leave food ANYWHERE in your room! YOU WILL get minature ants by the thousands! We had a candy bar in our suitcase. Myhusband and I were about to bite into it and oh my goodness, thousands of ants were crawling on us!The next day we ventured to the beach. I was so excited to see the pristine, calm, clear waters of the Caribean! However, to my dismay, the red flag was up, the ocean was FULL of seaweed and we couldn't even get in. The next two days red flags were up. The yellow flag! We got in and my goodness it was rocky! I couldn't believe it! This water was not even as impressive as Virginia, S.Carolina, N.Carolina, Florida, etc. We could have seen better beaches in the states. Definately a let down. Never were we able to utilize the watersports. The chairs were plentiful because everyone was at the pool. The ocean was not the resorts fine point. The sand was rocky, and the ocean was rocky, murky, full of seaweed and harsh.The pool was a fine point. We enjoyed the pool. For the most part it was clean and relaxing. The pool had limited chairs and floats, should you want to float in the pool. Also, the pool is not as long as it might look. You must exit the pool to get to the pool with the swim up bar. There is a wall between the pools This was not very handy. Note: during the day if you order a drink from the swim up bar you must ask for it with alcohol if you want an alcoholic beverage. They serve virgin drinks if you don't ask.The food was very good. As the week went on we became more comforable with the all inclusive idea and began ordering multiple appetizers, entrees, and desserts. Note: if it says thinly sliced (name of meat of fish) it will come raw. The service was typically what would be expected in an American eatery. (Sometimes better) Room service was not very good. It took a long time and the orders were rarely correst. One night we fell asleep waiting. The bars were pretty nice, the Rendez vous was our favorite. Chocolate was the best bartender ever. He was friendly and charasmatic! We loved him. They close very early for a young couple who wanted a little excitement and to meet new people. The disco was full of young kids, many looked like high schoolers and some nights teens were allowed in. I teach older kids and I was very uncomfortable having drinks and dancing with so many teens around.One of the worst things about the trip was the resort allows vendors to set up in the resort and hassle the guests. They were ripping people off left and right! They set up in the area you had to go through to go from eating, shows, lobby to your room! We went on vaction to relax and enjoy our honeymoon! Not to be hassled! Although car sales men have nothing on Dominican salesmen. We didn't buy one thing from them!We would suggest the bike ride in the morning. You need to wear tennis shoes, sunscreen, loose clothes and pack a water. On the ride back you will be allowed to stop at a small stripmall full of vendors. They have reasonable prices and will negotiate. You can get things from here really cheap. Also, it was a great time for us to gt to know two other couples and get to know more about the culture from the guide. We decided sinced we'd paid for our excursion we would brave it and go. We were signed up to go on a Four wheeler excursion. We took a car taxi to the location, which was much smoother than the van. We were the first ones there and the man said, You early, lookie lookie and I make deal with you! You my family! We looked and found a few things we liked. There were not priced on anything! He wanted nearly 100 dollars for a picture frame, two wooden turtles the size of a quarter and a mug (made in China on the bottom of the mug). We were never going to pay that, nor did we take that much with us! We finally told him 20 dollars for the frame and the turtles. He said, 30 or nothing bagged it up and put it in our hands and said pay the man and walked out. We saw a dirty medical needle on the shelf and decided it was time to get out of there. We handed the man the bag and said, No thank you. We signed the contract, you pay up to 2,000 dollars in damage and they pay up to 50 dollars if you get hurt in medical bills. The fourwheelers were very old and in overall poor condition. We went very slow in order to be sure we did not damage the fourwheeler. We stopped at a location. Vendors were everywhere and we stayed by our fourwheeler. No one told you where to go. Finally someone on the trip with us said aren't you going to see the cave? We had no idea, we hurried down and it was very pretty. Vendors tried to stop us but we told them our guide was ready to go. Then we headed the other way on the road. We went to the most beautiful beach. I had mybathing suit on so I could get right in the pool when we got back. However, my husband didn't know we could get in the beach and wore jeans and boots to drive. He couldn't get in the ocean. We were amazed by this beach. It was what we thought would be at our resort. It was only a few miles away and it was sooo different than the beach at our resort.The shows are very good! We loved them! We were even picked to be the show one night! We were one of four couples picked from the audience to play Battle of the Sexes! We represented the US! The shows and hospitaliy were A+Our trip was half and half. Half relaxing; half hassle. Half amazing; half dissapointing.

<Content>So-so My fiance and I stayed at Dreams from 12/28/08 to 01/04/09. We were very happy with some things, and very unhappy with others.The GOOD:- The resort grounds are beautiful and extremely well maintained. All of the plants are beautiful, well manicured, and accented the property beautifully.-The main building (including lobby) is beautiful- especially the large wrought iron chandelier in the main lobby.-The pool is amazing. It's big enough that you never feel crowded, the water isn't too cold, and it's kept quite clean.-The Hotel Staff were all incredibly hospitable and accomodating. Our drinks were refilled many times without even having to ask! The housekeeping staff did a great job keeping our room tidy - giving a small $ tip helps.-The Spa is great, especially the wellness centre. The entire Spa area was very clean and the services provided met our expectations.-The front desk was very efficient- it took less than 5 minutes to check in, and possibly even less time to check out. The champagne reception (with cool towel service) was a welcome reward after the 1-hour shuttle from Punta Cana Airport. -Bar service was great. Bottle service on New Year's Eve was even better. Very attentive, very efficient.-Bordeaux a-la-carte restaurant. The food was very good in comparison to other restaurants at the resort. -The Air Canada representative was amazing. She gave us a lot of good advice, and helped us book some incredible excursions (Hola Tours Outback Safari is highly recommended)-The entertainment staff are very talented. We enjoyed a number of the evening shows.The BAD:-There are tiny Ants EVERYWHERE. We were in a deluxe swim-out room, which ended up being infested by tiny ants. They were worst in the bathroom (especially the sink). We determined they were probably coming from the drain in the sink-- our in-laws who stayed in the room next door had the same problem. I mentioned this to maintenance, but aside from pouring soap down the drain, they did nothing. Our request for a different room was denied.-The beds are hard as rocks. There were broken springs in the mattress-- I have a bruise on my side from one of the worst parts of the bed. The bedding (with the exception of the sheets) seemed very old and discolored. There were holes in the bedspread (which is not a proper duvet, contrary to what is advertised on their webpage). It would be worth their while to replace the beds  bedding.-The rooms themselves are not 4-star caliber... at least not by North American Standards. The walls are damaged, there is mildew throughout (especially in the shower/tub), the furniture is in poor condition, and the filter in the air vent was absolutely filthy. After having visited a Dominican Home, I didn't find it that bad... but then again, Dominicans pay about $250 USD per month rent-- not $250 per night.-The food in most restaurants is unimaginative and far too salty. With the exception of breakfast, the food at the World Cafe is terrible. Hot foods are never hot enough (which is worrisome in such a humid climate) and cold foods are always lukewarm. Most a-la-carte restaurants left much to be desired.-When you charge anything (spa services, specialty wine or champagne, etc..) to your bill, they automatically add 10%. We were never informed of this.-The phones in-room cost about $32 per minute to call back to Canada. Our Canadian cell phone cost about $2.50 per minute. Be careful. CDMA (telus/bell) works quite well.-The beach is pretty, but there are lots of rocks in the water (to be fair, the beach is not property of the hotel). Sand fleas are a problem. We saw several cockroaches down behind the swim-up bar.

<Content>A Great Familty Vacation Not being a huge fan of all inclusive resorts, we made our decision on Dreams Punta Cana based on a recommendation from our travel agent. We decided on a Preferred Club Deluxe Room figuring that access to the concierge would remove some of the typical all-inclusive unpleasantries such as dinner reservations at the more popular resort restaurants. The Flights 鈥?We flew Skyservice from Toronto and other than both flights being delayed I can鈥檛 complain. One minor oversight on my part was while booking the trip I didn鈥檛 noticing that the return flight left Punta Cana at 10:30pm and arrived back in Toronto at 2am which made travelling with our 3 year old interesting. Fortunately the resort let us check-out late at 5pm. Next time I鈥檒l pay more attention.The Check-in 鈥?It鈥檚 a midnight check in and the front desk staff are friendly enough. Within 10 minutes we鈥檙e on our way to our 鈥淒eluxe鈥?room. My initial impression of our room (building 3, ground floor) was one of utter disappointment. The mustiness was overwhelming, the furniture was old and the beds were hard and lumpy. I made my way back to the front desk and asked them what their interpretation of 鈥渄eluxe鈥?and 鈥減referred鈥?were. It鈥檚 at this point that I鈥檓 told I鈥檝e been put in the wrong building. The front desk supervisor takes me to visit our proper room and a Junior Suite upgrade option (who didn鈥檛 see that coming?). I was sold (literally) on the Junior Suite. It was bright, clean and what I was expecting in terms of quality when booking the trip.The Food 鈥?Dreams puts on a great buffet. I don鈥檛 expect much in the way of restaurant quality when it comes to all-inclusive resorts but they did a great job. My daughter's favourite was the World Caf茅 but we did manage to visit the other restaurants as well. All surpassed our expectations.The Preferred Club 鈥?We didn鈥檛 really use the concierge much or use the Preferred area of the beach but it was worth it just to be in the newer guest buildings.The Staff 鈥?The staff at Dreams were fantastic. My 3 year old daughter took a liking to many of the staff and I鈥檇 recommend this resort based on their friendliness alone.Overall it was a great trip and we鈥檇 go back.

<Content>Absolutely Loved It We went to Dreams Puna Cana and we can't wait to go back. We loved it so much we are thinking about having our wedding there. The grounds were immaculate, the food was delicious, the staff was helpful and friendly, and the pool was breathtaking! It's true about the beach being rocky directly in front of the resort. But you only have to walk a few feet to the left to get get the nice soft sand that Punta Cana is known for. We had a lovely vacation. Looking forward to visiting the new Dreams at Bavaro Beach sometime this year.

<Content>Paradise I just got back from Paradise, and am back to reality, but I wanted to post my views and experience in order to help others seeking advice on where to go.We went as a family group, which included my parents, (87 and 90) all my siblings and grandchildren and friends who tagged along. There were 26 of us in all.I want to point out that as a widow of a commercial European pilot, I have traveled quite a bit and so has my whole family, so we were extremely pleasantly surprised at the beauty of the hotel, the marvelous smiling and helpful staff and the great administration we encountered. We spent 7 days of glory. The food was excellent and varied, the bars well stocked and their house selection of wines and champagne quite adequate..(thank you, David). The organization for a big group couldn't have been easier and nicer (thank you, Evelyn) and all maitre d' and waiters, always smiling, polite and eager to please.The beaches were great and the best thing..the kids, from 10-30 all had a GREAT time, going from disco to casino, to game rooms, and we parents were finally resting knowing they were all safe even and specially on New Years Eve. Great Experience!

<Content>Drop 5 pounds in 7 days Without a doubt this is at best a 2 star Vacation destination. We booked through apple vacations. Some postive examples:1. The overall property and layout is nice, the pools, ocean, spa and resturants are easy to access.2. The weather is awesome, the beaches and waves are very nice.3. The rooms are adequate..4. The staff tries to appease you, and some are helpful.5. If you tip the cleaning lady, she will bring you unlimited bottled drinks for your room.The negative examples include1. Food: overall 4 out of 10. Since this is an important detail I will share our experience. 7 of us arrived healthy on Monday, by thursday, 3 were very ill with food poisoning, by Monday, 6 of 7 people were extremely ill with food poisoning. I was the only one of our group who pretty much escaped. I call it food poisoning because everyone suffered from explosive vomiting and diarrhea without any fever. Each person had this for about 48 hours, one person, got it a second time the night we arrived home. Yes not one person drank the water. Anyhow, I learned, do not eat anything green, do not eat the fruit, do not drink the soda from fountain machines, do not eat any cold food. I found the best thing to do was to eat fried food, ie go to the chinese, japanese, or french (best food, although 6 out of 10) resturant. The cafe, ocean and seaside resturants had food that was 2 out of 10. Get hot soup, sweat and sour pork, etc. Also go to the gift shop and get bottled soft drinks, and gatorade, pringles etc. Bottle bear is fine. Mixed drinks that are entirely bottled are fine. I dont know about the fruit on the side, I stopped having the fruit added after the 3rd day. When we arrived home we went to Wendy's. My 7 year old daughter got a kids meal, and after 3 days of drinking gatorade refused to eat. Suddenly and to the horror of the staff at Wendy's she started pathetically sobbing that she was too scared to eat, that she couldnt stand to vomit anymore. I had to explain to everyone that it was not Wendys but we had just arrived home from punta cana.2. Staff, we had some good staff and indifferent staff. The managment didnt seem to care that there was widespread illness. We talked to many guests who were ill. Only one man reported a fever. When we relayed this to the management, they said we were the only ones, except that 4 seperate people standing behind me in line said that they had all had similiar symptoms and illness. If this had been in the USA or a Cruise line it would have been on CNN.3. The rooms we booked were not available. We had 7 people, we booked, on room with 2 double beds, and one room with a king, and a sofa bed. We got 2 king size beds. After 4 hours on the phone with apple ( who tried to say we were the only ones ) we were moved to 2 new rooms with guess what, 2 king beds! We finally got them to agree to bring a couple of cots. In the end it didnt matter, the king size beds were rock hard, the cots were ok, and the sofa bed in one of the rooms was broken and we placed the mattress on the floor for a weekIn summary, this location is a metaphor for or pretends to be a resort. Its close, but the food is dangerous, and the staff is in denial. They are well trained to smile, appease you verbally and be happy. They are not capable of fixing much. They will give you all the food you can possible eat. If you are going already, take a jar of peanut butter, a box of crackers and gatorade. If you are considering going, try to find somewhere else. If you like to drink in excess or eat in excess and have an iron GI system you will probably be ok avoiding any cold foods.On the positive side, I lost 5 lbs without trying during the week and didnt get sick!

<Author>VACATION234
<Content>Nightmare Trip - Not A Great Resort For Kids We recently returned from our 6 night stay at Dreams Punta Cana (11/2-11/8) and our stay was extremely disappointing. The Explorer Club was well below our expectations due to a major lack of supervision, the service overall was truly subpar, the room conditions were below average, and the food quality was poor. Our main reason for staying at this property was due to the supposedly excellent kids program (we have three children ages 3, 3, and 5) but this was not the case at all. The vacation was not relaxing to say the least, and we would never recommend the property or similar AM resorts properties to friends and family going forward. The company needs to seriously focus on standards for guest services and the kids program so parents can feel comfortable with how safe it is for their children. We would never recommend this resort. Do not be fooled by their brochures of being super-kid friendly or any positive reviews. Many others during our stay shared similar experiences.Below is a large laundry list of problems by subcategory that we encountered during our stay. Kids program 鈥?Explorer Club / babysitting1. Make sure that kids program and camps are actually open before your visit 鈥?closed for part of our stay. This was not mentioned by our travel agent or by the front desk upon check-in. This should have been brought to our immediate attention. 2. Staff does not watch children swim in the Explorer Club. Even though only 2 feet of water, there still needs constant supervision. They advised us to use floaties but a child can still drown, if not supervised. A staff member should be sitting by the pool at all times watching the children swim. Many parents, similar to us, felt uncomfortable with the situation. We have 3 year old twins who do not know how to swim yet. 3. Explorer Club is not for 3 and 4 years old 鈥?supervision is limited.4. Explorer Club is also too young for 10 to 12 years old. 5. Limited babysitting service available. Plans need to made well in advance. You cannot get babysitting service the same day as requested. We asked the concierge for a sitter at 10am and we could not get one that day. 6. Babysitter did not show up when scheduled. We were told 2 hours later that she could not work for us that day. We had arranged for a sitter for the remainder of the day and then they changed the arrangements without notifying us. 7. Babysitter started working with the Explorer Club while watching our children. She said that the camp was understaffed. Meanwhile, we were paying her to watch our children. 8. Explorer Club does not inform parents if an activity is cancelled or location is changed. This has frightened a number of parents. One night, the disco location was changed.9. You cannot visit the Explorer Club on your first day of your arrival unless after hours. They should allow a 5 minute preview with your kid to get acclimated to the Club, especially on your first visit. What are they hiding? This concerned many parents.10. They would not tell us the ratio of kids to staff at the Explorer Club.11. Babysitting prices were quoted different before our stay than during our visit - $10/hour for 1-3 kids versus $10/kid, $20/2 kids or $30/3 kids at the resort. Then at the resort, we were quoted $20/2 kids by the camp and then $10/2 kids by the manager the next day. I requested 2 nannies if we were paying $20/2 kids because it was the same price as 1 nanny for 2 kids. That was not possible according to the concierge because they did not have enough babysitters on staff. We have twins so extra attention is worth it if it is the same price. 12. Limited formal activities for the children at the Explorer Club 鈥?typically at 11am, 3pm, 4pm, and 5pm. They need more activities. 13. Many kids were bored at the camp. It felt like day care at some points.14. Explorer Club鈥檚 activities are for all ages between 3-12 and not separate activities for different ages. For example, the daily bike activity at 10pm is not appropriate for 3 year olds because they do not have tricycles or bikes with children. Also the crazy games at the pool were too 鈥渂abyish鈥?for the 10-12 year olds. 15. The only toddler playground at the resort was inside the Explorer Club and parents cannot stay at the Club with their toddlers. They are not allowed inside the gates.16. Where were the advertised pony rides?17. Sometimes activities were cancelled and the kids just hung out at the Explorer Club.Room conditions18. We had to switch rooms two times due to unsatisfactory room conditions.19. Rooms are not well maintained. They are not 4 or 5 star quality as advertised. They are far from luxury. 20. Lamps broken in room.21. Doors not on closet. They tried to fix the door but it could not be done. 22. Toilets do not flush well 鈥?only work every 5 minutes.23. Tubs took forever to drain.24. Shower to dangerous to step into, particularly for young children.25. Do not be fooled by the 鈥淧referred Club Family Room鈥?鈥?it is only 2 small hotel rooms next to each other with no sitting area for young kids.26. Cracks in the walls.27. Beds hard as rocks.28. Poster beds are not secured and swing back and forth. One guest said that the poster bed fell on their child.29. Light switches were not working in room.30. Electronic keys do not work all the time. 2 of the 4 keys we were given did not work.31. Bolt was broken twice on door. You could tell that it was fixed multiple times. 32. No dressers with drawers to put away clothes 鈥?guests have to live out of their suitcase. 33. Not a 鈥渓uxury hotel鈥?34. Robes missing from the rooms.35. Holes in the blankets on the bed.36. Problems with air conditioning in room.37. Scale in the room was completely rusted.38. Complementary newspaper everyday was limited.39. Phone in bathroom falling off the wall. 40. Upgraded bath amenities? Make sure to bring your own conditioner.41. You can hear all the hallway noise if you are in a room in the first floor. Not good if you are putting to sleep young children. 42. Linens were dirty. 43. TV remote did not work.Overall service44. Service subpar overall from wait staff to concierge to general hotel staff.45. General management apathetic about problems with guests.46. Concierge, at first, refused to let us speak to a manager or give us the name of the manager. We had to insist multiple times before getting assistance. 47. Took 3 plus hours and multiple calls to get concierge to unlock the adjoining room. Therefore, we got our children to sleep after midnight on our first night. 48. It is imperative to confirm that your room is adjoining before you arrive at the resort. Some families that we met at the resort told us that they were supposed to have adjoining rooms and instead, they received rooms that were next door to each other. This made it difficult for families with young children and parents had to split up. 49. Major red ant problem throughout the hotel.50. My daughter had left her blanket in our old room (before we switched). I called concierge/housekeeping to retrieve the blanket that night and they never followed up. I called again in the morning and they were clueless as to my phone call the night before. They did find it but the service was unacceptable. It is a crisis for a young toddler to lose their blanket and they did not help us out to even find it.51. Took a long time for staff to clean around the pool. Used glasses could sit around for hours. 52. 24-hour room service 鈥?not that we experienced鈥nly until 11pm?Food / room service 53. Typically 1-2 restaurants will be closed each night as the staff needs to attend to weddings. 54. Food is terrible across the board, even at the specialty restaurants.55. Food portions are small at specialty restaurants.56. Food at World Caf茅 lukewarm consistently. 57. Need more variety in food choice on a nightly basis. For example, you typically would find the same desserts each night at the World Caf茅. 58. Beware vegetarians 鈥?many dishes have ham or sausage although not specified. I would also be cautious if you have any food allergies. 59. Need more variety in the kids鈥?menu. My kids constantly ate either hot dogs, hamburgers, or pizza. 60. Lack of silverware at every meal. You constantly have to ask for spoons, etc.61. Wait staff loved to clear off table without asking. For example, they cleared our entire table of breakfast while one of us was in the bathroom with 2 kids and the other was getting food. It was evident that the food on the plates was not even eaten and we return, another family was sitting at our table. 62. Plastic cups should be provided at all times to young children, not glass. Very easy to break and my daughter broke a glass during a meal. Had to ask 2 times to clean the broken glass (glass dropped during the meal) from the waiters and took about 15 minutes to be taken care of.63. Warming burners for the coffee were at a toddler鈥檚 waist level throughout the World Caf茅. You must watch your children at all times when they are walking in the Caf茅 so they do not get burned.64. Where was the afternoon hot and cold d鈥檕euvres?65. It is common to ask 2-3 times in the morning, at the World Caf茅, for coffee.66. When you call for room service to ask for food or drinks, the order is never right. I would always call in the morning and at night for 6 juice boxes for my 3 children and they would typically only bring 2-4. Also, they would never bring enough silverware or napkins to accompany breakfast orders. 2 spoons and 3 napkins are not acceptable for a family of 5.67. Room service was always slow.68. Long to check into room but they are quick to come and take your bags out of your room. 69. The Italian restaurant is a small section of the World Caf茅. Food is average and better relative to other restaurants but it does not fell like a real restaurant. Preferred Club70. Preferred Club Lounge was a converted hotel room.71. No one at the front desk was able to tell us where the Preferred Club check-in is. It took 45 minutes to find it because it is about a 15 minute walk from the front lobby. They need a sign posted at the front lobby to direct people to the Preferred Club check-in area. It would be better at the main lobby which felt more 鈥減referred鈥?than the Club itself. 72. Entrance to the Preferred Club Lounge was a bar with a small sitting area. If you check in at night with kids, watch out for drunkards. Not the classiest check-in. 73. Private lounge area for Preferred Club is a couch in a bedroom attached to a temporary office. Anyone could basically come into this area, eat the snacks, and drink from the bar.74. Preferred club wait service at the beach was non-existent. It was no different than the other section except that the Preferred section was roped off.75. Construction occurring during stay on a new Preferred Club.76. Preferred status from Preferred Club was non-existent with the exception of access to some snacks and drinks in the check 鈥搃n area. 77. Towels had to be picked up at the Preferred Club office versus a more convenient location near the pool. Miscellaneous78. It took 45 minutes to an hour to clean the wet floors in the hallway of Building 6, meanwhile kids were walking back and forth in this area. This should have been immediately taken care of. This was on our approach to the Preferred Club check-in area upon our arrival. 79. **We had to wait 2.5 hours to speak to a manager; we were told he would meet with us at 11am and we never came to see us until 1:30pm. Additionally, when the assistant came over the pool area to tell us he was ready, our child had slipped and bumped his head. I told the assistant to have him wait 5 minutes while we put ice on his head and she said that he could only meet with us now and we would have to see him later then at the lobby. We responded, 鈥渁bsolutely not鈥?after we waited 2.5 hours, he could wait 5 minutes so we could take care of our injured son. Very apathetic.80. After our baggage was taken from our room for our departure, we noticed that 2 zippers were unzipped when the bags were placed in the van. We are 100% certain that they were closed.81. Limited towel stations for guests.82. No cooking classes while we were there for our 7 days?83. Lack of garbage cans throughout the resort. 84. Vendors came onto the grounds to sell you goods and their tour services. This was bothersome.85. Hotel conserves electricity but turning off lights in hallways.

<Content>Wonderful People There were 4 generations on this family vacation, ranging from my 78 year old mother to my 8 year old grandaughter.The bus jurney was fine and the guide kept us amused with information and advice.We arrived at the resort around 1pm and the rooms were not ready (not unusual as this resort has an 11am check-out and they have to turn them around). We left our luggage with the conscierge and went to have lunch and look around. One thing we would do next time, is pack some shorts in our carry-on luggage as we were all hot, especially the children.My 2 granddaughters and I shared a room and, as we had requested on booking, it was adjoining to my mother's room . My daughter and son-in-law had a couple of attempts before they got into their room.Although this is a small resort, it was obvious the walking was going to be too much for my mother, however, they didn't have any wheelchairs (something they might look into).My daughter went to the lobby on Saturday night and talked to the manager. Thanks to her persistance and the staff, by 4pm Sunday we had a rental wheelchair, and although we had to pay the cab fare to have it brought and picked up at the end of the trip, it was well worth the money. Kelvin, in the lobby helped my son-in-law when he was negotiating the cab fare and we saved quite a bit of money thanks to him.Everywhere we went, the staff were wonderfully friendly and always had a smile on their faces. The children loved the kids club and the staff there were amazing. We ate in the buffet, seafood, French and Oriental restaurants. The French restaurant was fabulous and we were very disappointed to find it closed the last day of our trip as we had wanted to go back one more time. The seafood and buffet restaurants were also great - plenty of choices of good food. Look out for Margarita, the hostess in the seafood restaurant - she is wonderful and will tell you all about the island if you ask.The Oriental restauant was a disappointment. We could not get onto the tapenyaki tables and their idea of japanese/chinese food in the main part of the restaurant is not what we are used to (we are spoiled, coming from Toronto where there are some of the best Japanese restaurants!).None of us were sick, although we did hear of a couple of people being ill - they were the ones drinking way too much and sitting in the sun for too long!This was my mothers first trip to the Caribbean and to an all-inclusive and on the Thursday she declared she was not coming home, but staying there. The girls thoroughly enjoyed the kids club and the staff there were wonderful.This is cretainly a resort I would go back to.

<Content>Worst Wedding Possible Where do I start? This could be very long.When we arrived in Punta Cana it was a VERY long bus ride to the resort. Good news - the bus is air conditioned. Bad news - the roads will make you car sick in an instant. When we arrived at Dreams we had a very bad check in to begin. Our room was not ready, when it was we took our own bags, there was no assistance at all to bring the bags to our room (we had 5 bags plus my wedding gown and my husband's suit). When we arrived at our room we were shocked. We could not believe we had paid nearly $2000/ per person to stay in such a room. When I say we were shocked I was not shocked in a good way. We then returned to front reception and told them we were completely disappointed in our room (we had booked a honeymoon suite). They then reassigned us to another room which was more suitable but much farther away from the main building (down by the beach in building 6). All in all it took us over 2 hours to get in our room from when we arrived. This was completely unsatisfactory for us. We travelled with a group of 20 members of our families that were there to attend our wedding as well. The next day we met with our wedding planner Miguelina. When we met with her, she did not mention anything that would cause extra charges other than what we agreed to (bridesmaid bouquet). When we left our meeting with her, we felt quite secure that she had everything covered and things would go off without a hitch. On our 3rd day there we met with Miguelina to do a rehersal due to us having a ring bearer and a flower girl in our wedding party to ensure they knew what to expect the day of. During rehearsal there was no mention of what would happen with my husband and I or how the vows would be done. Now neither of us had been married before and did not know what to expect when. The package we had selected for our wedding was the Dreams Ultimate wedding package for $2650 USD. In this package it was to include a complimentary room for the groom the night before based on availability. We had talked to the bartenders and they had said they were extremely slow and the hotel was only 1/2 full. We were not offered our complimentary stay at all for my husbands room the night of our wedding. Also something to mention that occured the evening before our wedding: Chris's aunt was with us for a 3 day stay specifically to attend our wedding and had her room broken into during the middle of the night when she was asleep!!! The only thing that kept her door on the door frame was the chain lock. She called for security immediately and they did not appear for 40 MINUTES after this happened. When we discussed this with management the next day they gave us a line that it was a busboy trying to bring her luggage to her room. Too bad she had all her luggage already. In addition, why exactly would they be bringing it in the middle of the night? And if someone didn't answer why would they KICK THE DOOR IN?!?!?! We did not get any resolution on this problem the DAY OF OUR WEDDING. Management brushed it off and would not own up to anything. On our wedding day 4 members of our group were sick to their stomachs. Miguelina had made the spa appts for my sister and I at 2pm that day (our wedding was at 5pm) . When we went to the spa my sister specifically asked for her hair to be down and curled. When we left the salon her hair was done to look like she was an island 80's prom queen. My makeup was done to look like I belonged in a disco. To say the least neither of us were excited and one of us was crying. The spa appts also lasted far too long and only left us half an hour to get everyone dressed, take any photo's (we did not have any time at all) and make it down to the gazebo. When we lined up to walk down the isle the specific music Chris and I brought was not playing, there was another song that both of us hate and was not mentioned would be playing. When I met Chris at the altar Miguelina was performing our ceremony and was standing off to the side (not between us as we thought she should be) with a loud speaker (which we did not ask for or approve of her to use). She recited the ceremony in a mono-tone voice. When it came to my vows she asked me to say them and I said I don't have them and she said would you like me to read them to you - thankfully my dad had an extra copy and ran them up to me. Chris and I had no microphone during our vows and not one of our guests heard them at all. Once we finished the photographer took our pictures in two locations. Therefore all my pictures look basically the same with different people inserted. When we went up to the Himitsu patio they had our dinner set to be served outdoors. Chris and I had already discussed it with Miguelina that if it was windy or the weather was not cooperating we would like to move it indoors. I had to voice this to her DURING my cocktail hour and the staff continued to move all the furniture indoors DURING my cocktail hour. This was completely disruptive and I was made aware by a few of my guests. For our wedding dinner we had selected crab cakes (these were servedompletely cold and a lot of our guests were unimpressed) lobster bisque soup (very salty and fishy smelling) and beef tenderloin medallions (these were the only thing out of our wedding dinner that we served well). The Pina Colada cake for dessert was disgusting and we were very disappointed. Our wedding cake however was very tasty (chocolate). We had asked for any extra wedding cake be delivered to our room the following day which it never was. Here are the complaints regarding our wedding:-We had arranged for mini cakes to be in each guests room upon check in as well as a welcome letter from us. Only one of our guests recieved this but we were charged $15 USD for each one that was supposed to have been delivered for a total of 150$ USD. -We never recieved our 50 wedding photos and photo album-We never recieved the grooms complimentary room the evening before our wedding based on availability-We had to harass the front desk to get our marriage certificate and only recieved this upon checking out-Our wedding DVD is a disgrace. I am thoroughly embarrassed to show this to anyone - the music on the DVD is not even our song.-Moving the dinner indoors during the cocktail hour - completely unacceptable and should have been done ahead of time-The ceremony was a disaster and at the end of it we ended up getting billed $100 for the loud speaker that we did not use and did not authorize use of.-Ironing of the grooms suit was to be included in this package - we got billed for this-Total wedding cost is advertised as $2650. Be Careful!! They convert the USD to Peso's and then to Canadian dollars. All said and done my wedding cost me $4200 canadian dollars - DOUBLE THE PRICEOverall we were VERY disappointed in this vacation and are currently in the process of disputing all charges through our credit card. I would NEVER recommend this resort. It is too bad the service is such a disgrace because the resort itself is very attractive. If anyone has any questions I am more than happy to help!

<Content>More than what I expected Our family group of 7 just returned from Dreams Punta Cana and we just loved our stay.We had read a lot of reviews and wore not so sure, since some wore a bit scary. But take it from a us,(we are very picky travelers) you will enjoy it. Not only did we have a great experience during our flight (Sunwing Vacations), but the resort was increadible.The grounds are very clean, well maintained, well staffed, and strickly run.Our rooms wore in excellent condition, clean sheets everyday.The towels wore stocked twiece daily. The fridge was keep full with pop and beer everyday.The restaurants are well staffed as well, keep in mind that these are restaurants and just like back home expect to get the portions that you would if you wore to dine at a fine restaurant. We tried everyone expect the Bourdou because we did not have proper attier for the restaurant. One that is very popular is El Patio (mexican) Make sure you get there early or be ready to wait.But our favorite was the World Cafe. It has a great variety of food for all. For those who complaint about the choices; you should stay home our cook your own meal. You can not say that you go hungry because thae amount of food and variety available is unreal. They even have a Kids Buffet Area with kid's favorites.The pools is awesome very long, cleaned everyday and kid friendly; our 6 yr old daughter was able to go everywhere (standing) without a life jacket. While we are at the pool, there would always be staff askinging if we wanted drinks. The beach was keep clean and staff would walk about to make sure that every was ok. At the beach there is a BBQ stand were there is always hot dogs and hamburgers and fresh fruit and pop for those who want a lite bite. The is plenty of chairs and also the gigantic beds on the beach are for anyone to use.The entertainment staff is the best. Great shows and audience participation/incentive (dreams money/prices) for those who win the games. Our favorite entertainer was Micky Mouse, great guy and very friendly toward the kids.We really enjoyed our stay and can recomend it to anyone.The only thing I recomend is that you take more than enough US money, because the is no cash advance features on site and the some bank will not accept foreign credit cards or debit cards either.  Overall excellent resort and defenite well deserved reatings

<Content>Send us back to dreams It was our first time staying at Dreams and like so many others traveling these days we poured over the reviews on TripAdviiser and realized that there were all kinds of reviews. I must say that the four of us staying the week of December 6th were all more than satisfied with the experience. It was not perfect but what vacation ever is?  The food was fair to excellant depending on where you went to eat and what you ordered. Not to worry if one meal was not as good as the one before because there was always more food at another place or even room service.  The staff was fantastic!!!! They were very attentive and took care of our every need. There attitudes were great and the warm greetings we received from everyone was so nice. At the World Cafe we had Welsi looking after us three or four times. We wanted to bring her home with us so that she could take over America with her warm smile and caring way. There were some storms while we were there so the ocean was a bit rough most of the time but the one day it calmed down the beach was amazing and the water was so inviting. Everything on the grounds of Dreams was well kept and clean. Of course, when you walked down the beach for a mile or two you came across a lot of litter. Don blame the Dreams staff for this, it is not their responsibility.  I don't believe it is possible to overstate how wonderful the pool is. I kept thinking how much fun my children would have had at the pool had we taken them there when they were younger yet I was glad that they are grown and we could just enjoy the pool without worrying about the children.  WE enjoyed the people selling their goods a few nights we were there. Just walk away if you don't want to purchase something but, if you do desire to purchase something, have some fun with it. We do a lot of cooking and our extended family does as well. We purchased 6 liters of Vanilla for between 6 and 7 dollars a bottle. I added three bottles of rum to my collection and my wife added a couple small pieces of jewlery. There is a shopping area about a half mile from the resort. We found the best prices(all marked and not negotiable) in the shop furthest away from the resort at the end of the little strip mall with all of the shops. I talked with the shop keeper of that shop at length and found out tthe workers at Dreams earn between 500 and 600 dollars per month. You don't have to tip when you are at Dreams but we realized that a dollar or two for us means a lot less than it does to those looking after us. We probably tipped about $75 over the course of the week.  Would we go back?????? Absolutely!!! I talked with a shop

<Content>Welcome Home We were confused by many of the not so great reviews that were posted to this site. We had made our plans back in March, and had trepidations about going, BUT based on our enjoyable vacations at Dreams in Puerta Vallarta, and in Cancun decided to stick it out. (We love the Dreams' concept) We just got back, and one word describes it Terrific ! and three words describe what was wrong vacation too shortThe greatest thing about this Resort is the staff! Always a smile,always working to make your stay and the hotel better. This goes for the groundspeople, room maids, wait staff, people in the office, as well as the entertainment staff who probably work 15 hours a day, doing daytime activities as well as the shows at nite, which were very good( choreographed, costumed etc).I'm a people person, and wanted to see why the bad press. Basically people who take one item and blow it out of proportion as the following examples: Trip from the airport, yes about 1 hr or slightly more..roads are not highways as some expect, but the bus drivers careful and safe. Sit back, relax (you are on vacation) and look out of the windows at native life, the people, the fields, the schools. Another previous complaint..dirty beach, Yes, if you walk off the Hotel beach (which is perfectly clean) you will see litter either from the locals, or washup from the ocean. Too bad they don't have a litter law, but again NOT the hotel's responsibility. Another complaint was ants in the room (we only saw aunts..a little humor) never saw ants but after speaking to various people, decided a combination of tropical weather, and the fact that people leave open packets of sugar near the coffee pot, or dirty dishes on the floor from ordered in room service. We found the mattresses fine, others have said firm, others hard. THe same with the food, varied comments, but we found the food varied and plentiful. You can't go hungry with the choices, or with the portions. Drinks..again I could easily become an alcoholic if I stayed there long enough. Daytime activities were constant, or you could just sit out and veg. We never had a problem getting a lounge at the pool. So what if you have to shift over a few places because someone else got there first. While I don't want to lecture, it is apparent that many are looking for problems instead of enjoying themselves. The experience in each country that we have visited is different and that is what makes the trip. Chinese food in NYC is not the same as in China, and certainly not the same in DR.We literally met people from all over the world, and saw that they were enjoying themselves. While we didn't have any children did notice that those who did had their children completely occupied by the kids' explorer club.How bad can it be?? when we met people who were returning for the third and fourth time??Don'T hesitate in booking this resort . You will be glad that you did, and will start your vacation with being greeted Welcome Home

<Content>3 WORDS TO SUM UP DREAMS!!!! NICKEL AND DIME****** !!!!They get you for everything. There is no ATM at the casino resort and if you want cash you need to charge it to your credit card at a small 10% fee, oh and of course you get pesos in return at a lower than market rate....... If a bar opens at 10 do not ask for a drink @ 9:57 -- they'll make you wait ... Little things like this..... We paid up for the Preferred Club, unfortunately when we arrived we were at the back of the bus. This meant that I had to wait at the end of an hour long check in line only to find out that Preferred members have their own check-in!!! Ohh that was so annoying, considering my 13 month old had just traveled 7 hours..... Drinks were good - as far as food the buffett was the best thing, the restaurants were nice, but the food was below average... the staff was cool for the most part some attitudes but not what i expected after reading all the poor reviews about them. not much for small children, and there are gaps in the food service which could pose a problem for an infant..... THE Fully stocked bar in the room consisted of 2 beers and soda??? the pool was awesome, Coffee is great..... beach was a little dirty and very rocky.... the Casino is a 20 foot by 20 foor room...... thats why there are no pictures... Its a place to go get blasted with friends, maybe ok if your kids are older.... I'd rather stay state-side....

<Content>Dream Vacation I thought the Hotel was quite nice. The grounds were very well maintained. The staff is very friendly. Most everyone we ran into spoke english. Very willing to help. The entertainment team works their tales off. Always something to do. Waitstaff always seemed to find us, on the beach, at the pool, in the lobby, or at the theatre.Food was good. Always plenty of choices and the higher end restaurants were very good.I had read many reviews complaining about, weather, staff, food etc. Anything we asked for they gave us, staff was always willing to go the extra mile. Weather was perfect, maybe 10 min of rain all week. We did not bring our kids but it looked like the kids were always having a blast in explorers club. The even had their own Macy's Thanksgiving Parade.Only complaint would be the room was a bit musty smelling and had some ants. To be expected in the tropics. How much time do you spend in the room?

<Content>Traveler from Ann Arbor, MI. Dreams are what you make it. First , I will say that my wife and I have been to Punta Cana 5 times before this trip and have done all - inclusives there and in Mexico as well. We have always stayed in 5 star resorts , Iberostar, Bahia , and The Riu Palace Macoa , the first one not the new one, I am saying this so that you can see we love The Dominican Republic. We were here Thanks Giving week. We took the Apple Vacations 6-star square deal for the first time.Our travel agent said it was 80% chance we would go to Dreams. I think it was more like a 100 % chance as I think Apple has something worked out with Dreams,anyway we got a great price for a nice resort. I do not think it is a 6-apples resort though, maybe a good 5 but not 6 . The only thing that may make this resort a 6 is the service which I must say was the best I have seen in the Dominican. The people are always happy to serve you and do it fast. Really , Really great service there. The bus ride I hear so much about is bumpy so I would suggest take some motion sickness pills with you,other than that is gives you a nice tour of Dominican country side and cattle farms. The bus driver does his best on the bumpy roads. The grounds of the resort are very nice and clean and is not too big so it is easy to walk any where from where ever your room may be. Once we had to go to the Doctor on duty there as my wife had some terrible stomach pains and chills, the Doctor did a great job as she was feeling better in 1 day.We know know it was a virus and our DR. at home says that the DR. there in the Dominican really did a great job of getting her back up quickly. And our home Blue-Cross covered everything. The beach is nice but not near as nice as The Bavaro beach if you go to those resrts in Punta Cana,and if you walk any direction from the main beach there is alot of washed up garbage that is not nice to look at. They could do alot better if they would clean this up,but if you go left you will find a really nice place to swimm and keep going to you get to the little green and blue house that is Alex's gift shop and they are very nice and have good deals. With that I will say that for us , we would rather go on the Bavaro beaches in Punta Cana but were but there with the square deal, but I will not agree with all the really bad reveiws of this resort. The rooms are not the very best but are nice and do not have the smell you get sometimes there. The lazy river is great, the people there are fantastic,the service is top notch. Drinks are great with alot of premium alcohol. And served on the beach which is nice. The food is not the best but you will not go hungry there. The World Cafe is nice but not great. One thing that I really did not like was that every other day they allow sales people who are a little too pushy, I do not mind people trying to make a dollar but I have two eyes and can see you there,you do not have to yell for my attention everytime I walk by. Over All we had a nice vacation and I do not think you can go wrong at any 5 star or 5 apple in the Dominican Republic . Hopes this helps.

<Content>Amazing Vacation We travelled to this property in April 2008. This was the most amazing vacation ever. I was worried about some of the reviews that I read, but I did see some of the people there who write those types or reviews, and there is NO pleasing them. They complain about absolutely everything. And if you are one of those people, do yourself a favor, as well as everyone else (as no one wants to hear you complaining the entire trip), and stay home! If you are not one of those people, then you will likely love it!The property was absolutely beautiful. Everything was well maintained, and there was always workers out and about, cleaning everything in site. The only thing that went wrong was our room was not ready when we arrived (which was fine, we arrived before check in). But once we did get our room key, and got to the room, it still had not been cleaned up. We called the front desk, and they offered a different room (with double beds) or we could stay in the one that was not cleaned yet (king bed) and they would send the maid right away. We decided to keep our room, the maids were there in about 2 minutes, and cleaned our room up very quickly. So no big deal! The beach was gorgeous, and although it does not have perfect white sand and light blue ocean, it was very pretty and really really warm. As I read a lot of reviews prior to leaving, we never tested the right side of the beach, we always stayed on the left, and it was always clean, no rocks or algae, or anything like that. We spent most of our days by the pool or in the pool. You could always find a quiet place to swim, although the lounge chairs were sometimes full, and people would leave their towels, so you never knew if they were coming back or not (so if your going there, and dont plan on returning to your chair for awhile, just give it up...be nice...) The weather was perfect every day. Small amount of rain in the morning, but it was done by about 8am, and sunshine all day long!! Wear TONS of sunscreen though, I did, but it must have washed off, and I got FRIED.We mostly ate at the buffet, as I'm such a picky eater, there was always a lot of variety. Never had a problem getting full, thats for sure! We left the property a couple times, we went parasailing, ziplining, and also to Saona Island, and each one, I would recommend to anyone!! They were all a blast!!We would return in a heartbeat. I will definately make it back to this resort at some point in my life. Everything about it was perfect. You just have to keep an open mind, and let the small stuff go. There may be small things that go wrong, but you just have to relax, and grab another drink!!

<Content>From an english point of view My husband and myself stayed at dreams for two weeks . Our plane had been delayed so we were very tired when we arrived. The journey to the hotel was fine the rain filled the potholes if you also were on that coach you will know what i mean.  As it was too late for a sit down meal we ordered room service, it was total rubbish i even took a picture for facebook so my friends can have a laugh. We ate at the Seafood and the French Restaurants both were fantastic. Food very good. At the buffet we always found something good to eat. I really loved the breakfasts fresh juices and fruit lovely low fat yogurt. As i am a healthy eater i was very pleased that people ike myself were catered for. The gym is well maintained and the instructor very helpful.The running track is about one mile round the hotel even my hubby enjoyed being dragged round in the mornings. I did not enjoy the beach not their fault the sea was rough but should have been more warning on the website about the strong under currant. The pool was lovely and first time i have ever enjoyed lying on a float great fun. Unfortunately our first experience or one of the bars by the pool was marred by very loud people playing drinking games. Each to their own i guess but it was not pleasant. We did find it very amusing that some people would tip barmen just so they would be greeted by name and given extra measures. Again each to their own but amusing. I guess in the uk we are more tolerent of other nations and i was very upset by a comment by some americans who remarked they would not go in the same pool as used by some charming Germans. How stupid is that. There were some young english lads whose language was not acceptable for anyones ears let alone young children, that was a big shame. Every one is entitled to a good holiday thats face it we work hard then go away to have a good time but i would just like to remind people who travel in groups remember you are not the only people there. I will return to a Dreams resort and take our grandkids as i feel they are very well catered and cared for there, but i will not return to the Punta Cana one as i would not feel happy with them playing with any safety in the sea

<Content>Bill Clinton loved Dreams! We just recently returned from DR, spending our Thanksgiving at Dreams and had a great time. Like many people before me, I will start with the ride from the airport. Yes, there are some sections of road that are bumpy. We were grateful to have a great driver that took care driving around the bumps, so it was not that bad at all. A number of earlier reviews really blasted the roads. I think we all need to put things in perspective here - when you hit a bump, open your eyes and turn your head to look at the surrounding area. This is not a wealthy country here. Count your blessings that you can afford a trip like this and respect the fact that the DR people have to travel these bumpy roads to/from their shack on a daily basis, either walking or on their little motor bikes. Stop your whining, princess!Check-in was truly a breeze. The folks working the desks are fast, friendly and efficient. We were in our rooms in no time and the luggage arrived shortly after. The rooms were nice. Yes, there may have been some mold here and there in the bathroom and some other minor 'problems' but, again, relax a bit. This is not a 5 star resort and you did not pay a 5 star price. If you want perfection, go to Four Seasons in Nevis and be prepared to lay out quite a bit more money! You are getting what you paid for, and more, here. The rooms are comfortable enough to keep you happy. I think my biggest gripe was that there was not too much beer stocked in the fridge, but I got over it by hanging out at one of the many bars. The bartenders, for the most part, were very friendly. We found that the ones at the theater were the only standoffish ones. I think this is because they are servicing a large quantity of people and there is no time to relax and enjoy the guests. I did notice that a few reviewers complained that a number of workers did not speak English. To this, I say - learn some Spanish before you go! That is their native language. We found that almost everyone spoke fluent English. Yes there are some maids here and there that did not, but they were always pleasant to us. We learned enough Spanish to get us by and they really appreciated it - give respect and get respect back.The restaurants were okay. Some foods were great and others were just okay. There are a couple of things to note. When we were there, some of the restaurants were not open every night. It seemed that 2 were closed each night - Bordeaux and another one night, and Himitsu and another were closed a different night, so plan accordingly. A paper with the next days activities and schedule is placed in your room each night. Also, Himitsu is actually in 2 sections - Japanese and Chinese. There are only 3 tables of 10 in the Japanese section (hibachi style), so there are only 3 seatings. No reservations are accepted, so you need to get there early and wait. But, there is a bar close by! Seatings for us were 6:00. 7:30 and 9:00. The entertainment staff is outstanding. These guys and girls start work at 8 in the morning and are still going strong at 10 at night, seemingly 7 days a week. Always with a smile and their night shows are very fun. Hope this is helpful to all....

<Content>Dreams Punta cana We visited this resort last year when it was Sunscape the beach we loved it then and we were looking forward to seeing the changes as it was upgraded.Firstly we flew First choice which was great, on arrival at the resort we never recevied any cold towels like last year although I did see them giving them out for coach loads later on, but it would have been nice.I had requested certain rooms, we were given a room in block 2 middle floor, the first room had a connecting door which was a nightmare as you could hear every word the people next door were saying, even if they coughed!! So I went to reception after 3 days and requested a move, we moved two doors down and that was much better, we still had a pool view.The food in my opinion was not as hot as it used to be, I felt the food cold at times and as in a previous reviews alot of the restraunts were not opened on certain nights especially the adults only. I must admit last year the oceana etc was buffet style through the day but it has been done up and now you are served. The world cafe suited us with 5 children!!!, it was fine they all work so hard and the lady(can't remeber her name) she greeted us every day last year and was pleased to see us, she was lovely, she worked in the world cafe for breakfast and the oceana for lunch, she made my holiday!!!!The weather was horrid for around 6 days and that was not nice, it poured and poured!!!!!The entertainment team were fab and worked so hard, I remembered alot of the shows from last year.Mickey mouse was our idol and if all the kids had their way he would be home with us!!!! My daughter has not stopped talking about him!!! Glenda  Carrie were so good with the girls and would dance with them and always chat away.Chocolate, well my husband and his friend thought he was great, the only night my friend and I went to the top bar I felt he was very rude to us, he totally ignored us and we waited ages, he even served somone infront of us.We never got to do any excursions due to the weather, I was so excited about returning and I guess I was disappointed maybe because this was our second time there, or the weather, not sure?The gym was great and the guy who works there was very very helpful and chatted away!!!!Well worth a visit!!!!!!!!!!! A few days before we left boys were jumping on the ice berg, pushing the wee ones off it and using foul language, i think that also put a damper on things nothing worse than having to move just beacuse people can't control their children, or are too busy at the bar!!!I may sound negative but our friends who came with us so loved it (there first time).I spoke to other people who stated they did not get the wow factor, they had visited other hotels in the area which they felt were much better?

<Content>As good as ever! I have been to Dreams before. I was there last year (February 2007) with my family and the year before that (February 2006) with my family when it was called Sunscape The Beach. I went alone this time, without my family. I am going again this February 2008 with my family. Why did I go alone this time? [1] WestJet had a $139.00 (each way) special from Toronto which I just couldn't pass up and [2] I had read some recent non-flattering reviews on Trip Advisor (and on their own forum) which gave me pause for some concern. Maybe the management had changed and things wouldn't be the same as previous years? It's a pretty big investment taking a family to any (quality) resort anywhere and I just wanted to reassure myself and, if there were problems, give myself enough time to change destinations if things were not the same at Dreams Punta Cana as they had been in previous years. And, boy, am I glad I went! Bottom line? I am much reassured. No, things are not the same ... they are even better! Still as clean as ever, manicured gorunds, rooms great (well above average), people (both management and staff) as courteous and friendly as ever, food even better that last year (and last year was good!) ... BUT they even have more this year. (I'll probably forget something, hope not.) A brand new Preferred Club building! It's really nice. (Vanessa is still the Club Manager and she is the most competent and nicest lady you'll meet anywhere in the DR.) And brand new bali beds on the beach. And brand new (wood) chaise lounges around the pool. And a new hamburger stand by the pool cooking up burgers to order. And many new additions to the Teen Club (what they are now calling the Core Zone) complete with a new climbing wall, baseball cage with pitching machine, and even an electric riding bull! And they've added wireless internet for the rooms ($ - except for Club) but well worth the convenience). A lot of the same staff are still there from last year (and that says a lot about any resort) and that was very reassuring. You must say hello to Chocolate (chock-o-latte) when you go the The Lobby Bar! Great guy. That's it. I've been to two AMR managed resorts (Secrets and Dreams) and they are definitely doing something right. And, needless to say, I have been much reassured about taking my family back there in February.

<Content>Can't wait to go back-just booked our return trip for this February!! Last year my husband and I went to Dreams Punta Cana with our two young boys (age 3 and 5). The hotel had undergone a name change so there was some confusion on the part of Travelocity (which told us it was still called Sunscape). When we arrived, we were so excited. The resort was beautiful. The Kid's Club was so much fun. There are pirate treasure hunts, limbo competitions, coloring contests, birthday parties...my kids still talk about it and can't wait to go back. The main restaurant (forgetting the name now) has a kids' section that has all their favorites, fries, chicken nuggets, hamburgers, etc. There is a ton of fresh fruit as well. I thought the food was good. Always something different each day. The kids loved the chocolate fountain. We haven't stopped telling people how much we loved the place and our trip. We are going again in February. (We booked through Expedia this time...) And we are counting the days...

<Content>Escape to Dreams Although I have travelled extensively through the United States and Europe, this was my first experience EVER of travelling to the Caribbean and staying in an all-inclusive resort. I trusted my travel agent to book a trip for my honeymoon and she booked us to Dreams in Punta Cana, through Apple Tours. After reading some of the previous reviews on this website, I was really worried about going there but my fiance assured me that, no matter what, we would make the best of things.I'm glad I listened to him and not the people who have written these awful reviews. From the moment we arrived at the airport, we were greeted by friendly, outgoing folks whose only purpose in life was to make us happy (or so it seemed to me!). Upon arrival at the hotel (after the hour long, local sightseeing bus trip) and check in, we mentioned to the staff member helping us how thirsty we were, and voila, there appeared two drinks for us. We booked the Honeymoon Suite and it was more beautiful than I could have imagined. Our king-sized bed was comfortable, the room was very clean and our chambermaid was very observant. When we first got there, I had picked some flowers off the nearby bushes and put them in a glass in my room. EVERY DAY FROM THERE ON OUT, SHE PLACED FRESH FLOWERS IN A VASE IN MY ROOM!! I might mention this was in addition to the standard flowers left every day on the wash cloths and towels. My gown was laid out every night and soft music turned on the radio as part of her personal turndown service,The food was very tasty, albeit the portions are not what Americans are used to as compared to restaurants back in the states. But isn't that the great thing about an all-inclusive resort - you can order more if you like!! We ate at the buffet every morning for breakfast (this is all that's open) and found the food very good and the waitstaff extremely attentive. For dinner we tried a different restaurant every evening and especially enjoyed the Bordeaux Restaurant. Never once could we complain about the service we received. If there was one restaurant that let us down, it was the Mexican one- mediocre food but the service was good. The bars were great, too. Obviously, the more crowded bars around the pool were harder to get served at, but they eventually got to everyone - and there are girls that walk the beach and patio areas to serve those people who do not wish to hit the bar themselves. The bar in the Lobby is WONDERFUL and the three bartenders there, Clemente, Chocolate and Jonathan were awesome. As everyone else has said, the water is not the clear blue one might expect to see in the Caribbean, but it is warm and does provide some relief from the hot sun. The excursions that are offered do get you to the Caribbean side of the island and you can finally see that crystal clear water you associate with the Caribbean. Needless to say, a little money goes a long way. We tipped everyone a dollar here and dollar there. It added up, but was well worth it as we had a great time and would go back again in a heartbeat.LIke anything in life, if you expect too much, you will always be disappointed. This is your vacation, for gosh sake, enjoy it and make the most of it.

<Content>Dreams was very disappointing We went from Nov. 16 to Nov. 23. We went to Punta Cana once before to a different resort and I remembered why I don't like Punta Cana. The food is awful. Buffet had very little selection and ala carte restaurants weren't much better. By the end of the week I was forcing myself to eat. For those who thought food was good I guess have never been to the Riviera Maya in Mexico.Our room was very small compared to other places we've stayed including many times to various places in Mexico, Jamaica and Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic. Also, the bed was very hard. I didn't know you could get an egg crate.We had rain 3 days which wasn't the resort's fault, of course. The pool was very nice and the beach was okay. Not the white sand you get in the Caribbean because you're on Atlantic side, but nonetheless it was nice.We got this vacation for an incredibly low price so we were okay with it. But I would not go back.Next vacation will be back to Riviera Maya in Mexico. It is the best.

<Content>Dreams Resort And Spa is a real DREAM! My daughter Lacey and I attended a destination wedding at the Dreams Resort and Spa in the Dominican Republic in October 2008.We had a wonderful time! The wedding was beautiful thanks to the lovely views! The reception diner was delicious and handeled very professionally. It was served in a georgous and secluded area and very prvate..just for us.The staff at your resort was very friendly, helpful and the most cheerful group I have ever seen! Our room was comfortable and cleaned well daily...the towel animals were so cute! And the fresh flowers around the bathroom sink was such a beautiful welcome. The bed turn-down at night and the soft music in the room when you get in after a full day was very comforting. The drinks were delicious the food presented beautifully, served promptly and very good and the entertainment in the theater nightly was very enjoyable (and very funny too!). I know that you don't control the weather but it too was perfect! And the Spa was beyond perfect!!!Sound like we had a good time? We had a GREAT TIME!We plan to return and have told all our frends and neighbors how wonderful the Dominican and Punta Cana Dreams Resort and Spa is!!Thank You, Thank You, Thank You!Barbara and Lacey

<Content>Two weeks of heaven! My husband and I stayed at Dreams from the 31st Oct to 14th Nov and I can honestly say it was the best holiday we ever had. Despite a long delay in charles de gaulle airport from the moment we arrived we were struck by the welcome we received and the friendliness and efficency of the check in staff. The road from the airportbis bad but our driver really avoided the worst parts.Our room was in block 3 and was spotlessly clean and well equipped. we were on the 2nd floor with a pool view,. It was my husbands birthday and we had chilled champagne and fruit waiting for us. The room had a kingsize bed and there was plenty of pillows etc. Our maid was lovely and we had turndown service each night with chocolates and soft music to welcome us.We ate at all the restaurents except the Oceania as neither of us are seafood lovers. We found the buffet great for lunch and found the soups lovely and with a freshly made sandwich it was enough for midday. The breakfasts were great with eggs every way you could think of and plenty of bacon, juices, smoothies etc. We enjoyed freshly carved turkey, chicken, roast lamb, beef and pork. our only complaint was that they cooked the potatoes al dente like other veg. There was a huge variety and you would have to be really picky not to find something you liked. I think it is a shame that people dont watch their children at buffets as a did observe them handling food and putting it back down. I work at catering so I am very concious of food hygiene regulations and i couldn't find anything to complain about in relation to the food and believe me I would kick up a fuss if the standards were not good. Neither of us had any tummy probs. In relation to service in the bars etc it was not as fast as at home but then you are on holiday so whats the rush. Most of the time our drinks were replenished without us asking and that was tipping and not tipping. The entertainment team were great fun and work their socks of. The spa is a bit expensive I thought, but wow the massages fantastic. The beach was lovely and we spent every afternoon on it when we were not on trips and we followed advise and kept left, no rocks at all. We did see the litter outside the hotels bounderies and that is a pity.Our rep for cocoa tours was great and organised anything we wanted. Our laundery was returned to our rooms within 24 hours however they were a bit to liberal with the starch I thought!We found the other guests to be friendly and only witnessed a few episodes of float stashers. We saw one huge spider for the whole two weeks and this was quickly disposed of by the gardener. We did get a good few bites so dont forget to be generous with the sprays. also the sun is soo strong and you will burn even when its overcast.The resort we could not find fault with, the staff were brillant and we would go back tomorrow. If I was to do anything differently I would avoid Charles de Gaulle airport and Air France. The airport is dirty everthing closed up at 4.00pm and I never experienced such rude and unhelpfull staff. This was our experience on both the outward and return journey.Do look forward to your holiday if you have booked Dreams and relax and have a great time. I know we did and any of the guests we spoke with said the same.

<Content>In LOVE with the Dreams! Mu husband and I were at the Dreams Punta Cana the week of 11/10/08 and CANNOT praise the hotel and its staff enough! We had an awesome time. I read some reviews before we went and the 2 common complaints I saw were: bad road from Airport to hotel, and something wrong/unclean with the rooms. To both I have to say not true at all (for our visit at least). The ride from the airport is about an hour, and there is a part of the road that is bad, but what do you expect?! The highlights of the stay:Greeted with champagne immediately at check-inDidn鈥檛 have to worry about our luggage when checking in or out as it is tagged with a number ad taken to the room or lobby. The staff is on that! The honeymoon/junior suite was very roomy. I would estimate about 600 sq ft. We had a hot tub in our balcony!!! We didn鈥檛 have an ocean view room, but the room was absolutely beautiful!!!The food at all the restaurants is great. However, best one was Bordeaux, and least favorite, The Seaside Grill. No reservations are needed for the restaurants which is nice. Room services is available 24 hrs and is part of the all inclusive! So are the beverages in the mini-bar which included sodas, bottled water and beer, AND are re-filled as you use themBars 鈥?there is plenty of them and ALL the bartenders are awesome. Especially all the bartenders at the Oceana bar. They were absolutely THE BESTEntertainment 鈥?the nightly shows were really entertaining. The one we liked the least was the Karaoke night. It got a little dull when guests got to serious about it鈥?br/>The club/disco plays great music, and the entertainment team is usually in there keeping things going, encouraging guests to have fun and danceTwice a week they have couples night at the beach which includes a bong-fire, champagne, and romantic tunesActivities 鈥?the entertainment team is serious about keeping guests busy throughout the day, but it鈥檚 nice that they are not pushy about itSpa 鈥?we got 1hr massages and they were great. Very professional and thorough. You are allowed to use the spa facilities 1 hr prior to your massage. So we definitely took advantage of itBeach 鈥?plenty of lounge chairs available. The water is nice, but it is on the Atlantic side, which not as pretty as the Caribbean side. There are also a lot of rocks, so bring water shows if you can. That is one of the few things we wished we could change; again, the Caribbean side is so much prettier. But, got to enjoy it (Caribbean) during the excursions we booked through Hotelbeds at the hotel. The Saona and Altos de Chav贸n tour is a must. So is the Sunset Tour.Local shopping- there is a small market that鈥檚 only a 10-minute walk away (the walk is safe). The prices there are better than the ones at the hotel shop. However, beware of the vendors as they are extremely pushy and get extremely disappointed when told you will be back later or you will think about it. Regardless, make sure to bargain with themThe d茅cor, atmosphere, beach, and specially the staff are what make this hotel a DEFINITE come back for us!!!! Even though we have no other hotel to compare it with, we would strongly recommend the Dreams!!!

<Content>My Dream of a Holiday My wife and I were a little apprehensive about this holiday because of all the bad reviews we had read on this site. so we were expecting the worst when we arrived iin the DR. The airport at Punta Cana is lovely and really gives you the feel of the Country from the minute you arrive.When we did arrive at the Hotel (yes the journey is about 1 and a half hours, but enjoyable) we were welcomed with cocktails and cold towels. The lobby bar was the first stop for us where we had premium bottled beer - super!Our room was good, and we had no complaints about anything. The air con worked really well, the bathroom was spotless and always stocked with toiletries and the mini bar was well used and always replenished, as was the coffee machine. Maid service was reliable and we loved the different designs made from the towels.We ate in all the restaurants,Yes sometimes we had to wait for a table in the a la cartes, but we were on holiday, so didn't think there was any need to hurry and just waited in the bar until we were paged to the restaurant. The food was good in all the a la cartes, not massive portions, but plenty of courses, and we could always ask for more if we wanted.The World cafe had a good selection of food at all times. The only restaurant that we weren't thrilled with was the Italian, but that was our opinion, nothing wrong with the food just not to our taste.All the bars served excellent drinks, and we could never complain about the service in any of them, and we didn't tip heavily either.The pool was the best Hotel pool I have ever seen. It was big enough to have a good swim,and it was SPOTLESS.The theatre is well set out and wherever you chose to sit there was a good view of the stage, and there was never a problem getting a drink in there as there is waiter service. The entertainment,both day and night was done by the Hotel's entertainment team, and they do a very good job. They don't hassle you if you don't want to take part, but welcome you with open arms if you participate in the activities. They are always smiling and have a feel good factor about them. The stage costumes are excellent and the shows good. Bravo to you all.I realise this is a lengthy review, but after reading what others have said I felt that the Hotel and its Staff deserve better.We really did have a wonderful happy holiday, and would feel confident in recommending this Hotel to all of our friends and colleagues, and are making plans to return there again ourselves next year.

<Content>Just as I Remembered I returned to Dreams in October this year, having stayed there in January.Most of the improvements have been done - the gardens are wonderful and the pathways much better than before.The road to the Hotel is still as bumpy - but that's all part of the experience of visiting other countries.The Hotel lobby is wonderful, and the Reception staff are very friendle and efficient - as are the bell boys!!This time we were in Block 3 - fairly central to the pool beach and theatre. The room was good, the air conditioning worked well and the bed was comfortable.The room was cleaned daily - and the turn down service was sometimes a little early - but it was done each day!!There were plenty of beds around the pool - and I didn't have any trouble with beds being reserved!! Beach towels were plentiful and they always smelled clean and fresh.The pool is beautiful - clean and clear - and is huge!! There are quiet sections and noisy sections - it's up to you which you choose.The beach / pool bar is well stocked and there was never long to wait for service - as were all the bars thoughout the Hotel.The entertainment was good - you have to remember that it is provided by the Hotel's own entertainment team - and they work hard and do their best - well done to them all!!! Joseph is lovely -such a gentle person.I did the Monster Trucks excursion and that was really worthwhile - and gave me a chance to see the real Dominican Republic.Well done Dreams - another wonderful holiday experience.

<Content>It exceeded our expectation of a "Dream" vacation!! We were at Dreams from Oct. 16th through Nov. 1st. I must admit I was very nervous about traveling to this resort based on the reviews and at one time almost changed resorts. However, I am VERY glad I didn鈥檛. We traveled with 2 other couples and all of us were on a direct flight (not a charter) from our local airport. My husband and I used Apple vacations (as did one other couple) and the last couple used 鈥済o-go vacations. The flight went well鈥攚hen we arrived at the airport, it was made to be fun (music playing, people taking your pictures, etc). The transfer bus Apple was using was full when we arrived out in the parking lot, so we would have had to wait for another bus to fill up before we could leave. The Apple attendant found us the bus our other friends were on (Go Go Travel) and arranged for us to get on it so we did not have to wait!! (There was NO charge for this either!!) Yes, the ride is a little over an hour, but people---you are on vacation! Sit back and enjoy the ride, look at the scenery. The roads are bumpy鈥攂ut I have been on worse, and it definitely wasn鈥檛 the awful experience I had read about. When we arrived at the resort, we were greeted with wet towels, which was very nice. All of us had booked the Preferred Club鈥攕o we were whisked off to the private check in---which was also very nice. At the Preferred Club, there were deserts, fruit and a private bartender at our disposal. I might mention that these were available from very early in the morning until very late in the evening. Additionally at the Preferred Club, there is 24 hour use of the internet at no charge---which is also an added bonus. It was well worth the price of the upgrade. In the Preferred office suite we had not only the above mentioned, but we had lovely employees who knew us by name and/or room number and were always willing and available to assist us in whatever we wanted or needed. Twice, my husband had to call down for an issue in our room (nothing major), and within 5 minutes, someone was there. Also, the concierge called to ensure that we were being taken care of and was it corrected to our satisfaction! We had excellent service the entire time that we were there. Also, a benefit of the Club was that we were able to get our beach towels there and avoid using the 鈥渃ard towel鈥?that every seems to complain about. We also had a section of the beach reserved just for us which was nice. Also, for those of you who like to call home while on vacation, don鈥檛 waste your money on phone cards, or International SIM cards for your cell phone, you can dial home from your room and the charges are minimal which was a great surprise! To call back to the US costs approx. $3 per minute鈥攚hich was the same cost as our cell phone and there was no hassle.The food was wonderful---we ate at almost every restaurant. Our favourite was the Bordeaux. The filet was great - like American beef. The World Cafe (buffet) had many choices and at times looked better than the sit down restaurants we visited. The breakfast was especially nice, no time wasted, get what you want and get out to the pool or ocean!! Oceana was a convenient lunch choice since it's near the pool and beach - and they had carry out which you could take your lunch back to the pool area. We ate twice at the Seaside Grill, it was ok. None of us got sick from the food - we did over do the coconut drinks, which caused some stomach issues, but that was my fault鈥nce I stopped drinking them, the stomach issues stopped. One complaint on the reviews concerned the portion sizes. They are smaller than at home, but consider that there is no place to store left overs, why waste? You can always order more if you need to!! (As a side note, we never waited very long for a table (Bordeaux), but again, there are bars by the restaurants鈥攕it down and enjoy your surroundings鈥gain, you are on vacation. No restaurants were unexpectedly closed and no restaurant ever ran out of food. We had seen this reported before and we did not experience it.)As mentioned in many reviews, the pool is definitely awesome!!! We hung out there for most of the week---as far as the floaties, yes, if you want one first thing in the morning, you have to be at the pool around 8-9am鈥?otherwise, you just hang in the pool until someone gives one up. Our group took a couple of our own, but again, if you are patient, someone will share. This is an area that they could work on, but it is not a major!! Where else can you go, lay by a pool (or on the beach)---and a waitress comes around and takes your order and brings you back a drink when you are next to the bar??? How nice is that? This is a great feature of the resort.The Saona Island excursion is a full day trip, but was worth the time and money. We had a blast, the catamaran is fun and exciting as is the speedboats and the beautiful beaches and water. This is the only excursion we did鈥攕o I can鈥檛 speak for the other ones. For those of you that are questioning if you should vacation at this resort---don鈥檛 question at all. Our group spoke to several people who weren鈥檛 in the Preferred Club and enjoyed this resort as much as we did and stated they would definitely come back again. I am glad that we had upgraded to the Preferred Club---but, I think it is how you approach your vacation鈥?.just go and enjoy!!! We did!

<Content>A Dream Never been to this Hotel before, although I have been to the North and South of the Island in the past. I was a little bit doubtful after the bad reviews I have recently read, but my worries were for nothing.Yes, the road to the Hotel is bad - bumpy and the journey does seem to take forever - but youre not at work - so enjoy - it's all part of the holiday!!The Hotel makes up for the road's shortcomings - we were greeted with cool towels and a cocktail. Reception Staff were efficient and friendly.The room was wonderful - we had a room with a view of both the pool and the sea. It was clean and well maintained. Maid service was good - and the turn down service even better. The mini bar was well stocked daily.The pool is wondeful - big and clean. There are quiet parts to the pool and there are plenty of sun loungers.The drinks were of a good quality and well presented whichever bar we used.Concierge staff were very helpful and knowledgeable and there was always someone at the desk from early morning until late at night.The entertainment staff were brilliant and worked hard to keep everyone happy. Well done Usher and 50 Cent - you were extra special!!The food was good - a wide variety of choice, though it should be expected that the a la carte take longer to get a table, but the food is worth the wait.Can't wait to go back - and it will be soon!!!!

<Content>The real story about Dreams Before going to Dreams for a week in 11/08, we watched the weather forecast and read many reviews. There were more good than bad reviews, but there were enough bad reviews to make us worry a bit. Here is the straight story.Dreams Punta Cana is a spectacular resort with attention paid to every detail. The grounds are manicured and tropically beautiful. The service is friendly and responsive. The food is better than okay and unless you are used to eating in 5 star restaurants, you will enjoy both the quality and variety at the various ala carte restaurants. In 7 days, we only ate breakfast at the buffet. No reservations were necessary at the ala carte restaurants and, if we weren't seated immediately, we never had to wait more than 10-15 minutes. Waiting in a nice bar with free drinks isn't much of a hardship at any rate. Only the Japanese restaurant was tricky to get into on a timely basis because of the limited seating around the cooking tables. We typically ordered several appetizers because they are small portions. Remember, in the Caribbean, their definition of beef tenderloin is different that an American's definition. I am sure Dreams serves the best beef available but Angus it isn't. Sea food, chicken and lamb were excellent. You are in the middle of the ocean, think about it.The pool and beach couldn't be more beautiful and enjoyable. If you like laying in the sun, this is paradise. The 10 day advance weather forecast on the computer predicted rain everyday we were there. In fact, it never rained a drop and was seldom slightly cloudy. Various reviews mentioned going to the left up the beach but we found pristine beaches and great body surfing by going to the right around the point several hundred yards. Take a stroll, it's perfectly safe and an awesome stretch of beach..Our standard room was more than roomy and comfortable. Which leads me to the only negative and puzzle. Our king sized bed was hard as a pool table. We had been forewarned by reviews so we came prepared. We brought inflatable air mattresses that we partially inflated and put under the mattress cover. This was okay as an emergency measure to get us through the first night. Our ultimate salvation was to go to the front desk and complain in a firm but friendly manner. When we returned to our room a couple of hours later, our air mattresses had been removed and an egg crate foam layer had been placed on our mattress. Don't suffer in silence with a hard bed . Speak up and it will be addressed.The question I have is: this is a 6 Golden Apple resort with attention paid to every detail. Why they don't invest in memory foam mattress toppers is quite simply a mystery. Why make someone complain. Not everyone is assertive enough to speak up. Don't worry about the ride from the airport. You are picked up in a big Greyhound type bus and the bumps along the way are not severe. Consider the hour drive a free tour of the Dominican countryside. We concluded that all the bad reviews were written by sour pusses that don't like being outside in the sun, were looking for things to be mad about, and who probably should stay in the US or UK in their comfort zone. If you go to the tropics, expect to see an occasional bug. We brought bug spray for when we were lounging but never used it.The Casino was small but sufficient. The nightly shows were more cute than riveting. There are lots of activities if you want to be active. There are plenty of loungers, floating mattresses, etc. if you want to simply relax. There was a good mix of shaded lounge chairs so that if one person wanted sun and one didn't, you could always find a place to be together.The jewelry vendors were allowed to set up their stands on Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday evening. They were pushy but would take no for answer if you were firm. We got some great buys on Amber, lava stone, and the local turquoise type stone called larimar. You have to be prepared to negotiate. They always start high. Have fun with it.I could go on and on, but you get the idea. Dreams is a tropical paradise. Don't pay attention to the bad reviews. You will like it.We will go back and would recommend it highly to friends.Brian and Cathy 11-18-08

<Content>Dreams are what you make them!!! We have just returned (today) from our wonderful stay at Dreams.... We have fell in love with the Dominican Republic and its people, they are so warm and friendly and this was especially felt at the Dreams. The choice of hotel was made via the reviews on this website so I felt the need to write one too. Can't compare to other resorts as never been before but cannot fault our holiday, after all its what you make of it too! I am also a vegetarian which was a concern and found more than enough to eat throughout my stay and even managed to put on half a stone, although the wonderful cocktails may have had something to do with that too. The staff were wonderful and I cannot commend their hard work too highly. Dreams have an excellent array of personnel. The maids saw to our every need and I really enjoyed the towel figures that were done for us. Room was more than adequate for our needs, excellent air con and the beds were comfy. Entertainment Team, EXCELLENT, they really work hard and no matter how many or few join in the activities they are professional and entertaining, and they don鈥檛 bug you if you just want to relax. They performed and entertained for just 3 children on one evening! The world cafe waiters - too many names to mention, were always tentative and provided first class service. Pool waiters, the pool towel service and cleaners were lovely guys that really deserve a mention too. Always a smile and song despite the hard work they do. The gardeners deserve endless praise and probably the least thought of personnel (by guests), who kept immaculate and beautiful gardens that were a pleasure to view. love the wildlife at the hotel parrots, flamingos, fish  turtle, peahens, beautiful butterflies all added to the enjoyment (didn't see one tarantula to my delight but not my partner鈥檚 who was looking forward to seeing one - you are in the tropics). We made some wonderful new friends from the US and UK alike. We spoke to several guests who have stayed in the Dom Rep before at other hotels and there was a distinct pref for Dreams. Trips, we did the monster truck safari brilliant day out; informative, saw a little of the country and its people and its an excellent way to support the school funding programme at the same time, also did Samoa island too. Tipping, you get the same smile regardless, but a little goes a long way and there is pleasure in the giving. All in all read the reviews take a very broad view of the negatives and go for it, we shall be going again. Any questions please feel free to contact me directly.

<Content>Disappointed I had very high hopes for this resort as I was moving from 5 star resorts to a 6 star.My first disappointment was in my room then the dining areasHousekeeping was not up to par I had to call on serveral occasions just to get towels in my room for showering. I used my iron once and could not put it away as it was hot and two days later they didn't either.I found the food to be below par and not presented in a very nice manner, just plates on tables with no decor or greenery to make it more appetizing. Fruit and vegatable very limited in choice nightly same thing.The spa was the best part of the trip it was relaxinging and treated you special. The pool area was very noisy with kids and you could not get away from them even at the swim up bar they would be playing dodge ball so close the ball would go over the bar serveral times.Adult games in the pool were even taken over by the kids and no ones says anything. There were areas for kids but they seem to ignore them and no rule were enforced.Nightly entertainment was very poor for a 6 star resort dancers did same dance just in different costumes and the two nights they had guest night it was same thing just different people boring, so opted after awhile just to go to my room and watch a movie., it was more entertaining.was disapponted in the coral bottom beach as I do like to swim in the ocean but that never happened.Check-in and Check-out went very well Overall I will stick with 5 stars and give the Dreams a 4 star

<Content>Huge Disappointment! Well I am sad to report to everyone who is looking for opinions on this resort, that we just had a week from hell. I really wanted to have a wonderful review to come back and share with everyone, but my wedding week at Dreams Punta Cana was far from wonderful. I want to share a little about myself so you can get a fair perspective. I am an optimist! My husband and I had 30 family and friends join us for this week and for our wedding. My main concern was not that my wedding day be picture perfect but that we all share in the memories of being together and be married. This is the fifth trip abroad for me, so I am used to adjusting my habits and expectations to other than I have in Canada. I know that there will be a language barrier, keep the 鈥榦ff the normal track鈥?requests simple, drink only the bottled water, know your currency conversion, know a few words of their language if nothing else, and don鈥檛 expect things to be at a standard of what you would back home. We brought over 250lbs of donations with us to give to the children of the Dominican Republic. We all came with big hearts, full of excitement, and grateful that we could all be fortunate enough to do something like this. I believe in giving a fair and real perspective of our time there. I am an easy going person, and I went to this resort for example, not knowing what my flowers would look like, my cake, the location of the private reception, what we were going to eat for our meal,鈥? and I was at ease about not picking it until the last minute. I like so many other brides I have read about, tried numerous times to contact the resort to get these and other common questions answered. I, like others, had hit and miss responses from the wedding coordinators, often no response at all. All of this I chalked up to these three ladies being over worked, and just decided not to worry about it until I got there. I still feel that way, but would say you need to definitely adjust your level of expectations, a lot. The only request that we had was to try and have all of our guests in the same building, or as close as possible, considering that we had booked 10 months prior it should not be a problem. We were told that they could not give us any guarantees, but would do there best.THE ARRIVALWe arrived to Dreams Punta Cana, at lunch time, to a warm welcome and cold glass of champagne. The road was long and horribly bumpy, but we knew to expect this. A few of us got quite motion sick even with taking Gravol, including myself, but this is just how it is. Our luggage was unloaded to the holding area as many of the rooms were still being cleaned at this time, (again not a problem, we knew to expect this). As everyone began to check in it became apparent that we were being put in different areas of the resort. By the time we all got our rooms at 4:30, we were in every building at the resort, all nine of them! There are three floors to a unit and over 20 rooms to a floor. So you would think that it would be not too much trouble to get us all close together. Well it was like this, we couldn鈥檛 have been more apart from each other! THE ROOMS Some of my family was on the ground floor of building 7; we ended up on the third floor. The rooms were more damp than you would expect and not all that impressive. Apparently, the guy at the front desk said they were the newest to be renovated and the nicest, so I walked around the resort checking out other guests鈥?rooms and as I expected, we were being lied to. Some of the other buildings had nicer rooms than building seven. He tried to upgrade us to the honeymoon sweet and I said I wanted to see the suite and the room we would be getting before we decide on which we will take. Of course he tried to rush us into deciding and I said no, I want to see our room first. He finally gave us our room and after making such a fuss about how spread out we all were, he gave us a 鈥榥icest room, you will like鈥?and said he would take care of getting us all closer together. We finally made our way to our room, 7307, on the third floor of building seven. It was clean and a little warm so we tried to turn the AC to maximum. There are no markings on the dial to adjust the temperature so it was a guessing game. Our room never got cool enough to stop sweating while we were in it. We had married couples put in a room with double beds?!, single people given a king size bed, and I single person given the crib that was to be given to the couple with a baby. I realize people make mistakes but this was just the beginning of one 鈥榤istake鈥?after another, and another. Room changes took place for a couple days after arrival as the following things were concerning; bathtub didn鈥檛 plug for bathing, bed collapsed when it was sat on and someone ended up on the floor (head onto the marble floor!), water across the floor because it had not been cleaned up enough after a flood!?!, TV did not work because it had no where to be plugged into just a hole in the wall behind it, lamp at the bedside gave electrical shock when attempting to turn on, AC didn鈥檛 work. There was huge inconsistency from the room placement and room cleaning service. Some people got a room that partially faces the ocean, another ended up in the preferred club building, and others in a room that was so small you only had 6鈥?between the two beds(seriously), and we all paid the same thing! Some people got special turn down service at night, others did not. Some got Champagne in their room nightly, others did not. Some got fresh flowers throughout their rooms, others did not.飩?I do have to say the maids were all so nice, and the friendliest we have ever encountered.THE WEDDING MEETINGMaria was our wedding coordinator and she was very personable. She answered any of my concerns or questions with assurance that 鈥榊es she understood鈥?and 鈥榙on鈥檛 worry everything will be perfect鈥? I truly believe that she did her best but the evening of our wedding showed that there was not understanding of what we chose. Again I did not expect perfection and tried to keep my requests simple. But, I caution you that the pleasant confirmations that 鈥榓ll is understood鈥?and 鈥榥ot to worry and relax鈥? does not lead to your requests being met necessarily. We met with Maria for about and hour. 飩?Cake- chocolate with chocolate icing, smooth all over, ribbon around the bottom (which I supplied in our color) and a fresh flower on top center. Keep it simple for them right, how can you mess that up right, wrong!飩?Flowers tropical mixture and the girls bouquets wrapped with the blue ribbon I supplied around the stems.飩?Meal: appetizer: Avocado and shrimps salad; soup: cream of tomato with basil and tangerine; main course: chicken cordon blue(we specifically asked if it was baked or deep fried and were told baked) with chateau potatoes(sliced potatoes layerd with chesse like a tower) and steamed vegetables; dessert: kahlua flan with coconut and chocolate sauces *We had a vegetarian, one guest allergic to shrimp, and one guest who do not eat seafood. We had a few simple requests which were told to be 鈥榥o problem, don鈥檛 worry, it will be perfect.鈥?All three guests were to get the caprese salad instead of the planned appetizer, and the vegetarian was to get vegetable fettuccine alfredo. All else was to remain the same. Pretty simple right, wrong!*飩?We brought a few decorations for color, blue organza to wrap bows around the white chairs, candle holders with tea lights, and glass starfish to tie around the napkins with blue ribbon. We asked to have the tables set with a horseshoe sort of shape. One table across the top for six, (us and our parents), and two perpendicular tables at the end of our table to extend the guests down so everyone could see and talk. We drew this out and it was confirmed that they understood. They did not!飩?Before the wedding day we ere given a copy of what the bill would be for our approval. The only thing missing was the fee for the judge and the wine we selected for the evening. This would be added and we could get our bill upon check out. Everything sounded just fine, easy right, wrong! The bill restated that we could stay until 10:30PM and anything past then was a charge of 10% per hour. We understood and were fine with this.飩?We set the time for the wedding on the beach at 4:00PM and then to sign the papers with the judge before the dinner reception started.THE FOOD Over half of the people in our group had a lot of diarrhea and nausea with cramping. I realize people get diarrhea when they travel. We tend to eat more rich foods than normal, drink more booze than normal, etc. But when many of these people are stuck in their room and on the toilet for almost an entire day something is not right. As we walked around the resort you would overhear peoples鈥?conversations and there were a lot of other people sick there, a lot. There was a bride there from Canada as well with a group of 40 people. I never got to meet her but met people who were there for her wedding. She and her fianc茅 ate at the same restaurant as I did the night after I did and she ended up in the hospital in Punta Cana as I did. THE EMERGENCYMonday evening we ate dinner with our photographer and two friends at the Seaside Grill. As we found in all the restaurants, the service staff is super fabulous! Best service we ever have had in all our travels. They were attentive, polite, genuine, and fun too! The food tasted okay and all of us ate the same thing but in different variations. We finished eating by 9:45 PM, had a coffee with Bailey鈥檚 and left the restaurant at 10:15. We were on our way up to the lobby bar to meet everyone. We were in building 7, which we walked passed and as we started to pass by the end of building 8 I began to get strong cramping from my pelvis up into my rib cage. I told everyone to go ahead and that I would catch up because I thought I was going to have to use the bathroom. I got to our room and had the first bout of diarrhea. I called the concierge who located my fianc茅 to let him know I was staying in the room. I must say that was pretty awesome of them to do that no problem. The cramping went from strong to worse and then diarrhea again followed by vomiting. My fianc茅 came back to the room at 11:30PM and I was in more pain than ever. I would get moments when the pain would ease up but it never stopped. I could not even drink a sip of water with out pain, or keep it in! I just kept thinking it would pass and I would be fine. I would lie down for a few minutes and then be back in the bathroom. This went on until 2:30 AM and the pain kept increasing, I can鈥檛 even put into words how much I was in pain! I ended up over the toilet permanently and although my body was empty it would not relent in making me vomit. I started to feel exhausted and a little scared at the fact that my body was uncontrollably reacting in this way. My fianc茅 called my mom who came up right away with my father. My mother, my aunt and my mother in law who were all on the trip are nurses. When my mom first got to the room she was concerned. She started talking to me, and then she tried to call my Aunt and mother in law. I realized something wasn鈥檛 right. I started have strange dull tingling sensations in my hands. Then it started in my arms and shoulders and neck. I was extremely pale by this point and I went from worse to urgently needing a doctor pretty fast. My hands started to clench up and I could not open them. I was dehydrated and going into shock. My mother and father in-law arrived. My mother got on the phone to get a doctor and they sent a guy who didn鈥檛 speak any English! Then another man showed up, and another, and another. Everyone was just watching and my mom was still asking for the doctor. One of the men in the room kept asking my fianc茅 if we had insurance, and he kept saying yes. The man kept saying that having the doctor come would cost extra and my fianc茅 kept saying we have insurance; we will pay just get the doctor. My parents asked one guy if they had transportation to the doctor or is he coming to the room? No one seemed to know. Someone went to get a cart or something to carry me away with. By this time my mom was talking to the doctor on the phone and he started asking her the same thing about insurance. All they were concerned about was, were they going to get paid! And I kept getting worse. I was getting disorientated and starting to loose consciousness. So dad told another guy to help him and they carried me down to the ground floor. My body was like a rag doll. They had a cart like a golf cart with a flat bed behind the front seats waiting. The guy drove my fianc茅e, my mother and I, up to the medical room on the resort and the doctor wasn鈥檛 there yet. They got me up on the exam table and the doctor came. Of course he sent my fianc茅 back for the visa and insurance information before he would do anything! The doctor took my blood pressure; 87 over 60. Then he took a strangely long time to try and start an intravenous. I was really dehydrated and he could not really find any veins. My mother said she felt like he was really unsure and so she asked him if he had done this before and he said yes but not for a long time. So he put it in (with a much larger than normal needle and no anesthetic on the skin first) and without drawing back to make sure he was in the vein, he began injecting me into my tissue not my bloodstream! My mom said, 鈥淵ou鈥檙e not in the vein!鈥?and he stopped. Then he took it out and had to try again. He ended up getting the IV hooked up and then injected meds that stopped the cramping and vomiting actions really quickly! The IV drip was getting into me and the ambulance was on its way. The doctor said almost too quickly that it was not food poisoning but sensitivity to eating food in a different country!? I was loaded onto the ambulance and then they had to take care of the payments before it could go. My fianc茅 and mother came in the ambulance for the hour long ride from hell. The road we went on was not the road we came to the resort on initially and to say it was extremely bumpy would be an understatement. They were being bounced off the bench on which they sat, and how they didn鈥檛 vomit all over me I don鈥檛 know. God help someone that has a fracture!!!At the hospital I was taken into an emergency room where a nurse came in to take my blood pressure and temperature. She left the doctor came in. He pressed around on my abdomen for about 12 seconds and then said that my intestines were inflamed and that I didn鈥檛 have food poisoning because I had a fever. I probably had bacteria in me that they needed to treat with medication but I needed to be hospitalized for at least a day or two. He said he needed to give a blood, a urine, and stool sample as soon as possible and then left the room!?! We were looking around the room and began to notice things. There was blood across the curtain that closes off the room from the hall. There was blood spattered over the floor and the wall by the counter where they were to dispose of used needles. It looked like they used the wall to rebound off of and try to hit the bucket from across the room. There was a used needle just lying on the floor! The nurse that took my temperature came back in and my mom asked how high my fever was. The nurse had a surprised and puzzled look come over her face and said 鈥淔ever? She has no fever.鈥?She took my blood sample and left. A while later the doctor came back in and asked if I was able to get him the stool and urine samples yet!?! Did he not just learn that I had been having diarrhea and vomiting for 5 hours!?! I was severely dehydrated, so where was I going to come up with the samples!?! There was no way I was staying in this hospital; we were all going to get something just by being there! So after some time I was discharged with medications, instructions to come back if it was to start again, and to stay out of the sun because the medication I was going to be taking would give my skin lesions. My fianc茅 paid the hospital and we took a cab together back to the resort. Once back at the resort, I phoned home to my doctor in Canada and explained everything. She asked me questions, and I listed off the medications (that we had recorded) that had been given to me. She said that I did have food poisoning. They are probably just saying otherwise to keep the heat off the resort, because the medication they administered was used to treat food poisoning! Also she said that I could go in the sun, not to worry. I was glad I called her; what a remainder of the trip I would have if I wasn鈥檛 aloud in the sun! THE RESPONSE I did not have one phone call from management or anyone at the resort to express concern or see how I was. The only thing that happened was that we were billed for the phone call to contact the doctor that night! Why an outside call you may ask? Because he was at a neighboring resort! The doctor was not even on the property which is why it took so long for him to come! What if someone was having a heart attack!?! By the time they check for your insurance to pay and call the doctor, you would probably be dead! Unreal! THE WEDDING So, by Friday I was feeling well enough to have the wedding, but they also had no other time to do it. The weather was beautiful and perhaps if I had not been so sick the following things may not have bothered me so much.鈥?The cake looked hilarious! It came out with white icing, the ribbon around the center of the cake, with chocolate blops (attempt at petals?) around the base and top of the cake, and a big blop of chocolate icing on the middle of the top of the cake. It seriously looked like a pile of [-] on top! So we tried our best to make it presentable by ripping apart our bouquets. The cake did taste really good!鈥?The flowers were beautiful! They did not use they blue ribbon however that I had brought to wrap around the stems. How do you mess that up?鈥?The reception seating was sad. They had 7 people squished across the front and it was so tight that the people at each end were actually on the corner. The seats were all so squished together that there was not even seven inches between plates. It was not comfortable but we made it work. They had all the candles going and had made menus on paper wrapped around some of the candles so they were lit up. It did look nice.鈥?The avocado shrimp appetizer was very tasty. The soup just tasted like tomato soup and was barely warm. The main meal was a disappointment. The chicken was moist but deep fried. There was such minimal 鈥榝illing鈥?you had to look to see if it was there, (definitely did not taste it). The potato was just that. A peeled cut in half lengthwise plain potato, and most peoples were not even cooked enough to eat. Three people did not even get their meals. So after about 8 minutes I got up to go see what was wrong and they said they must have missed counted. So then after about another five minutes the vegetarians鈥?pasta comes out and it is filled with ham chunks. So it gets sent back and they come out and bring her the chicken cordon blue instead. Now everyone is done eating and the last three people finally get their meals. The dessert is a square of slimy, creamy colored, gelatin feeling, thing. Two people ate more than one bite. 鈥?We brought our own I-pod docking station which we used for the music during dinner and to dance to after dinner. 鈥?The waiters brought around wine throughout dinner and were very pleasant. We tipped them at the end of the evening and the guys at the little bar that they had set up for us. It was a beautiful evening and there was a nice breeze. We had some speeches and then took a quick break before cutting the cake. Then it was almost ten and we decided to set up for our first dance. That鈥檚 when Maria came to remind me that we had to start packing up in 20 minutes! I said to her that we were just going to start our dances and the photographer was setting up for this and that we will stay until probably midnight or so. She said no we had to leave by 10:30 because they have to send people home. Even though we were told we could stay later, now suddenly we were being told we couldn鈥檛. Unreal!THE FINALY Saturday evening after an early dinner we went to the front desk to get the bill and pay it. The next morning we all had to be in the lobby checked out and ready to leave at 7:50AM for the airport in Punta Cana. We got the bill and it was in Dominican Pesos not the US DOLLARS we were billed in prior. That鈥檚 fine. I just requested it converted back to US so that we can confirm the prices. Well the guy had to manually calculate this because the computer won鈥檛. (20 minutes later) There were no explanations of most fees, just some code number beside it. We were told we would have explanations of all charges and copies of the bills from the extras (ex. Wine). There were none, just a bunch of numbers that we had to compare with our quote. Well almost $500.00 US extra was charged to us and no one could tell us what for. No one could find anyone who could do anything about anything; the wedding department was closed until the next day at 10:00AM, so we went back to our room to pack. The 鈥榮upervisor鈥?on shift was going to call us to figure things out, but of course he never did. We called and he still knew nothing and would get back to us, 鈥渄on鈥檛 worry鈥? We confirmed that our bags would be picked up from our room in the morning at 7:15AM and taken to the lobby, finished packing and went to bed with still no phone call. The next morning we called at 7:10AM as we were leaving our room, to go to check out and grab breakfast, and they confirmed someone was getting our bags right away. We got to the front, new people there, and no one has a clue about what we are talking about. The 鈥榮upervisor鈥?from the night before eventually shows up there and he says that it still isn鈥檛 figured out. All the while we are being told that everything will be fine and not to worry and then the person would walk away and start with a different guest in the line! You are told that you can鈥檛 get transportation off the grounds until you are paid and checked out. And although they keep saying that our bags are on the way, or that our bags are there, they are not and the clock is ticking. We sent friends back to our rooms to check and they are not in the room, but they are not anywhere else! So after another hour of nothing being accomplished and no one knowing what to do or who to talk to, I end up in tears. They finally let the unknown and unexplainable charge be removed and we pay the bill. Our luggage shows up and we get on the bus that everyone has been waiting on. We leave the resort after 9:00AM, over and hour after we are suppose to have been gone. This lead to a whole new set of problems because now we were all late checking if for a flight that eleven of us did not get on! If we had gotten there on time, it would not have happened.So to wrap this up here it is.鈥?We did get married 鈥?We did get to have our friends and family be part of our wedding day and spend time together. 鈥?We did try to make the most of our time there. 鈥?The weather was beautiful. 鈥?The grounds were well manicured and full of flowers. 鈥?The grounds keepers, servers, bartenders, maids, were all so pleasant. 鈥?The long winding pool is excellent! 鈥?The game center is a nice place for everyone to mingle, and the theatre is very impressive.BUT鈥?When a serious occurrence happens they lack how to handle it鈥?When a serious occurrence happens they don鈥檛 look into it after鈥?Whatever your preferences may be for your wedding, don鈥檛 count on it happening that way鈥?When I say that many people were oddly ill, I am not exaggerating.鈥?When two people end up with food poisoning, there is a problem.鈥?This was a once in a lifetime trip for a lot of our guests and for us. As hard as you can try to stay optimistic, when things go wrong, over and over, and when everyone is paying a lot of money to be there, positive thinking can only go so far. 鈥?When they say don鈥檛 worry everything will be fine, or I understand, worry.There are many more examples of things that were disappointments, but I think that I have written a long enough novel. My only hope is that no one else has to have the experience that we did. Perhaps I was the unlucky one, just like sometimes you get a car that is a lemon. Perhaps

<Content>Good Dreams! My husband and I stayed at Dreams October 26 through the 31, and we loved it! Yeah the drive from the airport was long and scary, but what do you expect in a foreign country. Our driver took us through the country instead of going through town on the way there, and the country side is beautiful once you are away from the houses and stuff. The trip was for our 3rd anniversary. When we arrived the check in went smooth and we were greeted with a letter telling us happy anniversary. When we arrived at our room we were surprised to find out that we had been upgraded to an ocean view suite, we also had a bottle of champagne and a fruit plate waiting on us. The suite was in building 1 and was a swim out. The deck had two lounge chairs, a table and chairs, and a Jacuzzi tub. It was quite nice. The grounds were beautiful and the pool was just awesome. There was always someone pruning bushes, picking up trash, and cleaning the pool. The beach was nice as well, but I think they need to have more waitresses on the beach to take drink orders. We tried all of the restaurants except the Italian one. They were all pretty good, but the Japanese and the Mexican were our favorites. The buffet was ok, but not the best buffet we have ever encountered to at an all-inclusive. I just got a few drinks from the bars. If you are looking for a good time order anything with rum, they are not stingy with it, but the margaritas suck. I liked the red wine, I don鈥檛 know what kind it is but it was pretty decent. The people that work here a super nice, not once did I walk past an employee that didn鈥檛 give me a smile and a 鈥渉ola鈥? If you get a chance check out the wellness center, they have a nice big hot tub with a waterfall, a steam room, a sauna, and various showers. I had a massage, body wrap, and hydrotherapy, and the wellness center was included. I think I could have lived with just spending a few hours in the wellness center. The massage was wonderful, but I could hear cars driving by and people talking from the treatment room (not so relaxing). We had a wonderful time during our stay. I would definitely recommend this resort to family and friends. It鈥檚 a great place to stay!

<Content>fun in the sun After a 1 hour ride from airport[and a beer stop by bus driver] we arrived to cool towels and cold drinks. Was needed/ We were taken to rooms almost immediately. Rooms- clean, stocked cold refrigator , lovely patio with confortable swing. maids were pleasant and helpful and were there several times when we needed assistance with door lock. They had to replace one. Pool- clean and very large. Pool is one of its best features there. The water was always kept clean,and pool maintance was excellent. pool bar[barracuda] we stayed by every day and bartenders happy and pleasant. Keep the Bahama mama's coming[with extra banana]pedro and juan carlos always greeted you with pleasantries. towel bar right there so all close to our room. Beach- steep infront of hotel and rocky but go to left of hotel, much better there. We walked the beach every morning and saw the armed guards with dogs outside of hotel grounds. We collected sponges while walking beach but inspectors took them from us/ thanks airport guards// Food- only great dining was oceana, great coconut shrimp and soup. buffet had good variety and good waiters. Breakfast was wonderful with custom omlets and frothy drinks made by Ambar. She is so cute and pleasant. The rest of the dining was average to so so. nanchos and cheese at lunch on beach we all enjoyed. Entertainment-- they keep you busy ALL the time/ The little ones to teenagers will have no time to rest. The evenings were filled with ballgame outside[go phillies] and vendors every few evenings. They do get alittle pushy/ okay, alot pushy// Over all I would go back there again. I do hope they finish renovations in rooms but that takes time. We ranged in age from 40 to 83 and all could handle walking the whole place. If you have any leg problems, get 1st floor. No elevators in building where you sleep//

<Author>Washington_DCSuze
<Content>Definitely NOT a 5* Anyone who considers this a 5 or 6-star resort obviously hasn't traveled much. I would rate it a 3-star at most. Staff was wonderful and accomodating although at times there seemed to be a language barrier, especially when attempting to get broken items repaired. Accomodations: We stayed in Bldg. 2. Bathroom was old, cracks in the wall, tub that was difficult to climb into because it was small and framed with glass. Outside our patio garbage (rugs and mats) were hanging from trees -- obviously having fallen from one of the unit above us. Hallways were dimly lit and tile floors extremely slippery. Food: Typical buffet breakfast although many mornings the food was cold from sitting in the silver chafing dishes. Evening meals in three of the specialty restaurants were excellent. Entertainment: Good. No complaints. Although we got tired of being accosted by the vendors who set up booths nightly on our way to the main area. It was annoying to say the least. Perhaps they should be on the outer walks rather than throughout the entire entrance to the main building. Pool: Well maintained. Clean. Although the chair saving was evident throughout the day. All in all, we had a nice time because the weather was great and it was very relaxing but I would not return here nor would I recommend it to friends as it is not the quality of vacation I am used to.

<Content>i love punta cana Just came home this morning, and i miss the holiday already!! I found all the staff, apart from in the shop, very friendly. They made us feel very welcome. Arrival was nice, greeted by all staff. Found that the rooms were always clean, fridge alwasy stocked up and the housecleaners friendly. Thought the hoetl was beautiful. Always appeared clean and tidy inside and out, aswell as the pool. Plenty of sunbeds around the pool. Activities were good, with staff holding 4 or more during the day around the pool area. Entertainment at 5 near the beach was brief but good. I found the food was good, sometimes cold, but in a buffet I sometimes expct it. The other restaurants were nice, particulalry enjoyed the grill. Evening entertainment was good, althoguh in 2 weeks a little repetivive, but still enjoyed it. I went with a family as their nanny, and the 2 1/2 year old enjoyed it as much. The staff were very friendly to her, and she cam home speaking spanish! she alwasy had something to do, and enjoyed any entertainment she saw. Overall i thoroughly enjoyed this holiday. i miss the staff few inparticular, and am hoping to back next year!

<Content>Wonderful Experience! We absolutely loved Dreams. It was our first time at an all inclusive and were very pleased. Anyone who is not happy with the food are way too picky and should rethink going to an all inclusive like Dreams. There were so many options that I can not imagine not finding something that you would like. We would rate the food from good to great. Many choices for breakfast, include fresh made omelettes, pancakes, french toast and made to order fresh fruit drinks etc..After a couple days we knew what items were more to our liking. Service everywhere was excellent and with a smile. These Dominican people are very hard workers and work long hours while retaining their smiles. There is a language barrier at times when trying to communicate, but it never caused too much of a problem. The pool is absolutely amazing. Bring your own inflatable float so as not to be disappointed to not find a float provided by the resort. Relaxing by floating in the pool is definitely stress relieving. Like other reviewers, I agree, go to the beach to the left and the water is better, and the floor of the ocean is more sandy. The water is not as blue- green as other areas in the Caribbean, but this did not alter our opinion of the resort. The pool makes up for it. Entertainment was very good, just don't expect Broadway or Vegas quality shows. The room attendants do a great job cleaning the rooms and do a special turn down service in the evening using fresh flowers accents . People comment on the 1 hr bus ride to the resort from the airport. Yes, the road is bumpy, but we used Prieto transportation, and rode on a very comfortable large tour type bus and found it interesting and also humbling to see how some Native Dominicans live. We felt truly blessed for what we have. I highly recommend this resort to all, it definitely stands up well to our wonderful cruises we've done in the past . If I was a person to repeat a vacation, this would definitely be one.

<Content>True Heaven I have just arrived back this morning from a week at Dreams, with my husband and 3 kids aged 13, 8 and 3...and what a wonder time we had. The negetive reveiws had made me a little nervous to say the least, but it wasn't like that at all.We booked with carribean warehouse so we flew with thomson fly...great, transfer with VIP, good drive, little bumpy but he was so careful...only on the way there mind you another story on the way back (speeding, reckless,) and did make you feel sick, did wonder if we would make it to the airport...(different driver though).When we arrived we were offered fruit punch or BFizz, check in was quick. First thing I noticed was the corridoors smelt clean and fresh as did all the wash rooms.The resort was amazing, Ive stayed at some lovely resorts but this was exceptional. Amazing gardens, pool, all so pristine. We stayed in a family deluxe room in block 3 which was central but we had a bit of a walk to get around as the resort is so big. Clean, lovely spacious rooms. Food was good, plates were clean! We ate at the Himitsu x 2, really nice. World cafe had a good variety, Oceana both day and night served very good food. Mexican and Italian was OKish.Kids Club and daily entertainment was fun the kids loved all the activities and so did we, met some fun families from London. Ps get collecting your Dreams dollars for participating in the activies which you can spend at the auction 3x per week.All the staff on the resort could'nt do enough for you they always had a smile on their face.We had some quality professional family photos taken on the resort which cost quite a bit but worth the memories. I do reccomend this.On to the Negatives..Yes, I agree, some tourist were rude and yes there was alot of lounger and Cabana hogging by the pool and beach..so annoying. Inconsiderate smoking, ash flicking inc at the restaurants, Some poolside, drunken rowdy behaviour.Spa is stunning but you had to pay to use the pool, steam sauna etc. I had a pedicure that my 3 year old daughter could of done better.Please be aware of the 10% charge for Credit/Debit cards which is not stated anywhere in the hotel or brochues. Take TC's or cash.I bought some quality designer handbag copies from The Bamblue boutique at the hotel. They took off the 10% charge on the bags...which was good.Theres a small market to the right of the hotel just 10 mins walk for cheaper souveniers about 70% cheaper than hotel. Dont be put off by some of the reviews you read..but maybe take some travel sick pills if you get travel sick. Also watch out for those 8 leged things they are huge! Hope you found this review helpful.

<Content>Great Holiday We traveled to Dreams for the first week in September. Having been to many resorts over the last 4 years, I feel comfortable recommending this resort to friends and family. First off, all my travels to the Caribbean have been either Cuba or Dominican Republic. This was my first summer time get away down south. I find that most of the poor reviews are by those who constantly look for things to quantify the value of their trip. I'm sorry but if a bumpy ride to the hotel made your vacation miserable, please just stay home. If you feel wronged because god forbid you did not get immediate service at the snap of your fingers, perhaps you should just stay at work.What made this a great vacation? 1. Atmosphere - It was a mature resort, large and clean yet a very intimate atmosphere with the tropical vegitation. I have been to the Majestic Colonial but i much prefer the village feel of a resort vs. the palatial feel.2. Staff  People - The staff were happy and friendly. This means happy vacationers. We met so many happy relaxed vacationers. Being gay and on vacation with my partner, we never once felt unwelcome. We dined and partied with many new friends from all over the world. 3. Rendzvous Bar - This was more entertaining than the shows! Plus you could see the shows from up top, Balcony like style. You could get a beer in a bottle. MGD, BUD, Presidente, all sorts - in the bottle which was a nice touch.4. The food was fine. Not 5* everyday but never was it gross. I found the portion size at the al a carte to be sufficient. (It's actually a perfectly healthy serving). Things to be aware of:Beach - My boyfriend got smacked down by a wave and cut his foot on the coral. Yes there are signs. How often do you get to swim in hurricane created waves though? Pool Bar - Drinks are strong.

<Content>We had an awesome time My sister and I took my mom there for her 60th Birthday and we had a wonderful time. The place is amazing it's like a tropical paradise!!!! We were there for 7 days and enjoyed every minute of it. The only bad part was the ride from the airport to the hotel our driver was crazy!!! But on the way back to the airport the driver was fine so it depends on who you get. The hotel staff is the best I have ever experienced everyone says hello when they are walking by and are very helpful and alot of fun.We met some great people there Joseph who was part of the Entertainment staff he s a great guy, very nice and thoughful. We also met Winder in the Mexican restaurant and at breakfast he was awesome too, along with Ramon and Rafel. I would go back tomorrow if I could!!!

<Content>3 Star Hotel Disguised as a 5 Star Before my fiance and I booked our vacation to Dreams we read a good deal of the reviews on TripAdvisor. A number of people claimed that Dreams was elegant and worthy of a five star rating. It is definitely not- I would say it is a high 3 star hotel with some better than average features.We booked a deluxe room with a king size bed - they offered to upgrade us for $80/night to a room with a hottub on the patio. I am glad we did not do this as the hot tubs rooms bordered some new construction project and would have been incredibly noisy. The rooms at Dreams were noisy as is - you can here every single person walk by your room and hear every door close. The furniture in the room is in need a a total makeover. The lampshades are moldy and the wood furniture is chipped. The linens are also very thin and twice we had to have our room re-done because the linens smelled like burnt cotton. Another major drawback was the phones in the room. Our phones did not work - meaning no checking home, no ordering room service, no booking spa appointments without going to the front desk. I complained about this 5+ times and nothing was done. Not even an attempt to fix it. The best feature of Dreams is the pool. It is enormous and clean and there are plenty of chairs. However, do not expect to relax. There are tons of kids (this is I did not know) and tons of loud groups. I was not expecting so many kids as I figured this was a place that does many weddings. The pool bars are great and the waiters and bartenders are very attentive. Especially Pedro in the middle pool bar. I was a little disappointed with the beach. Based on the brochure and pictures the beach was described as white sands with crystal clear water. The water was sandy and the ocean floor was rocky. However, the beach was a good quiet place to relax.The restaurants were below average. The portions were small and not creative. The $5 chinese take-out down the street was better. Bordouex was the best restaurant, but nothing special. The meat and fish was not top quality. Again I would not have expected top quality except for the ratings the hotel had on this and other sites. I didn't even try the Seaside Grill or Oceana as they seemed to have the same items as the World Cafe. The Japanese restaurant is actually 2 tables inside the Chinese restaurant. If you want to eat Japanese plan on waiting an hour or longer. I had sushi as an appetizer in the Chinese restaurant and have had better at the local Shoprite.The room service was great, it was quick and fast and the food is actually included as is the beer and soda in the mini-bar. This was a great feature. The Spa was excellent! Best massage I have ever had. The Spa appears to be brand new - its architecture is nothing like that of the other buildings. The Spa was the only 5-star thing about the resort. Perhaps if I had thought I was booking a 3-star resort I would have been satisfied, but not at this price and not one claiming to be 5-star. Last thing - they bring vendors onto the resort at night, Total rip-offs and they constantly get in your face. This was really unexpected and brought down the class of the entire place.

<Content>what a wonderful place We stayed here from Oct4th to Oct 11/08. Early morning flights are a killer. When we arrived at this hotel we were checked in immediately. We only had a 1 1/2 hr wait for our room. No big deal with all there is too look at. Weather was the best this week very hot and humid but we left Canada when it was cool. The Food was pretty good. Buffet had food for everyone. I really liked there pancakes in the morning, we had bacon 4 out of the 7 days not bad. We ate at 3 a la cartes. Oceania is and will be my all time favorite. Seaside was just okay. El Patio was my husbands favorite. There was never a shortage of drinks. We had a wonderful time, entertainment staff was just terrific.We would go back to Dreams again

<Author>Tinkerbell016
<Content>Fairly average all round Okay I will point out the good and the bad points of this hotel. We went there as part of our honeymoon and had a blast but that was down to the people we met and what we made of it ourselves.Firstly from the minute you get into the airport, I'm afraid the Dominicans are trying to make money out of tourists....you're thrown into a photo (looking horrendous after a long flight!) with some women with fruit on their heads(!!!), have baskets thrown in front of you by musicians playing carribbean music and when you go to the loo, you are handed a paper towel to dry your hands and expected to hand over tips.Then you get on the bus ride to the hotel. Seriously......Sheikra in Orlando is easier to cope with. If you have a weak stomach, be prepared!!!Once you get to the hotel, there is an immediate feel good factor, you are welcomed very kindly, handed champagne and given cool towels to wipe your face with. However, you are then just pointed to your room. No-one accompanies you there and after a long flight, a buggy ride to the room would be really appreciated. We were on our honeymoon and put into a room facing the back of the hotel with twin double beds. Not what we booked. We had to argue a bit to get another room. That was one thing I noticed - lack of making anyone feel special. Don't expect to be treated any differently if you're on honeymoon or getting married. In fact, unfortunately I would go as far as to say, don't expect to be treated with any type of service unless you are prepared to tip consistently. Before I came to Dreams, I read on here that you should bring 100 dollars in tips with you and tip one or two dollars the odd time to the waiters for good service. There is a sense of Americans being treated far better than europeans because of their nature to tip for EVERYTHING! This was not only noticed by us but by many others staying at the hotel.Food and entertainment......If you're like us, a holiday is to hang around the beach or pool until 7pm, get ready and chill out in your room and head out for a meal about 9/10pm followed by drinks - this will not happen in Dreams resort. People go out crazy early - I'm talking 5pm to get ready and out for dinner at 5,30pm/6pm. If you hit any of the restarurants at 8pm, the food will be gone or you will be rushed out of the place - even though it says the restaurants are open from 6.30-10.30pm. This I thought was the worst element. You wait in some of the restaurants forever for food and then after the wait, you're too late and there's no food. NOT GOOD ENOUGH. The World Cafe is like a school canteen. Didn't go there much. Ideal for kids because of the choice available for them but serious lack of atmosphere.Chinese and Mexican are lovely but with very small portions - I mean really small. We are both not big eaters and thought the portions were small. The grill is lovely but again, be there queuing outside at 6pm or it's a no go.Entertainment was brilliant when the dancers were on stage and the Wednesday night show is spectacular. It's less than amusing when they do the love couples shows or dodgy karaoke though.The casino is tiny but good fun and well air conditioned which is a must at night.The nightclub is fine but they play the same tracks every night. Was at a 60's 70's and 80's night and apparently Sean Paul was a key hit in the 60's as that's all they played. That and i like big butts and I cannot lie, which, yeah is a floor filler every now and again but just gets cheesy when played four times a night every night!Drink is good - lots of lovely cocktails but make sure you ask for them with alcohol or they automatically give them without. Be careful with kids too as I heard from parents over there that their kid got alcholic drinks a number of times so just taste it before they drink it!The trips - quad bikes, horse riding etc - heard bad reports from others while there on these also and we decided not to do any of the trips. The horses didn't have the proper equipment and a child ended up on a horse without proper reins. On a bike trip one couple told us their quad broke down and they were left at the side of the road for 45 mins alone far from the resort. Another couple said that their legs were burnt from the exhaust pipes on the quads and from leaking oil. The quads need updating I think!The catamaran on the beach is cool. You pay 25 dollars to learn to sail and then you can take it out whenever you want throughout your stay.The beach in general is amazing - spotless clean, gorgeous and just dreamy to lie on. Like some poeople have said on here already, just be careful of the rocks, we both got cut on them.The bedroom was lovely, great AC and mini bar except the fridge wasn't cold. But lovely room, nice balcony and views (once we moved from our original room). They try to sell everyone a very expensive upgrade when they check in. Truth be told, they are seriously chancing their arm. You can probably get the upgrade anyway for a third of the price. Another honeymoon couple were same as us, paid for a queen bed and were put in a room with two small double beds. It's like they try to get rid of the lesser rooms first and see who will complain before they do anything about it. Not a nice way to deal with guests, especially if you're on honeymoon.There are dominicans around the resort a couple of times a week selling their wares and they are really pushy. Avoid any eye contact at all if you don't want to end up having an argument about not buying something! The prices are incredible, littlebeaded bracelets that you would get for between 2 and 6 euros, they re looking for 35 dollars for. Crazy money.Photographers at the hotel are great and well worth looking into. Just don't get caught into the trap of booking them for 150 dollars for an hour and a half photo shoot if you don't want it. They will just as easily do a few snaps for you down by the beach whenever you feel like it. We got Lucy and she did great shots for us, wasn't at all pushy and made us feel really at ease.The entertainment staff are incredible. We watched them all week and their talent is fantastic. They are especially good with kids - the kids all seem to flock to them and adore them which is really great and must be fantastic for parents looking for a break!In conclusion, I would say a great holiday, because of the people we met and what we made of it ourselves. Wasn't great value for money and is certainly not the five star it sets itself up to be when it comes to food and service. However, it's clean, comfortable and the place to go if you want to just chill out, relax and have a few drinks every evening.Finally, we heard that one couple who had been travelling to the hotel for over ten years, came this year and noticed a down turn in service and food. Maybe this sums it up? Could be that they are just starting to take tourism for granted. Who knows.

<Content>Excellent Resort!!! We stayed at Dreams from 10/4-10-11 and we really had a great time. I was skeptical after reading some of the negative comments, but truthfully we did not see any rats in the sports bar, tarantulas in the halls, ants in the rooms, bedbugs or any of the other creatures previously mentioned!!! We were greeted with a cold towel and champagne. The grounds were meticulous! Our room was upgraded and was really very nice. We were in room 4101 on the ground floor. Even though there was rust from condensation on the edge of the lampshade and metal edging of the sofa, I did not find this to be a reason for complaints. The room was cleaned every morning, floor mopped and looking spotless when we returned from breakfast. You just cannot expect brand new furniture everytime that you stay in a hotel. We did not experience any ant or bug problem at all. The room was fresh smelling and did not have a musty smell. Occasionally there were a few mosquitoes which love to bite me but not my husband!! We had turn-down service every evening, plenty of fresh towels, the fridge was refilled daily and the air conditioning was very good. We never felt uncomfortable at all.  The restaurants were all very good. Our favorite by far was Bordeaux. We tried each one except for Da Mario, and we never made it to dinner at the buffet. All of the food was very good, served hot. I cannot complain about anything here. The portions are small but we ordered appetizers, soup , main course, and dessert every evening. And we were never hungry nor did we feel like we needed to snack later. There is always something to eat no matter what time of day or evening from the buffet to the regular restaurants, BBQ on the beach, lunch in the restaurants, midnight snack at the buffet, room service etc. It is important to read the SUNDIAL every day to find out which restaurants are serving what times (as far as lunch and dinner) on that particular day and also to find out the dress code for each. Men are not required to wear long pants to all of the restaurants, only certain ones! The pool is absolutely gorgeous as has been stated. But we really are beach people. We would spend most of the day on the beach, then go to the swim up bar around 4:00 each day for some socializing and fun. The beach is owned by the Federal Government and not the resorts, so if you walk away from the front of the resort you will find trash and seaweed washed up on the shoreline. But this is no fault of the resort. They try really hard to keep the area in front of the resort very clean. The area to the left is very good for swimming. We never encountered any rocks or coral there. I did spend time in the water. The service is outstanding as has been mentioned. The beach service was excellent also and friendly. All of the bars that we tried has excellent service. Sometimes you had to be patient while they mixed certain drinks, but we did not mind. Overall they were very attentive and very willing to please. Overall I must say that we never got sick from any food or anything else, we were not harassed by the vendors. A polite no was all that was required there. There was bacon every day at the buffet. (I guess we hit a good week!!) And I never saw or experienced any sexual harassment. I think the language barrier would make this difficult and easily misinterpreted. I truly loved this resort and I really cannot find one negative thing. This was our fourth stay at an all-inclusive and our first to Punta Cana.

<Content>We Loved It This was our third trip to Punta Cana. Our first time two years ago we stayed at Excellence and this past May we stayed at Melia. All three hotels were great for certain distinct reasons, but this by far was my favorite resort.Yes, it is quite a distance from the airport, but it only added to the adventure. We took a private taxi service from Mike's Marina (they were wonderful - prompt, courteous, played great music in the car). Get yourself a cold beer at the airport and enjoy the ride. I will start my review with the most important aspect of Dreams and that is the staff. The People: Wonderful, from the bellboys and housekeeping staff, through Eileen, the Concierge. I emailed her a few days before our trip and she upgraded us to a beautiful oceanview corner suite. Please give her my regards if you are going. The lobby bar staff were fantastic - and if you've been there - OH MY GOD. Clemente was a blast. We did tip and brought gifts for them.Food: I just can't believe people can complain about the food. We enjoyed every meal we had. We ate at every restaurant but the Japanese restaurant. To me Oceana and Bordeaux were the best. Out of these two, Oceana was my favorite. It was very beautiful and romantic being next to the sea. My grouper was out of this world. The World Buffet was always good. El Patio had a great bowl of chili and the shrimp appetizer was to die for. The servers all went out of their way for you.Pool: What can I say that hasn't already been said? It was fantastic. We brought our own floaties, although they were provided by the hotel. Drinks: The drinks were wonderful. I loved the Coco Loco's and Caipirinha's. Presidente and Bohemia beers were always available, and let's not forget Mamajuana.Beach: Picture postcard beautiful. All those Palm Trees. I judged a Paella-making contest on the beach one afternoon. Entertainment: We only saw a few, but they were fun. The beach party was a blast. The disco played a wide variety of music.Tours: We never left the resort. We were planning on taking a catamaran tour, but we loved it so much, we didn't want to leave. Casino: The casino was small with a few tables for Blackjack and Poker. About 20 slot machines and a Roulette table. The murals on the walls were very cool. I wouldn't think twice about staying here. I'm already planning our next trip.Kathi and Gene

<Content>You Get What you Pay For I will make this short and to the point Dreams was nice but in comparing it to the Bahamas - the Bahamas is way nicer. Travel: yes, it is 1 hr. from the airport to this location on a very bumpy ride.Hotel Room: The hotel was nice, we stayed in Bldg. 4, on the first floor after we moved from the 3rd flr. due to air problems. Beer: They only carry El Presidente at the bars, except the lobby one, which has Bud Light. It is for the most part skunked. My bottle actually said 3/08 as the expiration date. And you can see at the Swim Up Bar - the keg is out in the open - not refrigerated. Drinks were o.k. ask for x-tra liquor - if they know how to make your drink my cosmos and martini's all stunk. Food - was o.k. The buffet is decent and you have to try all the restaurants - we had dinner at Bordeaux one night, after the hour wait, dinner still took about 1.5 hrs. Best place for dinner is El Patio.Service - not good. They are very slow and speak no English, which I ,know I am in their country, but some people didn't even know the word Beer - we actually started tipping people for better service, which in the Bahamas, they didn't take one $1 for anything. Here it was almost expected. Pool - best part of the whole trip. Yes there are waitresses on the beach and by the pool, but again service not so good. Beach - I guess b/c it was hurrican season the water was very foggy - can't see through it at all. Which I am afraid of sharks so we didn't go to the beach. Activities - there are a decedent amount of activities throughout the day but again.....there was a certain air of partying in the Bahamas whereas Punta is very much more relaxed and a lot of people had their kids, kids at dinner, all over the place. Excursions: We did Bavaro Splash - it was like $75 a person - went out at 8 a.m. which when you are hungover is hard. It was again 1 hr. away on the crazy non-existent road - next time I would stay closer to that area, b/c it seemed that's where all the excursions were and it seemed a lot more active, that area was Bavaro. Spa : very nice - no complaints. Again - I paid close to $5k for the Bahamas - Sandals - and it was awesome. I paid $1700 for this trip - air included for me and my husband and you def. give me what you pay for.

<Content>Loved it When you book your trip use apple vacations. Its a direct flight,Reps are there 8 hours a day to help you and accomodate you very well. When we arrived we were directed to a charter bus with air conditioning, the ride is an hour but not bad. Remember this is not a USA or Euorpean trip it is Third world country. The hotel is nice, the employees great. There were no rats or mice (very classless to even say that) We were there on our honeymoon, and so was 90% of the other guests. No one was racist and they would never say racist remarks either. They are fun loving people. And sexual harassment is not believable either lol! ( get over yourself) Howevever we did find older people weren't as impressed as we were with Dreams. So if you arent planning a get a way or honeymoon you may not like it there because its all about relaxaion. So if you like to be busy and active it may not be for you. The food was good,not hot but not really bad. The buffet was always good, Bordeax was great it is a french resturant. Our air conditioning stopped on fourth day, but they moved us ASAP to a new room they even moved us we didn't have to do a thing! Learn Spanish before you go.... or at least the basics. Remember you are in their country they are not required to speak your language.. Most know some English but not all of them. The hotel ws kept up maybe not a 6 rating that it is considered, but no where in the Domenican republic is. (3rd world!) We went horseback riding on the beach it ws great! Dreams offers free bike tours they were great Julio the tour guide is great! The bikes weren't the best but we were ok.It wasn't buggy when we stayed. 1st floor I hard was. It like 90 degrees there what do you expect.You have t oleave dreams to do good snorkeling. It advertises it there but its not what you would assume.It was fun there we would definately return. This hotel gets some bad reviews but remember there are people who are never satisfied no matter where they go.We are in our late 20' and we had a blast. I would recommend 9 days because you just get a feel for what is going on and then the week is up! It was a great honeymoon, and if it wasnt the hotel wouldn't have been booked up with honeymooners if it wasn't .

<Content>just okay We stayed at Dreams Tulum last year and it was very nice, so we decided to stay here. Worst thing about the place was the food. The portions wre very chincy, like two cheesesticks or two wings for appetizers. You have to eat one and then order another one. No ordering two at one time. The beach party food was exactly the same as the buffet food. And, it was all cold. The beef was pretty rare. The side dishes and salad bar at the Seaside Grill and Oceana Rest. were the same side dishes served at the World Buffet. Bacon was only served twice at breakfast during the week we were there. The mexican restaurant was not any better. There was no chicken at all in my quesidillia. The servers seemed to be short staffed, very busy. There were lots of bugs under the lights right above the salad bar at the Seaside Grill, and a large beetle crawling around on the brocolli salad. There was a stir fry at the World Buffet, the cook only puts one shrimp in the stir fry, my husband asked for more, cook said no. Drinks were pretty good and our room was nice and clean. I would not stay there again.

<Content>Decent Place - Pluses and Minuses Dreams Punta Cana is definitely NOT a 6 Apple resort. We booked this place on the 6-apple square deal expecting a real bargain. Sorry to say that we got exactly what we paid for. The resort is not horrible, certainly not a nightmare, but it's also not the luxurious experience that they make it out to be. It is an AMstar resort, owned by Apple, which is why Apple rates it 6 stars. Don't be fooled. The ride from the airport was horrible...we took a shorter route that actually took 1.5 hours and involved numerous people getting sick. On the way back, we took the long way and ended up getting to the airport in 1 hour with no one sick. Make sure you tell your rep not to take the short way! Check in was great, but our room was not 6-star by any stretch of the imagination. There was a huge crack in our ceiling that ran clear across the room, and the closet and facing of the furniture was in generally bad shape. The bathroom was OK, but the shower is weird and hot water is sketchy. Our maid was excellent, and we didn't tip until the last day. We also gave her some school supplies for her children and she loved it! Think about bringing them a little something :) We also had a problem with our AC, which was fixed within 1 hour. Very nice. The pool is great, but I did get an ear infection from it and it screwed up my swimming for the last 4 days. You will also find losers gathering rafts every morning to hoard for the rest of the day...such a shame that people act this way. The beach is pretty right in front of the resort, but the water is ROUGH, not clear at all, and there are sharp rocks all throughout the ocean so swimming is hardly possible. No snorkelling opportunities, and others are right---a ton of trash all over the place. A real shame, they certainly cannot tout their beach as top of the line, as I've had better beaches in Jamaica, Dominica, Bahamas, and at Excellence Punta Cana, etc. Restaurants were very good generally, with good food and GREAT SERVICE. The deserts are straight from the buffet, however...very disappointing. The buffet is TERRIBLE...food selection is very limited, none of the food is good, and they run out of everything. Bacon is like gold at breakfast....Patio, Himitsu, and Seaside Grill were great, very good food. Our service was always exceptional. Shows were OK, I don't put much stock into them anyway. Overall, best thing about this resort is the service, and the worst is the beach/buffet. It is not a 6-star by any means, so be prepared. You can certainly enjoy yourself, but don't think you're getting any special deal with the 6-star. You will get excellent service, however!

<Content>Great Honeymoon! My wife and I had a great time on our honeymoon at Dreams Punta Cana. Our trip was from 9/28/08 鈥?10/5/08. Check in was very fast and immediately taken to our room, which was room 1108. It was a swim out Master Suite in Building 1. The grounds looked great! Everything was very clean and we would constantly see people cleaning. The trip from the airport was very rough! But it didn鈥檛 bother us because we were expecting it. Your on Vacation just have fun with it!! You first need to realize that you鈥檙e traveling to a Third World Country. If you don鈥檛 like the idea of that then you need to book your trip somewhere else! It really helped that we read a little bit about the Dominican Republic before we went. As far as the food goes, we ate and drank whatever we wanted all week long and our stomachs never turned. Most Dominicans only cook in fruit and oil. They don鈥檛 use many spices. So a lot of the food will be a little plain tasting. We didn鈥檛 eat much seafood except for some Mahi Mahi in the Japanese Restaurant, so I don鈥檛 know if that would have made us sick or not. Our favorite place to eat was Himitsu. You can either sit down and have Chinese or tell them you want Japanese. That鈥檚 where they will cook in front of you. We ate at the World Caf茅 everyday for breakfast and lunch and that is where the food was a little more plain. But not to bad! We liked all of the other restaurants. The only place we didn鈥檛 eat was the Seaside grill, but it looked pretty good. The bars were great! We never had to wait for drinks at all. Our room was across from the Pool Bar and we loved it. They were never shy on the alcohol at all. They will give you as much as you want. We do however like to tip according to service. The service was great, so we tipped quite a bit. Just a couple of bucks here and there will do. When we tipped they would remember us and help us the rest of the week. Our drinks rarely went dry! All of the staff would try their best to take care of us!We did see a big spider. Could have been a Tarantula but we weren鈥檛 sure. It was huge! The workers killed it after we took a few pictures of it! You have to remember you鈥檙e in the tropics!!! No sense in dwelling on a spider!! We were very worried about going to the resort after reading the reviews, but we had an amazing time and can鈥檛 wait to go back soon!! My mom and her friends are going to Dreams Punta Cana in November and they have been very worried also. But we told them to go, and we know they will have a great time. The Entertainment team was great and put on great shows every night. We went to almost all of them.We did walk out of the gate of the resort, took a right and walked about 10 minutes to a plaza and went shopping. No one ever bothered us. They just wanted us to buy stuff from them. We knocked the prices down about $100 - $150 dollars in every store. But got some nice stuff! If you don鈥檛 want to go out of the resort, they did let some vendors set up tables 2 nights out of the week we were there.Your trip is what you make of it. Again, remember where you are going. It鈥檚 a Third World Country!! But the Resort is Awesome and very clean. After going there we now think a lot of the reviews are a bit ridiculous. You are in the Caribbean!!! If you鈥檙e looking for something wrong you will find it no matter what the circumstances are. We hope you have a Great Trip!! We can鈥檛 wait to go back to Dreams!! (Hopefully Next Year).

<Content>Dreams Honeymoon - Not what we expected! We had planned our honeymoon in Feb of this year and couldn't wait to go to the Dominican. After reading several bad reviews, we were very nervous and couldn't understand why we would see so many good reviews and also so many bad reviews. After staying at the resort for 7 days, we figured it out. The biggest problem with Dreams is inconsistency. First off, the bus ride is very long and you should take dramamine if you suffer from any type of motion sickness. The starts, stops, bumps, and turns will get you sick. Now for the Resort. You will encounter very friendly staff who do everything they can to provide you with excellent service. You will also encounter the most rude, inattentive staff who refuse to even acknowledge you. The same goes for the food. Some of the restaurants provide excellent food, while others are terrible. Good luck if you get a drink before you are finished eating. We stayed in a honeymoon suite which was nice, but the room did smell of mildew and our shower was in need of repair. Actually three days in to the stay, they ordered us to leave our room because our shower was leaking on the room below us. Now on to the beach. We walked down to the ocean and discovered trash everywhere. This included bottles, oil cans, bags, ropes, boxes, etc. The ocean water was also murky right in front of the resort and clear blue around 100 yards out. We did buy an item from the gift shop and were treated poorly by the attendant. The casino is also a great place to be ignored and treated poorly as we witnessed.Now for the positives: The pool is one of the most amazing pools you will ever experience. The grounds around the pool are kept very clean and the waitresses working around the pools always asked for our orders. The Himitsu and Patio restaurants provide excellent service and also provided excellent food. We also received a complimentary spa package which was very nice. We would highly recommend the spa. The best service and meal we received was the romantic dinner package which is served higher up on the beach (away from trash). The service and food was spectacular. In closing, if you already have a trip planned, there are things to enjoy and you may experience some of the better portions of the resort. Also, you are far away from the excursions so you will be taking bus rides to get where you need to be. Wish we would have known that since we didn't want to waste a full day for each excursion. While we made the best of the honeymoon and enjoyed our time away (almost anything is better than work), we decided we will not be returning to the Dominican or to Dreams.

<Content>Dreams, more like Nightmares Punta Cana This hotel should be renamed to Nightmares! We always go to the Caribbean but thought that we would give Dom. Republic a go BIG Mistake. Where to start?Food:No wonder people were getting sick, nothing is served hot so the potential for food poisoning is extremely high and probable, even Room Service and if you complain the food is nucleared in a microwave and the plate is scalding hot and the food even more inedible. Our Thomas Cook travel guide recommends only eating fresh and pipping hot food. This would have been nice. Didn't have a good experience in any of the restaurants within the resort. Oh and don't think that if you complain to a restaurant manager it will help, no way, they don't acknowledge just give the same plate of food back to you saying 'hot' after its been nuc'd. Oh and you have to wait ages for the pleasure of being served!Thankfully, we weren't in the restaurant at the time the mice were there or the mites at the bread counter. Not joking!Staff:The staff are very rude and give the impression that you should be priviliged to be in their presence. Here's some of what we experienced:- Racial: We didn't want to participate in pool games having just arrived from the UK the day before and jet lagged, only for the entertainment staff member known as Mickey Mouse to turn away and say 'don't like whites anyway'.- Entertainment staff drink whilst working and on one occasion came up to our group took a beer from one of the guys hands, drank the beer and ordered him to get another one. Often seen them drinking at the evening shows and some of the guests actively encouraging them to do so... I'm sorry but I don't want to go to a so called 5* hotel to see the staff enjoy what I'm paying for!- My husband was playing the air rifle competition at the core / sports zone and was ordered to go and collect the target, when he walked away Usher from the entertainment team pointed a loaded air rifle at him. - Sexual harassment: I experienced inappropriate staff conduct on 3 separate occasions. Once I alone was going meet my husband at the Rendez Vous bar and the bar man named Chocolate walked towards me and as he passed me he ran is hand down my arm. Two other times inappropriate comments were made.- If you think that the facilities are just for guests think again. Tour operates, hotel staff use the restaurant World Cafe, guest toilets, and we even heard that someone had walked into their room to find the evening 'turn down' made sitting on their toilet.- On the subject of toilets, they weren't the cleanliest. Soiled underway and toilet and female hygiene products not removed.- The only way to get served at bars is if you are holding dollar bills in your hand then you get the full attention of the bar staff, otherwise expect to wait on average 20 minutes of being blatently ignored.Facilities, Tours:- If you take ill, I hope you have taken medication on holiday. My hubby came down with flu and went to the onsite shop. The assistant sold him one slip of Tylenol for $10 and wanted to keep the box with the instructions so that she could sell the second slip from the packet for another $10. Rip off.- If you are at the pool or beach you will be harassed every couple of hours of every day from photographers taking pictures of parrots, snakes or something else, and the guys selling horse riding.- One of the nights only two restaurants were open out of 5 or 6. Given that they were all no good anyway it maybe a blessing.- We missed the rat[s] and tarantulas at the Core Zone but everyone spoke about them, maybe we just were unlucky to miss such infamous guests?Beach:- It ain't the powder white Caribbean beach. I have never been anyway that has such a beautiful asset and totally waste it with all the rubbish that is lying about. If you walk to the right of the beach you will find bags of rubbish, even the odd computer screen. So much for saving the environment.Hotel Management:- We complained to our Thomas Cook rep [Becky] who was brilliant. Given the severity of our complaint she immediately went to see the hotel management who funnily enough weren't available at the time and promised that he would contact us directly. We never heard from them. Thankfully we asked to get moved and Thomas Cook transferred us 5 days into our 2 week holiday to Barcelo Premium, Punta Cana. Which takes All Inclusive to a different level, so see my review of this hotel. You won't believe it honestly!What else, the Government of Dominican Republic ashamed of themselves that they allow such environmental damage not to mention health issues and eye sores of the amount of rubbish that is strewn everywhere. It is despicable that this island is being sold as a Carribean paradise given the level of rubbish that is visible on the one hour and 15 minute trip from the airport to Nightmares, maybe it was a sign? Then there is the roads with the massive pot holes and what can only be described as kamakazi driving. The Government should be investing the tourist tax coming into and leaving the country to clean up Bavaro and Punta Cana and improve the roads.Wouldn't go back to Dominican Republic ever again, so you have been warned.

<Content>Star Rating Review This hotel is a Michelin 3 Star, not the 4 or 5 star awarded by several other reviewers. It's an average All Inclusive Resort that caters to wholesale mass travel markets; and the food especially reflects those tastes.That said, the hotel is quite attractive with well maintained grounds. The surpantine swimming pool that meanders through the property is excellent. Hotel rooms are nicely decorated, and are a close likeness to the hotels advertised photos. The staff is friendly, always smiling, and courteous. Hosekeeping is good and frequent. There is a quite small casine, and nightly entertainment performed by hotel employees and local entertainers. The beach is nice, well maintained but rocky in some parts.. Other than the rooms, there are only a few air conditioned places in the hotel; and those can be quite uncomfortable on hot  humid days.The food is fair with the quality of an All you can eat restaurant in the States. The 6 different restraunts at the hotel sound good, but essentially come from the same kitchen.As well, the hotel is located about 3 hours from Santo Domingo, which equates to 6 hours on the (very bumpy) road. No one in our group thought it worth looosing a day to do so. Without the cultural awareness (other than the staff) we could have been any where in the world that has sun. Never-the-less, if you can get a good rate, are not looking for a food or cultural experience you might like Deams. Just don't buy the 4 and 5 star hype or you will be dissappointed.

<Content>'ENJOYABLE VACATION' We dont understand all the bad reviews. We stayed at Dreams the middle of Sept. for 8 days of beautiful weather and wonderful people. Our check-in was flawless, room was ready and luggage was delivered immediately. Our room was on the third floor overlooking the pool, very clean, refrigerator stocked with water, beer, pop and juice, and a fruit tray waiting in our room. Our air conditioner worked properly the entire stay even though the temperature was in the 90's everyday. My husband and I are pool people and it was the best I have seen anywhere, The drinks were awesome and non stop all day long, Our beach time was also awesome with the help of others writing reviews, to keep to the left for swimming and walking. The drinks at the beach were also plentiful with anything you wanted at anytime. The drinks of the day were awesome. The entertainment staff added an extra enjoyment to our vacation. Since we participated in the daily events at the beach and pool, we were remembered each day by name from the entertainers. HATS OFF to Michael, Mickey Mouse, 50 cents, Usher, Glenda, for all your hard work each day to make our trip more fun. Your dedication 12-14 hours a day 7 days a week is just amazing to us. and you all should be so proud.We also met alot of great people, some even from our hometown that we wer able to enjoy the same passion with: THE PITTSBURGH STEELERS. We never saw tarantulas or rats and the grounds people were always working to keep the resort clean. We did not have to keep tipping our maids to keep our room clean.The food was only average at best and never hot, this was probably our biggest complaint. I think the food needs to be addressed the most and hopefully with all the bad reviews about the food, this will improve in the future.All in all this was truly an enjoyable week, and just remember when you go there you are not in the USA but in a third world country who are trying their best to make your vacation a memorable one.

<Content>Never Ever Going Back Before I went to Dreams Punta Cana I read alot of reviews, however none of them can prepare you for what is really there. The beds are hard as rocks, the pillows smell like mildew. My advise bring your own. Also, back in the Sports Bar area their are Tarantula Spiders walking across the bar area. There was also a rat climbing in and out of the popcorn maker at the Sports Bar. Every night before I went to bed I felt the need to check my bed and under the bed for any kind of rodents or bugs. There is not enough food around the clock. They do not have bars by the pool that have snack type foods. On the Beach they have a grill that serves Hamburgers and Hotdogs at lunch time from 12:00 to 2:00pm if you are their quick enough before they run out. Also, they have stale nacho chips with ice cold melted cheese if you can't get a burger ! I would not recommend this place to my worse enemy. The ride to and from the airport is about 1 hour and 10 minutes long in which you are fearing for your life. The pot holes are 3feet deep the drivers run people off the road and pass vehicles with oncoming traffic.

<Content>beware of this hotel we have just returned from 2 long weeks at dreams punta cana in dominican republic.do not believe what the brochures say this is supposed to be a newly refurbished hotel (change over from sunscape to dreams jan 2008) but the condition of the so called deluxe rooms was appalling,damp patches,damp damage,damp smell,holes in wall,plug sockets hanging of walls overall standard was rubbish not what you are lead to expect from the brochures, very misleading.Restaurants are nice nothing special,get to dinner early or you will not have much choice because they seem to run out of food quickly,you don't have to make reservations for the al a carte restaurants but you will have a long wait if you don't arrive early.Beach was nice although it has a massive ant problem as the beach waiter staff chuck the left over cocktails into the sand the ants get on your feet and sun loungers not very nice.excursions from the thomsons rep were expensive and the monstar truck safari just dragged, after they had taken you shopping every 5 secs you were crammed onto a truck of 30 passengers and knocked about not value for money at all ($99 each).We will not be returning to this hotel.

<Content>Don't Be Fooled By The Pictures My wife and I picked this place for our honeymoon basically because most of the reviews seemed pretty decent, the pictures on the website were really nice, and it was pretty reasonably priced for a so called 5 star resort. Before you read any further let me tell you that my wife is a flight attendant and we have traveled the world and stayed in dozens of all inclusives and this one was definitely the worst and in no way a 5 star resort. I hear the place changed hands less then a year ago so perhaps thats when things went down hill and why some of the other reviews were not that bad.First the good; as every other review says (and I agree) the pool is beautiful. The wait staff were all very friendly and were wonderful to converse with, finally most of the grounds were clean. That鈥檚 about it. The beach was pretty dirty with sharp corral everywhere, honestly the Jersey Shore is nicer. By the way this is not on the Caribbean side of the country, it鈥檚 the Atlantic so you don鈥檛 get those crystal clear waters and smooth sandy beaches. We were supposed to be upgraded for our honeymoon but instead got this tiny shoe box of a room with a nice view of a service road. The maids only stocked the fridge and did a good job cleaning if you left them a tip. If you don鈥檛 leave a tip, don鈥檛 bother have them clean the room. It took well over an hour to get there and then you are trapped because nothing is even remotely close. So鈥e decided to take a tour. I told the guy at COCO Tours that we wanted to go snorkeling and take a catamaran ride. He signed us up for a tour that costs over $200, told us it would be an hour long bus ride, a half hour speed boat ride to snorkeling, followed by a gourmet lunch, a half hour catamaran ride back, followed by an hour of shopping in a local market. Well here is what we got: a 2 hour bus ride, no speed boat but an old fishing boat loaded with cockroaches that we were on for close to 3 hours (people were getting sick left and right), a gross lunch that I wouldn鈥檛 feed a dog, a 3 hour ride back on a loud obnoxious party boat from Spain were not one person spoke English, a 2 hour ride back, and no shopping. The trip was supposed to be 8 to 4 and ended up being 8 to 7:30. Every single person on that trip was furious. All 23 of us met the guy the next morning to complain, he wouldn鈥檛 do anything until we started scaring other customers away, at which time he gave us half the money back. We complained to Dreams and they said they had nothing to do with it and it was not there problem (even though they sell these trips in their lobby and assigned us this guy to do all of our bookings). I am still mad about that whole thing!! Next there is the food. The food was absolutely horrible. Room service was not even edible. I ordered nachos and there was melted plastic on the chips, burger was ice cold and like a hockey puck, soggy salads, etc. The buffet had the same stuff every single day, just tasteless crappy food. In my opinion the French, steak, and seafood places were the worst. The Mexican was not too bad and the Chinese was edible. Everything else got us sick. We were both really sick all week. We actually both got food poisoning the last day we were there. We have been home for 3 days now and are still really sick. Next the Spa. The first day there it rained so we paid 30 bucks each to use the spa only to find out the hot tub was not working right and was not hot at all, there was not much else to do there. FYI, there are no other hot tubs in the resort which is unheard of for a so called 5 star place. Then every night they bring in these local merchants that literally block every entrance to the buildings and harass you non stop to buy something. I expect that when I leave a resort but never on resort grounds. The beds were like sleeping on bricks and to top everything else off, the last day we found a dead cockroach in our bed!!Thanks for reading my long winded review, stay away from this place. If you want to go to Punta Cana ,spend the extra few bucks and got to The Paradeses.

<Content>We had a wonderful trip, even in the rain! Our group of 6 returned from a week at Dreams, Sept 20-27, and we all agree that it was a fabulous trip! I will give you the best description that I can about the different views you have read here on Tripadvisor.First the road to the resort!! Yes there is a 15 or 20 minute stretch that is extremely bumpy and full of large pot holes. It depends on what type of vehicle you are transported in as to just how bad the ride is. We arranged private transportation through IBK services (Mike Fisher and Bronly) and we were picked up at the airport in an air conditioned newer model mini van. The driver, though he did not speak much English, was extremely friendly and very skilled in maneuvering this smaller vehicle around the pot holes and we got to the hotel in only 50 minutes.We got the cold towels and champagne upon arrival and check-in was a virtual breeze and the bellman Thomas (absolutely wonderful person) had our bags to our rooms in no time at all!The rooms 鈥?We had adjoining rooms on the second floor of building 2 and one room on the bottom floor of building 4. There was plenty of space in the rooms, they even have a small sofa and desk. Ants? Yes, if you spilled the sugar or left food out, or dropped toothpaste in the sink overnight, but you know what鈥︹€︹€?I live in PA and if I leave sweet food out during the summer I get ants too! The only bad thing I have to say about our rooms is that the one in building four on lower level did have a musty or damp smell.The maid service was wonderful, my room was spotless everyday when we returned from beach with plenty of fresh towels AND wash cloths as well as beer in the fridge!!As everyone as said the pool was immaculate!! I would be out there swimming at 6:30 AM and they would be out there scrubbing and cleaning the pool daily. There were plenty of chairs, though there was a shortage floating mats at times. The resort was not that busy and I can see that during prime season that the mat shortage would be an issue.Food 鈥?All I can say is that if anyone comes back and said they could not find anything there they liked or that the food was horrible has got to be some kind of nut or totally spoiled picky eater! I would have liked to see bacon at breakfast more than once in the 7 days there, I was a bit tired of the sausage, but other then that I really did not have any complaints with the food. None of us every got sick and we tried just about every restaurant. I did see some small black bugs on the salad bar at the seaside grill, and they were actually some in the lettuce. This I am sure was because it was an open air restaurant and with the climate and the lighting attracted the bugs. But that was the only place I noticed anything like that.Room Service 鈥?Don鈥檛 go there thinking you can get a steak at midnight (like I did) if you are hungry because you can not! As a matter of fact the room service menu is limited and we were a bit disappointed in this. You can order breakfast for room, but for dinner unless you want pizza and fries or sea bass salad you are pretty much out of luck.I saved the best for last, THE STAFF! I must say that absolutely everyone from the groundskeepers, to housekeeping, the wait/bar staff and entertainment were a pleasure to be around. They were always smiling and did whatever they could to make you happy and comfortable. Unfortunately it rained for about 60 hours straight while we were there and we still had a fabulous time. They had all kinds of indoor activities in the lobby/theatre area and the booze was flowing freely so everyone still enjoyed themselves.I would just say HATS OFF TO THE ENTIRE STAFF at the Dreams Resorts. If you want to go shopping or sightseeing, then Dreams is probably not for you. If you want to relax and soak up the sun and fun, then this is definitely the place to do it! In my opinion a vacation is more about the people you spend it with then what type of bed you have or what you ate for dinner. Dreams made our vacation one party day after another and we would return again in a heartbeat!Hola to all especially, Julio, Rosalie (the best pool waitress) and her sexy husband bartender Wilfredo, Diony the best waiter and my special waitress with now all her new hair bands and if I could spell her name I would!!! A great thanks to the chef at World Buffet for cooking the fresh Mahi Mahi we caught as well!If you have any questions or want to whole truth and nothing but truth please feel free to ask.

<Content>A Dream Come True!!! irst I'd like to say that I have been at 5 different All Inclusive Hotels before Dreams. I have been in Mexico, Panama, two in Jamaica (one which was a Sandals) and St. Lucia (also a Sandals) and this has been the best overall experience by far.I have to start with the staff, everybody is going to greet you with a smile, and you will feel welcome since the first second that you step into the hotel. Room Service was great, people at the pool, beach and restaurants were phenomenal. I was with a group of 10 people and we all had a really good time.Food:The food was not out of this word, it was ok, not great. If you are looking for a resort with fine cuisine this is not your place. The Japanese, Bourdex and Oceana were the best restaurants by far. The buffet was always good. Didn't like at all El Patio or De Mario. The servers were all great is just that the food is just average.PoolThe pool was great! It was non-ending, clean and there were always seats available and bars close by. The staff treats you really good. You can either get your drinks into your chairs or just swim up to the wet bar (pick your choice). Wilfredo at the Manati bar was the best! He made the best Mojitos in the resort.DrinksDrinks were also great! They treat you with premiun drinks. They had a wide selection of non-Dominican premium beverages like Tanqueray, Jack Daniels, Jim Beam, Smirnoff, Absolut, etc... They even have in some bars choice of beers, Presidente is their main beer which is always available on tap but they had available a beer name Bohemia (which was really good) and Bud Light both in bottle at some bars. They even make you Mojitos with fresh Mint and Bacardi (which is not a Dominican Rum) at almost every bar. When you are at Manati ask Wilfredo to make you a frozen Mojito.BeachBeach was beautiful but it had been raining non-stop for about 4 ddays before we got there and it was a little rough for children. I heard this is not the norm is just that there is a river nearby and it was dumping a lot of water. If you are a beach person go to the left side (where the trampolin is) to avoid rocks. Also if you like snorkeling you can get your mask and walk about 5-10 minutes to the left, there are a lot of coral reefs in that area that are good for snorkeling.EntertainmentShows were nothing out of this word. They entertain you for a while but don't expect a cruise type of show. The Disco was nice, we went there three nights and they play a good variety of music. The DJs are always open for request.Tours and TownWe only did one tour (snorkeling tour) and we had a good time. We just had such a good time at the resort that we felt that we didn't have to get out on any more tours. I heard mixed reviews around the resort on some of the tours, we did Catalina Island and it was really good. Crystal clear water for snorkeling and good entertainment on the boat rides.CasinoSmall Casino, about 5-6 tables for Black Jack, three cards Poker and regular Poker. One Roulette and about 15-20 slot machines. We did some Back Jack late at nigh after we got of the disco and had a great time with the staff. All very friendly as the ones outside of the casinoOverall it was a 4.5 out of 5 experience. I am not giving the hotel a full 5 because they can definitely improve the food in some of the restaurants. We are already planning our next trip to Dreams next year, we hope to have a group of about 40 next time. As far as the guest that you are going to see in the resort, you will see a good mix of Europeans and Americans in there. About 50% of the guests were from the UK, some from Germany, about 40% from the USA and the rest from other places. They all go there to have a good time, we didn't have a single problem with any guest, and we all share a good experience together as family.

<Content>Once Was Enough Off to a bad start and exactly what the reviews said....Check-in: My husband had apparently called the hotel a week before our trip to upgrade our room to a Jr. Suite for the week to celebrate our 1 year wedding anniversary....he was told how much it would cost and that he was all set! APPARENTELY NOT! At check in the Asst. Mgr. said that who he spoke with was not authorized to book the Jr. Suite and that they did not have any available for us that week......So, off to our room with a King bed and pool view....UM, NO! We landed ourselves in a musty first floor DOUBLE BED room with a GARDEN view....NOT WHAT WE PAID FOR! We go back to complain and are told we must stay there the night because there are no rooms left with king beds and pool views......So we stay for the night and cannot move our things until 3pm the next day! The food was ok....dinners were the best! Especially the Japanese and Chinese restaurant! The cleanliness of the resort was OK.....we ALWAYS saw empty drink glasses laying on the grass or sidewalk of the resort property, the staff was not too quick to clean things up. We also saw a HUGE roach out by the bar closest to the beach (that disgusted us).The entertainment that we saw was fabulous! And the drinks were very good.We also had a great experience in the SPA. And the pool is awesome! The gift shop is a RIP OFF! $6.00 for a bag of Doritos, so bring your own snack food if you want something to hold you over in between meals or to munch on at the pool side.If you like to leave the resort and go to shops, then Punta Cana is not the place and Cancun is a much better destination for you鈥?we had wished we went back to Mexico because while we were there it rained 4 out of the 5 days and we were STUCK at our resort, whereas in Cancun, we could have left the property to shop, etc.

<Content>Had a good time, but wouldn't return We went to the Dreams Aug 30-Sept 6th. This was our 2nd trip to a Dreams Resort, first time in the Dominican Republic. First off, you have to pay a $10 pp tax to get into the country. These little guys in hats will try to take your luggage, so that you will tip them. I carried my own. If you aren't interested, just ignore them. IThe roads are bumpy. It is a third world country, so what do you expect. We were the first dropped off at the resort, which took approx 50 minutes from the airport. They were not overly nice at check-in, but also were not rude. Bar Staff-Let me first say, I am normally a good tipper. I know that these folks make next to nothing, so my heart goes out to them. However, when I have to argue with them every time I got get a drink, you aren't getting a dime from me. This resort advertised premium liquor. Every time that I went to get a drink, they tried to pour the cheap stuff, even when I said, Malibu Rum. When you told them no, they argued that it was the same. Restaurants-We at at the World Cafe every morning. I thought it was very good. My favorite was the freshly made omelets, We never had to wait for a seat, so I was thankful for that. Boudeaux-this was the best quality food. I had a filet  it was delicious. Our waitress was super nice.Seaside-I would recommend getting everything well done, if you like your meat cooked! 3 of us ordered a steak, medium well,  it was bleeding. Salad was good.Oceana-We ate here our first night. Food was good, greeter not so good. She completely ignored us,  tried to seat someone in front of us, until she noticed that I was watching her. Da Mario-this is the Italian restaurant. It is acutally in the World Cafe. We were the only ones in there at 7:30, which should have told me something. They were out of fetuchinne, so some form of spaghetti was the only option. It was hot  good though. Himitsu-We at at the Hibatchi grill  I was impressed. I would not eat the fish!! Everyone got sick after eating it. Shopping-They had vendors there for 3 nights. They will negotiate on the price!! The most I paid for anything was $25,  it was a large piece of jewelry. The gift shop was very resonably priced too. They said male enhancements over the counter, which we got a kick out of seeing. There is also a store that has knock off designer merchandise. Everything from purses, shoes, clothes, sunglasses, jewelry, etc. A friend of ours got a chanel handbag. Excursions-We did Stingray Bay. I would recommed it! I was a little nervous at first. Swimming with sharks  stingrays will do that to a person, but it is safe,  we all had a great time. Overall, I had a great time. However,I would not go back. I try not to have expectations on any trip that I take, but I was spoiled at the Dreams Puerto Vallarta. Everyone on thier staff was overly friendly. so much that it made these folks seem rude.

<Content>Dreams - Lives up to it's name! We have just returned from our holiday at Dreams Punta Cana Resort and Spa. We were there from 11-25 September 2008 and had a great time. Check - InCheck in was fine, very quick and efficient. We got welcomed with a nice glass of champagne and a cold towel and a 'welcome home' from the guy who was checking us in. They offered us an upgrade to one of the suites which is normally $100 per night, but as it was my birthday whilst on holiday they offered it to us at $60 per night, which we still declined as it was too expensive to pay considering we were staying for 14 nights - $840 (拢420) If we hadn't been staying for so long we may have considered it. The bell boy took our bags and we just had to walk to the room.Our RoomOur room was 4319 - in building 4, top floor (there is only ground floor, 1st floor, 2nd floor in each building) The room was fine, the view wasn't great but we could have asked to be moved to another if we wanted to - we didn't bother. We had 2 double beds, which again we didn't bother about but if other couples have a problem with this then the hotel would have no problems moving you to a different room. The room was nicely furnished and decorated and a decent size with a balcony you could sit out on. The maid service was excellent - the first few days she came at varied times. Only one time we had decided to have a lie in so we were still in bed when she called, but she just said sorry and closed the door again. After that, we put the 'do not disturb' sign on the door when we came in in the evening and once we left the room the next day we turned it round to the 'please clean room' side and it was always done by the time we came back - usually with some nice towel art left on the bed and some flowers and rose petals sprinkled on the bed which I thought was a nice touch. There was always a turn down service at night, quite a lot of the time we were still in the room getting ready for dinner when she came - she would hand us some chocolates and the sundial flyer which told you everything that was happening in the resort the following day, including which of the al a carte restaurants were to be closed and the dress code for each etc. On the odd occasion we were out of the room, she would make the bed all nice and ready to get into and on the last night we came in to some nice soft music playing from the clock radio which I thought was really nice. The bathroom was nicely decorated, lovely tiles, good lighting and the shower was good and simple to work. It did go cold the odd time, but just for a few seconds and it was always at peak times so you can imagine how many people were showering at that time, hot water can't get to everyone at every single second. The air con was fine, it was controlled by us in the room so we could have it as cold as we liked. We heard some people say that the maid turned it off when she came in to clean but this was never the case with us, it was kept on the whole time we were there so the room was always nice and cool when we came in. We had also heard it worked with a motion sensor, this was also not the case. My only small complaint was that the mini bar wasn't topped up every day, my boyfriend enjoyed a beer or two when we were in the room and once or twice when he went to get one it hadn't been filled. However, all we did was call the concierge (excellent service from them!) and they sent some straight up. Any time we had to call the concierge, they always called later to check that our request had been carried out - which it had. The BarsThere are several bars in the resort, the lobby bar up next to the reception, the theatre bar, the bar within the disco, the beach bar, the pool bar, the swim up bar. So even though the resort is pretty big, you're never far from somewhere to get a drink! The beer they serve at all the bars is presidente which my boyfriend says was perfectly fine. The lobby bar served heineken and bud light so that was good. They served looooooads of cocktails, so you're bound to find something you'll like. They also serve premium brand spirits and soft drinks like coke, fanta, sprite etc. as well as fruit juices too. They also serve champagne by the glass, which is what I drank most of the time, it wasn't exactly moet (not that I'd ever have expected it to be) however it was lovely just the same. The RestaurantsMy only complaint about the restaurants in general was a couple of nights out of the 14, 3 of the al a carte restaurants were closed at once. Which meant there was a long waiting time at the others. I would expect one, max two to be closed on the one night, but not 3 - it makes the others too busy. There are 7 restaurants at Dreams Punta Cana, we tried all except 1:The Bordeaux (French cuisine) was excellent, we ate there 3 times and I would say this was probably our favourite. The food was lovely, beautifully presented and the service here was always fantastic. El Patio (Mexican) We also ate here 3 times and was one of our favourites also. I preferred what I had the 1st and 3rd time, as apposed to the 2nd time. I had chimchangas and fajitas and felt the tortilla was more like pastry, it was quite oily and not like what we would get back home so on the 3rd visit I had again what I'd really enjoyed on the 1st visit - mozzarella cheese sticks and chicken pasta (fantastic)Himitsu (Chinese  Japanese)We ate here twice, once at the chinese section and once at the japanese teppanyaki section. The chinese was fine, it tasted lovely, my only gripe - which is only because I am an extremely fussy eater, was that the chicken was slightly grissley in some parts. Other that this, I really did enjoy it. The japanese was fantastic, they served sushi to start which I didn't eat as I am allergic to fish however my boyfriend said it was quite nice (first time trying sushi). The soup they served second was lovely as was the main, a mixture of vegetables with chicken and likewise with beef and you could have one or a bit of both, served with rice. They also offered fish, which I obviously declined. My only annoyance with the japanese was the server kept shouting BAM BARA BAM BAM - and we had to say BAM BAM!! and it was quite annoying in my opinion but everyone else seemed to enjoy it. Maybe I'm just a spoil sport when it comes to audience participation lol. Seaside Grill (Steakhouse)We ate here twice, the food was excellent. My only disapointment the first time was the portion was small but we ordered extra sides the second time which more than made up for it. My boyfriend ordered his steak medium rare the first time and it came well done, which was his only disapointment about it, so the second time he ordered it rare thinking it would come medium rare... It was certainly more like what he asked for than the last time but slightly rarer than he normally likes it but he did ask for it rare so it was his own fault! La Trattoria (Italian)We ate here twice, the food was good however the menu was quite limited and didn't give a very detailed description of the dishes so it was quite a bit of guess work. All that aside, what we did order we really enjoyed so it was fine. World Cafe (Buffet) We ate in the world cafe every day except one for breakfast and lunch and I can honestly say it was excellent - the choice was superb. My only complaint was the service on the odd occasion was pretty rubbish. One day a waiter didn't come near us once, so we got no drinks or even water which they normally served you as soon as you were seated at the table. I will say that the service was fine most of the time though. We ate here once for dinner and the service was great, as was the food. I had chicken fajitas one day for lunch and the tortilla wraps were fine - just like we get back home (unlike the afore mentioned in the mexican)Oceana (Seafood)This was the only one we didn't eat in for dinner as I mentioned before I am allergic to fish so nothing on the menu suited me. We did however eat here one day for lunch, they had quite an extensive menu for lunch. The thing I had, chicken fajitas, were similar to that in the mexican, oily pastry like tortillas so I didn't enjoy it very much. We didn't get to try anything else from their extensive menu so my opinion on this is not exactly fair. They serve a continental breakfast.In addition to the restaurants, they also served some late night snacks outside the disco like burgers, hot dogs, fries, nachos, chicken wings etc. which was good to take back to the room when you were peckish at night time. Room ServiceThis was excellent, it always came quicker than the timescale they advised. The food was pretty good, most of the time we ordered pizza which came in it's own dreams punta cana pizza box and was delicious. The PoolThe Pool was great, and HUGE! It runs from one end to the other. There was always plenty of sun loungers and we went out pretty late most days. There's so many different sections you can sit at so you'll find somewhere that suits you (it's a bit noisier near the bottom end as this is where the entertainment team do their games and things) The swim up bar was excellent, this is where we spent most of our time. The Pool FloatsI had read about the ridiculous antics regarding the pool floats before I had come, but I didn't realise just how ridiculous it actually was. One day when we were in the pool there were no available floats to be seen. Then we spotted 3 lying on sunbeds and the owners which they obviously thought they were, were putting on their clothes - socks, shoes, the lot and walked off. So we jumped out and took 2 of them, someone else took the other. They were gone for well over an hour and when they came back they were shouting and bawling and pointing their fingers in a rage. We just laughed at them as they had a cheek taking them out of the pool in the first place. THEN we saw the guy go into which I assume was his ground floor room by the pool, through the patio doors and take out some other floats!! So the whole time they were complaining about someone 'stealing' their floats, they had some in their room anyway! The thing that really annoyed me most about this was the hotel clearly states the floats must not be removed from the pool but people just ignored it. If people left them in the pool there would be more than enough for everyone in the pool at any one time, but selfish people obviously don't realise this. This is obviously not the hotel's fault, but their staff should enforce the rule of not taking them out of the pool or back to the rooms. The BeachWe didn't ever make it down to the beach, other than one day for the beach BBQ which was quite good. I didn't really pay it much attention which was a shame. We were intending to lie at the beach the last few days but unfortunately a tropical storm was passing through so it rained from the heavens and we didn't get to go. Overall, our holiday was fantastic, the weather was fantastic apart from the last 3 days when I mentioned it rained. I would definitely return given the opportunity and I would also reccommend it to my friends and family without a doubt.

<Content>So-so stay at Dreams I didn't know exactly what to expect after reading the wildly mixed reviews of Dreams; after our recent stay (returned on 9/24/08) I would say it's fairly accurate to put it somewhere in the middle. Transportation:Yes, the roads there are not great. The first part of the drive from the airport was fine. As we got closer to Dreams, the worse the roads got. Yes, the drivers are generally very aggressive. I didn't exactly fear for my life though, as other reviews seemed to state. I think the more annoying part was that it was so far away; if you hire a shuttle shared with other travelers, it's almost a guarantee that you will be dropping everyone else off first. It took almost an hour and a half to make it to the resort. It rained - a LOT - so the drive back to the airport was worse. Muddy, rocky roads. But it's not a deal-breaker by any means. Hotel staff:Again, a mixed bag. We had plenty of servers who were extremely helpful and friendly, and others who were pretty ambivalent and slow. We weren't in any hurry though, so it was fine. Check-in staff - not so great. Details below. Bellhops, pool attendants, etc. were all very friendly. Room:We had a rocky start as far as the rooms went. Our first room had hair all over the bed and on the blankets, there were opened/used beverages in the fridge, and was generally rather dirty. We called to request a different room, and their solution was to send a maid with fresh beverages to replace the used ones. We called back, and they didn't understand why we wanted to change rooms, yet still refused to send anyone out to look, and made us come back to the desk. They finally relented and gave us a different room. We walked into it, only to discover that someone was already IN that room! At this point, we were infuriated, not to mention a little concerned that they would give out keys to occupied rooms. We went back to the desk again, and after 30 more minutes and more debacles with our baggage and rude check-in staff, got yet another room. This one, too, had hair all over the bed but at least it was otherwise clean. The maid gave us new bedding and we left it at that. Terrible first experience. Food:Not so great. Wasn't bad and it was edible, but by no means did I look forward to meals. Bordeaux had pretty good steaks, and the breakfast buffet was generally okay. We didn't ever have to wait for a table though, which was nice. Room service 24/7 is a nice perk, but it's a rather limited menu.Pool/beach/grounds:All very nice. We never had a problem getting a chair (with shade) at the beach or pool. Attendants came by frequently to take drink orders, and there's always a bar nearby, no matter where you are. The grounds are very well kept, and there are peacocks and flamingos wandering around. Overall, we had an okay trip but there are definitely other countries/places to go that we want to visit and probably won't be going back.

<Content>Had a great time! My husband and I returned from a week long stay at Dreams Punta Cana September 21, 2008. This is our third visit to Punta Cana. We have previously stayed at Grand Palladium and Riu Palace.We used Apple Vacations and USA 3000 Airline. The flight was fine. They showed one movie and a few short programs. We had drink service twice. The snack (meal) now cost $7.00 but you can bring your own snack or purchase something from the airport before boarding. Arrival at the airport in Punta Cana was as usual...get picture taken, pay $10.00 arrival tax and then collect luggage which was already waiting for us.The ride to Dreams took approximately one hour and twenty minutes. The roads are bad in certain areas but the drivers do the best they can to make it a comfortable ride. I do recommend taking medication if you know you have problems with motion sickness. There are lot of bumps, brakes and bouncing.Since we arrived at the resort around noon our room was not ready yet. We had lunch and checked on the location of our room. We preferred a pool view and the first room did not have that. It had a view of the gardens and the building next door. We went back to the front desk to inquire about possibly changing our room to a pool view and were told no problem and we got the room we preferred. Our room was in building 4, second floor. This was a perfect location for us. Centrally located between the lobby and the beach. The middle pool bar and towel guy were right across the bridge from our room.I have to agree that the rooms are small and very average looking. We reserved a deluxe room type. The maids did a great job cleaning and keeping our towels stocked. You do have to be very careful about bringing any food or drinks into your room. The little tiny sugar ants are everywhere there is a tiny piece of food or an open drink. Air conditioner worked great. I think that we have just gotten used to junior suites and that is why the room seemed small. One funny thing is that the headboards were not attached to the beds. Every time we moved on the bed the headboard would hit the wall. I think our neighbors probably thought we were newlyweds! I don't really know why the headboards are not attached. The pool is wonderful and very, very big. It is nice that everyone can spread out and no one area seems crowded. There are also alot of palapas (palm frond umbrellas) so you can always find shade. Bar service is great. We were lucky enough to have a great server (Nerys) the first day we arrived. She suggested Blue Margaritas and made sure that we always had a nice fresh one in our hands the whole week. Didn't matter if we were at the beach or the pool. She made sure we were taken care of.Restaurants: We had breakfast at the buffet daily. Very good selection. I don't know if bacon is in short supply but some days there would be plenty, other days none, some days just an empty serving dish for an hour. I know it's just bacon, but my husband loves bacon. The food is good but never hot. It's warm, but not hot. We found this to be true at all the restaurants. The Mexican restaurant is just ok. The Seaside Grill has good steaks but are lacking on side dishes. We missed not having baked potatoes with our steaks (they did serve fries). Oceana has good seafood but very small portions. The dinner buffet was very good. The roast beef is excellent and the fish dishes were very good too. The desserts are wonderful. Very good variety and cut into small portions so you can try more than one.We did eat at the Bordeaux and it was our favorite. Very, very good meal, wine and dessert.The beach is beautiful. The nice part about staying at Dreams is that it is off by itself and you can walk for long distances on the beach and not see another resort or person for that matter. Again, alot of palapas for shade. The beach beds are great. There are a few in the preferred section and about 6 of for anyone to use. A word to the wise...just because they are covered does not mean you are out of the suns rays. The sun does come thru and you will get a sunburn if you don't have sunblock on. There is a small market for souvenirs about a 10 minute walk from the resort. Just go out of the lobby and turn right. There are maybe 10 shops at this center. We also went to Hard Rock Punta Cana. The taxi was $96.00 roundtrip. The shops in the same center with the Hard Rock are almost all high end retail shops. There are a few souvenir shops, but they are on the expensive side too.I know that there are so many details that I am leaving out. I will ask if anyone has questions in the Punta Cana forum. We really enjoyed our stay at Dreams Punta Cana. We met alot of very nice people (guests and staff). I would have to say that I don't think that it should have Apple's highest rating but I do think that it is a fine resort for budget minded families that are not picky about every little thing. I think sometimes people read the word luxury  and get all kinds of ideas. This is a fine, moderate resort.

<Content>Excellent place - loved it Not sure where to start.. i guess the early bookings stage. My friend and I were looking for a vacation stay in Dominican and from the hotels starts and price this was the best choice for us. We booked the vacation thru AirCanadaVacations in July to travel from Sep 13-19. One thing we missed is to read the others reviews prior to booking, but nevertheless we started reading about the hotel after we booked. There were so many good and bad things written about the hotel. We were confused and lost, whether it was the right choice or not. Nonetheless, when time came we hoped on the planes and ended up in Dreams Punta Cana.When you land, yes the airport is not a solid structure, but it is made to entertain the tourists - national style building with palm trees as a roof. I personally loved it, does it really matter to be huge solid structure when you arrive - No. There is $10 tourist card, but AirCanada is pretty cool, they paid that fee for us, as well as $20 exit fees. I was quite suprised that AirCanada did it, where I heard that US carriers did not. Customs were very quick, and got my luggage, I was happy.Our hotel transfer was on a minibus, that had A/C blowing cold, i had to even ask to turn it off for a while. Now about the road, it is not the greates experience, but if you like 4-wheeling or rollercoaster then it is perfect. Primarily it is the first 15-20 min strech that is bumpy, but acceptable. Again, if you live in metro citties such as NYC, Chicago or even Minneapolis and have driven thru constructions zones, you will be just fine.Hotel check in was fast, 3-5 min at max, plus glass of champagne, but no cold towels since it was me and my gf. I noticed when bigger group arrives then they offer cold towel. But it did not matter to me at all. There is a bar near lobby that I made myself comfortable while waiting for our freinds that arrived on different flight.Room are clean and neat, may be not like Ryat or Hilton NYC, but you should not spend more than just to sleep in you room at night. The rest of the time is outside - ocean, bars, pool and etc.. A/C in the room worked, and we had fan not working in bathroom that was fixed promptly upon call to front desk. There is a fridge in the room with couple of beers and some soft drinks and water. Also there is safety box for your documents. Fridge is not very cold, but it keeps the beverages cool.Food, was very good. In the morning and lunch there is World Cafe that everyone can find something to each, even champagne with orange juice, and for those who partied hard a bottle of absolute for hangover. Pretty cool. There is also burgers and hotdogs on the beach grill, as well as SeaSide grill for lunch. For dinner we tried all excep chinese restaurant. Bordeaux is french one, and they have pretty good appetizers along with lamb chops.. excellent, same quality as in high end restaruant in Vancouver Canada I have eaten once. Service is OK depending on who serves you, sometimes excellent sometimes acceptable. One thing, they offer wine list that you have to pay for it you would like a vine. But other than that any alcohol or pops are free, so don't get stack on wine, you can get a Disarono on the rock, or their vitamina - rome  coke. Out of all restaurants french has good lamb chops, oceana had steaks and lamb shoulders, but the most we loved the Sea side grill. Oh 1 thing to remember, the portions are smaller as in good restaurants, so if you not full, don't be afraid to ask for more. I have had ordered 2-3 apps, and sometimes even 2-3 entrees. The servers were kind and friendly. Just try all of them. Tips are not required but appreciated. Just remember how much you tip in AppleBees or Boston Pizza, and that the servers here work no less than the ones in US or Canada. As a standard we left $5 for our group of 4. Same applied to maid service, it is up to you to leave a tip or not. Since we are used to leave a couple bucks we did the same here.Entertainment is great, there are hotel staff that purely dedicated for entertainment programs, they have even prett cool nicknames such as 50cents, usher, michael jackson, julio, and mickey mouse. They work pretty hard, and made our stay very enjoyable. From the first day you arrive may sure you get daily program schedule that list various activities. You get paid hotel printed $ for participation and even more if you win. That money can be used to buy items at the auctions that is conducted every other day. We got a nice palm boat with a painting in it, and a bottlle of their rum, very nice. Also, right before dinner they have mini show at the bar by the beach, and then a bigger show for after dinner in the main theatre.For shopping, there are stands every couple of days on hotel premises that you need to bargain. For example a red corral necklase for my gf they were asking $165 another stand is even $240. You say no, and offer $20, they will come right away to reasonable price, they will offer it for $35. Eventually we got one necklase and earrings for $25. You need to bargain. Same for cigars, as they were asking $10 for a cigar, I managed to get about 6-8 of them for a $5 a piece, which I still consider expensive, just did not feel bargaining that night. There is also a market outside the hotel, if you go to the right of the hotel for a 5-10 min walk. It is quite safe as they have 2 police on duty and the people are very friendly. Again remember to bargain on anything.Beach at the hotel, very good on the shore like, but the water line a bit rocky in front of the hotel. But if you walk to the left towards boat rental, just pass it and go for about 200 m and you will find quite nice area.Tours, we took 2 tours: 1 is Marinarium and second is Saona Island.Marinarium was awesome, we loved it it costs about $85 US but worth as you will be swimming with sharks and sting rays, it is half a day tour. However the road to the marinarium is about 1 hour and the road tto there are for the real 4-wheelers fans.Saona island was OK, it is full day trip. It took 3 hours to get there but on our return only 1.5h. We got on catamarans and were towards Saona island about 2h away, then lunch, not bad, and drinks all inclusive. After that on speed boats to a place to swim and supposedly see star fish, but we saw only 1 and that was either dead or plastic. and then you return to you point of origin. It iis about $100 US, but it will not be our suggestion for others.Oh.. amost forgot, pool, is very clean and nice, but it is ony 1m or 3 feet deep. No diving, but good water polo playing ground.Overall A+, 2 thumbs up, or even all 10 fingers up!!!

<Content>lovely hotel I went to Dreams (then called sunscape beach) in April 2006 for my sisters wedding.It is a beutifal hotel and the whole resort is so big. I loved the restaurants they had there like the chinese restaurant the best! , the first days of arriving we got so badly burnt that we couldnt walk properly for days so we were fed up at first. The swimming pool is nice and the beach is beutifal but didnt like the barbeque on the beach because they done it right next to a bin where there was wasps and flys.The entertainment at night is ok but it got boring because they done the same shows but i loved the michael Jackson show it was brilliant and the karoke was good,i didnt really like the nightclub as they only played spanish music and you get men smoking cigars and they stink so badly.There was plenty of things to do for the kids and they enjoyed themselves,but for my age group it got abit boring because i like to explore and you cant leave the resort,so you end up doing the same thing everyday.If your getting married then dreams is perfect for you as they do very beutifal weddings receptions and the staff were lovely,i would go back but probaly for a week instead of two because the entertainment wasnt all that but i did go 2 years ago so it might of got better.

<Content>Loved the Grounds!-LOTS of Tips Just returned on Sept. 21st. I travelled with my husband, 5 year old, 11 year old and 15 year old. We picked this resort mainly for the extensive family activities that were available.Grounds: ABSOLUTELY STUNNING! I rate them a 6*. Best I've seen yet! Very tropically landscaped and well kept. Also has a nice flamingo pond. Resort was secluded in between jungle on both sides. No bracelets needed.Food: Just alright. Not gross, but not amazing. Not enough of a selection. No reservations required. They request long pants and collared shirts with no sandles for the men, but even though we complied, most people would go in with t-shirts and sandals and were not asked to leave. Best restaurant-Japanese (Ages 6+ only). French-Adults only.Drinks: Perefect! Frozen drinks, large selection, large glasses topped with fruit. Brough to poolside and beach for you.Staff: Very friendly and helpful.Room Service: Great! Good selection of food and snacks. Helpful when returning from an excursion when nothing is open or late at night when dinner is finished. 24 hour service.Rooms: Gorgeous. Best I've seen so far. Clean. Coffee makers, iron, hair dryer, amenities, daily stocked minibar, included safe. Some ground level rooms have patios that practically enter right into the pool. Some have jacuzzi tubs on patios and balconies. Spa: Didn't use it because the costs were higher than where I live, but it is beautiful. Nicest spa I've seen in a resort.Entertainment: Really good night shows. Everyday you are given a daily schedule of events, so there is something going on day and night. If you prefer not to join in, the resort is very quiet for relaxing. Entertainment is mainly in the middle and lower pool area close to the beach. Movies at night, outdoor. Markets a few days around the resort. DIDN'T LIKE THIS AT ALL. They made sure they set up on every corner you could take, so they could nag you to death. This shouldn't have been allowed in such a nice resort. Beach entertainment is done on the right side of the beach which was a bummer because this is the side that's rocky and waves are rougher. Join in if you aren't shy. They give out amazing prizes for those who win. ie: Bottles of rum, champagne, t-shirts, hats, certificates to the spa, money to use in their auctions they have a couple times a week, etc. A few times a week they have a bonfire on the beach and champagne for adults only. Teen Club: Looked fun and had a lot to do, but unfortunately, my son was the only teen there; I guess because school just started, that it was mainly adults using the stuff. Disco: Never went. Casino: Looks alright. About 20 slot machines and a few tables. BBQ on beach from 12-3:00 pm everyday. Only hot dogs and burgers :( There is no snack bar on the beach or poolside. If you don't want the burgers and hotdogs for lunch, you have to change and walk all the way to the front of the resort to eat in the buffet. You couldn't go in in wet or uncovered bathing suits. Nor could you go bare foot.Kids Club: Excellent. Best I've seen. Each parent is given a cellphone and is contacted when child is read t o be picked up. Very fluent in English. They too had a daily schedule of activities. Parents are not allowed in the gated club though, so you couldn't stay with your child to use the waterslide or play. You literally had to drop them off and leave, which was a bummer for my son who wanted to use the slide, but didn't want to join. Kids have daily dances, movies at night, games, feeding the flamingos, water time, a weekly campout on the beach and they will even take the kids to eat in the buffer for dinner free of charge while you and your husband enjoy a quiet dinner.Pool: Very clean and huge! There was always a place to sit. Private sections and fun sections. One pool has a climbing iceburg in it for the kids. There's one pool in the shade about 1 foot deep for small children with a few water fountains in it. Jacuzzi was just a water massage. Not hot. Part of the pool. Lots of sunbeds aroung pool and beach.Beach: Huge beach, lots of chairs. Water was cloudy, but that could have been due to the passing hurricanes. Wasn't blue like I've seen. More of a dull color. Not rocky at all aroung the trampoline (guests loved this!). Just to the right. Snorkel sets require a $20 deposit per snorkel in case of damages and you have to return them within an hour. If you walk all the way down the beach to the left, there is a small market that we visited. Very friendly people. Safe. Not a huge selection, but better deals that the gift shops.Excursions: We only did the dune buggy tour which was awesom! We were taken about 15 minutes away to a ranch, rode a horse for 20 minutes, drove the dune buggies across town and to the beach, swam for 15 minutes in a perfectly clear and very pretty beach (Macau), checked out the market on the beach and were taken to an undergound cave to swim for 15 minutes. It was $60 pp, kids were half. Very worth it! They have a dolphin excursion that looked great but my kids were scared. For $110 pp, you got to swim with a dolphin and included a shark  stingray encounter-Dolphin Island Tour.Other than the small issues, we had a great time and would return again.

<Content>Would not go back We are big fans of all inclusive resorts and have stayed in all inclusives in Cancun, Mexico 1/2 dozen times. Those resorts were consderred 5-6 stars. So when you read this review, keep in mind what our frame of reference is.PROPERTY: The property is very nice with a nice private beach area. Depending on where your room is, you could be in for a lot of walking. The walkway between hotels is covered, but at the time of year we went, it made no difference as it was hot and humid. The beach is on one end of the hotel and most of the dining/activity is on the other end of the hotel. Its like a big rectangular layout with a meanering pool running the length of the layout. There are no elevators at the individual buildings that house the hotel rooms. ROOMS: We had a deluxe junior suite. The rooms are tiny. The smallest I have ever seen! Additionally, the air conditioning would barely keep the room cool, even if you ran it 24/7 IN CONJUNCTION with running the ceiling fan on high speed. The air conditioning intake filter was packed with about 1/2 inch of dirt/lint, etc. Apparently, it was not just our room that was like this and maintenance seems to replace the filters only when its brought to their attention. We were in a group of 14 people and everyone's rooms had the same air conditioning issues, some worse than others depending on the floor of the building. When you are out in the blazing heat all day and cannot even come to your room for a break, its quite disappointing. We also had a red ant infestation that seemed to have been created by the sugar near the coffee maker (either prior guests or room not properly cleaned).SERVICE: The service here was deplorable. From the rooms, the bars, to the pool side service to the diniing rooms (buffet or non buffet). A few examples....At the main pool cabana where towels are given out, at 9:45 a.m. one morning, they had no towels! In the rooms, we often were left with no floor towel, without ANY face towels, less bath towels, etc. At the bars (ANY of them and we frequented ALL of them), they are understaffed and unfriendly, unattentive and very slow. It seemed that unless you were greasing the staff with wads of cash, in advance of receiving your drink, service was not forthcoming. In the dining rooms, silverware would often be missing and take forever to get. Asking for a drink or a refill of water was another issue. We are used to the staff somethering us asking if we need something and here, you ask and ask and ask and finally get what you need when the meal is over. They seem to be able to habdle the buffet breakfast best. Pool side- there is usually 1 person covering a very large area and as a result, your drink will take 10-15 minutes if its early and if its peak time, figure 1/2 hour.DINING/FOOD: Food was acceptable. The variety was not impressive over a 6 day stay and the quality was so-so. One plus is that if you want to eat at a fancier restaurant, you do not need to make reservations unless you are in a large group. We went to the 4 out of the 5 restaurants and would recommend the French and Japanese ones the most. One issue is that you are expected to wear pants in most of the dining areas for the evening (with a proper shirt). While this is not a problem, in and of itself, its a big issue when its still hot as heck outside and the A/C is barely effective or on in the dining areas. Especially in the Japanese restaurant where there are open grills giving off heat.The staff do not seem well trained and do not have the right attiudes either. Also, not all of them speak sufficient English so be forewarned.

<Content>Would not go back for a million bucks Good points: beautiful pool, sunny days, helpful staff always willing to fix issuesBad points (outweigh the good by far!): food was terrible, beach was dirty (condoms, garbage) and full of sand fleas, we got bedbugs, hotel charged us twice a fee of $700 US that was supposed to be refunded and never was so now we have a hassle with Visa, nothing to do in Dominican Republic (rented a car for three hours and gave it back a day early because we were so bored), fake Cuban cigars, hotel let vendors on site every evening to harass you into buying their garbage.Basically a crappy way to spend our once in a lifetime honeymoon.Don't do it. Don't get sucked in!

<Content>Wonderful but be ready to avoid vendors! Transportation: We did NOT book this through a service and instead used a cab. It ran 60USD. Yes, the ride is bumpy, however they are close to completing a major highway running to the resorts - so help is on the way. Ride was approx 1hr from the airport.Hotel:The hotel was in excellent condition - pools immaculate - staff SUPER friendly and always seemed very happy. Drinks were what you'd expect for unlimited - but certainly did the trick! Water is also filtered so enjoy ice in your drinks.NOTE:Room service COMES TWICE A DAY - once to clean and once to drop off the next day's activity flier. Recommend to chain your door as they will simply come in.The only complaint we had was the vendors IN the resort. They would set up tables to present their jewelry. A booth was setup on EVERY sidewalk every night leading to the dining areas. Recommend taking the service sidewalk as this takes you around the entire resort and there were not any booths.Food was mediocre - very hit and miss - just keep ordering and find what ya like and stick with it. NOT a high point to say the least.Hotel Entertainment: These were some seriously talented performers....seriously made the vacation and the resort with daily and evening activities and shows. However, as previously stated, the evening shows/auctions were held rather late (for those who go to bed on vacation at 9pm)... we had no issues with it as were normally up until midnight enjoying the beach.Excursions taken:Scuba diving - Francisco led the dives and was a fantastic dive master. Would HIGHLY recommend it as the visibility was fantastic. Also bring bananas with you to feed the fish...way cool.Horseback riding - WEAR JEANS! We had never been before and wore shorts, painful. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Get to full gallop on the beach up to lagoon - beautiful and way fun.Quad runners - Get ready to get sandy. Trip takes you up to lagoon then through a little town and country side (rice fields). A lot of fun and get to see the REAL living conditions there - bring a camera. Recommend: Wear sunglasses as the dust gets pretty bad. Excursions will have a 'break period' in which you'll be taken to their 'ranch' - which is just another shop - same as all the other ones. Dont bother stating you have no money - they will insist you take the stuff with you and pay later. Just remember - EVERYTHING IS HEAVILY NEGOTIABLE. If you need cash - which we did - there is an ATM/bank within 10minutes walking distance. It's also very safe as there is a police station right outside. Would recommend walking during the day and once again there are shops where they will try to sell you the same stuff again. Most vendors will take either US or DR currency, so no need to exchange if you dont have to.If you decide to get some of the DR national drink 'Mamajuana' - make sure you also pick up some rum and fill the bottle (as they come empty with only the sticks in them). The mamajuana bottle is REQUIRED BY CUSTOMS to be filled prior to departure.

<Content>What a piece of paradise Where to begin... what an amazing vacation we had. After reading some of the reviews I was a bit concerned. All I can say is rubbish for those who write negative reviews. The hotel and staff went above and beyond. We had our wedding and honeymoon here and would recommend to anyone. The only thing I would add for anyone traveling outside of your home country is to make sure you have money or credit card to pay for medical expenses that may come up, they usually don't take insurance. Miquelina what an amazing person, brides do not fret, she will take care of everything. Go have fun and don't pay too much attention to the weather channel, when we went it said 65% chance of rain everday, it only sprinkled here and there and then sunny and 87. We will definately be returning. Last but not least meet new people when you go, we met some amazing people, shouts out to Claudine, Larry and Mya. Hola!

<Content>Great Resort - Awesome Staff!!! Loved the resort. Beautiful landscaping!! Hugmongous pool - great kids club and teenager zone. So many activities to choose from - or just relax. The staff here is amazing and pretty quick to responding to your needs as long as they speak a little english. We stayed from 8/31 trhough 9/6 so we did have 2 days of rain from Hurrican Hanna - never seen rain go sideways!! But the staff had so much to keep you moving - missing 2 days of pool or beach time was no big deal. Food was pretty good - just not the fish - we had one person get a bit ill from that. Loved it and would go back - one word of advice - make sure you take some bug repellent...being outside and with most of the resort being openair - you can be a buffet for the mosquitos.

<Content>Don't let the negative reviews scare you. Again after reading the reviews of the travellers before me i decided to lower my expectations so as not to be too disappointed. This was totally unnecessary as the place was wonderful.I purposely booked after Labor Day so i wouldn't have to deal with unsupervised children running around or splashing in the pool. There were very few kids when we werre there. The ride there which wasn't terrible, was no indication of the Dreams experience. We upgraded to a suite because i had recently injured my back and wanted to make use of the hot tub. Incidentally ,my room was, at times actually freezing!(room 8204) and was perfectly situated in the middle of the resort. The food although not gourmet was better than i expected from the reviews i read.There was enough of a selection, although they offer grouper a bit too frequently. We met alot of honeymooners who seemed to be enjoying themselves immensely. The pool is very comfortable and i do recommend that the hotel build some steps next to the pool bar with a rail into the pool as it is somewhat difficult to enter and exit from there.I thought that the best night time show was the True Love show..Very funny. I don't think there was a single time where i DID NOT see workers landscaping the grounds.It is always well maintained.We only did one excursion and that was the zip-lines. I never did it before and i can say it was a lot of fun...the emphasis WAS on safety. I brought plenty of singles for tips because they really do work hard for you.I recommend Dreams for a very relaxing vacation.

<Content>great service but scooter needed to get around when we arrived we were really impressed with the grounds, they were beautiful. we have stayed at 2 other resorts in Punta Cana and Dreams was definitely very impressive.one problem we encountered on arrival was the location of our room. I have a problem with walking any long distance and we were put into a room all the way at the end of resort. this made it difficult to go to Lobby or central hub and with one phone call we were moved to another room that was middle of resort of rooms. Also we were told we could call and an employee would drive us to restaurant or anywhere else that we wanted. We used this service and it was great, the response time was excellent.The food at the buffet was good but, some improvement was needed. The restaurants were great and wait time was minimal .The bar service was EXCELLENT, best we haveexperienced in all our travels, someone was there at all times to get drinks. The best part were the employees, hey were always in good spirits and would do anything we asked of them. To us that was VERY important.The nightly entertainment was good but, it could have been longer usually1 hour and it was around 10;30pm and if you didnt go to disco there was not much to do except drink.The casino was small, the machines were paying off fairly well and I can say I came home with money won.

<Content>Punta Cana in hurricane Season Travelers--my Girlfriend and I, a couple from the midwest with a modest budjet of 1000 spending cash. We both like food, outdoors adventures and different cultures.Weather--My GF and I booked a 2 week stay at Dream Punta Cana for August 26 to Sept 9th. We got a very good deal on it (950 per person) because it was hurricane season. We had 4 hurricanes in the area when we were down there and the only bad weather we had was 1.5 days of rain, everything weather wise worked out great.Punta Cana Airport-Wow, what a neat airport, the roof is thatch and it is open in many places letting in the nice tropical sun (and heat). There are no terminals like in the US, you just hop off the plane on the tarmac and walk into the airport. There will be a welcoming crew taking your photo that you can but on your way out. All in all pretty decent, if somewhat sweltering, but hey its the tropics.Resort--What a beautiful place. The building designs, the landscaping and statues. The design of the pool and the general layout was fantastic. We were both very happy with the way the resort looked, felt and (yes even) smelled. Other people have complained about flies/spiders and other critters, but the insect life wasn鈥檛 anything different than here in Wisconsin. Not once did I have to avoid something due to my irrational fear of things with more than 4 legs.Crew--The people that work here are fantastic, in fact, all the people we met from the DR were fantastic. Always ready to help with a smile or to sign/dance the crew that work here are just plain amazing. Everyone was so polite and friendly in a sincere way that you knew these folks loved their jobs. These guys/gals stick it out for 10-14 hour shifts and still have amazing energy. I spent most of my money tipping these fine folks for our vacation. The Dream Entertainment Team is very very good at what they do. I usually thinkt he little shows places put on are for old people and families, but these were funny and well done. Did i mention these folks are the same that are out there 1st thing in the morning getting people organized for the activities?Food--I will get this out of the way here, I love eating, but I am not a food snob. We tried out every restaurant and the buffets, lunch and dinner during out trip. Our highlights were the French, Chinese Japanese and (oddly enough) the Mexican. We ate at each of those places 2-3 times. The other places are quite nice, but those 3 stood out. As far as the buffet goes most of the items are good, but there are a few stinkers. You really need to try out a small sample of everything there before you find your niche. My only complaint is that the sit-sown places have crappy lunches. (PS a Dominican hamburger will NOT taste like it does in the US hehe)Drinks--With a stack of $1 bills in hand getting good drinks is a breeze. I got fast service, great tasting drinks and top shelf alcohol. Make sure you have your rum drinks made with Brujal, this stuff is fantastic, in fact, I would get shots of it to sip on (try extra viejo for a nice sipping rum with your cigar). What ever you do, make sure you drink a LOT of mamajuana, wow what a great drink.Room--Our room was huge, 9117, 2 couches a desk and chair, a nice patio with table and chairs, I huge bed, a decent TV and a very spacious bathroom with a tub big enough for 2 (not a Jacuzzi). We were on the first floor by the entryway to the pool area so when it rained for 2 days there was a bit of water in our hallway, but the staff put towels down to manage the water flow with out us asking. The maid service even fixed a broken toilet without us even having to report it, I was going to wait for the next day, but when we got back from dinner it was fixed--nice!Pool--100% awesome. It was huge and spacious, my GF and I always had a place to go where we could play around in the water by ourselves. This was really a gem. there are a bunch of trees around the outside that you can spy on all of the cool little lizards that live in them. Only bad part, pool closes at 6:30 NOT 7:30 like the sign says =(Beach-the hurricanes were messing with the ocean something fierce when we were there so the beach was nice and wavy. The water was murky from all of the detritus kicked up from the storms, but hey, I live on the Mississippi. As long as you stay to the left by the water sports there are no chunks of coral to watch out for. There are plenty of relaxing' spot to pick from, most people seem to prefer the pool (weirdoes)Excursions- We went on the Saona Island and El liguna Limon excursions and both of them were fantastic. Saona Island involved cruising on a catamaran out to the island, while enjoying fine drinks music and dancing. We got to the island and here was the crystal clear water, bright blue and green stretches and the white beaches. Wow, never seen this before and I was enthralled. We had a nice grill out of local cuisine (pork beans n rice) then took a speed boat back. Stopped at a little villa of shops in higuey for all the ppl that like to buy stuff. Picked up a big ol bottle of Brujal Anejo for cheap-yum. El Liguna Limon was a bit more involved. I nice cruise through the DR countryside, visiting several small villages and farms, went up a big ol mountain and took some sweet pictures (if you are afraid of heights like me the ride up and down is the stuff of our nightmares hehe). There was a nice lunch of lobster beans rice and pork (see a trend yet?) then some horseback riding to a beach (side note-the horses looked scrawny and small for me so I chose to ride on the jeep than subject them to carrying my obese American butt around). The beach was right where a fresh water stream hits the ocean and the life that teemed at the junction was amazing. There was what appeared to be graffiti on the coconuts trees here--odd. We then had a nice cruise across the lake and a serene bus ride home--until it got dark. If you have read the reviews of DR driving during the day, you are only partially prepared for the insanity at night. Although, I never saw a single car/horse/motoped accident down there...Misc--Every night the maids dropped of a program of what the next day would have available. You dont have to do anything if you do not want to, but you can earn tickets to get free stuff. They also have a featured drink listed which is great for trying new stuff. Try a banana mama, mmmmm. Lots of cool statues and little lizards all over. They are reall fun to watch hunt insects or to watch them puff out their bright red crests at the lady lizards. The disco is pretty fun, easy to get a drink and isnt to big or too small. The gal that works the bar in their makes a wicked Mojito. Cigars are fairly priced and quite good, at least for a stogie-noob like myself. The fruit we saw all seemed to be harvested unripened--oh well. Great prices on coffee, cacao and rum outside the resort area.Liked Best-The very happy citizens of the DR, the fact that beans rice and grilled pork are a staple, wonderful sunshine Saona IslandLiked Least- Pushy vendors (I realize this is the only way they can feed their family so I would be pushy too, but after 2 weeks I found myself taking odd paths to avoid them)All in all it was 2 weeks of a fantastic vacation with a real experience in a country quite different than my own. We both loved it and would return.

<Content>Dreams is a Dream come True! We stayed at Dreams for 14 nights at the end of August early September. We could not rate this hotel higher. The staff were friendly, helpful and informative. The entertainment teams were lovely and would always say Hola and come and have a chat to you, but equally if you were deep into your book they would leave you alone.The Pool was lovely, however not very deep, the free flowing drinks (cocktails or otherwise) were a welcome, with the heat.We went to the Spa and had a massage, which was very well priced and made us feel like we were royalty! The water Spa circuit was heaven and so very relaxing, which was lovely on the last day as one last wind down.The facilities were great, we played Tennis ( A first for me) Pool, Table Tennis, Archery, along with other games that they have available. They even have a Wii which was funny to watch!The rep that we had was great and was very friendly; there are 7 restaurants so we were spoilt for choice when it came to where to eat. There are 9 bars so we did not have to walk to far to get a beverage.The night entertainment varied every night, although the names stay the same, and was well presented and at times extremely funny.We had two days of rain, but again the entertainment team made sure that we never got bored with a wide range of activities available.We were pleasantly surprised that the Mini bar was included in the all inclusive price, there are professional photographer that come around with a variety of animals e.g. parrots, and you can have you picture taken with them, which is a really lovely memento. We saw some guest being very rude to the staff ECT which was not nice as the staff are so helpful and polite.Overall we can鈥檛 rate this hotel enough and only wish that we could have stayed forever.

<Content>Fantastic!! Could not fault this holiday - we had an excellent time! Wish we'd have booked for 2wks instead of just one! Staff are helpful and can not do enough for you. Rooms are clean and plenty of clean towels provided. Food was excellent, and lots of choice. Lots of entertainment during the day, and night time. Dreams entertainment team are second to none and really get you involved! Made some good friends - JJ, Harvey, Edgar, Usher to name but a few! Top guys! Can not wait to go back! Thanks to you all at Dreams, keep up the good work!

<Content>Dreams was a perfect honeymoon We went to Dreams mid August to early September.We had an amazing time, the food and service were wonderful and the quality of everything superb.The entertainment staff were world class and all the staff around the hotel were friendly and accommodating.We were there when the storms passed and yes there were towels on the ground floor corridors to stop the flooding, what do people expect, that they rebuild the hotel? You can't blame them for the weather nor for the flies which we only saw outside and certainly not inside the 7 restaurants which we went to that were definitely open!We would go back in a heartbeat and have already recommended family and friends to.This was a perfect honeymoon for us but would be great for families also as they had a great kids' club that kept the kids entertained and out of the way.Have a nice trip!

<Content>Horrible We were at Dreams 9/1 - 9/8 The food had all flies over it, water bugs which I feel were roaches at your feet at outside bar. Chairs in restaurant were dirty and by the pool. Fruit laying around pool area from drinks. Tarantulas in hall ways of hotel walking back to room. The heat was horrible, no air, sweat just poured off your face and body, especially in lobby area. Smell of must thru out the rooms and hotel. We had a blackout for 45 mins. no one told us what was going on, the back up lights did not come on. The hurricane threat did not add to the vacation. Staff would not tell us what was going on with weather, had to call home. Hotels were lined with towels thrown in doorways to stop flooding. It was absoultely horrible. We would never go back to Dreams, it was a Nightmare. The guests that were there helped us thru the week, we wanted to leave immediately.

<Content>Paradise at Dreams Stayed at Dreams for two weeks in August with my husband and 9 year old daughter. I fully appreciate that what can be one person's paradise can be the complete opposite for another but for us this place was pure paradise! We have visited a number of caribbean islands and stayed in a variety of all inclusives, Dreams is the best we have exprienced so far. We met some lovely people - Robin, Carole, Meggie and Craig; Andy, Deb, Gina and Josie; Bob and Tracy; Jan; Billy; Deb from Philadelphia - you know who you are and thanks for helping to make our holiday such a great experience!Rooms were more than adequate, ok, not huge, but plenty of room for three of us, nicely decorated and spotlessly clean. Air con worked fine and always plenty of clean fluffy towels. Be warned though, as others have said the marble floors are deadly when wet. I slipped one night and took a very heavy fall bruising my back, fortunately no more damage than that.The tropical gardens are beautiful and it was lovely to see the peacock and her baby wandering around every day.Fabulous pool, lovely design and plenty of nice places to sit. It always looked very clean although several children we became acquainted with did succumb to ear infections.,fortunately our daughter didn't. There were plenty of comfortable sun beds and it was a real bonus not to have to get up at the crack of dawn to reserve one as we have needed to do in other places.The beach was nice but we didn't spend much time on it as our daughter just wanted to spend time in the pool.Food was very good. We ate in most of the restaurants but not all.World Cafe was great and we did eat here the most, mainly because our daughter loved the buffet. There was plenty of choice for her and she could try a little bit of everything. Breakfast was amazing and oh how decadent to be able to drink champagne and eat smoked salmon if you wanted. Oceana was lovely and the fish and seafood in there was excellent. Our least favourite was the Seaside Grill. What did upset me a bit in the buffet was to see the amount of food that was wasted. When you can always go back for more why pile your plate up in the first instance and if you are not sure you like something you can always try a little.Bars were good and drinks were good quality. We spent most of our time around the Barracuda bar and the cocktails here were very good. We found the majority of bar staff across the resort to be excellent however, there were one or two who were a bit ambivalent, seeming to respond better to the customers who passed a few dollars across the bar.The entertainment staff - well, what can I say about these amazing individuals, they are a complete credit to this resort. They are happy, gentle and genuine people who really take an interest in making sure you have a good time. They work incredibly long hours and are still smiling constantly. Although they were all amazing, our particular favourites were Usher and Mickey Mouse - Sophie really misses you and can't wait to see you again next year, we hope you will still be there. The daytime entertainment was such fun and was a great way to meet other people, our daughter just loved it , although she did get a bit competitive! The evening entertainment was also very good and we always made sure we were in the theatre to see the Star Dance every night, it was just so energising to watch. Last but not least, the spa. What a lovely peaceful place and the range of treatments was excellent,, prices very reasonable too compared with what we might pay in UK..All in all we thought this was a fabulous place, almost perfect for us and we have already booked to go back next summer. Hopefully we might meet up with some of the delightful people we met this time, that would just be the icing on the cake!If you are thinking of going here don't be too put off by some of the negative reviews, try it for yourself I feel sure you won't be disappointed.

<Content>Great resort for all ages Our family of 5 (hubby and myself along with 3 sons ages 19, 17, and 13) just returned from Dreams and we all loved it. The entertainment staff did a great job. As soon as you signed up for an activity and they knew your name they went out of their way to say hello and call you by name every time they saw you, which made us feel even more a part of the resort. We loved Mielko and Mickey Mouse. There were so many activities each day that you couldn't do all you wanted to do. We hardly sat down and relaxed at all, but of course that was our own choice. Others just sat and watched most of the time and had a great time too. Our 13 year old loved the Core Zone and activities there such as archery and air gun competitions. Our older boys loved water polo, sand and beach volleyball, Olympic games and pool games. My favorite activity was the Paella contest on the beach. Don't miss this one, it's a blast. I loved the dance lessons too. My husband loved water polo and the water balloon fight in the pool. The food was very good, not as big of portions as Americans are used to so be sure to order appetizers each meal. The Asian restaurant was incredible. One of my favorite parts was the cart of fresh fruit where you chose your fruit and the lady would cut it up for you and serve it on a stick so you could walk around eating your fresh mango or pineapple on a stick every afternoon. Yummy.Now the bads: the bus trip was a little rough...they don't drive like we do in the US, that's for sure. My son said if he drove like that he would get a ticket for reckless driving! The bed wasn't very comfy but they never are quite like home. There is a one hour gap every day when you can't get food and it's hard to get drinks (while they are getting ready for dinner) plan ahead for this and it isn't a big deal, but it's good to know about. They did not offer near all of the top shelf liquors of many (most) resorts so I had to adjust what I drank. The bartenders etc like you to throw them a buck tip every once in a while and then you can get a little better service as sometimes it is a little hard to get a drink. Just relax and realize you are on vacation and time doesn't matter here and all is good. The resort is on the Atlantic and not the Caribbean so we are not sure if this is why the water wasn't very nice (very rocky and not very blue) or it might have been because of the recent hurricanes. Either way, be sure to wear water shoes in the ocean as we got our feet cut right away. We have never been to the same resort twice because we like to have new experiences but this is one place we would consider taking our family again because it had something for everyone.

<Content>Worst! If you booked a trip to Dreams Punta Cana just cancel it! We spent a week been there, got sick with stomach bacteria. You will get a diarrhea and fever. We had bags and lizards in a room even we鈥檝e been on a 3 floor. We met a lot of people with the same problems. They are trying to save on everything( food, drinks, lights, energy, even a on cleaning personnel) The fruit flies and flies are everywhere. This is horrible! I paid $2000.00 for service like this! There are only 4 restaurants NOT 7-8 like it said in a ads and not inaf to eat. Also the ceiling in a major restaurant World鈥檚 caf茅 is leaking. My advise for you DON鈥橳 go there and ruin your vacation.

<Content>Best holiday yet Just come back from 2 fabulous weeks at Dreams hotel. Couldnt fault it at all, even with the hurricane going on the 2nd week we had great time.The entertainment team during the day were excellent,made everybody enjoy the games and made them forget the rain.Hotel room was nice and clean, towels cleaned daily and mini bar topped up.On our arrival, it was a long bumpy journey but was fine, we were given a lovely cold drink and cold clothes to wipe ourselves with as we were all very hot, this was a lovely welcome.Food was excellent, we ate in the buffet for 10 of the nights and couldnt fault it at all, ate in the steak house and chinese too, both these were lovely as well.Entertainment in the evenings was fine, repeats itself the 2nd week but they do a good job considering what they have.All staff very pleasant. Would definately return, and hope its very soon.Go and enjoy it, Im sure you will.

<Content>A taste of paradise The stay at Dreams Punta Cana was amazing. From the minute you arrive they make you feel welcome. The rooms are nice and comfortable. The pool is amazing and right in front of the beach. The staff is very friendly and amazing. They are very energetic with the activities they do throughout the day and at night. They are very friendly with the guests. Yudy was an entertainer and she was very nice and attentive as was the rest of the entertainers at the hotel. The only thing is the ride from the airport but don't let that discourage you because once you arrive you get that taste of paradise.

<Content>FABULOUS and FUN family resort!! My parents treated our whole family of 14 to celebrate their 55th wedding anniversary at DREAMS from August 10-17, 2008. Ages ranged from 77 yrs. to 11 years old. We flew direct from O鈥橦are and everything went off like a hitch. We were greeted at the airport with an air conditioned bus that took all 14 of us and our luggage to the resort. Yes, the roads were bumpy but we quite enjoyed the trip there and seeing the TRUE Dominican life. It was an 鈥渆ye-opener鈥?for the kids. Once there we were given champagne and mimosa. (I drank both!) No cool face clothes which I really needed at that point as I attempted to check all 14 of us in. We had 7 rooms and had emailed Eileen (manager) ahead of time with some room requests as we wanted to make sure the children were safe and adjoined with their parents. Unfortunately that didn't happen and they were placed in rooms next to their parents. It all worked out but we did wonder why we couldn't have been accommodated when the adjoining rooms were unoccupied. Oh well! Michel, at check-in, was truly giving us his best service and trying hard to please. We were housed is 5122, 5120, 5112, 4124, 2203, 2204 and 2226. The rooms were clean, decent size for two people in each room, the air worked well, and the fridge was fully stocked with water, juice, pop, and beer. We had maid service 1-2 times a day based on our schedule and cute animal art on our bed on several occasions. No one in our party had any complaints about the rooms.I was disappointed at the lack of face clothes. We didn鈥檛 receive them for the first 3 days and then we ended up with 6 at some point later in the week. Go figure!The pool is AMAZING!! It is the gem of this resort. We all loved it as it鈥檚 only 3ft. deep throughout. There is a swimup bar at the beach end and another pool bar (on land) 陆 way down. The chairs are plentiful and there are palapa huts throughout too. There are a few cabanas beds which hold many people at once. My family loved chillen under the cabana together when a sun  drink break was needed. Guests did not really reserve beds. We saw security remove items if they were placed on beds unattended before 8am.I was disappointed by the poor quality of the poolside chair cushions. The cushions on the poolside chairs are in MAJOR need of replacement. It appeared to be black mold or something 鈥渋cky鈥?in and on them. I covered the chair well with towels.The ice berg was fantastic fun for kids to play on. Rafts were available too. We brought several with us and only ended up using 2. Many mornings the rafts would clog up in the pool by building 2. We called it the 鈥渞aft graveyard鈥?as we were able to get a raft first thing in the morning.The beach was BEAUTIFUL!! The water is turquoise blue and the sand is soft and tan. We were there right before Tropical Fay rolled through so the water appeared to be a little rougher than I remembered. We all brought water shoes and made sure we swam to the left. It was absolutely gorgeous. We brought our boogie board rafts out to the ocean and rode the waves in. We also brought our own masks and snorkels. It was FUN!! There are rocks as many people have posted. Just be aware of them.The chairs and palapa huts were plentiful on the beach. The beach service was GREAT!! We brought our Bubba Kegs and they kept ice water COLD for hours. They were a BONUS for the beer and mixed drinkers too. Never had a problem keeping them full.The restaurants were incredible. You鈥檇 have to be CRAZY to not find something to eat. It 鈥渇loors鈥?me when people say the food was HORRIBLE. What planet are they coming from??? We did bring our spices but rarely found it necessary to use them. We don鈥檛 enjoy eating bland food but obviously that was NOT the case.The World Cafe鈥?offered a HUGE variety from breakfast, lunch and dinner. At breakfast you can get made to order eggs and omelets. The smoothies are 鈥渢o die for.鈥?We only ate lunch twice in the World Cafe鈥? The pizza is wonderful. They also had a make your own pasta bar where you pick the noodle, sauce, etc. It was delicious. The El Patio was a 鈥渢heme鈥?night with a certain food being served. (ie~ Dominican night with Dominican far, Asian, etc..) the food was VERY good with A LOT of variety.The Seaside Grill was closed for renovation part way through the week to have the thatch roof repaired in this open-air restaurant. We ate there the first night and had great steaks, veggies and desserts. Drinks were plentiful too.The Oceana was very convenient for lunch. We spent A LOT of time on the beach so you just had to throw a cover-up on and head to this open-air beauty. The sandwiches were pretty good. One day we ordered a version of a club sandwich as stated in the menu but got a ham and cheese sandwich served to us. Not sure why. They also had a fresh fruit and dessert bar.The outdoor beach grill offered fresh fruit, fresh salsa, chips and cheese. There was a grill with hotdogs and hamburgers and ALL the fixins to go with them. The pop machine was nice too.The Bordeaux was truly the hidden diamond in the rough. It is located above the Seaside Grill and Oceana BUT it is enclosed and air-conditioned. The view is stunning as there are windows wrapped around it and you can see the gorgeous blue water. The food was very tasty. We loved the seafood shell appetizer and the beef tenderloin and steaks. The best part was the bar located right next to it. Often we were the only people frequenting it. The views are SPECTACULAR!!! The bartender, Aquino, was so efficient and friendly. My dad asked him one evening, 鈥淒o you like your job?鈥?and Aquino replied, 鈥淒o you like your drink?鈥?We ALL laughed as he had made THE BEST bloody sisters EVER!!The Himitsu was a very fun Asian grill restaurant. The chef was very entertaining and allowed my daughter to partake in the cooking. She had a ball!! The food was VERY delicious. We were STUFFED by the end of the meal that we had to skip dessert. The view was beautiful too.We must have missed the Da Mario. I can鈥檛 imagine how but we did. It is an Italian fare.The bars offered plentiful liquor and top-shelf when you asked for it. The drinks could be as strong or as weak as you wanted them. After a while the bartenders often knew what and how you liked your drinks. It was INCREDIBLE!! Don鈥檛 miss the hidden gem by the Bordeaux.The entertainment team worked EXTREMELY hard everyday to prepare the very entertaining programs. Many people participated had a lot of fun. On Friday when Tropical storm FAY rolled through they had a variety of activities and food to keep everyone entertained.No one in our party had kids that used the Kids鈥?Explorer Club. It looked AWESOME and the kids we did see were having the time of their lives being entertained by the staff there.The Core Zone was a hit for both the teens and a few adults in our party. They offered a mechanical bull, pin-pong, pool, internet caf茅 (fee,) a snack/drink bar, batting cage and a few other things. There was a lot to keep the teens busy.The Casino is VERY SMALL and fairly smoky. My mother won several times and came home with more money than she brought. (BONUS for mom!!) There were approximately 30 slots and 6 tables.The grounds were IMMACULATE and the wildlife roamed the resort. (Peacocks, babies and the flamingos.)The vendors attempted to get pushy but we FIRMLY set them straight and it worked. Be firm and consistent and you shouldn鈥檛 have a problem. It鈥檚 only when people continued to converse with the vendors that they became frustrated because the vendors wouldn鈥檛 let up.A few minor renovations to this resort would truly make it EXCELLENT! We felt an above average rating was in order.Last but not least鈥︹€? The staff worked VERY HARD to serve the guests of the resort. It truly showed.I am sure there is so much more to comment on but I feel as though I have covered the 鈥渏ist鈥?of things. DO NOT believe the negative reviews. Those negative reviewers must be hard to please. It鈥檚 funny how many negative reviewers post only ONE time. Hmm? Makes me wonder. Enjoy your stay at DREAMS if you鈥檙e lucky enough to vacation there. HAPPY TRAVELS!!!!!Jan :)

<Content>Caution on the food Lovely, lovely resort, pool, staff. We had a marvelous honeymoon suite (my husband  I of 20 years and our 14 year old) in #7 bldg. I guess a newer one of the buildings. No problem with room. Maids are awesome. Teen club was perfect for our teen to hang, play wii, pool, ping pong, dance, etc...To balance this however was the fact that we all got terribly sick starting 4-5 days into the trip. My daughter is a vegetarian and did fine - she even ate salads and drank the water in the restaurants, ate fruit and drank non-alcoholic drinks so our MD was thinking E.Coli infection. Never been sicker. Missed work for 3 days on our return and was put on anti-biotics. IF you go - please tip - these guys make a small salary and a dollar to them is huge.By the way - this Dominican resort posts No Topless around the resort. Also, we couldn't really swim - the waves were ridiculously rough and random sharp rocks made for a dangerous combo but the pool more than makes up for it. Also, Gustav was passing overhead. Only rained 2 days for 20 min each day but was overcast pretty much 5 of the 7 days which was OK. (I'm light-skinned). My husband did the $100 deep sea fishing trip - didn't catch anything (they sell dramamine in the pharmacia in the hotel)- also had to laugh...they had viagra too.The boys in El Patio were a riot - silly bunch - like to laugh and joke. Japanese habachi not worth the trouble for us - good food but quite the hassel to get in.

<Content>Nightmares not Dreams Well, as in our review title we decided to rename this hotel Nightmares not Dreams. After a long and very bumpy drive from the airport, we arrived at Dreams at around 6pm all excited to start our holiday. First impressions really good, lobby looked absolutely lovely and quite glamourous but very hot - but hey we were in the Caribbean what do you expect, hot climate is part of the reason for coming. Friendly hotel porters were quick to offload our luggage and label it ready for transporting to our rooms. Upon joining queue at check in desk we were greeted straight away by a friendly waitress with an ice cold glass of champagne or fruit juice if you preferred. This was a good start and made us feel very welcome, and this is where the good holiday feeling ended. Everybody seemed to be checking in ok and when we arrived for our turn (we were near the back of the queue) we had a sheet torn out of our ticket book and told to go and sit in the lobby area which we did and had a cold drink while we waited we assumed for the bellboys to take us to our rooms (we were a party of six adults, parents with two daughters and their partners). Well, we sat and waited and waited. After about half an hour we decided to make enquiries with reception how long we could expect to wait and were told that someone was going to come and talk to us. We thought this rather strange but went with the flow and sat it out for a bit longer. Another half hour passed, further enquiries and were told same thing again. Beginning to lose patience and finally after two hours sitting there with no explanation of delay decided to start stamping feet and demanding information. The senior receptionist finally came over and informed us that the hotel was overbooked and that there were no rooms for us (we booked this hotel 18 months previously, how could there be no rooms - they had known we were coming for long enough!!) When asked what was being done about it, the staff informed us that he would get back to us. Oh, no, this sounded familiar and yes, you guessed, we were still sitting there at 9.30pm hot, tired and with nowhere to go and the hotel staff just shrugging their shoulders. Well, tempers were flaring by now with the hotel staff just disappearing so we contacted our rep on the emergency number she had provided us with on the transfer coach (thank god, she had and not waited until the welcome meeeting). Fair play to our rep, she was there within 10 mins to help us and put her foot down with the hotel who had still done nothing to help us but ply us with free drinks which is all well and good but would rather have somewhere to stay. We were eventually at 10.30pm offered an alternative hotel which was a 20 min drive away (which actually turned out to be more like 45 mins). We were disappointed because we wanted to stay at Dreams having seen all the lovely pics on the internet and didn't know anything about the hotel we were being transferred to, but couldn't really complain as we had nowhere else to go. By now, we just wanted to get away from Dreams. They offered us to transfer for one week and go back to them for the second week which we weren't happy with (we didn't want to keep packing and unpacking, if we wanted a two resort holiday we would have booked one) but decided to accept just in case the alternative hotel wasn't very good but with the option of staying there if we preferred it. Preferred it, best thing we did - the other hotel was absolutely lovely and far superior. We also found out that another family had experienced the same problem and had taken the option to transfer back to Dreams after one week (they were transferred to the same hotel as us) which they did and regretted it. If you are planning on staying at Dreams, take a tip and check availability of your rooms nearer to your departure. It's a shame we never got to see the rest of the hotel and resort but with the attitude of the check in staff we have decided not to try Dreams again. Will go back to Dom Rep but not to Nightmares!!!!

<Content>3 weeks of bliss!!! My husband and I have just returned from a 3 week holiday at Dreams Punta Cana. I don't usually do feedback on websites, but since I found previous feedback exceptionally useful, I thought I would payback the favour!! I also felt it necessary to address some of the less positive feedback....This was our second time in the Dom Rep, we have stayed previously at another 4Star, as well as the Moon Palace in Mexico, so can make fair comparisons with other resorts. Additionally, I have worked in the travel industry for 10 years, visiting in my professional capacity a range of hotel chains across the world, so I feel I am speaking with knowledge and from experience.To begin with, the journey from the airport to the hotel:This is not really anything to do with the hotel, so it is not fair to judge the property on this factor. I always find the journey to my resort a fascinating one, and if, as with most Caribbean resorts, you are predominantly hotel based, this is a useful insight into the country you are visiting. The Dominican people live in basic accomodation in prefabricated housing, often growing fruits and vegetables, keeping a few animals. They are mainly self sufficient (think- The Good Life), and exchange produce with other villagers, and sell some from the roadside. They are always keen to give a wave and a smile:-) Yes the roads are bumpy, but this all adds to the experience!!Upon arrival at the hotel, we were greated with champagne (no flannels or juice), and the bellboys register your luggage with your room number once you have checked in.Check in was very straight forward, we were issued with a map of the resort and information on the restaurants, towel cards and 2 room keys (which are quite unreliable if they have been in the heat all day, the magnetic strip is often not recognised by your door!) Reception did not try to upgrade us to a suite, although I did email the hotel (Concierge-Eileen Ostos) to advise that it was our anniversary and we had a larger than average room, fruit platter and bottle of champagne as well as a letter of congratulations!!Our room was delightful, and very easy to find. We were in building 8-2nd on the right from the lobby. Room 8210. We had a king four poster bed, two sofas, a vanity area, a wardrobe in the bedroom and a double wardrobe outside the bathroom, iron, ironing board, coffee maker, dvd/cd player-warning to UK guests-this will not play dvds you take from the UK-I did try!! As I said, our bedroom was larger than average. Our bathroom was also spacious, shower over the bath and always had fresh towels, handtowels and flannels-which were replenished during the evening turndown service too. We were happy this was our home for 3 weeks!The mini bar was well stocked, coke, sprite, diet coke, 6 waters, the coffee machine worked well, but the mini ants (found in all rooms-not the hotel's fault-it is the tropics!!) were attracted to the sticky machine once we had used it, so do be careful!! No tea bags in the room, I did think ahead and packed PG tips, which I was glad to have done. The linen on the bed was changed daily, we only had towel art 3 times in 3 weeks, but this didn't bother us.Grounds:Stunning, well maintained. Always being watered-even in the hours before and after a tropical storm. The flamingos were gorgeous, even when they were grunting at 3am!! They follow each other around like lemmings. The peacocks were lovely, I did see a rat one day by the pool-but I am convinced this was a one off, attracted by the platefuls of food left ourside people's rooms from room serviceThe beach:Pleasant, after tropical storms, there is some seaweed washed up, this isn't always cleared up immediately. The sand is coarser than other beaches on the island, but a pale yellow. The waitresses do provide service on the beach, but not with the same frequency as by the pool. The turtle trampoline is quite good (children only, but I am very small so got away with it;-)but with the waves underneath you lose your footing and fall over a lot!! Palapas were plentiful, in fact the beach was mostly empty all day.The pool:It is actually in two sections, the busiest is closest to the beach, where the swim up bar is. This tends to be packed all day, as this is where the entertainers are based. If you prefer piece and quiet, I recommend the pool closest to the lobby- we spent the majority of our time in the part by the spa. Every single day we were able to get a palapa for shade, regardless of what time we came out-although we are not late risers. Waitress service in this quieter part of the resort is okay, i just ensured i ordered double the drinks I wanted, so they would last!! We took our own inflatables, but could always get hold of a rubber mat if we wanted to use one. It is true that some people like to hog one (two or three) all day, but I would state the obvious- You're not using that are you? Can I take it. They couldn't refuse-it wasn't theirs to keep. The hotel put some new ones in the week we left, so there were more to go around.Restaurants:This is what attracted us to the resort-the unlimited a la carte dining. Most nights, we had to wait for up to 25 minutes for a table-this was never an issue for us, we just had another drink in the nearest bar!!!World Cafe:We only visited this for breakfast, the range of food was excellent.Cereals, breads, omlette/egg bar, smoothie bar, smoked salmon, champagne, bloody marys, fruit, yoghurt, bacon, hash browns, pancakes (mickey mouse shaped on the children's section!) You name it, you can find it here. Margarita (a maitre de-very friendly)El Patio:The Mexican next to world cafe-the bar just inside very nice. They try to create the authentic mexican feel with hats, horse blankets etc! A trio of singers come here most nights, and will sing any song you request. Menu good, portions small but rich so they will satisfy you. Enjoyed the shrimp martini and key lime pie. Sanchez works here at evening time, great guy...HimitsuChinese cuisine very good, but cooked in coconut oil-be careful if you are sensitive!! You may need to be close to a toilet the day after this meal. The rainbow chicken very good, as was the chow mein.The teppanyaki tables very good, they should run 6.30 7.30 9.00, but this varies depending on demand. Get there at least 40 mins before hand to put your name down. There are tables to sit and have a drink at outside, so it isn't a problem. Carlos waits in here, the sweetest person you could wish to meet (check out the skull belt) -salut!! He always asks Are you happy?!Oceana-Seafront restaurant open also for lunch. Lunchtimes they offer a subway style sandwich menu, as well as a dessert bar. Exceptional food. Try the vegetarian spa sub (curried mayo), also liked the salads, the crab/shrimp sub and the philly cheese chicken. Yum!! Carlos also works here by day-as does Sanchez-another superb waiterDinner menu is also very special, the calamari rings very tasty, can also recommend the salmon and the grouper fillet. If you are lucky, there is a waiter who does liquor coffees, setting fire to the alcohol as he pours it. The singing trio visited here too when we were there.Sea Side Grill-next door to the Oceana, saloon style diner. If you are UK based, can compare this to a Harvester Grill-soup to start, then visit the salad bar. The sierra chicken very tasty, the ribs/chicken combo also good. Be careful if you are at a table by the artificial lake-you will be eaten alive by mozzies-we were wearing 90% DEET repellent and were still bitten, glad we took our course of malaria tablets since the malaria outbreak in punta cana in 2004!! Puddings here good, but usually too full from dinner-chocolate moose and gateux nice. They will also try to ply you with liqueurs, liqueur coffees or mamajuana (dominican spirit made from bits of plants- not very palatable!!)Bordeux-Adults only French. Upstairs above oceana. Very elegant setting, airconditioned, windows over ocean (but usually too dark to see!). The menu was impressive-snails, duck salad, scallops and prawns, soups, cheese board, chicken with brie, salmon, pork fillet, choc mousse, white mousse. It is surprisingly quiet in here most nights, I think because it is a mainly family resort and no kids permitted in here.La TrattoriaNot really worthy of a separate review as it is inside the Buffet restaurant. We came here twice for some pizzas, when we were not in the mood for fancy food. The service here was very good, usually it was fairly empty. If you want dessert, you just go to the buffet for self serve. The bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar makes a pleasant light starter here.BarsOur favourite bar was the upstairs bar down at the beach, next to the Bordeux. No-one knew this bar existed, people only went for a drink there if they had to wait for their table. Stunning ocean views.The beach bar is advertised as being open from 10-10, but closes at 5. A disappointment, as this would have been stunning spot for predinner cocktails.Another bar inside oceana restaurant, open from 12. Service here always good.We never visited the swimup bar, as this was usually very rowdy!Barracuda- middle pool bar, I found this bar a challenge to get served. I usually only wanted a bottle of water, but would get ignored by most of the bartenders who preferred to give their attention to the more pushy, assertive guests....Cafe Kafe-our favourite bar, open air, by the spa, from 5pm. The service here was exceptionalUpper lobby bar- I never had a problem getting served here. Why? Because I am a woman. If you are male and not overtly pushy, you will have a bit of a wait. On average, my husband and other male friends of ours had to wait 15-20 minutes. Unfortunately, one bartender in particular was quite obvious about being pervy towards the women...The shows in the theatre were really very good. WE enjoyed the True Love show, and Night of the Stars (impersonating beyonce, usher, etc) The karaoke was predominantly songs for the American guests- so we couldn't enjoy this as much.At the back of the theatre is a jewel in the crown-Rafael, the hotel's characaturist. He did a portrait of my husband and I for $40-it was very realistic. In fact, all of his work was outstanding. He works from 8-10pm, but get there early, we had to wait until 9.15 for our sitting!!We only used room service a few times. It wasn't really necessary because we had such good food at breakfast, lunch and dinner. We were just being lazy!! It was okay, not outstanding, but sufficient. The service good sometimes be slow, taking up to 45 minutes on one occasion.If you are taking your children, they are in for a treat. The explorers club is extremely well run, and has fantastic facilities including the pirate ship, caves, a water slide and night time kids films. There is also a mini club for younger children by the beach.The shops in the hotel were fairly limited, they sold bikinis, bags, some clothing and toiletries, but these were very highly priced. The girls that work in the shop were often too busy chatting on the phone to serve you, and didn't like giving change and one time tried to refuse to give me change for tic tacs which only cost a dollar!! I made her get change from the shop next door....The vendors come in several times a week (no set days), they can be quite persistent, I just told them I didn't speak English on day one and they didn't bother me again.... White lie!!I visited the gym most days whilst at Dreams. This is fairly well equipped for a resort, and is exceptionally clean. The guy that runs the gym always hands you a bottle of water when you start working out, and there are rolled up towels available. Trust me, you will need them- a workout in here is like boot camp. It is airconditioned, but it is a high roof and gets very hot. You have been warned!!All in all, I would say this hotel deserves its star rating, we had a fantastic 21 nights and would return without hesitation. I have never been to a resort and had 100% satisfaction 100% of the time, but this comes as close to that as you would expect. The staff really do put their heart and soul into their job, and nothing is ever too much trouble. We met some fantastic people staying at this resort (Hello Eileen, Uncle Trevor, Alison, Sam, Lisa, Lawrence, Kevin, Megan, Darren and Julie) Everyone we spoke to was very happy with all aspects of the resort -and said they would return...If you have this booked-lucky you!! Maybe I'll see you there one day...

<Content>An OK Experience Our family, two children and two adults went to Dreams with high expectations. We travel frequently, but this was our first All Inclusive Experience. Check-in was perfect - except for the heat- the lobby is a beautiful open air room with no air conditioning. It is hard to understand, but 90% of the time, there was no breeze for the entire 7 days we stayed at the hotel even though the ocean is right there. I walked around with a face cloth to wipe away the sweat for the entire 7 days. We vacation every year at various Caribbean islands and love it. We never expected the heat in the Dominican Republic to be as oppressive as it was. Our room was on the third floor and there were no elevators. The rooms we had were equal to USA 3 star rooms. They were quite small and barley air conditioned. We called the front desk, they came right away to look at the air conditioner, and they made it slightly cooler. We called on the second day to complain again and they came again, right away. They make it slighty better and offered a change of room. By this time it was the third day of our vacation, and the room teperature was just OK. I did not want to repack clothes for 4 people and maybe not get anything better. So we stayed where we were. There never was any air conditioning in the bathroom. It was like a sauna in the bathroom for the entire vacation. I would never go back because of this.The grounds were beautiful and well kept. Palm trees and foliage simular to a rain forest. The pool was a disappointment because it was only 3 feet deep. But it was very refreshing, with plenty of lounge chairs and beach towels. The staff served constant drinks but the specialty drinks were quite sweet. But you could always get beer or vodka, gin or rum and tonic, no problem. They served as many drinks as you wanted.Our children are 9 and 11 and they enjoyed the Kids Club on a daily basis. The resort supplied a cell phone so they could call us if necessary. There were a lot of kids at the resort.The food was not that great. It was second rate food. The World Cafe had a daily buffett with a wide selection for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I guess you could always find something to eat there. However, we do not like to go away and eat at a buffett. My kids did not like the food at all. They love pancakes at home but would not eat them at Dreams. They said they were terrible. My kids survived on pizza most nights. We would have an omlet in the moring with fresh fruit, skip lunch and go to a restaurant for dinner. We had no problem getting into any of the restaurants, sometimes with a minimum wait. But the food was not that great. The Chinese resturant was equal to us calling for take out at home in the USA and not as good. In the Mexican Resturant, the food was room temperature, just OK and caused us to get sick during the night. The best place to eat was the Oceana Resturant. The food was slightly above average. I would never return to Dreams because we became ill from the food. My kids had the runs with stomach pains for one day and I had the same problems on two ocasions. I spent the last day of my vacation in my room, not feeling well. I have been home since yesterday and I am still running to the bathroom. The best thing I can say about Dreams is that the staff was wonderful. They were very pleasant, and accomodating. They were excellent. Anything that they could do for you, they would. If you wanted room service they would bring it right away. One day we did not have towels in our room, I called the front desk and very quickly, they were delivered to the room. The front desk even called back to make sure we had received them. I have never had better service anywhere. The staff was always there to serve you. They acted like they could not wait to serve you.My husband used the spa for a massage and he said that was very nice and he had a great massage. The beach was a great dissapointment. We are used to the beaches of other Caribbean islands and this beach did not measure up. The water was like the Jersey Shore, you could not see the bottom and was not the crystal clear water of other islands. It had large rocks in the water and you could not walk in the water. I went in the water once for only a few minutes. I usually spend most of my time on the beach when we go on vacation. Not in the Dominican Republic.

<Content>Great time @ Dreams-The staff makes it happen We just got back, 鈥淕ustav鈥?missed us, rained on and off a few days, but really didn鈥檛 affect stay. Took JFK out of NY and used 鈥淎vistar鈥?for parking-had car ready to roll when we got back-would use again. Upon arrival at PUJ you get your picture taken[which we bought on return-nice souvenir] turn over your tourism sheets, which they give you on the airline walk about 30 feet, turn them in and pay fee-$10.each. Walk another 15 feet go through customs and fetch your luggage to the next room to the left. After this hang a right to another area if taking a tour bus. We used Prieto鈥? which we would use again. Big A/C bus located in rear left side of main lot. Just remember your return flight, they need at desk. They give you a receipt, you have to see the representative at the resort, usually next day in AM to schedule return pickup. [next to World Caf茅]. Luggage handlers at airport are a simple 鈥渘o gracias鈥?if you want to take your own luggage, on return didn鈥檛 have a choice-they had our luggage before we could get off the bus-but no big deal. Bus ride about an hour to resort, upon arrival checking was a breeze, they ask if you want an upgrade, but we use our room to sleep, didn鈥檛 see the need. We got champagne and wet towels, the waitress went back and also got my son a 鈥渧irgin鈥?drink. You check out your room, make sure you鈥檙e satisfied and your luggage is delivered to the room. Upon leaving last day call to have it brought back to lobby. Room was fine, A/C could have been a little cooler, but it was fine. Had to move our room, but that was due to drunk, obnoxious, loud guest next door. Which was no problem, see concierge for anything you need or request. [Across from front desk on lobby floor.] The staff is what makes this place-from management to the maid-accommodating and super friendly. Please tip, they deserve it and when you get the eye opener bus ride from the airport, you can see that every dollar goes far. Extra thanks to the entertainment staff-50cent, Meikos, Mickey Mouse, DR Madonna-ect.-they make this place-and work their butts off all day long then put on a show at night also. 10 stars for you. Get involved in programs on the 鈥淪undial鈥?schedule. Met some great people from all over the world and had a blast. You get 鈥淢onopoly Money鈥?for usually just playing ,which you can use certain nights for auction items. A couple of nights a week, they have outside vendors-usually sucker you in right away by giving your kids something free, don鈥檛 pay full price they ask, usually a quarter of total will do for an item. The Cubano鈥檚 in lobby were real deal-so smoke away before coming home. The pool was huge, had no problem getting a lounge everyday, even in lower pool area. Played water polo everyday-twice, still hurting, but great fun. My son was in the water from 9-dinner, 12 year old and played games with adults or plenty to do in 鈥淐ore Zone鈥?for teens. Ocean had plenty of lounges-only fault here-was plenty of rocks directly out, go to left by turtle trampoline-much smoother, and water was too cloudy from waves for snorkeling. As far as food, it was great, restaurants were all good, Himatsu-fun, but get there early, only a few Japanese tables. Seaside Grill-great menu and World Caf茅 for breakfast. Only had one day of stomach problems-not their fault, but due to muccho cervasa syndrome. At night make sure you spray on the 鈥淥ff鈥?big time-the mosquitos are pretty ravenous after dusk. Drank restaurant water-w/ no problems. We took Pepto tablets every morning as a precaution and used the bottled water in room fridge for brushing teeth-ect.Went on one excursion-鈥淏avaro Runners鈥? speedboat/snorkeling trip-was OK, but would pass on next time-too much time taking your picture and not enough snorkel time. Better time had at resort.When leaving they give you tourist sheets again at the airport-fill out, but no fee for US travelers-they stamp and take when checking your passport, They check all luggage, and the first thing they ask is if you have any mamajama鈥?drink- it can鈥檛 be brought out.-When scheduling return-our flight was about 4 hours after p/u at resort, which we had only about an hour to grab a bite to eat before getting on the plane. Only reason didn鈥檛 give 5 stars was ocean-[rocks] and trip from airport-[ over an hour]-which I didn鈥檛 think the roads were any worse/rough then driving through a road in Queens or Brooklyn, their building a new coastal 鈥渉ighway鈥? but your on 鈥淚sland Time鈥?and don鈥檛 see that being completed anytime soon. The price was right, probably half of what we would have paid at better known Caribbean all-inclusives. And the people from the DR were so accommodating and friendly.

<Content>The Place to be Dreams is the place to be. This was my 5th time and in 3 weeks I'll take 60 repeat guests again. This place has alot for everyone. The children program is excellent. They have added Wii , X-Box, batting cage and the soon to be completed rock climbing wall. The Preferred Club now offers a private area on the beach with big beds, free internet and a more personal guest service. The sit down service at the Oceana for lunch now offers an assorted variety of sandwiches, which is a nice change. Most of the dinner menus have been upgraded, with different choices. The drinks also have been upgraded. A few added bottles of different liquor's. Bud, Bud Light, Miller Genuine Draft and Heineken bottles also were added. The employee's are still as friendly as ever and are waiting for you to return. Dreams is a great place that everyone should try at least once. To those who have complained or like complaining, please remember where you are. They try to address any and all problems that might come up. Not everything where you live is prefect either.

<Content>Just OK - and you better like children My husband and I went here for our honeymoon. We are all inclusive newbees having only stayed at one other one previously (Iberostar Del Mar in Cancun - good). We knew going in that all inclusives are not meccas for gourmet food and at Dreams we got what we expected. Food was OK - VERY SALTY.Apparently the hotel has a policy that men must wear long pants (no jeans) and shoes (no sandles) in the restaurants. THIS IS NOT ENFORCED. One of the reasons we chose this place was b/c of the policy - a little more sophistication... At every restaurant we ate we were surrounded by men in wife beaters and jean shorts, swim trunks, bermudas, etc. Very unappealing.In general we felt that the place looked.... old. Like it hasn't been updated or renovated in 20 years. The grounds were lovely but the buildings and rooms seemed VERY dated.We stayed in a honeymoon suite in the building closest to the beach. Our room was acceptable but the ceiling in the bathroom was made out of slatted plastic? - i presume to have easy access to the roof (we were on the third floor). We were there during Tropical Storm Fay and during the day on Friday the ceiling did drip a bit in the bathroom but stopped by that evening. We are pretty tolerant people so we didn't ask to switch rooms (which we had to do earlier in the week at the hotel we stayed in in Santo Domingo - review to be posted shortly).In addition there were little tiny ants that would appear on and around the sink area - i think they were coming up from the drain so we sprayed shaving gel in the sink to cover the drain and we didn't see any after that.The beach was OK - they really could have used more staff to clean up used drink cups and water bottles. - this goes for the pool area too.Pool was nice and big but for such a big pool they only had one swim-up pool bar and one of the ends. If you wanted to get a chair under an umbrella or thatched umbrella you need to get there SUPER early - like 9 am. The resort has some sort of policy that prohibits staking out chairs but it definately wasn't enforced. We were really frustrated to see towels on chairs and no one in sight - at 9:30 in the morning!And last but not least - THIS PLACE WAS OVERRUN with families with children. Seriously - i thought we were in Romper Room or something. The whole Explorers Club deal should have alerted us to this fact.... kids everywhere.... especially the pool. Don't expect to have a quiet sit by the pool at any time of day.So... to sum up - we were disappointed and will not return.

<Content>Had an excellent vacation I found a detailed review on TripAdvisor before I wen to Dream Punta Cana with my girlfriend and I found it very helpful. In that spirit I'd like to rate the good and bad aspects of Dreams Punta Cana.First, the bad news - The drive from the airport to the hotel - The airport is nowhere near many of the resorts in Punta Cana. While it is clear that the government is making a major investment in the tourism infrastructure in the Punta Cana area (they are clearly working to expand the road that goes into the airport, the airport itself looks to be brand new and has a new air-conditioned international departure lounge complete with several western food options and an extensive duty free store), the roads are still fairly rough. Some reviews have suggested that you need motion sickness medication before going on the roads, this is simply untrue. There are some large potholes that need to be repaired and our driver did have to swerve to miss the potholes many times, but it is no different than any other developing country. Treat as part of the adventure and have some respect for where you are and this trip won't really phase you.The drive to Saona Island/Isla Saona - One of the popular excursions offered at the hotel and on Expedia is the Saona Island trip. The island itself and the natural pool are absolutely beautiful for both ecotourists and people who want to relax on a different beach. The drive from Punta Cana to Hayaribe when you walk through a disorganized marina to get on a speed boat takes a long time - I'd say at least 1.5 to 2 hours. You'll also have to transfer from a smaller bus to a larger bus at the Tobacco Museum. The trip has some interesting sights such as a Basilica in Higuey, but its mostly open fields. I heard other people at the resort talking about how much they enjoyed the trip, but as the only native English speakers on our bus, we often didn't get a detailed translation explaining what we were seeing. However, the beaches were awesome and we got to hold a starfish which was really cool.The sun - This can be good and bad. You will get a tan for sure, but be careful - the sun in Punta Cana is very hot. I used 70 and 50 SPF lotion and parts of my scalp still got burned and pealed. I recommend packing some good after sun lotion for the trip.Pina Coladas - Don't get me wrong these are great drinks and bar staff makes some really good Pina Coladas. However, when made right a pina colada has a natural laxative in it that could spoil your evening if you have too many of them in the afternoon.breakfast in the World Cafe - The food at the world cafe is very good especially when you consider the number of people that they are cooking for. However, we stayed only a week and the options didn't really seem to change - so I found myself eating similar things each morning. A word of advice - the kids food bar has a lot of adults at it, the reason for this is that the kids buffet consistently has the best sausages and is the only place that you can find hashbrowns for breakfast. The crepes were also very good. A good way to vary the breakfast options is to get a custom omelet or a custom shake, but the lines for these options can be long at times.The good stuff --The pool! - It really is the best pool in the Caribbean. Its free-formed and runs nearly the entire length of the resort. While it may look like a lazy-river in the resort pictures, it has no current. The pool bar staff is very nice and they have an extensive cocktail menu at both the swim-up bar and the normal bar. I recommend the Dreams cocktail. My girlfriend liked the Bahama Mamas they made there. The resort tells you not to reserve chairs early, but we noticed that most pool side chairs are reserved by 10am - this is a good reason to consider booking a swim-up room. Also, the pool rafts provided by the hotel are a valued commodity. However, many guests in the hotel are nice and will offer them to you when they are getting out of the pool.The beach - Its beautiful and there is some very clear water if you walk to the left. Some comments mentioned that there is coral near the beach - I didn't wade out too far, but I didn't feel any coral near my feet. Be sure to watch the flags at the beach - a black or red flag means that there is a dangerous rip tide - this didn't happen when we were at Dreams, but its something to be aware of. To balance the beach and the pool we tried to go out early and reserve a seat at the back of the beach that was also near the pool. That way we had the best of both worlds. The same thing goes for beach recliners as for the beach - try to reserve them before 10am.The entertainment staff - The entertainers, like the other staff at the hotel, are fun, humble, and very hard working. They have a very detailed entertainment schedule for adults, kids, and teens that arrives every day in your room. You have a lot of options and the staff tries to get people involved and has lots of great prizes, but if you just want a quiet weekend, they'll leave you alone.No bracelets! - A lot of other resorts make you wear bracelets to get drinks and all inclusive services - after a while you get a bracelet tan and it can be weird to shower with it on. Dreams doesn't do the bracelet thing, which was refreshing. It made us feel like we were at a normal hotel and not an all inclusive.No reservations! - Another big difference between Dreams and other all inclusive resorts. You don't have to stand in line or take a number earlier in the morning to get to eat at a restaurant at the resort. I really enjoyed this aspect of the trip.The restaurants - The restaurants at Dreams are excellent. Especially Bordeaux, the French restaurant. The wait staff there are excellent and the food is amazing for an all inclusive. Its truly a credit to the resort to have a place like that associated with it. The busy time at the restaurants seems to be around 8pm. We usually went earlier than that, but I never heard anyone complain about a long-wait. Stuff we didn't try -Just to let you know the limitations of this review, we didn't go into the casino or the disco. We also only went on the Saona Island excursion.Other odds and ends -There's a good selection of fake handbags and fake sunglasses available in one of the stores in the lower lobby.Everything is negotiable - we were offered a room upgrade when we came to the resort and were able to get a 25% discount on a suite with a jacuzzi - we took the offer and it was one of the best decisions we could have made.When we showed up, even though we reserved a regular deluxe room, we were given a swim up room - it was a nice unexpected touch, even though we upgraded our room.

<Content>Dreams Punta Cana - what a wonderful holiday! We returned on 18/8 after a wonderful 2 week stay at Dreams. We booked our stay through Jetset2 which saved us a good 拢1000+ on the trip price quoted elsewhere. We flew with Thomsonfly, and were transferred by VIP tours (who also provided our English speaking rep - Sharron). The trip organisation was excellent - it was as good as we would expect had we booked it wholly through Thomson.We were aware from other reviews on Tripadvisor that the journey from the airport was a bit rough - and yes it was. Our transfer was in an airconditioned minibus with only 2 other travellers in, but this couldn't hide the fact that the roads are pretty bad - but this is the carribean! Having said that, our driver was obviously used to them and we didn't feel too uneasy - just a bit jostled!We arrived at Dreams and entered another world, we got the champagne and fruit juice on arrival and we were checked in smoothly. They did offer us an upgrade to a honeymoon suite, at half their usual price, but we kept with our deluxe sea view room.The bellboy delivered our cases quickly and demo'd the safe and provided any other info we cared to request.Our room was lovely - it consisted of 2 double beds and whilst it was a touch on the small side was comfortable for our 2 adults  2 children!We had our first dinner at the World Cafe (buffet) - and the staff there made us extremely welcome and this set the scene for the remainder of our stay.The staff who work there are friendly, beautiful people who all try to make your stay enjoyable. This was our first time all inclusive, and we were concerned about the standard of the food. We needn't have worried - there was an amazing amount of food on offer every day in the World Cafe, always something for everyone.We tried all the restaurants (except the adult only Bordeaux- the menu looked divine though!) and enjoyed them all. Probably the only one we weren't so keen on was the Italian. It was 'within' the World Cafe, so you could get up and have something from the buffet if you liked, but we found the menu disappointingly small, and the food not what we expected from a 'Carribean Italian'! It also felt like having your meal at the buffet restaurant rather than in a separate eaterie. We loved the Seaside Grill, Oceana and the the Chineese. We didn't have a wait longer than 15 mins at any of the restaurants, and you were given a bleeper, so you could go and have a drink at a nearby bar whilst you waited. We loved the pool, the beach was good, but we found it a bit hot and the children preferred to be able to be in and out of the pool all day. We loved the entertainment team, who worked soooo hard, the shows were good, and the poolside mini games were a good diversion from the pool. We took quite a few floats with us to keep the kids entertained, but we did get hold of floats most days for a time. Our son got an ear infection (there seemed to be quite a few children with ear problems), but the doctor spoke great English and he was treated quickly and efficiently (a learning curve for us - because the children were in the pool such a lot, we would next time encourage them to wear earplugs!)We enjoyed it so much we could go on  on.........but.........our main tips would be; take plenty of suncream we got thru 10 bottles in 2 weeks(!) Take any medication you might need! Take inflatables/pool toys for the kids! Take $1 bills for tips! Go and bartar at the small shops 5 mins out of the resort gates!

<Content>Lovely hotel !! Dreams Punta Cana:I have just returned from a two week family holiday to Dreams Hotel Punta Cana and had a great time, before I went i read alot of bad reviews about Dreams. I did get worried but i can confirm that these bad reviews were not true facts. I will go into each section of my review seperate to give a clearer review.Hotel Overall: Great for Families, Kids, Couples. Everybody is welcome at dreams!Rooms: The rooms are not that big but they are clean and kept clean and tidy throughout. There is a large shower  bath in each room which is supplied with fresh towels twice a day. Each room has a hairdryer which is really powerful and also an iron with an ironing board.Swimming Pool:Dreams has one of the biggest swimming pools i have ever seen, this is always clean and plently of room for everybody. The swimming pool has a number of floats in which are the hotels and available for everyone, if you spot a float in the pool just jump aboard. The swim-up bar is good and has some nice seats in the water which are in the shade. The service is prompt and the workers are always polite. This bar opens 10am -6pm. Towels are provided for around the pool and the beach, you collect a towel per person from the towel hut which is located in the middle pool area. When you check in you are given a towel card per person you need to keep hold of this card in order to get your towels. There is always plenty of sunbeds available at the pool and the beach, people aren't allowed to place towels on beds before 8am.Kids Club:None of my family went to the kids club, we had a 9 year old with us but he wanted to do the teenagers activities. I did see the kids club and it looked great pity i was an adult they looked like they had a great pirate boat and slide which went into a pool which was located in the kids club. There was another place where the kids club was held this was nearer the beach. We did see the kids doing games etc with the kids club staff. They always looked well organised and great fun. The staff held a kids disco and games of an evening before the main show so if the adults wanted to go off and have dinner alone they could.Beach:The beach was nice, it was the only place with a breeze which i enjoyed. Staff come around the beach and the pool asking what drinks you would like and there is a BBQ held on the beach daily so you dont even have to move off to get lunch. The sea is controlled by a flag system, There are some watersports on the beach which are not included in the hotel price. There are some rocks in the ocean which you need to be careful of but there are some nice spots for swimming. A few people hired some snorkelling equipment as there is a reef near by. There are some nice comfy beds on the beach too which are nearly always free suprised me as to why as they are lovely.Daily Entertainment:This was great, you can either join in everything, pick a few things or just sit and watch the day go by. The staff are great, very friendly and try to get to know everyone which makes you feel relaxed. We got told that the staff got paid $50 a month so if you can treat them it would be appreciated. There is plently for everyone to do for all ages. There is a newsletter which is handed out each evening when fresh towels are given which tells you the activities for the next day, this also tells you what times the bars and restuarants open and the evening entertainment. It also has the weather forcast for the next day which is good to know.Night Entertainment:This is held in the main theatre, shows are above average for hotel entertainment, if you get a chance watch the night of the stars show and the magic show, karoke can also be fun to watch. The shows are casted by the entertainment staff so these people work long days for little money so your support is always good.Hotel Facilities:Gym,Spa,DVD rental free of charge(DVD players in each room),1 small supermarket,1 carribean shop which sells gifts and all sorts,1 clothes shop which sells good fakes of gucci etc and a diamond shop so fella's take your plastic! There is a disco which is strictly over 18's and they do ask for ID. Every evening there is a movie shown on the big screen out in the plaza and also there is a market which comes in every other evening, you need to barter with these people!!Food:There is the main buffet which is brilliant, lots to choose from and the quality was always high standard. If you tip them 1$ you will be well looked after!! There are the a la carte resturants also which are Italian, Mexican, French (adults only), Japanese Seafood. You may need to wear long trousers in some of the resturants but you do NOT need to in the main buffet. The a la carte resturants serve small portions so make sure you order a starter. The food was wonderful at dreams and i could not fault it one bit.The grounds of the hotel are always clean and tidy and the hotel was a lovely place to visit, prompt check in and check out and drinks provided on check in. The journey from the airport is about 1 hour and is quite bumpy but once you get to the hotel you forget all about that.Excursions: We went on the Siona Island tour and if you get to do this I would strongly recommend. It's a lovely place, you go to a village and an art school then you get on a speed boat and travel from the river where lots of films are set and travel into the mouth of the carribean sea, you then stop off and get in the sea where you see real starfish and get to hold them, you then spend a couple of hours on Siona Island beach where you have lunch, its a great day out. We also did the Ocean World tour, Ocean world is in Puerto plata which is the other side of the island to Punta Cana, you have to travel by air to get to Ocean World, it is alot of travelling to get to and from but the experience with the dolphins and sea lions was great, i wasn't brave enough to do the shark encounter so cannot say what that was like. You can check out the Ocean World website for more info just search on google.If you need anymore info about this hotel then please just contact me. Hope you choose Dreams and have a great stay!!!!

<Content>Loved the Dreams Punta Cana Well, we are winding up our trip to Dreams and all I can say is that it is a dream. I read all the reviews before we came and I must admit I was more than a little concerned that I had made a mistake in booking this holiday. Yes the roads are a little bumpy on the ride from the airport to the hotel, but you are dealing with a third world country so to expect what we have in the western world is unrealistic. Sure it was bouncy but that was part of the fun. From the moment we pulled in through the gates of the property we were treated with nothing but respect. Remember treat others how you would be expected to be treated. We have no complaints with the excpetion that the ice machines on the the second floors of the buildings seemed to run out of ice very quickly. Martinez in the World Cafe was excellent as was Manuel in the Italian restaurant. Jonothan at the bar in the Plaza Santa Domingo was great as well,. Just remember to bring along some small american bills so you can tip. You do get better service if you tip the waiters and waitresses, but they work hard for you. The pool is great. The Ocean is excellent and make sure you head off to the left of the water trampoline for a sandy beach (in the water) so you don't have to worry about the rocks or coral. We had fun doing the horseback riding, Manuel was great and took good care of us. We were travelling as a family. Myself, my husband, 16 year old daughter and 12 year old daughter. They cant wait to come back and I am sure we will because we had such a wonderful experience. When you read the reviews take everything with a grain of salt. Your level of disappointment is contingent on what you expect and where you have been in the past. My family and I have travelled the world, literally, and we were totally pleased with this resort. I am sure you will be too. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions at all and I will try and help. A couple of dollars and a good attitude will go a long way. Excellent place - well recommended. Cindy

<Content>"A Little Piece of Paradise" We just got back from our 10 year anniversary celebration at Dreams, Punta Cana.We were a little concerned about the negative reviews, but this is truly a hidden paradise.Our room was lovely, and we could have upgraded for decent price, but chose not to. Our room was in section 1, and our balcony overlooked the pool and palm trees. Section 1 is closest to the beach, and farthest from the Main Lobby. We liked that though because that meant we got a lot of exercise.We enjoyed the food-we are vegetarians, and there were plenty of options. Try the Mahi Mahi in the Chinese restaurant. It's the best! The resort also makes the best mudslides ever!We only drank bottled water, and did not eat fruit that did not have a peel. I have a very sensitive stomach, and I was completely fine.My husband enjoyed endless hours of pool and beach volleyball while I relaxed in the pool or under a small hut.There is this incredible tranquility in the resort, and we were more relaxed at Dreams than we have ever been.There are vendors who come to the resort 3 times a week. They told us that they leave at 8 pm, but they stay until 10 pm. You have to bargain with them, but some have really neautiful offerings.If you don't LOVE this place, you will not love any place.A big thank you goes to Nikki at the Concierge for being the absolute sweetest, and for taking such good care of us.

<Content>Put Your Hands in the Air For Dreams!! We stayed at Dreams for 2 weeks at the beginning of August. Our group consisted of 2 families with 4 children, two 14 year olds and two 12 year olds.We landed at the beautiful Punta Cana airport and passed through customs very quickly. We had a mini bus transfer to the resort, and although it was bumpy in places, if you have ever driven in a taxi in Greece, it is a breeze.We arrived to a warm welcome from the reception staff and were allocated our rooms very quickly. I had emailed the chief concierge to say hello and let her know when we were coming beforehand and she came out to say hi to us. She encouraged us to come back and see her should we have any problems. We didn't!THE ROOMSWe had booked 2 deluxe family suites and requested that if possible could they please be together. Luckily they were. We were in Block 4 on the third floor. Each suite consisted of a deluxe kingsize bedded room interconnecting with a deluxe double bedroom. All the rooms were garden facing and over the top of the palm trees we could see the beach beyond. Gorgeous! All the bedrooms had a bathroom, stocked fridge, balcony and they looked just like the pictures on the website. The air conditioning worked brilliantly and kept us cool day and night. We were all delighted with them. We did not find them small. Perhaps if there were more than 2 adults and a child in each room it would have been a bit crowded.THE POOLThe pool is the jewel in the crown of this resort. We all loved it. Being only about a metre deep throughout, we found it very safe for the children to play in alone. We based ourselves at the wedding gazebo end of the pool where it was quieter.There were free sunbeds up this end all day. Guests did not really reserve beds and we saw security remove items if they were placed on beds unattended before 8am. We were lucky enough to be able to use one of the cabana beds for most of our fortnight!The ice berg was fantastic fun for the children to play on. I would however ensure you keep a watchful eye on your children, as it got a bit racous at times, with children falling on one another and the actual ice berg tipping over.Throughout the day we ventured down to the beach end of the pool where there was always some activity going on for one of us to join in.We only had one incident at the pool. One night a drunken idiot left a broken glass in the pool, which fortunately we found. We then spent a lot of the morning ensuring there was no more glass in the pool with the pool staff. Not the resorts fault, but aren't some people dumb?THE BEACHWe thought the beach looked like a picture postcard. White sand lined with palm trees and an aqua blue sea. Whilst we were there the sea was calm and clear. We used to walk down the beach to the right towards the Colony Bay hotel for the kids to jump the waves. It was rougher down there.We snorkeled in the sea around the trampoline. To the right of it was wonderful coral and we saw lots of colourful angel fish.The children had a windsurfing lesson. It cost $30 dollars and meant they could then take out the windsurfs when they wanted after that. Waterskiing was $30 for half an hour and we took out kayaks for free. All great value we thought, particularly compared to what you can pay in Europe.We wore water shoes in the sea if we were not around the trampoline. On the one occasion we didn't, in the sea directly front of the resort ,my friend cut her foot. Our fault as we had been warned!There were always plenty of sunbeds free on the beach at anytime.THE RESTAURANTSAll 8 of us ate anything and everything at the restaurants throughout the resort. None of us were ill. The choice of restaurant was fantastic, we had difficulty some nights deciding where to eat!! Even though we were a party of 8 we never had to wait long to get a table together.EL PATIOThis restaurant had a great atmosphere. The singing trio were great fun and had all the customers singing and clapping. The food was okay. We particularly enjoyed the beef fajitas and the key lime pie. As everywhere the staff went out of their way to make sure you had an enjoyable evening.THE ITALIANThis is part of the buffet restaurant. This meant that should anyone not want something on the italian menu they could get food from the buffet. The children loved the Italian. The pizzas were excellent and we also enjoyed the parmesan chicken. The waiter service was particularly good here.THE WORLD CAF脡 BUFFETThe food offered at the buffet is very extensive with something to suit everyone. The standard is very good and the waiting staff are very attentive. We LOVED the breakfasts. I have never had better 鈥?particularly the freshly made smoothies. Lunch and dinner were good too with lots of choice. The children liked going to the buffet for dinner as the service was quick and they could then rush off to see the evening entertainment.THE SEASIDE GRILLWE ate here a couple of times for dinner. Lovely location down by the beach. The food was good. Delicious burgers, ribs and cheesecake.HIMITSUWe loved both the Chinese and Japanese! The Chinese had a great atmosphere and the food was very good. The thai spring rolls were the best I have eaten anywhere. It had a very upmarket feel.We visited the Japanese for my husband鈥檚 birthday and what a fuss they made of us. My friend had had a quiet word with Mary, the hostess, a couple of days before and she reserved us a table at 9pm on the night. Thank you Mary! We had such fun. Whilst the chef was cooking in front of us, he involved us all. My husband was dressed up as a chef and the children took turns tossing eggs in the air, catching food tossed at them in their mouths and taking part in the actual cooking. Carlos our waiter was outstanding as was the chef.At the end of the evening the staff brought out a huge delicious chocolate birthday cake and sang happy birthday to my husband. Wonderful!! A night to remember!BORDEAUXThe most delicious food set in classy surroundings. We could not fault a thing. The Salmon was outstanding and we had the most amazing cheese board. First class!I think the restaurant is a bit of a hidden gem. When we spoke to a few people they did not know where it was, nor the fabulous patio bar outside which we enjoyed visiting with the children. It had stunning views on to the beach. Don鈥檛 miss out 鈥?it is up the stairs inside Oceana.OCEANAMy personal favourite, if just for the panoramic views and the staff. We mostly ate our lunches here, although never tried it for dinner. They had a great lunch selection with waiter service, offering salads, subs and burgers. All delicious! Thank you Margarita, Carlos, Juan and Sanchez. You all really made our stay. Margarita, who also worked at the world caf茅, always ensured we had a table for 8 at lunch and arranged a special celebration for my husbands birthday. Thank you!THE STAFFAs others have all said, the staff make the resort. They are always happy and smiling and go that extra mile to ensure you get exactly what you need. Never once did we encounter a grumpy staff member and if anything, we were nearly embarrassed at how they would go out of their way to help. We have never come across such high quality staff.THE ENTERTAINMENT TEAMThe entertainment staff, particularly, made our children鈥檚 holiday. They had so many activities running all day plus the evening shows. They were very encouraging to get you to join in, but never made you feel pressurized if you did not want to. We really enjoyed the Olympic games they were running whilst there and my daughter and friend are still doing the club dance to the CDs we got from them! The evening shows were of a good standard and the whole family enjoyed them.THE CORE ZONEThis is a fantastic facility for teenagers 鈥?and their mums and dads too! Out of the sun the kids played archery, shooting, bull riding, billiards, ping pong, air hockey, chess and Wii. They also had basketball and tennis up there. It was great to get the children out of the midday sun and they loved going there after the evening shows to meet their new friends. In the evenings some of the entertainment staff were at the Core Zone after the shows, so we felt safe leaving the kids there whilst we popped for a drink elsewhere.All 8 of us really did have the most amazing holiday at Dreams. And we would love to go back next year. Thank you to everyone from the Trip Advisor who wrote reviews and gave tips. However I am still wondering if we were at the same resort as those who wrote negative reviews!

<Content>Best Vacation Yet For a Great Price After reading some bad reviews on Tripadvisor and other travel websites, my husband(36), son (13)and I (37) thought that we had made a big mistake choosing Dreams Punta Cana. However, after spending 8 days at the resort, we are happy to say that this was probably our best vacation yet. All through the week, we kept questioning why people gave the hotel bad reviews. I think that those people expect Dreams to be 5 star luxury hotel with 5 star resaurants - you're not going to get that unless you pay the price to stay at a hotel like that. The Dominican workers do everything to try to make your trip feel as if you are at a 5 star resort. Their service is wonderful. There are activities all day for adults, teenagers, and children to enjoy. Mosquitoes - were not a problem. The only time it would be a problem is if rainfall is expected. We were fortunate because it did not rain at all. I recommend that you bring bug spray just in case.Ants - were not a problem in the rooms. There will be little red ants on your balcony so make sure that you try to keep the sliding doors closed as much as possible.Food - not bad at all. The World Cafe is probably the best choice to eat b/c of the many choices (and I am not a buffet type of person at all) and on different nights there are different themes. The service at all of the restaurants is outstanding.Beach- very nice, plenty of tables and lounge chairs. Our only disappoinment was the ocean floor-bring water shoes if possible. Looking at the ocean - stay to your left on the same side as the turtle trampoline - this is where you will have no problem and probably would not require water shoes.Room - loved the room. Air conditioning was ok - keep in mind that you are staying in a tropical region so don't expect optimal air-conditioning. Housekeeping was wonderful.Our experience at Dreams Punta Cana resort was wonderful, and we would definitely recommend this resort to anyone that wants an all-inclusive vacation for a great value.

<Content>Really liked the Dreams After an 8 day stay, we recommend the Dreams for a family vacation but there are some things that are noteworthy. Overall the experience was average and did not totally meet our expectations of a 5 star resort. Our rooms needed to be changed since the original rooms were very dated and the beds felt like boards. The staff was nevertheless very accomodating and was very good about changing our rooms. The rooms size is also quite tight. The meals/food were okey but not over the top. The only exception was the Oceana restaurant with our favorite all time employee being this restaurant's main server, Winston. Winston was our first experience with the staff and was immediately welcoming and accomodating making our eating experience so wonderful that we ate at Ocean's over 5 times during our stay.The beach was extremely rocky due to the coral which meant we were not able to swim there without foot injury.Finally the air conditioning is very limited throughout the resort with none available in the lobby and very weak in the restaurants and rooms.The drinks, cleanliness of the resort, and staff friendliness made up for any inconveniences.

<Content>A good time was had by all! Your vacation at Dreams Punt a Cana can be as relaxing or as busy as you like. The entertainment staff works day and night to entertain those that like organized activities centered around the pool or beach. We particularly enjoyed the Karoake night and Impersonation show.....the dancing was great and non-stop. We spent every day enjoying the pool and beach and the swim-up bar. The BEST bartender at the resort at the Manatee swim-up bar is WILFREDO. We tipped him every day and our drinks were ready before we even reached the bar. He would see us walking or swimming over and he would be making our order. He makes the best bloody mary's, rum punches, or drink of the day. The resort would do well to allow him to teach the other bartenders how to make a tasty drink. The resort was extremely clean .....grounds and rooms were both exceptionally maintained. The pool area can get filled with empty drink cups but the staff is walking around continuously picking up glasses and cleaning. When we read the posts on Trip Advisor, we started to worry about the quality of food at the resort. I can assure you there is enough of a variety of food and restaurants that you will always find something to your liking. We stuck to the World Buffet for breakfast and lunch simply because of the WIDE variety of choices. We enjoyed the tenderloin at the Seaside Grill (order two, they are not 10 oz. steaks), the Mexican restaurant and Japanese hibachi. The buffet had good pork cutlets, chicken fajitas and beef that was being freshly sliced. We did stay away from all cold salads due to many who said they did not feel well. Stick to bottled water as well. We had a standard room but after a water leak from the room above, the hotel manager upgraded us to a Honeymoon Suite that was really great. No problems with the air conditioning or other things that some guests mentioned. I can assure you that if there is a problem, call the manager and they will fix it one way or the other. I tried the spa one day and really enjoyed it although I would urge that you ask about treatments in detail. I thought I was getting a facial and massage and I got a wrap and massage. No matter, it was enjoyable and I loved the hydrotherapy area that you can use before your treatment. Our group's (there were 6 of us) only complaints was that there seemed to be only 10 snorkels for the entire resort. Also the ocean trampoline is in dire need of springs and repair. Why these items are not maintained and upgraded constantly was disappointing. We did not travel outside the resort. Many complained about the drive from the airport to the resort but it was fine.....you have to expect some rough patches of road when you are on an island. The island has a relatively low standard of living so we did tip the resort workers daily. Bartenders, maids, wait staff, etc.......these people are supporting families and are very friendly and willing to do anything to make your vacation enjoyable. It is really easy to have a GREAT time at Dreams...if you don't, you have no one to blame but yourself!

<Content>Wow! What a fantastic holiday!!! Yes, the roads to the resort are not the best (!?) Having said that, you really do get a true picture of how the people live - families sitting by the roadside selling their wares from corrugated iron shacks. My children were humbled and realised what a good life they have.The welcome at the resort was fantastic (champagne and fruit cocktails) and we were made to feel welcome. Cases were taken to our rooms by very polite and happy staff (who all look like rangers in their uniform!!!). Rooms were a little small but nice and clean but lets face it, how much time do you wana spend in it? The resort in itself was beautiful and just how it looks on the website. We loved the fact that we could choose where to eat as this kept everyone happy (kids didnt want to eat the same as us adults) and in our opinion the food was a very good standard (never been anywhere that you could have smoked salmon and champagne for breakfast!) and I thouroughly recommend Oceana for the meat and seafood main dish as the steak was melt in the mouth. Some people said that the portions were small but hey, ask for more if you are still hungry! Personally I found it quite adequate and all resturants do 3 courses. The staff everywhere were so helpful and happy, I did wonder if they were all on the wacky baccy! They were so eager to do anything to enhance our stay which went a long way. Of course they rely on tips ( the pay is meagre) but in no way do you feel pressured as they still treat you fantastic if you forget. It is very secluded with only a few shops in the hotel and if you fancy a short walk outside there are some souvenir shops - my husband and I ventured out. We walked out of the gates and strolled along taking in the sights when all of a sudden we were aware of a guy in uniform from the hotel by the side of us on a pushbike, he rode by our side with a rather large baseball bat!!! He waited while we looked in the shops, then rode next to us on the way back. This did not make us feel intimidated at all as it is just a precaution, this is a very poor country and they so need our tourism to survive.There are trips to go on but we were told by our rep to book them with her as they are fully insured and legislated. As for the cost of the trips, we were amazed at how resonably priced they were. If you havent lost the will to live, read on.......Ocean world is a long way (short flight) as it is in Puerto Plata but well worth the journey. My two children (9  14), my husband and I swam with dolphins and sharks which was a wonderfull experience. The park itself was clean and well set out with staff that really were passionate about the welfare of the mammals which impressed us as we are animal lovers. We bought lots of photos and a dvd as again, the prices were so reasonable.Saona Island also was a long way (coach and catamaran) with entertainment (dancing on the catamaran!) and lots to see along the way if like us you want to see how the Dominicans live. The sea is the most beautiful turquoise we have ever seen and the beach is pure white sand. Bar-b-que was ok. On the way back we went on a speed boat which was so much fun as they really do know how to handle them at high speed - my daughters giggled the whole way!!! We stopped in the middle of the ocean for a surreal experience , I will try to describe it............ They call it the 'national park swimming pool' as you get out of the boat and can touch the ocean bed (unless like me you are 4ft 11 ! ). It is so clear and we were able to handle the star fish ( crew told us how to do it without harming them which again impressed us!) Then they played a game of 'hot potato' with a bottle of rum  coke as a forfeit ! That was an experience we will never forget.Horse riding at a local ranch only a 10 min ride in an open back truck was such a giggle (my husband had bruising on his under carriage- he didnt rise on his seat when we trotted!!!) While we were riding we had the company of the ranch dogs, who I was told by the tour rep where mostly strays that the ranch owner didnt have the heart to shoo away , and the whole time they jumped in puddles, rolled around in the sea when we got to the beach and generally fought with eachother! This amused us greatly. The only downside was we were not able to gallop as the heat was intense and too much for the horses, but we understood that and accepted it was for their health.Back to the resort, we felt so secure and comfortable that we let our children wander off and do their own thing which we wouldnt usually do in another country. They made friends and played in the pool, ate when they wanted and had freedom which was great for them. While they did this, us adults had a rough time lying on sunbeds with a constant supply of cocktails brought to us by lovely waitresses ( a dollar now and then made them happy!) The entertainment was good with no expense spared for costumes and scenery.Although all the staff were superb, I have to mention the guys in the lobby bar at night as they were outstanding, cuddles for my kids, banter with the adults and some wonderfull shots!!! Their names are Clemente , Chocolate, and Domingo. Met some lovely people, Linda  Eddie, Sandra  Paul. Keep in touch if you are reading this!We only got home yesterday but are now thinking of going back which is not what we usually do as we want to see all the world! All in all we will treasure the memories we have of a fabulous holiday

<Content>Beautiful Resort with okay food and sick for a week I just returned from a week at the Dreams Resort Punta Cana. This was a big trip for us, which included me, my husband, 11 month old daughter, parents, brother, his wife and 7 month old daughter. We were celebrating the purchase of our home, my 3 year wedding anniversary and daughter's first birthday.The plane ride from NYC was over 4 hours, which was extended an hour due to delays. The resort does not post on their website or respond to my inquiry of the travel time from the airport to the resort. My family decided to pay additional for a private van transfer to the resort for the comfort of the children. The ride was an hour, which included about 15 minutes of VERY bumpy roads. The driver explained that they were being repaved by the gov't the week we were leaving. Upon arriving to the resort we received a cool champagne drink that was really tasty. The hotel grounds were gorgeous. We booked the Partial Ocean View room and received a double bed room with garden views. Their response was that a King size bed room was not guaranteed. After talking to the front desk regarding our need to have a King size bed for the space of our daughter's play pen they then found an available POV room, which had no alarm clock - none available. Sometimes it pays to be persistent with your request. The pool was gorgeous and VERY big, which allowed for some space between the ton of people staying at the resort. The beach was nice. However, the ocean had a lot of rocks and coral reef. The bars served frozen drinks that were not slushy or cold. Their liquor drinks also did not seem to be very cold. We expected the premium drinks they promoted on the website.We loved the fact that there were 7 restaraunts to choose from every night with only three that required long pants. None of them required reservations, which allowed you to be comfortable and decide last minute where you'd like to go for dinner. The Italian restaurant was amongst the World Cafe (buffet), which was not good traditional Italian food. The Japanese restaurant was very good. We found that the Seaside grill served the best soul food type dinner with steaks and surf and turf options. By day seven four out of the six in my family were sick even though we only drank bottled water.The Spa is out of this world. The prices were a bargain compared to NYC spas. They provided great service and amenities.The shops were okay. At times the shops were disorganized. Every other day they had locals come with their merchandise whom could be a little 'pushy' to come to their table. The photography company they have located in their lower lobby takes great pictures. We had Lucy do a photo shoot of our family. The pictures we purchased were a bit pricey but well worth the memories we have for a lifetime.Lastly, I have to rave about the WONDERFUL entertainment team. It was the best entertainment I've experienced in the 6 carribean islands I've been too. My money was well worth the fun and laughs I experienced.

<Content>Bad experience all around We booked directly on the Dreams website to avoid problems that others have mentioned about dealing with Expedia, etc.We paid for an upgraded room in their concierge building and paid for a private car from the airport. The car was a small ramshackled bus that we were alone in. We waited in the lobby for 20 minutes for someone from concierge to come and check us in. We got to our room (marginal at best) and it wasn鈥檛 even in the concierge building.The A/C wasn鈥檛 working when we got in the room. Four calls and visits from maintenance later, the A/C never really worked correctly. The grounds were fairly well kept, the casino was tiny and vendors selling items would harass you on the way back to your room. Also, because it was all inclusive, the food was terrible.We were there for a wedding so we had to stay there at least until it was over, so we decided to leave a day early. We let the hotel know that we were leaving early and checked out. We were told that we would need to contract the company鈥檚 customer service line to request a refund for the last night.After trying to call and email for 3 months, someone from the hotel finally emailed back and asked for our credit card number to issue the refund. No refund. So we just gave up.Decide for yourself, but we are never going back to this hotel nor the Dominican Republic!

<Content>Awesome Vacation My husband and I just returned from Dreams Punta Cana today and I had to write in to let other people know that this hotel was absolutely incredible. I was so worried before we left after reading the reviews of disappointed people, but the overall experience was awesome. The service of the staff is so friendly and they can't do enough for you. The entertainment team are absolutely fun and excellent in what they do. They truly entertain you day and night and you can participate in as many activities and contest as you like to win Dream Money which you can use at the weekly auction for prizes. We had so much fun everyday. The bartenders are so much fun and will keep your drinks coming! The food was better than I expected after reading the reviews. There are 7 restaurants so you can dine at a different place each evening. The bordeaux, oceanana,sea side grill, and the Hibachi restaurants were our favorites. There was only 2 negative that I could say, but wouldn't keep me from going again. The air conditioning could be cooler, but I don't know if it had to do with the incredible heat. The other would be that although we enjoyed our room in building 1 which is on the beach, it is a hike to the main lobby where there are lots of things to do. I would definately go back to Dreams. They make you feel so welcomed. We had an absoutely incredible time.

<Content>Great time had by all Stayed at Dreams from the 14th to 28th of July and had a fantastic time. Don't believe the negative reviews this place is fantatsic, do your homeowrk a bit before you go and you will know what to expect from the likes of the journey to the hotel etc...As well as this the Dreams management team do read TA reviews and forward them onto their staff via e-mail, they do act upon negative reviews ( Thanks Ricardo in the Preferred club for showing me this).We upgraded to the Preferred club and stayed in two honeymoon suites which were immaculate and well kept throughout our stay. A big hi to Vanessa, Ricardo and George in the Preferred club, you guys rock and George your Smirnoff n Coke's are eh, how do I say it.... Put some coke in next time mate, cheers...LOL. Particularly liked the beach area for preferred guests with better sunloungers and beach towels without the need for a card etc...Loved to chill out at night in the hot-tub with a few beers....Heaven.The beach itself is beautiful, but there are rocks in the Ocean so be careful when entering. We swam in a horseshoe shaped area to the right hand side of the beach in front of the vendors hut. The water is lovely and refreshing and is like swimming in a lukewarm bath.One of our highlights at the resort was seeing 70 black people having a pre-wedding party on the beach, man do you guys know how to party or what, everyone was up dancing to some cool tunes being played by the DJ and to make it even better they invited us to join in, which we did and had a great time. Hope verything is going well in your married life.Food is outstanding at this resort, we ate at 4 venues: The Mexican, The Seaside Grill, The Italian and the Buffet and food was good at all of them. We liked the buffet best as the choice at dinner was excellent and allowed all of our party to have something they wanted. Worthy of praise are the waiting staff at all restuarants but again at the World Cafe ( buffet) the service here was faultless and you felt staff really enjoyed their work.A big thanks to Josie and Angel at the Core Zone area. This area is fantastic for all the family as it has pool, table tennis, air hockey as well as an X-Box, Wii and Playstation for those who maybe suffering from withdrawal symptons. Some good activities are held here i.e. Air rifle shooting, Archery, Darts along with Basketball and Tennis.Entertainment at the resort is good and runs on a weekly basis so if you are there for two weeks you will see the same shows twice. Some may see this as a problem but we certainly didn't as it allowed us to enjoy other activities within the resort i.e. Core Zone, Movies on Beach etc... I absolutely loved sitting out in the Plaza Square watching movies at night with a cocktail in hand, the atmosphere is just fantastic.I had two Hot Stone Massages at the SPA and they were fantastic, the resort offers discounts of 15% on certain days which are well worth looking out for and taking advantage of. The facilities are excellent in the SPA and you get to use the water areas prior to any massage or treatments. Try the ICE PLUNGE POOL it's lovely......LOL. Upstairs from the SPA is the Gym and what can I say except I wish I had bought some of my gear with me so I could have used it, it is incredible and if you use a gym back home bring your gear with you and use this gym, you won't be disappointed.The pool is superb and runs the length of the resort, water is only 3 foot deep throughout the length and we had no problems finding sunbeds at any time during the day. One thing I did dislike about the resort is the Vendors who come on site 3 times a week, they can be very pushy. The situate themselves so it is impossible to miss them when you are walking around the resort. Perhaps a better idea would be to move them to a specific area within the resort, where drinks could be on offer and music playing in the background etc..., then if guests wish to go shopping they can go there and have a nice shopping experience rather than feeling intimidated.I'm not a person that likes to go to the same place twice so for that reason I perhaps will not return to Punta Cana, however, I enjoyed the Dreams experience and will definently use Dreams Resorts again in the future.

<Content>Beautiful wedding, relaxing vacation I just got back from my wedding moon at the Dreams resort. It was so beautiful and amazing that words cannot even describe it! The resort is beautiful and the flamingos walking around made my day - everyday! We had a honeymoon sweet and it was perfect for the two of us - most people that saw our room wished they had booked a suite. My brother in law had an imperial room - room 1209 - it was THE BEST room in the whole resort and the only one with an ocean view! It was awesome! I would definitely upgrade to a honeymoon suite if possible!Food - we liked the himitsu japanese restuarant the best! the hibatchi was awesome and very tastey. the seaside grill was good fro dinner as well. I am not normally a buffet person, but they always had something to eat there that everyone liked. oceana was good for lunch if you didnt want to bbq on the beach - but we didnot like it for dinner - very small portions.Drinks - what can i say - you can drink all day long - just make sure they put alcohol in it :)service - absolutely impeccable! not a bad thing to sayentertainment - if you get bored, join something. you fake money for participating in activities and spend it at an auction during the week. its fun!all in all - have a great time!

<Content>Loved Dreams!!!! After reading a few reviews, we were concerned..... but we just returned from 7 days of heaven at Dreams Punta Cana. The Dreams team welcomed us home at arrival with champagne and smiles, Kelvin at the front desk worked his magic and then the Dreams team continued this service throughout the week. Two families with children (ranging from 10 to 17). Everyone was busy, happy and entertained for a full week! Go figure?! As this seems to be a big issue, we didn't have pool chair problems, although prime seating is best obtained by 9 - 930 am. Tipping is a good idea and be prepared to leave the deposit for snorkel gear ($20 cash) and take the lesson ($25 cash) before leaving the beach with a sail craft. The banana boat ride is $15 / per for 15 min but looked like great fun (we have a boat and tube at home so we skipped this event). The paddle gear is free free free and the whole gang had a great time kayaking. The snorkeling at the resort is fabulous, be sure to grab some rolls from the lunch barbeque to feed the angel  pencil fish. Out a bit (to the bouys) are great corals. Parasailing is not offered at this resort, however a ride (50 minutes) takes you to Bavaro Beach where they do offer this, however it's not encouraged by the hotel for safety reasons. The free scuba lesson in the pool (thank you Antonio) is short, but a good lead into a real water dive ($80 for your first dive), but not for the claustrophobic. To say that August is HOT is the understatement, but the resort long pool and the ocean kept us cooled off. The pool events (waterpolo, volleyball and the bar) were great fun and we made cool friends from all over the world. The food was good, we ate as a table everyone ordering something different from the menu and sharing. No matter what, the buffet will make every, any and all happy. We had a short wait one night (mexican and 30 minutes) but the alcohol is plentiful! Make a friend or many in the entertainers... our crew would have been lost without Fifty Cent  Usher entertaining the middle pool and making us laugh and dance at the evening entertainment. Tell'm Jimmy  Mike sent you! Play the games, ALL of them during the day at the pool, collect your winnings and head to the evening auction. Bidding is high, so collect all the winnings you can if you want the bottle of babymaker or the free massage!The Disco scene had a few late night incidents while we were there, contained quickly by hotel security. That's what you'll have with that much sunshine and alcohol! Be sure Mom's and Dad's to visit the Core Zone and show your kids how you can ride the mechanical bull! Late evening matches of soccer (futball) and basketball kept the kids busy and entertained! If you take an off resort tour, Cesar will hook you up, but remember it is a third world country and the roads and the view are NOT what we're used to in the US! We found that snorkeling at the resort first to get the kids used to it and then offsite was great fun. Take snacks, remember, no McDonalds along the way! If you want a Dolphin tour, book it the day you get there, DO NOT WAIT, they were sold out for the week when we went Day 2 of our week to reserve. Spanish is key, if you have the skill GREAT, if not there are plenty of staffers / managers that can help guide you in English, or visit the middle pool lessons...... with my brother from another mother.... Fifty Cent, tell'm Sandy Crawford sent you!

<Content>Go and enjoy yourself its brilliant This is the 3rd time in Dominican Republic and possibly one of the best.The best points of this hotel are the pool it goes on or ever. The entertainment team are fab Best are 50 cent Usher and Stephanie.The only bad comments I could make for our vacation is the 4th July meal on the beach. The whole hotel had to eat on the beach as they shut down all other restaurants. But there was not enough lighting or adequate seating. The evening entertainments is good the coral for kids and adults is great way to spend an hour after lunch when the sun is at its strongest.Bar staff are friendly don鈥檛 look to be tipped all the time I only tipped good service. Don鈥檛 believe in tipping for the sake of tipping.The beach is excellent we went snorkelling most days on the reef the fish and coral are all here also went sailing all part of the all inclusiveGo to dreams and have a wonderful time

<Content>Wont go back to Dreams Punta Cana Just came back from Dreams Punta Cana, My son who is 21, daughter who is 14, my husband and I stayed for 9 days. You could really tell that you were in a 3rd world country. You really feel sorry for the people of Punta Cana because on your ride to the resort you see the true scenery. These people are very, very very poor. The roads are not paved they are the worst. So, once you get to the resort you have a back ache. The staff at the resort really tried but it could never compare to Dreams Cancun which gave you 5 star treatment. You could not go outside the grounds unless you were with a tour from the resort. The resort was set in a reclusive area within the bushes of Punta Cana so once you have participated in the activities within the resort you are just stuck there. The food was fair but could have been better. The highlight of the vacation was the tour on the Kontiki boat. This was fun for the whole family. It is a party boat, the whole family is brought into the line dancing and the make believe shows that they perform.

<Content>Awesome Time at the DREAMS!!!! We stayed at the Dreams Resort Punta Cana in June 2008. We had an awesome time. The Resort has a very tropical setting, rooms are clean, pool is great, food is good and the staff is very courteous and friendly. The Best part of the resort was the entertainment team specially Michael Jackson, Melkins and Usher!!! These guys worked their [--] of to keep us entertained. I would definitely recommend this resort to people who are not complicated and don鈥檛鈥?except a five-star luxury hotel. By the way, for an additional fee, they also have a photo shop with professional photographers, who take beautiful pictures, so you can cherish your memories. Thank you Jorge for my awesom pictures!!!SHUT OUT TO MICHAEL JACKSON, MELKINS AND USHER FROM Los Colombianos de NJ (lalo, gladys, viviana y fabian)

<Content>Still Dreaming of Dreams......... We have visited the Dominican Republic 4 times previously staying at Riu and Iberostar hotels, I have previously rated the Iberostar better than the Riu's but I certainly compare Dreams PC to the nicest Iberostar which is the Hacienda Dominicus in Bayahibe.On arrival we were greated with soft drinks and champagne, check in was quick and we were on our way to our room.ROOMSWe were given a room in block 5 on the ground floor, we were a bit disappointed with the size of the room, but it was spotlessly clean and the3 of us managed with the beds pushed together.The room was a bit noisy during the early hours with inconsiderate people staggering back from the Disco, but we soon slept through it.Nine days into our holiday we decided to upgrade to a honeymoon suite on the 1st floor in block 7 which gave our 11 year old his own bed in the lounge area, we loved this room and the novelty of the jacuzzi on the balcony, I think this may have spoilt us for future holidays!!FOODWe loved the arrangement of not booking ahead for the a la carte restaurants. The food was perfecly acceptable everywhere we ate, it is'nt how it tastes at home, but the ambience and the staff make each restaurant enjoyable. Our favourite's were chinese, oceana and bordeaux. The clam chowder in bordeaux was delicious and so was the scallop starter. Sometimes the time you wait in the restaurant's can be hit and miss but remind yourself you are on holiday, let the waiter top your glass up, and relax. Margarita, Carlos, Juan, Ingrid and many more are a credit to the Hotel.DRINKSLoved Mojito's,Samisosa's, Mudslide, Isla Coco's, Punta Cana special, Tanqeray GT's, champagne and I found the house wine to be perfecly acceptable especially the red. Hubby drank Johnny Walker over ice and the Presidente beer, our son loved the creamy cocktails minus alcohol.SWIMMING POOLLoved the pool, it was very clean, and it is the first holiday where the white on the swimwear did'nt discolour, water was very warm. There was a snake in the pool one day which one of the other guest's grabbed and put it in the bushes.BEACHDid'nt spend a great deal of time on the beach as someone we went with were in a wheel chair, but did swim in the sea near the trampoline and walked down the beach almost to the Sirenis. No complaints. ENTERTAINMENTWe loved Meky Mouse, and 50 cent, they all work so hard.I do think the Hotel should roll their entertainment programme over 2 weeks rather than 1 week, so us Brits don't get bored with the same show in the second week.Core Zone- WOW!! Our son disappeared there every evening until we collected him at 11ish. It's a kids paradise, certainly a jewel in the crown for the Hotel.EXCURSIONSDid the Tropicalstorm trip from Bavaro, sailing and snorkeling from a catamaran,we would all recommend it, and my son loved diving down with the fish with his snorkel on, which scared the hell out of me!!We also did horseriding locally through Sharon the VIP rep, we had never been on horses before and we loved it, the horses looked in good shape and we would recommend this trip also.We loved Dreams PC and our experience there would certainly encourage me to book another Dream's hotel. Don't get stressed about the bad reviews, anyone looking for faults and problems will find them if that's all they are looking for. Just remember when going to the D R you are booking a chilled out relaxing holiday and escaping the hustle and bustle. If it takes a few minutes to be served at the bar, relax and remember you are on holiday, you don't need your watch, leave it in the safe!!

<Content>Most Relaxing Vacation Our 12 day stay at the resort was just what we needed! We wanted a vacation that required us to do nothing and this was it. It was the most relaxing vacation my family and I have ever experienced. The perferred club was well worth the up grade charge. The food and drinks were excellent. The spa was great. The only item that needs to be up graded is the casino. It's to small and the air conditioning was lacking.

<Content>Stop the moaning I cannot understand all the negative reviews that people write. Do people honestly expect that everything will be 100% perfect for 100% of the time. We travelled (32 of us) to dreams for my sister-in-laws wedding and had a fantastic time. I aggree that the transfer is a little on the interesting side but the drivers do their best to avoid the worst of the pot holes and it is only just over an hour.The staff at the resort are fantastic, they work extremely long hours and are always cheerful and happy to help, despite some very rude guests.I was never served a bad meal in the two weeks at the resort, on occasion the contents of my plate did not precisely match the menu description but in my opinion this is a minor transgresson. There was occasionally a wait for the more popular restaurants however there was always an alternative for the impatient.If I had any complaints about the holiday they would be directed and the some of the loud and obnoxious guests at the resort. In my opinion it was a very enjoyable two weeks and money well spent. This was my first experience of an all inclusive holiday and though I was initially sceptical, I would thoroughly recommend Dreams Punta Cana.

<Author>MrsM2281
<Content>Love this place! Everything good you have heard about this place is true....truley AMAZING!I will not go into details about horrible flights and the transfers to/from hotel, as these things have nothing whatsoever to do with the hotel. We all know (or should research if do not know) about these things.Check-in: Immediate as we were the only people who arrived at that time. No, we did not receive champaign or cold/hot towels, but if you must have a drink the lobby bar is steps away and I'm sure the friendly staff would get you a towel if you ask. Beautiful lobby.Room: Average size hotel room which was beautifully decorated and clean. Yes you do have to wait for the fridge (which was fully stocked as advertised) to cool down as the hotel does not keep the fridge running when no one is in the room, and trying to change rooms will not help as you will still have to wait for the fridge in that room to cool down as well. Just give it a couple hours, and remember that in the Dominican Republic electricity is not a necessity. No problems with A/C as long as you keep a card in the slot to keep it running. We were upgraded to a swim-out room in building one....loved it! We also had champaign, fruit basket, and beach towels upon arriving to the room, which was great! And also had a bar of sorts in the TV stand under the TV, which was definitely not expected. We did have to call maintenance out because the toilet did not flush completely, which was fixed promptly (just needed to open the valve a little more).Resort and Staff: Beautiful grounds with roaming free peacocks, parrots. Very friendly and helpful staff, who will do practically anything you ask to make your vacation wonderful.Pool: Massive, but only about three feet deep throughout. Always could find a place to hang out or a chair to lounge upon. Nice.Beach: We are beach people. Yes, this side of the island is rougher than the LaRomana area, but you still have beautiful turquoise waters with nice tan sand. Yes there are rocks directly in front of the resort and no you cannot see them...my husband can assure you of this as he ran straight into the ocean (did not heed my warnings) and received a nasty cut on his shin. Stay to the left near the water trampoline for swimming. We tried to snorkel near the water trampoline, but the water was too murky to see anything. We later discovered that if you go to the right of the resort, you can find some clear spots with OK snorkeling, but be careful as there are rocks and dead coral in this area. Always found a shady place on the beach to grab a chair and relax, and the beach drink service was awesome.Food: We tried every specialty restaurant (dinner meals) while there, as well as room service for late night menu, late night pizza, World Cafe for both breakfast a couple of days and lunch a couple of days (we slept in, so on days we ate breakfast no lunch and vice versa), and of course the beach BBQ a couple of times. We found the food everywhere on the resort to be wonderful! You have to keep in mind that there will be local influence/flavor to the food...for instance in El Patio, my husband ordered wings over buffalo, which was similar to buffalo wings but had the Dominican flair. Not the same as here at home, but very good. If you want food that taste exactly like you get at home, stay home. Do not complain that the food is bad because it is not what you are used to eating at home...the food is wonderful and I cannot see how anyone can say it is not good. Not once did we get sick from any of the food. One night we opted for the romantic dinner on the beach and chose the lobster...WONDERFUL (book through concierge....Nichola is wonderful if you get a chance to meet her)!Alcohol: I found some drinks to be very strong and some drinks to be weaker. If you love strong drinks, and receive a weaker drink either drink it and get another (ask for more alcohol) or ask for more alcohol in the drink you have. Not a beer drinker, but I know they do have Budweiser, bud light, presidente light, and Coors in the lobby. My husband did have bathroom issues right after we arrived and the only thing he had eaten or drank was the presidente beer...I think it was because his body is not used to the heavy beer as he is a light beer drinker. I did have an upset stomach after drinking way too much one night...be careful of the amount you drink. If you want top shelf, just ask for it.Casino: Slots will take your money...my husband had luck on the blackjack table.Excursion (although not related to hotel I will comment): We booked the Bavarro Runner excursion with the Thompson rep, this is an awesome trip. You go into the mountains and horseback, watch how chocolate and coffee are made, learn about mamajuana, visit a local school, watch people making hand rolled cigars, have lunch at a house in the mountains, visit a sugar cane field, and end your day at el Macao beach (which is awesome). I think this is a MUST do!Weather: Awesome the entire time we were there. I brought SPF 70, and still burned a little (I am NOT fair...I guess I'd describe myself as having a light olive complexion). Sunscreen is a must, as the sun is stronger. Yes there is a lot of humidity...you are in the tropics and this is to be expected.I could actually go on and on, but this is long enough.Overall we had a wonderful time and were very impressed with Dreams PC!

<Content>Excellent time! Would go back again! my boyfriend and I just returned from a great week long vacation at Dreams. We had such a wonderful time that we thought it warranted a wonderful review. We took a private taxi from the airport which turned out to be a 2000 Camry - it had AC and it was clean so that was fine with us. The ride is one hour long exactly and there are parts where the road is a mess of bumps but our taxi driver was very careful to take each bump slowly and we felt very safe. We were greeted with champagne and were checked in immediately an hour before check in time. Our bags were brought right to us as well. Our room was clean with a king size bed and patio overlooking the pool which was great. Some negatives...were that the bed is very firm and there were a few ants by the sink in the bathroom. These ants were quickly squashed and taken care of though. We think they may have come off of the flowers that were placed around the sink for decoration. (Note that they spray the rooms once a week). Our mini cooler (its not a fridge) was always stocked with sodas, beers, juice and water. At one point we had a six pack going of Bohemia beers so we were happy. THe maid came to our room 2x a day - first in the afternoon where they fully cleaned the room down to mopping the floors even on our balcony and then at night to turn down the bed, replace towels for a 2nd time that day and leave you yummy chocolates.The Food: coming from someone with a very sensitive stomach, the food was great. Obviously baked ziti is not what you eat on a spanish island, but there is a huge selection of food and everything is fresh and bountiful. We ate chicken, fish, rice, potatoes, fruit etc,...all the things they know how to make just right. The buffet was clean and sanitary and the service was immediate and excellent.The Restaurants: We thoroughly enjoyed each restaurant that we went to. The wait staff was great at each of the locations and we had no problem. They warn you to go earlier than later if you want a guaranteed table, so listen to them and you should have no problem. We had dinner every night at 6:30 with NO problems.Himitsu - entertaining and yummy - sit at the hibachi table and be amazed as they play with fire.Sea Side - the steak was great and the salad bar was great for filling you up.Oceana - was okay food but so worth it because it overlooks the beach and is beautiful - be sure to get a special coffee made by Johnny Be Good.El Patio - was not the greatest Mexican food, nor are the serving sizes large, but its connected to the main buffet so it was a nice experience and we just continued eating next door when we were done.Bordeaux - this took the cake. All of the food on the menu was carefully planned and delicious. Everything was fresh, the service impeccable. Many didnt even know it existed since its upstairs to Seaside but it should not be missed. Be sure to get the double mousse dessert.The Beach: The beach was beautiful. It was clean and there are NO - NO - NO rocks on the left side AT ALL. When we say left side, we mean slightly to the left - not on the other side of the beach. So those that see coral should walk 15 ft to the rock LESS side and enjoy themselves. The water is just the right temp. and you can take kayaks and other equipment out if you want to play.The bars are great - tip as you like. Of course you are going to ask for premium, why else should they give it to you? If you ask its never a problem though. Just specify. Try the Bahana Mama. If you are for some reason not by a bar, (which seems impossible since there are 10), someone is sure to quickly walk up to you to ask if you want anything.Pool: Bring rafts - pool is awesome and very clean. Its warm but that is bc you are on an island where it is hot all the time. What else would you expect. After laying out, it is still refreshing so enjoy!Special shout out to the ENTERTAINMENT TEAM - they had us laughing constantly. The shows were great especially Night with the Stars. You should admire the effort and hard work they put into each performance and into making your stay enjoyable. We especially were fond of Julio from Entertainment - He was very friendly and made our time at the Core Zone extra fun. (pingpong, electric bull, batting cage, etc). We also thought 50 Cent was a hit with his bingo games, spanish lessons and personality. The Day time activities kept you busy all day bw beach volleyball, to ping pong tourneys to pineapple throwing - there was always something going on and smiling people.Every vacation is what you make it, however we felt the resort and their entertainment team did a wonderful job of making ours extra special. We definitely recommend this resort. Enjoy!

<Content>Fun, but came home with ECOLI!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My best friend and I attended a wedding there. The resort is nice, and a lot of fun, but a few days after returning home I became wretchedly ill. Finally, a trip to the ER proved that I had conctracted e.coli. While I'm not sure where it came from, I'd advise no one drink the tap water, or eat and raw fruits. The beach there leaves much to be desired, but other than that it was fun and good, yet tainted, food.

<Content>Some Good/Some Bad I read the reviews before I left and scared myself silly with some of them. I was apprehensive to say the least but it was too late to do anything about it. With that in mind. The airport is not airconditioned but the lines move very fast and there are big fans to help ciruclate the air. The airport and hotel is clean which is an important factor when we travel. The bus ride from the airport to the hotel was an air conditioned coach bus. The ride was very bumpy and around an hour trip. There is nothing they can do about the roads so you just have to sit back and take in the bumpy ride. The hotel staff greated us with champagne on our arrival and one of our rooms was ready so we were able to change in the room and head out to enjoy the hotel. The rooms are clean and air conditioned. The beds are hard but we were exhausted each night so it didn't matter. Nothing else is air conditioned. The lobby, the restaurants or the hallways. The pool is clean but water is warm. The ocean has rocks and seaweed directly in front of the hotel but if you go to the left its fine. Everyone is very friendly and can communicate fairly well. The only compalint we have is the food. We are somewhat picky eaters but the food just did not taste the same. There is plenty to choose from and for the most part the men loved the food but the women did not. The buffet is the best. If you eat at the other restaurants order two meals. We got the land and sea lovers and got a tiny steak and one shrimp. Went to the buffet after that. There are no elevators. Steps everywhere. There is no reason to be bored there. There is plenty to do and lots of activities. We normally don't go back to the same place twice but if we ever did return to the DR we would stay at dreams.

<Content>The Truth !!! Well my husband and i came here for our honeymoon. The ride to the resort was about a hour. It was not as bad as everyone said it was going to be. There was no AC on the ride to the resort but, on the way back there was so it is a hit or miss with that. We get to Dreams nobody welcomed us but, it may be different for everyone. It is very open and has a beautiful lobby. We check in and we booked a ocean view room through are agent but, when we recieved our keys and info we saw we didn't have a ocean view room. The front desk argued with us and said we did not book that suit. We called are agent and they even told the resort we paid for that room but, they said no and we didn't end up with what we paid for. We are taking that up with are agent now.  We get to our suit it was very nice but we were on the 3rd floor and the AC sucked. We had no problems with bugs like you may read. The beds are hard but not bad. The room does have water,soda and beer but it is luke warm. The pool was beautiful but very warm you can't cool down in it but we also were there in July.  The food was ok i am a meat and potato's girl and it's only my opinion but the meat is not the same as it is here in the US. So when you see chicken and beef it taste different. We had stomach issues the whole week. Take tums pepto or what ever else works for you TRUST me on this one. The Cafe was where we ate most can't go wrong with pasta,bread,fruit and salad. We did room service it came up cold everytime but oh well it is what it is. The beach was pretty alot of seaweed but it's a beach...There is lunch on the beach everyday burgers,hotdogs and nachos. They do show movies at night and the bars are open till 5 at the pool at between 10 and 11 at other locations. We did go to the club  Disco it was ok very hot seems like no AC is in there. The service is a lil slow so when we ordered drinks there we would get 2-3 at a time. We did notice that if you did or didn't tip our service was the same. I used to bartend so i was tipping good but was not treated any different so i left money after that here and there. LOL now the CASINO it has about 6 tables and 20 slots. It is true what they say watch the dealers. They do not know how to count that great. I changed in 100 for chips she gave me 50 back. My husband said wait we just gave you 100 and then the  pit boss  came said whatever in spanish then the dealer was slamming chips back at us. That did not go over to well with my Husband. Also count your cards before they take them. The dealer would have 18 and take cards that people had 20 with. The resort is beautiful all the staff seemed happy and nice we met great people there ( love ya Gaelyn and Adam) and tried to make the best of the trip. I dont think i would go there again but it's only my opinion I am a Vegas girl so i think i will just stick with that. One more thing when you leave they tell you to make sure you see your bags go on the bus. We were the first on the bus and saw are bags go on. When i looked out the window are bags were against the wall so we had to get off to make sure they were put back on. Have fun enjoy your trip. I realized no matter how many of these reviews you read your experience will be what you make it!!!

<Content>A dream come true Ok well i am goin to start off by saying that dont believe any of the bad reviews people are writting. My girlfriend and I stayed at the dreams with another couple from monday to friday. Yes the roads are bumpy, but not completly dirt roads they are paved roads with pot holes, but you are in a third world countrty so what do you expect. Once we got to the hotel which tool an hour, we were greated with cold towels and champagne. Went to check in with no problems, we had the junior suite with the jacuzi on the balcony. Room was clean minor scratches on the walls, maid always did a good job cleaning up, refreshing our towels, and the turn down service at night was good. Pool was warm everyday, and dont believe people about not being able to get a lounge chair they are available. The drinks didn't have much alchohol in them, but if you tipped them a few bucks they took care of you. Food was average nothing to write home about, but that didnt bother me. I wasnt there to expect food like i have back in New Jersey. Lastly the ocean. Water was warm everyday, becarefull for the coral reef which is directly infront of the resort. So if you go to the left of the resort by the turtle trampoline, the water is gorgeous. There is seaweed in the front, but once your in the ocean its ok. Overall i think its a beautifull resort well taking care of, the staff is friendly, grounds are gorgeous just a all around great place!!!!!!! Don't listen to the other reviews people want to have ritz carlton treatment and not pay for it . Than complain on trip advisor. Have fun at the Dreams Resort it truly is a DREAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Content>Phenomenal Vacation My family and I (7 of us in three rooms) just returned from a fantastic week at Dreams Punta Cana. We originally booked Sunscape Punta Cana through Bookit.com, but then found out that they were undergoing renovations, and received a free upgrade to the Dreams property....wow did we luck out! Bookit.com did a fantastic job of making it a smooth and simple change, and we didn't have any problems with the change. Yes, the hotel is a bit far from the airport, but this is one of very few negatives (if you'd call it that). The roads are a bit crazy, but I consider it part of the experience, and enjoyed seeing the country for what it really is, rather than getting a surreal view based on only my views from the resort. It made us all appreciate where these workers come from.When we arrived for CHECK-IN at Dreams, we were greeted with warm cookies, juice and champagne. Jose checked us in, and spoke perfect English. The check in process was less informative than at many other all-in's we have stayed. We had three rooms in total in three different BUILDINGS The first in Building 5(close to the main Buffet and theatre/farthest from the beach and seemingly older building / nosie from theatre and movies was an issue.) Our second room was in Building 8 (in between the beach and main building clean and quiet during our stay) Our third room was in building 2(close to the beach with wonderful views and very atttentive maids).All ROOMS were clean and bugfree. They were spacious and all you need with so much to do outside. The walls are thick concrete and we had very few noise issues other than late nighters in the hall. If you have issues with your room, go to the front desk. They are incredibly helpful, but are much better in person than on the phone. We found them more than accommodating when we had issues.The GROUNDS at Dreams were sensational. I couldn't stop taking pictures because everything was just gorgeous. The groundskeepers work tirelessly keeping every square inch nearly perfect. And, if you're a POOL-lover, you'll be in heaven in the expansive pool. It is a little warm and only about three feet deep throughout but was kept extra clean during our stay. the pool is surrounded with beautiful landscaping and more than enough lounge chairs for a totally booked resort.The BEACH was huge and has what seem like and endless supply of shady Palapa huts for the shade seeker and a thousand lounge chairs. Beach drink service was constant and really appreciated. Rocks in front of the resort make it necessary to veer to the left or far right to find a sandy safe place to swim. Beach walkers will be happy strolling safely to either side of the resort. We never felt unsafe on the beach but you might not want to stray too far off the resort beach late at night.We visited all of the RESTAURANTS during our stay. People who complain about the food here are just complainers. There were so many options at the buffet, and each of the restaurants was fantastic in its own right. Our favorite was probably Bordeaux, because the food was fabulous and the restaurant was beautiful, but our favorite tended to change nightly....we just happened to go to Bordeaux last. The food at the Mexican restaurant was a pleasant surprise. We didn't expect much from it, but really loved it. At Himitsu we opted for doing Hibachi. You had the choice of Hibachi or ordering from the menu. The service was much like you'd find at Benihanas in the states. We had such a good time there, and enjoyed the food and the saki. Get there early (it opens at 6pm) to get a hibachi table or you may be in for a bit of a wait. The portions in Oceana and The Sea Side grill were a little small, but the food was tasty, and Oceana had a nice cool breeze coming off the beach for a pleasant dining experience. The wait staff was friendly and helpful. Many of them took time to get to know us, and even those with limited English skills communicated well. A few of our favorites were Briseida (our favorite breakfast coffee waitress), Sanchez (who seemed to be everywhere all at once. He waited on us at several different restaurants around the property, and Grover who told us all about the hotel, its staff, and the country. The waitresses on the beach also worked very hard and did a great job. We didn't participate in many of the entertainment activities, but there was definitely always something going on. Usher, Luis, Julio, Michael, and the gang worked hard to keep everyone having a good time. We did take out sea kayaks, which was fabulous, and we enjoyed tooling around by the reef. (If you want to go snorkeling, there is a $20 deposit fee per person. You get it back when you return the equipment) We never brought money to the beach, so we didn't end up snorkeling. I haven't seen anyone in these forums mention the Core Zone at this hotel, and it is such a unique feature....especially if you have teenagers or older children. Behind the main lobby building, there is an are called Core Zone where you can participate in air hockey, ping pong, foosball, a disco, wii and x box, archery, darts, air rifles, batting cages, and even a mechanical bull! We are all adults, but had so much fun in the Core Zone. I've never seen anything like this at any of the other AIs where we have stayed.Also, if you get a chance, the horseback riding is great, and a really good value. The horses even run through the water on the beach, which is just amazing.Overall, we had a superb vacation, and would definitely return to Dreams again.

<Content>Dreams Punta Cana We stayed at this hotel in July this year for our honeymoon and it was amazing. I have read some iffy reviews on this website and I truly cannot understand were the bad reviews come from. The food was fantastic, the buffet restaurant was brilliant wide choice and good variety of good quality food and the a la carte restaurants were superb especially the sea side grill. its brilliant that you do not have to reserve tables at the a la carte restaurants, some evenings they quoted up to 45 minutes wait for a table but we never ever waited more than 20 minutes. customer service from all the staff was second to none, they can`t help you enough. the all inclusive is fantastic you can have whatever you want, all branded drinks. massive resort with so much to do you will never get bored, activities and entertainment is run all day and all evening. you can be relaxed and do nothing or have a fun packed holiday. the beach is beautiful, and the daily beach bbq is fantastic help yourself to burgers, hot dogs etc with all the fresh trimmings. the rooms are brilliant we had a honeymoon suite which was the best room we have ever stayed in. truly an amazing hotel and would definately return and we now fancy trying another dreams hotel in one of the other superb locations.

<Content>Great Time Spent our honeymoon there just a couple of weeks ago and had just ane awsome time. Room was nice and there were many different places to eat with The World Cafe having a little of something for everyone.You could get Bud Light,Miller Genuine Draft,and Henigan in bottles at the bar in the main lobby. Pool was nice and big and you had lots of room to float around and drink your favoite drink,(Try the SAMMY SOSAS) Lots of activities on the go all day long.Met a couple good entertainers while I was there 50 Cent and Usher. These guys really helped us have a good time. They were pool side every day from 10 in the morning until 5 in the evening with activities from Spanish Lessons to Horse Racing. If you go check these guys out. Excellent Entaintment Team and a well rounded resort.We would defientley go back there again. Lots of good food ,lots of good booze,lots of sun, nice people.

<Content>The Real Dreams Punta Cana I don't typically do reviews like this, but decided to because of the experience I had. We booked this trip at a great deal through bookit.com. After reading the reviews, we went knowing that some people can not be pleased. Yes, the cab ride was bad because of the roads, but there is no way to prevent it. The cabbies know the roads so well that they can maneuver around very well. We were told that we were going to stay at another resort for 2 nights because Dreams was overbooked. This was disappointing but then they said that they would give us 1 free week in the next year. Yippee!! We stayed at Gran Bahia Principe Bavaro and it was amazing! Our room was gorgeous, but the resort was very large and we had to do a lot of walking around. When we finally got to our resort we got our vouchers for the free week and the front desk people were a bunch of jerks. We were traveling with my mom and sister. My mom is older, and I had requested a room near all the action. She got a room on the top floor as far away from the action as we could get. When we got into our room we noticed that the door did not close very well and that our phone did not work. We tracked back to the front desk and they said that it would be fixed later in the day. The phone never got fixed which made our stay difficult since we were there with others. All and all when we left we decided that for the price we paid, we didn't have much to complain about. The pictures on Dreams website are COMPLETELY off. The resort does not look like that at all!!!Now for the reason for this review. I have been trying to book my free 1 week trip. Any website that I go to, I have found that I can book a trip, but my voucher says that I have to book through the resort. Everytime that I call they say that they are booked up already or do not have room rates at this time. We are not going to get to use our vouchers because they are making it too difficult and I do not trust them. I wouldn't put it past them to give our room away and make us sleep on the street once we got there. Punta Cana in general was a boring and dirty place. We would never go back and had only considered going back to save money and use our voucher.

<Author>NewYorkSummer08
<Content>Don't believe all of the negative reviews!! Awesome time I just want to start off by saying that before my trip I checked on tripadvisor daily and was so nervous by all of the negative reviews. My boyfriend and I stayed at the Dreams hotel from July19th-25th. We had a blast and couldn't ask for a better vacation. We got upgraded to a suite with a jacuzzi on the balcony. It was gorgeous. Just a word of advice try to negotiate with the check in people. They are very nice and helpful. We had an issue with our first room and they helped us out right away and took care of everything. Yes there were some little ants in our bathroom-but that isnt going to ruin our vacation. The air conditioning is so so and its cool when you first walk in but once you get comfortable its a little warm. The grounds of the hotel are beautiful. I was taken away by the hotel. It was so clean. The workers work so hard it is ridiculous. From the morning you wake up you see people cleaning the pool and watering the grass. There are constantly workers cleaning up around the resort. The maid comes twice a day and leaves your rooms spotless. The bed was a little hard but we managed. The pool and beach were gorgeous. We usually put towels down by the pool/beach before we walked to breakfast to save loungechairs. We got up around 930ish, yes some people wake up extra early to put towels down but even if you get down a little later there are chairs available. We usually hung out around the pool around 3ish because thats when the Entertainment Team came and did a lot of their dances and activities. The food was good. We are from New York so we know good food. I mean you go to an all inclusive place in the Carribean and you know that your not going to get amazing American food. However it was very good. Bordeaux was our favorite restaurant and we went there two nights. I was so scared about the reviews on the food that I made sure to bring Immodium, Tums ,Pepto Bismol etc. However, we didnt need any of that. And I did eat from the salad bar and had the ice cubes. Try to get to the restaurants 630ish this way you dont have to wait too long. Most nights we waited 20 minutes or so. Room service is ok nothing great. The entertainment team was the highlight of our vacation. These people work 16-17 hour days. From 10AM they have daily activities around the hotel and pool. My boyfriend played waterpolo a lot near the pool. They also had merengue lessons one day and step aerobics was fun. The Entetainment team is also responsible for the show at night. The shows are good-nothing broadway like but enjoyable. Our favorite was Night of the Stars and True Love show. After the show we usually went to the disco and danced and had a good time. I fell in love with Mickey Mouse, Michael Jackson, Stephanie and much more. They work so hard I give them so much credit. We did two excursions which I highly recommend. We did the ATV quad tours which was amazing. You are on the quad for almost two hours. We also did the zipline which was amazing. I was a little nervous but my boyfriend really wanted to do it, and I am so glad that we did.  Overall, please do not believe all of the negative reviews. We had so much fun. The hotel was so clean and accomodating. Everyone at the pool was saying how they were reading negative reviews and were very nervous also-but couldnt agree with any of them. Clearly some people are very picky and think that if one thing goes wrong than their whole trip is ruined. I went just me and my boyfriend and we met such awesome people and had a great time. If your going to Dreams anytime soon- have a great time and can I come with you?? Other friendly reminders: Drink of choice-Sammy Sosa! Also, bring a lot of dollar bills for tipping (at least 50-100). The flea market tables which sell jewelery are a rip off. Please do not buy anything without bargening. They have nice jewelery but you need to bargan with them. If you want to do the excursions bring sneakers with you. Make friends with the Entertainment Team they are all awesome people and made our trip worthwhile.I hope this review is helpful and you are going to have a great time at the Dreams Punta Cana resort.

<Content>OMG Okay, so one of my best friends from college was getting married and his wife-to-be chose this resort for the festivities. The grounds were sprawling, well-manicured and the hospitality of the waitstaff was great and attentive. Ironicly, they were lacking in customer service. The wedding was beautiful and definitely an evening of joy. The day after the wedding, most of the attendees were prepping to make their way back home. In lieu of this, my college friends - 12 all together - arranged to have dinner at a Hibachi restaurant, Himitsu, since it was the last day we would all be at the resort together. Well, we all met at about 7:15pm and were told a table would be available in about an hour and that there was no need for us to provide our names. We were already hungry from our ATV excursion earlier that day but eager to enjoy our dinner together so we sat tight and decided to wait. Imagine our surprise and chagrin when we approached the hostess and she told us that she had forgotten about us and that there was nothing she could do since we had not given our names. She said there would be an additional half hour wait. In their defense, this should have been the point when we went to a less crowded restaurant at the resort and stuffed ourselves but we continued to wait because management guaranteed us seating within a half hour and offered us sushi to hold our group over. We had already lost 4 members by then. The remaining 8, including children, waited as a half an hour turned into 45 minutes with management continuing dangling the carrot of seating in front of our faces. Because there was hardly enough sushi to go around for us, we asked the manager if there was food left in the restaurant so we could go elsewhere if that wasn't the case. He assured us that there was plenty of food.To make a VERY long story short, we gave up on our chance to have a Hibachi dinner and settled for Chinese at the same restaurant. By this time, it was 10:30PM. We ordered our respective dishes and were brought out what was left as opposed to what we ordered. This after the manager assured us that there was food left. The fish was not fresh, the rice was scraped from the bottom of the pot and the appetizers were less than appetizing.We complained to the restaurant manager who referred us to someone who was in charge of the food and dining at the resort. After hearing our gripe, he took our room numbers with one of my girlfriends suggesting that we get comped for a massage. We never heard from him again and visited the concierge later in the week to follow up on our own. She proceeded to tell us she could only compensate us with the promise of a really good meal at any of the restaurants on the premises. Huh/? This is an all-inclusive resort, a really good meal should have been a given. That wouldn't have made up for the experience we had at the Hibachi restaurant. Our pleas fell on deaf ears and I left there feeling cheated.Again, I take responsiblity for the fact that we waited but the service was still terrible.In addition to our harrowing restaurant experience, we heard rumors of poor air conditioning, wetbar refrigerators not workng, and the worst of the worst, sitings of rat droppings in one of the bathrooms of the resort rooms...YUCK!!The pool was cool but the beach was covered with seaweed on our first venture there. it was much better on the other side of the resort.If it wasn't for the awesome company of my extended family, the occasion we were celebrating and our awesome excursion rep, Ceasar, the trip would have been a total bust. Beware of Dreams...!

<Content>Dreams was really a NIGHTMARE!! The pool and beach are beautiful. The spa is great. The entertainment is okay. However, the food is horrible....no flavor compared to American food. The honeymoon suite isn't anything to write home about...we found blood on our comforter the first night there. We had ants in our room. The bed was hard as a rock. The bathroom ceiling was partially broken and you could see through the slats. They overbooked this hotel while we were there, so they were trying to bribe people to go stay at their sister hotel which was less nice in return for a 7 night voucher back at this hotel. I wouldn't stay there for free if I had to!

<Content>Great Vacation! We just got back from Dreams and I would have to say it was a great vacation with a few exceptions.Arriving at airport: Be prepared to pay $10 per person for a Tourist Card. They do take credit cards. You buy the card and then walk a few steps and give your card to someone else. Going thru customs was a breeze. Everyone was very friendly. Unlike Mexico, they do not try and get you to buy time shares, etc so that was a positive. We were on Apple Vacations and everyone on our bus was going to the same resort which made the hour ride to the hotel more bearable. The roads were extremely bumpy and winding but all in all it was not too bad. Arriving at hotel:We were greeted with cold towels and champagne. Bellboys took your luggage from you and brought it to your room which was nice. We arrived at the hotel around 1pm and our rooms were not ready so we headed to the buffet for lunch which was really good. The rooms:We were in building 2, 1st floor overlooking the pool. The rooms were small but we did not have any bug problems like other people have said. The bathrooms were kinda strange as there was no glass door that went all the way across the tub. It only went halfway and there was also a huge step to get in to the tub. So if you have been drinking alot, getting in the tub could be a problem. The water went from hot/cold a lot so if you burn it can be rather painful as I found out. The fridge always had water, pop and beer in it however it is not a fridge it is called a cooler so the beverages were not ice cold. The pool was very nice. I would recommend buying some rafts or something to use in the water at Walmart, etc since it is cheaper than buying it in the gift shop at the resort. We did not do this so it was hard to find something to float on. Restaurants:I recommend going to the restaurants early if you want to eat at them and not the buffet! Our favorite was Hitimusi (Hibachi Grill). They only have 3 tables that seats 12 people. We were there at 5:30 (restaurant opens at 6) and had no problem getting in. Best restuarant. We also ate at the Seaside Grill (opened at 6:30). We arrived around 6 and was first to be seated. The steak was great! Small portions so order 2! We also ate at LaTrattoria which is Italian. It was ok. Not too much of a selection but it is in the same area where the buffet is so you could grab stuff over there to eat too. The buffet was great especially if you are a breakfast eater!If you are not in to the beer they serve there (Presidente) then go upstairs by the lobby to the Lobby Bar. They serve Bud Light, Budweiser and MGD plus Premium Brand liquor. The entertainment was great. Our only complaint about the resort was the heat. It was very warm in all the restaurants, the casino and even our room. It feels good once you walk in after being in the sun, however after you are in the A/C for a while that even begins to feel warm. Like I mentioned above, we were in building 2 which is closer to the beach, however this proved to not be a good thing because it was a long, hot walk to go to the lobby (where a lot of the restaurants are). At night, things are lit up very well either and the path from the bridge that goes over the pool to the buildings are just big stones so they are very uneven and you can easily twist your ankle.To sum it all up, it was great except for the heat with high humidity and that you need to get to the restaurants really early. The hotel was very clean and the staff was friendly and helpful.

<Content>A Dreamy Vacation? Hola to All,We just returned from 7 days at the Dreams Resort and Spa July 18-25 in PC (previously known as Sunscape).The transfers were fine (road a little dumpy).Upon arrival not greeting with towels or drinks :(.On to the reception desk were a somewhat less than attentive man gave us info and pointed to were the World Cafe was for lunch.We spoke Spanish but still no smile.Our rooms were in building 2 third floor. My room was comfortable, clean, but the beds had hair which was not mine on the blanket.My daughters room and a dirty pillow and ants in the BR, tub. The maid sprayed with a RAID spray which made the room stink.The AC is NOT what Americans are accustomed to but our room was cool.Daughter room AC did not cool off and was warm. We called the front desk and a tech came to adjust it , but it never was as cool as ours.On to the beach which was nice water calm left side soft sand.The drinks were sweet and abundant. The restaurants foods were good but the service throughout was always hit or miss. Some days you got what you asked for somedays not.Please remember all the meals are gourmet style, (small) but you are allowed to order whatever you like.The shows were entertaining.Most of the restaurants have AC not what we are used to in the USA. So bring a hand fan.I felt like I was in constant hot flash, lol...Our main complaint was I do not believe the hotel staff is trained to pay attention to detail ...for eg...at the spa BR had no paper and I had to tell 3 different people before I received paper. At times at breakfast no one asked if we wanted coffee, or tea, at times water was ordered and we never got it. I noticed the staff either in the reception area, bars, restaurants talk to each other and at times ignore the customers ( not good)These are minor things I suppose since we had a safe and lovely time but I am comparing it to the IberoStar Bavaro where I would return to next time.Would we go back to PC: yeswould we return to Dreams: noConclusion: bring wash cloth at times there are none.The AC seems to work better on the first -second floordont drink the room water--EVER- only use the bottled one (same kind they use in the restaurants)If you want premium liquor ask for it.Happy Travels

<Content>Dreams Punta Cana is a Dream Come True This was my third stay back at Dreams Punta Cana, my first stay since the resort was upgraded from Sunscape The Beach. Let me just say I LOVE what they have done with the place. I thought it was great before, but now it's even better!My kids LOVED the new teen club. They made lots of friends during their stay and enjoyed having a spot of their own to hang out in.I think the spa at Dreams Punta Cana is second to none! I love the hydro therapy area. If you get a massage, which I HIGHLY recommend, then you can use this area for free and it was well worth the time I spent in there.Food was amazing as always....always top notch.We saw a large wedding take place while we were there. Have to say I was a bit jealous. I wish we had this option when we were engaged. I talked to some of the wedding guests the next day and everyone said the ceremony and reception was beautifully done.

<Content>It's more like a 2 Stars Hotel Here are our observations:1- The country of Punta Cana is unbelievably poor and we did not feel safe outside of the resort, so stay inside the resort. 2- Food was average. 3- Rooms are too small and infested with bugs. Mattresses are so hard that feels like you sleeping on the CONCRETE. Almost every gusset that we talk to had backache. Be ready to pay a visit to your Chiropractor. 4- Do not use the bridges at night if you crossing over, cause they wont turn on the lights at night. 5- Buy some kind of health insurance before you go there unless if you want to pay $308 to hotel Clinic.6-Hotel Clinic waiting area is out door, so not only you are suffering from stomach ache and diarrhea but also you have to put up with Heat and humidity.

<Content>The good and the bad Just spent 7 days at the resort. Excellent grounds, food average to above average, great service from the staff. Some of the negatives - you never know how your room will be furnished daily - some days no wash towels, no coffee cups or just one, same for towels or bath mat. A simple check list for the maids sure would go a long way. The Premium liquor would run out by mid afternoon at the pool bars and you would be left with their house brand Normandy and they did not resupply til the next day. Air conditioning in the restuarants, lobby and common areas and casino is non-existent - even though the temp is 85-90 degrees. The pool closes at 7:30 PM (even though they have lights in it -not turned on) The external lights on the room balconies shut off at 11 pm or so - not to comforting from a security standpoint. Understand some of the buildings lost their room air conditioning - ours was OK - my brothers room lost it twice in our building - but not whole building. Check in and check out a breeze - transportation also satisfactory to and from airport. 1 hour ride.

<Content>Dreams was Great Went for our honeymoon and really enjoyed the resort. Found it to be well-maintained. Had honeymoon suite which was great, jauczzi tub on balcony was awesome. Room cleaned twice a day and had no complaints.Food was good...variety with all the restaurants. There is a bit of a wait at night but nearby bars make the time go by. Bars were good, though drinks not very strong. Usually need to ask for it to be stronger. Beer never that cold...overall refridgeration is not the same, but to be expected in a 3rd world country.Staff is great, very helpful. All bartenders and entertainment staff were fun, friendly and made stay enjoyable.Pool well kept and could usually find chairs. Beach a bit rocky in the water, not clear like I was expecting, but then again on Atlantic side.Would highly recommend.

<Content>Loved Hotel, but hate Thomas Cook! Just came back from Dreams Punta Cana. Loved the hotel and the staff were great, well all apart from Miserable Raul at the pool bar (he shouted at me when he didn't understand what I wanted, and laughed at us when we said we were leaving the next day). The choice of food and restaurants are excellent, although you need to get a table before 7pm, if you don't want to wait an hour or two to be seated. We waited 2 hours for Oceana one night and 1 hour 20 for the Sea Side Grill another night. Not much shopping in the area of the resort, so don't go there hoping to shop. I loved the hotel, but the real dissapointment and what really spoilt the holiday was Thomas Cook. 15 kilos baggage alloance is no where near enough. The inflight entertainment service did not work on my row, so my 5 year old son could not watch the films on a 9 hour flight(we were offered 1 free drink as compensation. My mother pre-ordered champaign before the departure date, which I had to ask for 4 time (in the end I went up to the back of the plane to get it myself. One of the stewardesses ignored me for 5 or so minutes, then served me, but when it came to one of the other people in my group, she was very rude and abruptly said she had things to do as well. My suitcase was half empty going out and the same on the way back (as I said there was not much in the way of shopping), they were going to charge us $96 coming home for 5 kilos over our 45 kilo alloance (there were 3 of us in my group). We just squeezed more clothes into our hand luggage. There was also no communication between Thomas Cook and the hotel, which ruined my sisters 2 week stay and wedding. They were promised a free upgrade to the honeymoon suite as there was so many of us going (22, 9 rooms booked), but on arrived, they were told they would have to pay an extra $100 per night for the honeymoon suite, and instead squeezed them into a cramped room two floors up, where they would have to carry a pushchair up and down the flight of staires everyday, (no lifts). We paid extra for pool views, which we did not have and my mother requested a ground floor room as she has very bad knees, but she was next to my sister two floors up. I would reccommend the hotel, but deffinately not Thomas Cook. If you have booked with them already, travel lightly and don't expect to get anything you've paid extra for, requested or been promised!

<Content>Had a blast at Dreams resort and spa My boys and I went to Dreams Punta Cana from 6/13/08-6/20/08 and we can't wait to go back next year. The food was okay but the staff,especially the entertainment staff, were super friendly and made it a great fun place to visit. The night shows were a lot of fun and absolutely every interaction I had with the staff was incredible! I loved the fact that they allowed the locals to come to the resort only a few days a week. The most fun were all the activities they had scheduled every day. If you did them the entertainment staff made the games way more fun....The people were incredible and it was their hospitality that will bring us back next year. In addition, the game area was a hit for my two boys 8 and 11! I never expected to find a Wii and Xbox on site for all to play!!! The adults loved the Wii as much as the kids....Thanks Usher, the Dominican 50, Melkis and Michael Jackson, Vladimir and all for some great times!!! The wait staff William and Willey were also great and so very kind to my boys and I!

<Content>Enjoyable Vacations at 'Dreams Punta Cana' Liked: friendly, courteous and, professional atmosphere. All employees went the extra mile to make everyone feel at home. Kudos to 'Black Angel', Luis  Vladimir! -- Well kept grounds --The 鈥淐ore Zone鈥?helped pass the time with it's Archery and Rifle Shooting competitions, WII and, other games, whenever the sun was too strong on the beach. -- Sand area is well kept. Loved to have daily champagne as much as desired. -- 6 restaurants made meals a daily adventure. -- Spa was a good experience too. Massages by Rosa and Raquel did the 'relaxing' trick. Daily activity Flyer Sundial is a good idea -- Good amenities overall.Disliked: not a swimming beach. It's rocky. Items at the store are too expensive: $1 per 3 Band-Aids. Stamps to Cuba: 2 stamps for $3 (dollars not pesos)Recommendations: keep the 'Core Zone' in good shape. Bring more variety in vendors (Mond., Wed.  Fri.) the same articles 3x/wk can get boring. -- Some kind of reminder by the beach area, of coming activities, as it's easy to forget about the time while sunbathing.

<Content>best holiday yet Just got back from Dreams, there for 2 weeks, did'nt want to leave.The weather was great, the food was very good, the entertainment was excellent. Without 50cent, Mickey Mouse, Usher, and the dancers, the holiday would not have been the same without them.Everybody working at the resort puts in so much effort to make it right. You can find faults if you look for them, but they were small and did not interfere with the holiday.The trip from the airport is the worst part, not to bad during the day but at night a lot worse.The rooms we stayed in were excellant, block 4, adjoining rooms, housekeeping kept things clean, and towel art was nice.The pool is excellant, kept spotless.The World Cafe does some lovely food, we found lunch time especially good.The other resturaunts were very good, but some of there menu's are a bit limited.We did not find the hawkers at night much of a problem, just say no and carry on. One thing to watch out for if you have teenage kids is the disco is over18 and the security does enforce this, as is Bordeaux.Overall a great holiday.One big downer is Air France, would not send my worst enemy with them, and if we return to Dreams it will not be with them.

<Content>Annoying Americans This was our fourth visit to Dominican Republic so we had several locations and hotels with which to compare Dreams Punta Cana.Location of hotel is ok but beach a bit disappointing as the area designated for swimming has a lot of rocks on the sea bed but the area where the boats came in and out of was lovely, unfortunately a member of staff kept blowing his whistle and calling the swimmers out of that part!The beach sunbeds are diabolical - terribly uncomfortable and many have not been repaired and are coming apart making them even worse! The sunshades are made from wooden frames covered with palm tree leaves. They look lovely but some are so low off the ground as to be virtually impossible to get underneath and also get extremely hot as no air can circulate!The food bar on the beach was most unsavoury - burgers, sausages and hotdogs were cooked on the beach and there were bowls of salad and cheese partially covered with torn bits of cling film etc. The food was covered with flies not to mention filthy hands - it was disgusting.The hotel itself is quite nice but the rooms were rather disappointing. This year my partner and I decided to upgrade our room to deluxe but discovered on arrival that this simply meant exactly the same room as standard but with a pool or sea view. Our room had a 'sea view' - just able to see a bit of sea over the top and through some rather tall palm trees! Not good value!The hotel pool is very impressive and runs practically the length of the hotel blocks but is is very shallow and gets very warm in the heat of the day so making swimming not at all refreshing!!Generally the hotel food was pretty good but the Japanese restaurant was poor. My partner also got stomach problems on the two occasions we ate at the Seaside grill restaurant although the food tasted reasonably good! The breakfasts were great though especially the omelettes and the brilliant smoothies freshly made by Merecedes.We still had a good time in spite of the niggles and would have had a good holiday but what was worse than anything and unlike any other place we had stayed in Dominican Republic was the DREADFUL Americans. The first week was quiet and enjoyable but the second week the Americans arrived en masse. They were so loud and obnoxious as only the Americans can be. They seemed totally incapable of talking in normal voices - they had to shout to oneanother so everybody within 100m could hear every word! and they appeared to always be talking about real estate and how much money they had made. They spent much of the time in and around the pool drinking heavily. The language was appauling and these were not young people as you may expect, but middle and late middle aged adults, particularly women. They were the worst of Americans and it was apparent they were rather poorly educated. Dominican Republic is probably a very cheap destination for Americans hence the quality of Americans who holiday there.In conclusion I would say that the hotel is generally ok and the staff were brilliant but if Americans are not your favourite race - DONT STAY IN DREAMS PUNTA CANA !!!

<Content>What a lovely holiday...... Hi,We have just got back from two weeks staying at the Dreams Resort and Spa (3rd - 17th July 08), i can't believe the bad reviews that this hotel has recieved.....A couple of weeks before me and my boyfriend were due to go on holiday, i checked reviews for this hotel and after reading some of the reviews i was really concerned about our holiday. However, please do not believe everything that you read.Our holiday was booked through Portland meaning that we flew with Thomsons, we had a very good flight and really enjoyed the benefit of the touch screen TV's on the back of all seats. You get a good choice of films, however there is an option to upgrade for 拢5 to get a few more films, which is well worth doing on the way out. We arrived on time at Punta Cana's airport, as some reviews have stated this is not airconditioned, however it is a lovely airport and you are not there that long to be too troubled. (Don't forget that its $10 to enter the country  $20 to leave).The bus ride to the hotel takes about an hour, it is a very bumpy journey as the roads are not in great condition but as you will see when you get there, it still shows signs of being a developing 3rd world country!We arrived at our hotel and the reception staff were very friendly and helpful, through Portland we had booked a Deluxe room. Our room was nice with a balcony looking out towards the sea, the bed was massive, very comfortable. There is a good sized TV together with a DVD player. In all rooms you have a safe (at no additional charge) and a little drinks fridge filled up everyday. The blocks of rooms were very clean but did look like they needed a lick of paint altho it looked like that this was beginning when we were leaving. The grounds of the hotel are very green and really nice, they have a few parrots and 4 flamingos around the grounds. We used to take some bread from Breakfast to feed them and the fish in the ponds. When we were not on trips we would be on the beach, we didn't actually once go in the pool, not because it was bad (actually very clean and quite impressive), but it was so hot round the pool and there was a lovely breeze everyday on the beach. The pool stretches all the way from the first block of rooms down towards to beach, It looked very nice and had loads of floats and climbing bits of the kids. There is a big swim up bar at the end of the pool, which i would imagine is great for chilling out. The beach is lovely, the entrance to the sea is slightly rocky but if you walk round the beach to the left of the hotel, there are some lovely bits of the beach to relax and snorkel. Make sure you take a walk along the beach, me and my boyfriend walked for about a mile there are some great views. Whilst on the beach, there are waitresses walking up and down taking your drinks order, which is great, make sure you try the cocktails of the day. We used to give them a couple of dollars a day tip and they were always asking us if we wanted fill ups. Between 12-3 there is a beach BBQ if you don't fancy walking back through the grounds to the buffet. The hotel had one buffet resturant, this is where you can get your breakfast , lunch and dinner. This resturant caters for all nationalilities and the food was of a high standard and plentiful. You can also get breakfast and lunch at the Sea Side Grill which is located near the beach/end of pool. There are 7 other resturants which are lovely, we ate in all of them and found the food to be really tasty. If you do go to these resturants beween 7 - 8.30 expect a little wait, asthis is peak time. We had no complaints about the food the whole holiday, well apart from putting on about 1/2 stone!! Remember that this is a 500+ room hotel, so don't expect Gordon Ramsay every night, but the quality is good.We didn't really get to know the entertainment team like some people, however they did put on a good show every night. if this doesn't really interest you, most nights showed a decent film on the big screen or you could try your luck in the casino.....Whilst we were there we booked 4 trips through Thomsons. - Monster Truck SafariWhich took you round the real Dominican, going to see villages, schools and even meeting a Voodoo Doctor! Was our best trip and is a must. - Speed VentureWhich was a half day trip, you get picked up from the hotel and taken to Bavaro which took an hour to get there back along the bumpy road. On this trip you get to drive a mini speed boat along the coast, stop off for a bit of snorkelling and then drive the speed boats.- Carribean fesitivalGet to interact with Stingrays and go snorkelling with 6ft nurse sharks (timid and safe), great experience. Another half day trip, goes from the same place as the above. - Trip to SaonaGet to go on three different types of transport, paddle boat, powerboats and catamaran, spend 2 hours on the island where the Bounty advert was filmed, this is also a must. Also stop off at Casa de Campo golf resort with artists village in the style of 16th century italian village (visitors reportedly include Bill Gates, Sting etc) so v v v posh.To summarise, the Dreams Resort is a great place for a competitive caribbean break and would recommend it to any of my friends or family. We both had a lovely time and normally we don't like going back to the same place twice however i would have no hesitation in returning.If you did want to ask me any questions, just drop me an email and i am more then happy to answer any of your questions.

<Content>Not All Bad - Not All Good Travelled to Dreams Punta Cana from July 5, 2008 - July 12, 2008. First, as far as travel to the resort, it is not fair to judge or expect the condition of the roads to North American roadssince this is an up and coming tourist area. They currentlyare constructing new roads/highways for access to hotels.Upon arriving to the hotel, we were greeted pleasantly by the hotel staff. Champagne and cold towels were provided uponarrival. Francisco checked us in at the front desk and was extremely professional, helpful, courteous and pleasant. He was a pleasure to deal with. The Rooms - Our room was kept extremely clean with morning cleaning service and evening bed turn down service. The room refrigerator was always stocked and we received towels two times per day without being asked to do so.The bed sheets and pillows smelled. However, we believe the smell is actually the mattress and pillows not the coverings. This is due to prior guests coming from the ocean and not showering and proceeding to sleep on the bed. The beds were not attached to the headboards which would become an issuewith noise. The sofa in the room was not clean and personally would not sit on it. There were some bugs but this is a tropical country and is to be expected in addition the rooms were fumigated during our stay. We did not notice chemical odors when this was done. The air condition did not seem to work properly and we tried to turn the ceiling fan to # 2 and it was as if it were going to fall from the ceiling since it was not attached properly. The shower has only a half of a glass door and causes the water to drip out of the shower onto the floor. Since we were on the second floor we do not know where the water would be going to. Every night a schedule of the next days activities, restaurant information, etc. is provided in your room.The Restaurants - The buffet food was okay - was of acceptable quality. Very clean and always restocked. The staff was very friendly and helpful. However, as far as the restaurants are concerned, we went to the Oceana which consisted of a 1-1/2 hour wait and an additional 1 hour wait to receive our meals. The food in this particular restaurant was not that good, not worth the aggravation and would have preferred at that point to stick with the buffet. We did not attempt any other restaurants at the resort after the experience with this restaurant. During our stay the Oceana and Sea Side Grill alternated nightly for dinner so they were not both open every night as advertised. The Italian restaurant is a joke..........it is located in the buffet area with two rows of tables to the far right side with red and which checkered tablecloths placed on them. When eating at the Italian restaurant you need to go to the buffet to get your own salad and walk back to the buffet to retrieve your dessert. Definitely not a separate restaurant so don't be fooled by the number of restaurants Dreams claims to advertise.Fruit Stand - Located next to the pool there is a fruit stand open from 11:00 to 2:30 each day. There is a very pleasant lady cutting fruit for people however, we witnessed her several times cutting fruit and putting it into her own mouth with her fingers going into her mouth as well, licking her fingers and proceeding to grab another fruit and cut it up for people. This is disgusting, unhealthy and unacceptable behavior. To clean the utensils and fruit she had one bucket of water that was continuously used and emptied at the end of the shift. Yuck !!! Yuck !!! Yuck !!!The Beach - We had plenty of selection of seating at the beach however the resort was not filled to capacity. The beach itself was not top quality. There was seaweed but that is expected when going to the beach the problem is they manually clean this and should acquire motorized equipment for this process. The ocean itself is very rocky with sharp and big boulders directly in front of the resort. Definitely need water shoes but would highly recommend for safety reasons to go to the left of the resort for ocean enjoyment. Kayaking and sail boats provided which was fine. The water trampoline advertised is for children only and was only open the last 2 days of our 8 day stay. They claimed the trampoline was in need of repairs. We did pay to go on the banana ride which is pulled by a boat and is 15.00 us dollars per person for 15 minutes of riding. The equimpment needed to be inflated when we first got on it and quickly was deflating while being pulled around at which time we elected to end the ride.The pool - Huge.........but the water is extremely warm in the pool which is a concern for growing bacteria. Even though they clearly add enough chlorine to the pool. There are alot of children present which for us was not an issue since we were travelling with a child and welcomed any friends for her to play with. If you are looking for a resort that does not have any children do not go here......this is definitely a child friendly resort and is advertised as such. So other posters complaining of too many children at this resort did not do their research on this resort before booking their vacation.Explorers Club - The childrens club seemed to be extremely organized with a daily schedule for children to keep them busy.They give you a cell phone so that they can contact you for emergency purposes.Sports Zone - Consisted of ping pong tables, pool tables, Wii, etc. this was entertainment for the kids but did have a bad odor we are guessing the septic system was located somewhere near this location.Entertainment - The entertainment staff seemed to work very hard at their jobs and tried to interact with guests in the buffet. The props should be of better quality however the staff works such long hours and continue to keep their great attitudes.Movies on the Beach - Dreams advertises this however, we did not happen to see this on any given night. We did seesetting up of what would be a movie but do not believe an actual movie was shown. It was not shown on the daily schedule of any night we stayed at this resort.Sick/Illnesses - We (3) did NOT get sick during our trip. This is the second trip to Punta Cana for us. We did not get sick from food or water on either trip. It is unfair to place all blame on the resort or staff for the stomach illnesses. First, they warn you not to drink their water and provide an unlimited supply of bottled water to all guests. This means - use the bottled water to brush your teeth, use the bottled water to make coffee in your room. The popular alcoholic beverages (Bahama Mama, Pina Colada, etc.) have alot of coconut juice in them. This coconut juice is a NATURAL LAXATIVE. This information is relayed to guests upon orientation at the resort. They are providing this information to guests so that guests do not get upset stomachs. We are very sure the resorts in Punta Cana, DR make every effort for your vacation to be a pleasant one and try to warn guests of things that could complicate your stay. We did witness guests (more than 1) picking food up with their bare hands and putting it back on the buffet after examining it and/or smelling it. This is unacceptable, maybe people do this in their own homes but this behavior is unacceptable when in the company of other people/guests. After all, we do not know if these people have clean hands, had a stomach virus the previous day, etc. You do expect to see children do this (hopefully not, but it does happen) but definitely not grown people. I even witnessed a guest eating a chicken wing, licking her fingers then putting her hand back into the food of the buffet, without using the tongs provided. This resort provides more than enough tongs to retrieve food - people need to use them and not their hands. Overall All - We Enjoyed Our Stay at Dreams Punta Cana, DR. However, if you are paying for a 6 Golden Apple or 5 Star resort this is definitely not worth the money. We have stayed in Mexico before at a 6 Golden Apple resort and indeed was a 6 Golden Apple Resort. We believe the rating standards in Punta Cana are lower. If you are paying more than $ 800.00 US Dollars(before taxes) per ADULT for an 8 day 7 night stay at this resort you should consider travelling elsewhere. We paid to go to a lower rated hotel which closed for renovations and were upgraded to this hotel. For the money we paid - this resort was acceptable. However, after reviewing how much this resort normally charges, under no circumstances would we have been happy with the results.

<Content>Wonderful Wedding and Vacation! My wife and I just got married at Dreams! Our party of 70 guests was there July 8-15. We had an unforgettable trip! After reading reviews for the past year, it confuses me to think back about some of the negative reviews I have read. Not to say the resort is perfect, but my takeaway is that it is what you make of it. First of all, people don't seem to remember that they are in another country and thus you need to understand that there are many things that are done differently whether at this resort or another. My wife and I consider ourselves well traveled and if anything we felt as though the resort goes out of their way to cater to both Americans and Europeans. Since it is not fair to review the transport to and from the resort, I will not include this as part of the review and I will just say that it is a rough ride.  The resort itself was even more beautiful than I was anticipating and the pictures don't do it justice. Check in for 70 went well with just a few minor hiccups that were quickly corrected. We had one person that was in building #4 and asked to be changed. It appears that not all of the buildings have gotten the room upgrades yet. Other than that, everyone seemed to be happy with their rooms. They are not the nicest rooms I have ever been in, but they were more than adequate and you spend so little time there that it really doesn't matter anyway. The resort is very spread out and if you don't want to walk medium distances from place to place, this is not the resort for you. I personally feel that it gave the resort a better feeling and made for a more enjoyable stay. The resort puts you into the landscape rather than a large stand alone hotel. There are restaurants in two general areas (one by the lobby and the other by the beach). Almost everyone thought the food was much better than they expected. The French and Mexican restaurants got great reviews overall and even the World Caf茅 (buffet) was well liked. Although only one person got really sick, many of the people had minor stomach problems which can only be expected do to all of the different foods and liquids that you will eat and drink. We all tipped the staff throughout the week and it was great to feel a sense of giving back to the community. That being said, I don't know if it got us better service really. All of the staff is amazing. We were greeted with service with a smile in almost every instance. There are a lot of families throughout the resort, however I personally don't feel it took anything away from our experience. If you are looking for a quiet couples retreat, there are other places that would better suit your needs. The best thing about this resort was that whatever your mood, you could find the right atmosphere. There was always someone drinking during the day at the swim up bar, always some game to play and also plently of places to lay quietly. The beach was much better than I imagined. Sea weed in the ocean is not the resort's fault, and really there wasn't that much of it. The beach was beautiful and chairs were always plenty. There is a great reef just off the beach that even a first time snorkeler could conquer. There were a surprising amount of fish and aquatic life there. If there was El Presidente here in the states, I would drink it constantly. It was delicious. There is always a place to have a drink during the day or night. My one complaint was that the bars closed at 12am and could have stayed open later. There was an after hours club, but it was difficult to talk and not for everyone's taste. Other than that, the resort was great and if I could do my wedding all over again, I would pick this resort. I will be reviewing the wedding itself on the Dreams forum on their website as I have many things I feel might be helpful for couples. I will say overall it was wonderful and we had an absolute blast! The beach setting is beautiful. Good luck in your travels.

<Content>Just Lovely Just returned from Dreams two days ago and had a fantastic experience! The staff is so hardworking and friendly, beautiful well kept grounds. The beach was very nice, and I'm picky! For the best beach, it's true what the other reviewers have written- go to the left to avoid rocks. I'm not a pool person but the pool at Dreams is extraordinary and we spent a lot more time there than I would ever have predicted! We took two excursions- the jungle tour and an ATV trip and I recommend them both as a way to get off the resort a little bit and see something of the countryside. The food was, I have to say, inconsistent. Occasionally it was outstanding ( especially the Dominican specialties), sometimes average. Our room was small but comfortable and attractive, well situated. I have read the reviews on this site and am aware that some people have extremely rigid and inflexible expectations, so if you're one of those maybe go elsewhere (like home, or the Four Seasons). Everyone else should have a great time, and maybe I'll see you there next year! Can't wait!

<Content>loved it...mostly i have just returned from dreams. i have stayed at secrets punta cana, palladium, three different Sandals, iberostar jamaica and a few other all inclusives. i loved this resort. my aunt and i went for a mini vacation. i was a little nervous after reading some of the reviews. the ride from the airport is long and bumpy. the same as it is in jamaica and other 3rd world countries. the resort was beautiful and every single worker at the resort was extremely nice to us. the activities people were great. we had so much fun. the lobby bar served the best drinks. fifty cent and usher were hysterical. i loved the food at all the restaurants except for hibachi. the only faults that i could find with this hotel is that the rooms are too warm and the pool is extremely warm. i couldn't sit in it for too long but i love the beach so we just went back and forth. the beach grill was the best hamburger i've ever eaten. i did see some kids but not many and believe me, i went to get away from my kids and they didn't bother me there. anyway, would definately return with my children.

<Content>Wonderful Resort Read many reviews before going to this resort and was a little hesitant about the trip. I don't know what the bad reviews were about, we found the resort to be just wonderful! The service was great, staff was very friendly, the food was better than most we have had at any all-inclusives (the french was the very best!), the rooms were very clean.........no mold, plenty of hot water, plenty of clean towels (twice a day), great spa services, the beach was beautiful!, even the public restrooms at this resort were always spotless! (better than any public restroom here at home). No problems with flight or transportation either to or from. Would I return? Most definetly!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Content>A nightmare I would like to forget. First let me start by saying Im not trying to be a negative person. Everything im writing is 100% true and actually happened to me all on this vacation. Im only posting this comment so other people wont overlook these bad reviews and make the same mistake i did.   I went to Dreams Punta Cana on Mon June 30th, 2008 with my boyfriend. We were supposed to stay until Mon July 7th but there were too many things going wrong to over look and just have fun. Im so angry with Liberty Travel (Brooklyn, N.Y. Kings Highway travel Agents Inna,  Manager, Rose) because they spoke very highly of dreams punta cana and did very little to make up for the problems we had. I will never book a trip with them again.  My flight was delayed going to punta cana, but that happens when you travel. Then we arrive in the Domincan Rep. airport. Very unorgainized and hot. No air conditioners anywhere in this place. They only use fans. Then we head to our tour bus picked out by Liberty Travel and wait for all the passengers to find their smashed luggage and board the bus.. They told us it was an hour long trip to the resorts. But for the small amount of miles you are traveling if they acutally built roads for you to drive on, it would only take 15 -20 mins. My trip to the resort took 3 hours b/c our bus broke down. It was very scary driving through broken, dirt roads with poor people sitting on the sides of them. Some local people walk along the roads with huge knives in their hand. You dont feel safe at all. Anything could have happened. The next bus came to pick us up and finish the trip. The 2nd driver drove very reckless hitting trees and fences and almost other vehicles. We got a flat tire on the 2nd bus and we rolled slowly the remainder of the way.  When we arrived at Dreams we found out that the dreams package we were supposed to have wasnt set up. That was the travel agents fault. But they said we would get our extra stuff included in the package. Then they brought us to our Honeymoon suite in Building 8. There was nothing special in it like our concierge said he would take care of. Like everyone else complained the room was so hot. The air conditioners are controlled so they cant be too cold or strong enough. I also noticed little ants on the sink and vanity. I called to complain. Right away someone came to fix the air condiitioner. I watched a man take apart the ceiling and drop it on the floor. I guess he restarted it or did something to make it cooler and a little stronger. Then he put the ceiling back together. Right there i knew how this trip was going to be. This is not a five star resort. More like a 2 star. The air was better but not like you have it at home or any other 5 star resort. They did give me the champagne and fruit basket , robes,etc later on but at that point i wasnt feeling happy to celebrate. I made my mom call the travel agent for me and explain what happend b/c the phones in the room were expensive. Inna the travel agent did nothing said I was a liar, what package?, its not her fault and i guess never told the manager of Liberty to call me. I tried to make the best of it waiting for the manager to call me.   The pool was full of kids jumping n screaming everywhere. If you want a chair by the pool, wake up at 7am and put your towel out to save them. Dont even think about a floating mat for the pool, there is only 20 for the whole resort. You have to fight people for them when they are not using them. They just hide them under their chair. The beach was full of seaweed and rocks. Not like the picture they show. That was what i booked my trip for a beautiful beach.  The food was terrible. Im from NY we have some of the best resturants in the world and this not what we expected for a 5 star hotel. Long wait times to eat. Very under staffed. Food made me sick. We ate at the french resturant and we ordered cheese cake and chocolate mousse. The cheese cake looked like an english muffin and the mousse taste like cardboard. The buffet for breakfast in the world cafe was ok but made me sick too. And No I NEVER DRANK THE WATER. Room service was just scary. Id rather have McDonalds. That night we had dinner on the beach in pitch darkness and that was the only somewhat edible food we had. By the third night the ant problem was bad. The ants had gone everywhere. They were crawling out of my clothes that were in the closet, on the night stand and phone when i picked it up to complain. We were disgusted. It was too late to switch resorts so we changed rooms, at 12:00 am. Now we were in honeymoon suite, building 7 which was the same. Very hot and had the same ants or whatever bugs they were. This room didnt even have a remote. We just went to bed with the smell of bug spray and waited for morning.  The next morning I got the manager of Liberty Travel on the phone. I told her we either wanted to come home or switch resorts. I mentioned the Excellence which was 10 mins away. I checked us out. We got in a cab and went to Excellence Resort. My travel agent didnt want to pay to ugrade me there even after everthing i went through b/c of where they sent me. The concierge saw i was very upset and gave me an excellence club suite without the perks of having the card but atleast it was something. The beach was beautiful here. The staff were very nice, spoke English and always tried to make you have fun.The food and drinks were much better here. The spa wasnt great though, very hot no air conditioner. The place over all more for couples, no kids. There was still a few ants I saw in the sink only but i think this problem was just everywhere in the Dominican Rep. They were in the spa, lobby, airport everywhere. My bf got very sick the last 2 days of the trip. His stomach was really bad. I gave him immodium but he couldnt leave the room. He was even sick for a few days when we got back home and had to call out sick from work. I have stayed at Excellence in Rivera Maya, Mexico and it was great. Not one problem. So I think it was just Dom. Rep. Punta Cana. I will never ever go back there. I will also never stay at a Dreams Resort anywhere in the world.  My trip cost me 3,500, Plus a huge phone bill for turning on long distance for my cell phone so i could call home and the travel agents, phone cards did not work there. $15.00 on another cab ride to switch hotels, $20.00 just to enter Punta Cana that no one tells you about, And a new luggage b/c i feel like the one i took is infested with ants and i dont want it in my house. I also had to dry clean and wash every item clothing i brought b/c of the fear of bugs. Dry cleaning cost me over $100 on things i had cleaned to wear there, that i didnt even put on. That is too much money too spend to go to a third world counrty. Its too much of a hassle for a vacation thats supposed to be a 5 star resort. More like an African Safari, not a luxury vacation. I have never had anything like this happen to me.   My advice, dont go to Punta Cana, or if you do pay with your Amex card so you can try and get your money back.

<Content>Great place but...... Let me start off by saying that I have traveled abroad many times and this was my third visit to Punta Cana. That being said I broke down the review to give insight on various parts of the resort. I just returned from Dreams Punta Cana on Sunday July 13th. I spent one week there. I overall had a great time and the place is very pretty. The one negative is they over book the hotel which I will get into later.Check In: Let's say it didn't go well. I had booked a VIP 2 bedroom suite and they sold it out before I got there. The staff was confused and at a loss what to do. They showed me various other rooms not getting the concept that is not what I paid for. I had myself, my wife and three sons (9,6 1 turning 2) and they tried putting me in a honeymoon suite with fold out beds and crib. Eventually we accepted a pool view w/ two connected rooms which where very nice and they gave me five free nights for a future stay for my inconvenience. Not bad.Concierge: They are useless unless you need something done in your room or need a bell hop. Remember they work for the hotel and if there is a problem with a booking like in my situation you will get no where fast except seeing various rooms. My suggestion is book through a travel agent/travel service such as Apple Vacations or Travel Impressions. We used Travel Impressions (VIP Travel) and they were great. From transportation to setting up tours. Sharon who is a sweet English woman helped me settle my room dispute has major pull at the hotel. One speaking with her and my problems were over.Grounds : The hotel itself and grounds are beautiful and are well manicured. There are flowers, palm trees and ponds every where. You will definitely get a lot of nice picture shots here.Beach: The beach is nice but the bad part is that it is on the ocean side which has waves and current. If you are looking for calm/crystal clear water like Grand Cayman you will be disappointed. However if you walk to the left past the water sports by a few feet it is much nicer. The waitress service on the beach is very nice and they are serving all day. There are also a lot of lounge chairs unlike many other resorts and you can always find a chair.Pool: The pool is the crown jewel of the hotel. It is massive and the landscaping throughout the pool is very pretty. The pool bar area which is right by the beach and Sea Side Grill is gets packed fairly quickly due to the location and the fact the entertainment staff hold a lot of activities here. The middle area is much more accommodating for people who just want to relax quietly or read a book. The top area of the pool is more kids friendly with the iceberg climb (my kids loved it). There are floats available but not many so bring your own or you can buy in the gift shop for like $10US. The chairs by the pool go super fast so you will have to reserve them early. I hate doing this but it is just how it works by the pool. If you wait to after breakfast you will not get one..I guarantee it especially the huts (covered with bed style).Food: the food is good for the Dominican Republic and much better than the other resorts I stayed at on the island. It is not United States cuisine. You are not going to get New York level food. But overall very good. I like the Sea Side Grill the best.Staff: very friendly and mostly helpful. The entertainment staff is great especially Mickey Mouse (little crazy) and Fifty Cent. The best is when we told them in passing my little one was turning two while we there. They actually told us to go the night show and sit in the first row where they brought my son on stage sang to him and gave him a cake. That won me over.Overall I recommend this hotel but just make sure you are covered with a travel service. That is my only complaint. If you have kids you will love it.

<Content>Brilliant fun!!!! I recently came back from a week at Dreams, we had a group traveling from different corners of the world to all meet there for a wedding. The venue was booked by the bride obviously and as i had agreed to go I was scanning trip advisor for months before and to be honest i was scared until I got there and saw it for myself.......... BRILLIANT FUN!!!The road from the aiport to the hotel is long and bumby..but it is not that bad.... if you have ever been down a country road anywhere.... it's the same...so I wouldn't even worry about that part....The resort staff were amazing, they were very friendly and helpful and all the english was very good. the place itself is beautiful and there is always staff around cleaning/serving/ helping etc.....We had members of the group who were unhappy with their allocated rooms, we had a couple with a toddler and they had given them a room with one kingsize bed...well the couple went back to the counter to complain that the room wasn't big enough and they would need to upgrade....the staff moved them in to a luxury top floor jaccusie suite.. with no extra cost it was an amazing room IF i had anything negative to say ... it is only that the decor is a bit dated and rooms with adjoining doors are very noisy.... for the first 3 nights there were these two american guys in the room next door and we could hear EVERYTHING they were saying at night when they came back from the bar/casino.... all their comments on the local talent views on women, bodily noises....then followed by smooshy phone calls to their girlfriends....ugg...yeah..so... that would be my one complaint...the adjoining doors were like paper....so avoid those unless you know the people on the other side....I learned alot about those two guys and their views.....i feel bad for their girlfriends...but thankfuly they left and it was quiet again...others in our group who didn't have an adjoining door didn't have any noise issues at all ... ANYWAY the food was really good.. i stuffed my face, the world cafe was the best for choice but all of the restaurants were really good and the service was wonderful and friendly.the pool is amazing.. I read all these bad reviews about how you can't get chairs etc..that is bullox. I do not wake up early... ever...and i was always able to get a chair... we would stroll down around 11 or 12 and there were always places to sit..... I could see that maybe if it were really busy at the resort..that it might be tricky...but not once did we or our group of 30 ever have any issues with pool chairs...the entertainment was a bit cringy and bad sometimes...but i have been to a few 5 stars in dominican and really.... their all bad - You can't expect Broadway folks it's the backwoods of the Dominican Republic.....by 10 at night or whatever i was always so tired from all the fun and stuffed with yummy food that i would sit and watch anything with a drink in my hand!!!! some of it was so bad it was hilarious....and that is just as good.SuggestionsBring a floaty raft thing of your own for the pool the ones provided by the resort were hard to find..but everyone brought their own cheap ones from the dollar store and they were great!!Bring a travel mug... yeah you think that is crazy BUT you float to the bar on your floaty thing...fill up your spill proof travel mug and let it sit in the cup holder of your floaty chair/raft or let it bob along next to you..... they will make your drink right into the cup for you...it's better that way you don't get random splashes of pool water into your drink!!! Have fun.. the resort is lovely and i had no complaints(exept for the adjoining door) it was family friendly and at the same time i didn't feel like i was surrounded by kids at anypoint....trust me.. I am actualy VERY picky and I will admit i can easiy be a snobby bi*ch I was very weary of this resort after reading the reviews...but honestly...it was brilliant!!!!enjoy don't be worried..it's great!! we were a group of 30...and everyone loved it.....

<Content>Drems do come true !! I was getting very worried about our stay at dreams punta cana after reading so many negative reviews BUT Im so glad we went. We had the most amazing time ever and would gladly go back tomorrow, we just didnt want to leave. We have been to many many destinations and we have all said this was the best. Its good for everybody young, old, couples and families and my family had a ball. We never met anybody whilst there complaining either!! This was our 5th time to dominican and we are already looking to book to go back in March 09 to re-new our vows, But we are having problems with the flights as they seem to be flying from manchester only :( If you decide to go to dreams you will have the best time ever, we did.

<Content>Love Dreams There have been so many bad reviews lately that I had to disagree with them. I travelled to Dreams in January 2008 with my niece. It was my 5th time at Dreams (Sunscape Beach). We are going back at the end of January 2009.Travel from the airport is an experience but as I told my niece you get to see the country side and how the Dominicans live. She really appreciates what she has at home. I have never been sick in the five times that have been there. I have eaten at all restaurents except the Japanese because my niece does not like Japanese food. My favourite was the Italian and the buffet. The entertainment staff is the best. There are so many activities during the day and night for everyone to participate or not. Meklis, Usher and Ricky are the best. They go out of their way to make sure that your holiday is fun. Can't wait to go back and see them and the rest of the staff. Our room was always clean and there were always plenty of clean (not smelly) towels. Our bar fridge was always stocked (beer and water). We never really had any problem with our rooms in the five years that we have travelled to Dreams. They even upgraded us one year and we did not have to pay the upgrade. We love the beach so we really did not use the pool. Lunch on the beach was great. Love the BBQ.I really can't say enough about the resort. Hoping to upgrade to Preferred Club and stay for 14 days!!The only bad thing was the vendors.. but we handled them, we just walked away!!JaLo and Suz

<Content>Dont listen to bad reviews! Stayed at dreams for two weeks in June and had the most amazing holiday! The place is beautiful, the gardens are immaculate, the pool is cleaned every morning, the sea is not crystal clear but the sand is golden and there were always spare sunloungers!Our room was lovely, nothing to complain about at all. Food was generally excellent, especially the French restaurant. The only minor complaint would be that we had to wait for a table nearly every night but never more than 30 minutes. I think some people are completely unrealistic in what they expect, the quality of the food was great especially when you consider they are feeding over 600 people every breakfast lunch and dinner! the breakfast buffet was amazing and had just about everything you could ever think of! The cocktails were also amazing!!Dont be put off by bad reviews, whilst we were there we did not meet one person who had anything bad to say about the place!There are people who set up stalls a few times a week in the hotel and they will try to get you to have a look, but nothing to worry about all you have to do is say no thanks and keep walking. after all they are only trying to make a living.We did go on an excursion to catalina island and although we had a lovely day alot of it was spent on the coach and I dont really think it was worth the money. We also went horseriding which was great althought the horses were on the skinny side!The weather was amazing, I cant believe people complain about the heat, its kind of obvious that its going to be hot in the carribbean in the summer months! The heat was fairly humid but by no means unbearable.The staff would bend over backwards to help you and work so so hard for very little money. i would advise it is a good idea to take plenty of one dollar notes for tipping.The spa was fab, expensive but what do you expect for a spa in a hotel. They do all the treatments for couples too which means you can have them done at the same time.Didnt watch any entertainment as jet lagged the whole holiday and not really our thing but apparently very good.Overall I had the most amazing holiday and was worth every penny! Some people are just to fussy and they are not happy unless they are complaining! If your in two minds about this place, i say GO!

<Content>Great time we stayed at Dreams from July 5, July 12, 2008. We had a party of ten people. I had emailed Jerry Three times requesting we all be in the same building. This did not happen. We were in three different building. When we tried to communicate this with the reqistration staff, they obviously could not understand English nor could we understand Spanish. It was a hopeless case so we just made the best of it. Our rooms were all fine. The facilities were great. The pool was awesome and the beach was OK. Having done my homework here on trip advisor we were all prepared with water shoes, but did spent the majority of our time at the pool. The food was very good. The staff was excellent. On several occasions we were given incorrect information from the front desk, but after speaking to the bell men this was corrected. If you have a handicappe they will transfer you by golf cart but just a simple phone call to 3000. The grounds are exceptional and well maintained. I have only one real complaint and that is the drive from the airport to the hotel...It is a real problem for people who get car sick. The hotel gift shop is very expensive and shopping with the vendors they bring to the resort is limited to mahogany, cigars, canvas painting and some Jewelry (no silver). like in Mexico. The shows are better than any other resort I have been to. I was very sceptial of this resort from reading some messages here on trip advisor, but not really sure those bad reviews were from the same resort I was. Yes I would return.

<Content>Great Vacation!! Well, I will make this short and sweet. Travelled with about 12 other family members. Two children included, under 3 years old.I just read a couple of reviews and I always chuckle when my fellow Americans get all hot and bothered by road trips on roads that are not eight lane super highways with twelve lane off and on ramps. This is Punta Cana, DR, not Buckhead, Atlanta...and after doing the due diligence on Trip Advisor and other places, we expected an interesting ride. I will admit it was long, but we were chatting up a storm so it wasn't half bad.Check in was smooth, and we were fine with our rooms. As mentioned, as long as we adjusted our expectations, and weren't looking for the equivalent of the Mandarin Oriental at Time Warner Center in NYC. It could have been a bit cooler, but we made our adjustments.This is a huge resort, we stayed in building 4 which meant a long walk to the beach. Big and beautiful swimming pool that almost covers the entire left side of the hotel. Plenty of room for everyone, and if you decide that you only want to hang by the swim up bar, then you will have to deal with the numbers there. Better to spread out and find a nice spot that's not crowded. Food was decent. The World Cafe Buffet was good, a great amount of variety. It could get tired if you did it more than once a day, so we made sure to go spread the love and do the other restaurants. Himitsu was cool, although we couldn't do the Japanese grill because of the girls. We had a 4th of July celebration on the beach that was very scenic and nice. The beach grill during the day was actually pretty bad, that was the one piece I was unhappy about.We loved the beach, although the life guards seemed to be more interested in looking cooler than the visitors as opposed to doing their jobs. I was firm with the vendors who would try to hassle us into trips or stuff; a simple not interested today, maybe later ended any conversations. If you are looking for nightlife, it ain't happening. And that was fine with us, as we were just looking to eat and then chill. The night entertainment was fine, and we went to see what the club was all about. Nice setting, but nothing like lousy DJing to mess it all up. But the young teenagers seemed to eat it all up, so it worked out for some folks. Would have been nice if the pool stayed open late at night.The staff were interesting. You could tell there was some kind of hierarchy amongst the workers and the higher up the chain, the more attitude you would get. Not much attitude, but you could sense some aloofness. They were friendly in general, and really nice, and I made it my choice to think it was genuine. All in all, this was a great vacation, and we all recommend Dreams as a place to visit. Just don't go there thinking you will be getting Ritz Carlton type service or amenities, 'cos this ain't the Ritz, people. It is Dreams Punta Cana.;-)

<Content>Some people can not be pleased! Ok, so I thought I should write my review on this Resort seeing as I read others on here for 3 months up to my holiday! First of all, after reading all these negative reviews I was really worried about going but let me tell you it was nothing like what some of these people say it is. Which doesn't suprise me because certain people/nationalities have expectations that are so high it would be impossible to meet them! My boyfriend and I are in our 20's and it was our first holiday together as well as his first time out of Europe and at an All Inclusive hotel. I have stayed in many AI hotels in Europe as well as another in the DR and this hotel was certainly the best one I have ever experienced. So to start we flew with Thomson, which was a great flight, we paid the 拢5 each so we could have on demand entertainment on board, this pleased my bf as he managed to watch 3 great movies he has been wanting to see. The airport is very nice, we didn't have to wait too long for our luggage.The drive to the hotel is not as bad as people say it is, yes maybe for some people who have never left the US or UK then maybe it will be a bit of a shock, I find it so unbelievable to think that people assume it would be like a drive in their own country! seriously people. Once we arrives we were greeted with the champagne and cold towels with was v nice, and we were checked in within 5 minutes - staff were great, helpful and friendly - our luggage was brought to our room shortly after. We were in room 6101 and before going I had read in almost every review that people had to change rooms because of problems so we were fully prepared to do this ourselves... well, there was no need, our room was gorgeous, it was v spacious, especially for the amount of time spent in there, we had two double beds, a sofa, tv in a cabinet (which was great because we stored our suitcases in after unpacking) and also had an alarm clock with Ipod connector. Great! as we were on the ground floor we also had a hammock on our terrace. The room was very quiet considering, right in the middle of resort, and also came with bathrobes  slippers. The restaurants were great, we loved the Oceana and Bordeaux - the steak was the best I have ever had! We loved the buffet too, especially breakfast. there is so much selection you will always find something - plus the fresh fruit and pizzas are great! There are lots of bars to choose from which are all great, if you want international brands be sure to ask for them. The Casino was good too - I have never played Blackjack before but I soon got into it - we went twice during our stay and had a great time, we weren't expecting to win but it was good fun playing. Entertainment was great, the staff work so hard and are not so annoying where the pester you all the time like in some other resorts. The pool was fabulous by far the nicest pool i have ever seen, Never short of sun loungers which was good. The beach was gorgeous, there is an area on the left side which is ideal for swimming, it makes me laugh that people complain about the sea having waves and seaweed - i thought it was paradise and I am sure you will agree. The grounds were beautiful and you will see parrots in tree's flamingoes all sorts - awesome! The Spa was amazing - seriously you will know you are in a 5* hotel if you go in here, its breathtaking. My bf treated me to a swedish massage on our last day and for $60 you get a 25 min massage and an hour in the spa - heaven! I think thats everything - overall we had the best holiday ever and would most definitely reccommend to anyone - couples, groups, families, and we will no doubt be going back! I would imagine in the next few months after the refurbishing has been completed (this did not affect any aspect of our holiday at all, in fact you would probably not notice it was going on) it will be even better! I do think that being british we are much more realistic, open minded and considerate when we travel - we do not expect the earth and make the most of the holiday we are on because we know that we are lucky to be experiencing such a wonderful culture when others are not lucky enough to do so. The holiday will be what you make it - if you go there thinking the worst and looking for things to complain about instead of enjoying the beautiful weather, the great food and drink and just relaxing and having a good time then I wouldn't bother getting on the plane! So thats my 2 cents worth - hopefully I have covered the important stuff. Enjoy!

<Content>Brilliant holiday - ignore the bad reviews!!!! We went to Dreams on June 14th for 12 nights and it was bliss! Yes shock horror on occasion I had to wait 5 mins for a drink......but guess what I hadn't exactly other pressing engagements at the time. Yes shock horror - one of the tiles in the bathroom was not exactly in line, but interestingly this did not cause me the trauma that it caused other review writers.The hotel, pool, rooms, service, food and weather are amazing. When I have travelled in the past I have always had stomach trouble (i.e Dubai, New York, Italy etc.) but I did not have any trouble here (despite for the first time ever, being really organised and bringing half a pharmacy with me!).Re the weather - don't freak when you look up the forecasts and it says 60% chance of rain and overcast. They only say that to cover themselves because it is the wet season - but if wet season means 32C sunshine everyday and the odd shower at night, I'll take wet season over our Irish summer anyday.Tips: Bring mosquito repellent and use it (esp when going to the seafood and french restaurant down by the beach). Also, if you have any small cosmetic samples etc. bring them for the maids - it might be just a lipstick to you but they cannot afford/access anything like that, so to see their face light up is a joy! If you really want to be a good Samaritan bring some toys e.g. dolls, colouring books and give to the priest who says mass in the hotel on Sundays - he'll bring them out to the children. This is a really poor country so try to give something extra if you can afford to!There is lots of entertainment and the tv has a wide variety of channels including some movie ones if you just fancy a night in.I will definitely go back and please don't let the other reviews put you off!! And have a dirty monkey on me when you go!

<Content>Had A Great Time!! WARNING: THIS IS A LONG REVIEW!!!ARRIVAL: What a wonderful experience we had at the Dream鈥檚 Resort in Punta Cana! My family of four arrived from Los Angeles, CA on Saturday June 28th. We stayed eight nights and departed on Sunday July 6th. We were there as part of a family reunion involving sixteen family members. I鈥檓 always a little nervous when traveling to a foreign country where English is not the primary language. I need not have worried; I was impressed with how organized movement through the airport was when we all arrived. They have a system where they direct you through the whole process. A system is in place for arrival, and another is in place when leaving, so it is almost impossible to not get to your destination. We booked with Apple, and the Apple Rep is at the airport looking people with luggage that have the Apple luggage tags. He directed us right to our Van, and we were off to the Dreams resort. Yes the roads are narrow, and riddled with potholes, but the drivers navigate with quite a bit of finesse through the cruddy roads. It took approximately 1 hour to arrive. Never did I feel like we were in danger while on the roads. Some of the roads we鈥檝e been on in Mexico come close to those in the Dominican Republic, but I do believe Dominican roads are worse. AT THE HOTEL: The Bellboys and driver took care of our luggage. We had nine bags (a side note- pack half the amount of clothes you think you need!) As soon as the van left, my hubby realized that he left his camera bag in the van. The driver was long gone before he realized that he left the bag in the van. I was ready to throttle him as he had his wallet, cash, credit cards, video cam, and digital camera in the bag. I thought that we would never see this stuff again. The bellboys let us know that everything would be fine and directed us to the concierge desk. A few phone calls were made, and voila, the driver was contacted and within fifteen minutes our camera bag was handed back to my husband. Everything was left untouched in the bag just as the staff told us and we were flooded with relief. The driver wouldn鈥檛 take a tip when he brought the bag back. I stuffed a $20.00 bill in his pocket anyway- We were so relieved! We then proceeded to check in. We of course got the cool wash clothes and Champagne while we were checking in. Check in went very quickly, and our rooms were ready right away. Very Friendly Front Desk Attendants! They went out of their way to give us adjoining rooms.ROOMS: We were given rooms 3210 and 3211. This was a family suite with an adjoining door. I had requested this room with Eileen Ostos the head concierge by email a couple of weeks earlier. She could not guarantee the room but did make a note on our reservation, and sure enough, what we requested is exactly what we got. There was no extra charge for the family suite. The rooms were very nice; comparable to many resorts we have stayed at in Mexico. The air conditioner worked very well in both rooms, especially when running the ceiling fans. I thought that the rooms would be very tiny after reading past reviews, but they were the size of a decent size hotel room. There is a sitting area and desk next to the king size bed. The kid鈥檚 room had two doubles and a desk. Both rooms had a safe (free of charge), and refrigerator full of beverages (fridges don鈥檛 cool drinks too much- so we always filled our ice bucket to chill our drinks). There was a balcony with a table and two chairs off each room, and the bathrooms were smallish- only one sink, but the shower had good water pressure. We did have a couple of things break in the room- a toilet flush handle, and door jam came loose after leaving the chain on in the kids room and one of them tried to let themselves back into the room with the cardkey. I called for maintenance and both were repaired within ten minutes, WOW was I impressed. The maids did a great job cleaning our rooms, keeping our fridges fully stocked, and giving us adequate towels. We also had thick and thirsty bathrobes (two in each room). There is turndown service each evening and the maid made sure that the kids got chocolates on their pillows. One night she left several for each kid. We had maid service EVERY day, and turndown service EVERY night, without exception. If your kids have a lot of electronics, bring a power strip with you, we brought two and used both. We had walkie-talkies, cameras, ipods, DVD players etc鈥?Oh by the way each room had a DVD player, and there were several English speaking channels on the TV including Denver affiliates and CNN.. RESTAURANTS: were pretty good. Oceano is closed for renovation. This was too bad because the restaurant has a great view of the beach- its open air and lovely. We ate at the Seaside Grille, the Japanese Restaurant, Patio (twice), the buffet and room service. My meals were all very good. My hubby鈥檚 were sort of hit and miss. He ordered steak. It was a little tough, but I had a killer skirt steak with peppers at the Seaside Grille, and the crab cakes and steak fajitas were very good at Patio. Omelettes were superb at the buffet for breakfast. The orange juice is very sweet and yummy as well. The kids especially loved having room service, and we ordered breakfast this way quite a few times. Also it was nice to order a snack late in the afternoon after spending all day at the beach. There was a very nice 4th of July celebration dinner on the beach. Food was good- they had a few problems with lighting though, so I鈥檓 not sure what all there was to eat that night- had trouble seeing some of it due to the lighting going out. Drinks were great; hubby loved the El Presidente brand beer. The kids had tons of 鈥渧irgin鈥?drinks and spent every afternoon getting soft served ice cream at the bar near the swim up bar. Some of our extended family ate at the French restaurant and said it was fantastic. I鈥檓 sorry we missed eating there, but we were late from our snorkeling excursion on the night everyone went. BEACH: We loved the beach. We are real beach people, love a little wave action, and the kids had fun riding the little waves at the beach. Yes, there were a few rocks, nothing spectacular though- wear water socks, and you have it covered. After a while you know exactly where the rocks are. The waves were mild, nothing like what we are used to in California and Hawaii, but the kids still enjoyed them. The beach was clean with not much seaweed. Had no problem getting beach chairs with the Palapas. Had great drink service by the staff while on the beach. We did bring bubba kegs and kept ice water or soda in them. They stayed cold all day long. We had lunch most days at the beachside grill. They had hamburgers, sausage, or hotdogs there along with corn chips and salsa and fruit. All was wonderful! There was a fruit stand by the pool too where you could get pineapple on a stick, watermelon, etc鈥?Never, and I repeat never did we ever have any food that was spoiled. Everything looked and tasted fresh. ENTERTAINMENT: Kids hung out at the Core Zone in the afternoon to play pool, ping pong, etc鈥?They also have a mechanical bull there, and it was hilarious to watch young and old alike get bumped off the bull. There was a Wii game console hooked up to a large TV there, and they had a mini disco complete with disco ball, for the younguns. Hubby spent a few $$ playing blackjack at the casino- never won, but we were there with other family members who did have some luck in the casino. We watched a few shows and the kids enjoyed them. The staff works very hard on their evening entertainment. We would have gone to more but were so tired after spending all day in the sun, and from all the excursions we went on. EXCURSIONS: Our favorite excursions were the Outback Safari- (It was great to meet and learn about the Dominican People, discovering how they make cocoa, coffee, cigars, etc鈥?, and Saona Island (although I could have done without the aggressive venders there). It takes a while to get there, but we were on a very comfortable air-conditioned bus, and received a great history/geography lesson. There was a good variety of tropical fish while snorkeling on the Stingray Bay excursion. Didn鈥檛 like that there were so many snorkelers all crammed in one small area of coral reef though, we felt like sardines. We have had much better snorkeling experiences in Hawaii. Also we went horseback riding. Everyone enjoyed the ride on the beach, but the horses were a bit small, some of the adults had very sore bottoms after their ride! TIPS: We did make sure that we tipped everyone, as the employees work very hard to make sure we had a good experience. I believe that they would work just as hard whether you tip or not, but I know that they really appreciate receiving the tips. The Dominican people all come across as very positive and happy individuals. They are very proud of their country, which was very evident to us. ILLNESS: All of us did get a little upset tummy while vacationing. I was sick first, my hubby next, and the kids towards the end of the week. When I say sick, I mean just a little GI disturbance, nothing to write home about. None of us felt sick for more than a day, and it didn鈥檛 keep us from doing anything- we were still able to function. My point is even though the water and ice there is safe to drink. The hotel does not use a filtration system, and the water is not safe to drink from the tap or shower. Bring Imodium and some Pepto Bismol just in case. I ate lots of salad and fruit, so that could have been what got me a little sick. Once I was over the little bug, I didn鈥檛 have a problem again. Ate whatever I wanted the whole trip.Overall great experience!

<Content>Very hot and you can't escape the children! I just returned from an 8 day stay at Dreams, Punta Cana. This was my 5th trip to the Dominican Republic. I have stayed at varying hotels in different cities on the island. Including top rated Secrets Excellence in Punta Cana. I feel I am very qualified to give you an honest review of this hotel.The other reviews are dead on about the drive from the airport to the hotel. It is long and bumpy. But it is the same drive to all the other resorts. I was prepared for the drive. I look at the drive as an adventure and an excellent introduction to the Dominican culture! Arrival to the resort was typical. Except we, there were 4 in our group, had all upgraded to the Preferred Club area of the hotel when we booked our vacation. I am so glad that we did! It was worth the extra money. As soon as the gentleman behind the counter saw that we were in the Preferred Club, he told us to have a seat and he would have someone take care of us. We had a private check in and concierge. No more than 5 minutes later, there was a concierge there to welcome us and take us to our check in. He was wonderful and spoke nearly perfect English. Actually, everyone in the preferred club area spoke GREAT English. My mother and neice checked into their room, a Preferred Club Deluxe Room, and they loved it immediately. My husband and I had a Preferred Club Honeymoon Suite. It was beautiful too. The rooms were both very clean and were in great locations. However, the problem with both rooms was the temperature. Their idea of a cool room and mine are very different. It was about 80 in our rooms the entire time! It never got any cooler. I am not a hot natured person, but the rooms just about killed me. I told the concierge about the temperature and he said he would have someone check on it for us. To my knowledge, nobody ever checked. I spoke with other guests at the hotel, and it was univerasal concerning the temperature. Every single person I spoke to had the same complaint. The rooms were just plain hot. I guess to the Dominican's it was cool. But to this girl from GA, it was hot! Speaking of temperature... The only break you get from the heat is in the pool. Most of the restaurants are cooled, but not very much. My poor husband was drenched in sweat at every single meal! Actually, he sweat all of the time! The food was average. Not great, but not gross. I never went to bed unsatisfied. I never got sick from the food or water while I was there for my 8 day trip. My niece did suffer for a day with a bad belly. I gave her some Pepto and she was back at the pool bar being a trooper within 24 hours. The reason for the low rating of this hotel is the children. I don't hate kids. I just don't want them on me 24/7. I knew before we booked this vacation that it was a kid friendly resort. I have visited a lot of kid friendly resorts in the past. However, the other resorts did a great job keeping the kids and families in one area and adults only in another. The children were constantly on top of you and there was no break from them at all. I also don't want to supervise children that aren't mine on vacation. It seemed that most of the parents seemed to disappear at the Swim Up bar and the kids were left to run around like crazy! The kids loved the bar and played around it ALL of the time. The kid situation was so bad, my husband and I didn't get in the pool the last 2 days of the vacation. I just couldn't go swimming one more time and have one more drink ruined by a stray child. Overall the vacation was very nice. The service was above par and the rooms were very clean. I just wouldn't visit this resort again or recommend it to anyone else.

<Content>Our stay at Dreams Punta Cana We arrived @ Punta Cana on Wednesday, July 2. It took us a little over 1 hr. to get to our hotel. We got to Dreams between 5  6pm. Check in went smoothly. When we got into our room (in building 4), it was musty, muggy,  warm. We dropped our stuff off, went back to the main lobby,  let them know that the AC wasn't working. Someone went  repaired it. We then noticed that the AC  fan work on a scensor. If you're not in the room, they shut off, same when you're asleep (not too pleasant). Anyway, we changed into our bathing suits, checked out our little balcony (which was nice, had a little table  2 chairs), went to the pool  saw that the pool closes at 7:30pm (a bit early for us). We ended up just going to dinner at the Seaside Grill which was pretty good, walked around a bit,  went back to our room.The entertainment was excellent  they give you a daily schedule with the activities  food schedule for the day which is good. Food was pretty good. Breakfast Buffet was good, as well as lunch @ the World Cafe, the Himitisu Japanses Restaurant (we ordered from the Chinese menu),  the Bordeaux (French Restaurant) was OK. Not a big fan of French food. We did have the romantic dinner on the beach  the food for that was great (bread, seafood ceviche, clam chowder, steak  shrimp, creme brule,  wine). Room Service menu was edible but not the best.The beach was nice. They have little tiki huts w/ lounge chairs underneath which keep you in the shade. The beach was sea-weedy but overall it was very nice. The pool  swim-up bar were the best part of the resort. We got sunburned our first day wearing SUNBLOCK! I would definatley visit the Dominican Republic again but I would not stay @ this resort. We wanted to go Dolphin Swimming  do other things but all of the activities were at least 45 mins away. We did have a minor ant problem in our room  our remote disappeared after room service came in. It took us 1 day to get a new one. Our cell phones had absolutely no reception (not a big deal) but they do have internet service ($4 for 15 mins). Oh  a small bottle of Aloe Vera  a stronger Sunblock cost us $30. Watch out for the sales people around the resort. They are VERY persistent  a total rip off. Take alot of singles for tipping. We enjoyed our stay  being fluent in Spanish made our stay easier, but we were looking forward to going home on Sunday. I give the entertainment  food 4-5 stars but the room gets 3. Good luck!

<Content>Amazing - Americans are NEVER happy I went to Dreams Punta Cana in June for my Honeymoon and we stayed for 2 weeks. I cannot honestly believe that people can give this place bad reviews! I will subtitle this review to make sure I miss nothing.The Pool and daytime entertainment--- Amazing! We always got great loungers no matter how late in the morning we got up. The Pool was cleaned ALL the time! There were always staff around to make sure it was really clean.IT WAS SO CLEAN THAT MY ENGAGEMENT RING FLEW OFF MY FINGER, WE FOUND IT IN 5 MINS THANKS TO THE PERFECT CLEARNESS OF THE POOL.The staff around the pool were really good (the bar staff not so much but oh well) and the entertainment was excellent! (50 cent, Usher and Stephanie in particular) Daytime activities galore both in the core zone, the beach and all along the lenght of the pool.The BeachI am scared of the sea so I cannot write a review fairly. My husband did cut his toe on some coral though.The Food and RestaurantsReally really good! Not repetative at all and an amazing choice. They were laying a new floor in the oceana restaurant, but they did not let this disrump anything as they simply alternated oceana and the seaside grill so people could still go to both. Very considerate.The japanese and chinese was my favourite and we had a fabulour waiter called LELI :DThe ConciergeReally good at sorting out all problems quicly and efficiently and they all speak really good english (this is throughout the hotel) - also excellent with card tricksAmericansDon't hate.... but they ALL moan too much! The good thing about this is that it brings the british holiday makers closer together, because we can have a good moan at how much the Americans moan lol.--- They think if they leave the big tip at the start, they will always get served first.Try relaxiing and making some friends!--------------- ps... This is not relevant to all americans as there was some lovely ones. In fact... everyone from Utah was really nice lolGood branded drinks, 24hour room service, nicely cleaned rooms, entertainment excellent!!! bingo bongo bongo bingo ba da da da da, cheep cheep!Ok, thats it....Victoria and Chris Horn(A.K.A - Chris the Loser 2, and Tricky Dicky Vicki)xxx

<Content>Wonderful for a last minute honeymoon! We booked our honeymoon 2 weeks before our wedding and were surprised the deal we got on flight+hotel. We looked at dozens of resorts in Do Re, Jamaica  Mexico and chose this one because it was something different. We wish the resort had golf, water skiing and boogie boarding though.We were at Dreams in Punta Cana 6/2-6/7/08.We were surprised how far the resort was from the airport but we were the first ones off the bus so we figured it was closer than many others. We were warned about the road/driving/riding conditions before we left.On our arrival we checked in right away and proceeded to our room when we were confronted by a man selling cigars next to the World Cafe saying he worked for the government and there was no need to hesitate. He talked my husband into buying boxes of what we thought were genuine Cohiba cigars.Basically we woke up every morning and went to the breakfast buffet, then to the pool, had plenty of drinks maybe a beach side burger or chicken sandwich and then took a nap in our room until dinner. I think we blew it up pretty good the first day or two and then we didn't want to drink many cocktails after that.My husband had the stomach flu the first couple of days. I never got sick but we both had really bad indigestion after being in the pool and sun all day and then going to a big dinner. We didn't use the tap water and we did have drinks with ice cubes in them but we didn't eat anything we thought might have been washed in bad water. Salad bar is a major no-no.I'd say breakfast was the best but the buffet got old after awhile. I don't eat fish or seafood so there were not many choices for me. I enjoyed the pasta pizza bar. Can't go wrong there. We enjoyed the Mexican restaurant and the French restaurant the best. The Chinese was kind of fast food tasting. PS....They eat Goat!We thought our room was great for what we paid. We had a King Junior Suite on the end of building #8. It was on the 3rd floor so the stairs were very slippery after it rained. I was only of the lucky ones to fall down the stairs! It was also very clean, our maid came back several times a day to see if we needed anything. *We left her a few dollars here and there. We always had plenty in the fridge, clean towels and sheets. The only thing we noticed is that the walls were cracked in a few places and it smelled musty.*The bartenders/wait staff also received a few bucks from us and there and they went well out of their way to remember our names and make us feel more than comfortable. It was well spent money! A bartender even watched out stuff for us while we went in the ocean. We were surprised to see he still had everything for us when we returned.We weren鈥檛 in the ocean very long. My husband spotted several large Tarpin while I attempted a dip and we decided if there are large fish around, there are probably larger fish around too. We over heard someone say they say a Man of War come right up to them on the far end of the beach. No Thanks! Not going to risk it with such a great pool to float around in. We booked a chartered fishing trip and didn't catch a thing but a major sun burn. We enjoyed being out on the boat though. The ride to the boat was very long. It was passed the airport.We also went to the shopping mall which was more of the same sort of stuff in the gift shops but more expensive and the people were really pushy. That was when the huge storm came through and we went back to the resort immediately. That was when the ceiling below the reception desk came crashing down. Thank god nobody was hurt. We got a ride on the golf cart back to our room because I was not feeling well and the concierge felt bad we were going to have to wait to get through the construction.My husband did the Kareoke and he was made that the leader cut him off before the end of the song. He said it was like The Gong Show! He was very upset but I tried to explain to him that they need to keep a schedule and maybe they were running behind?Over all we enjoyed our stay there. We had plenty of food, drinks and sunshine.It wasn't until we got home that we found out the cigars were fake and my business debit card was copied and being used illegally in FL to buy gas at a BP. I only used my card at 2 of the resort stores and that was it. They advised us to bring cash but there are no ATM's around. *Charge all of your purchases to your room and pay for them at the front desk before you leave.Good Luck and I hope you don't write this resort off due to all of the other negative reviews. We had a lot of fun:)

<Content>'Amazing' but not Perfect... Leading up to our trip we were a bit worried about all the negative reviews and wondered if they were justified or were just passed on by snotty, rich travellers who complain about everything. Although we loved our trip and would go back, we did find some areas where complaints were justified .  One complaint we heard a lot about was the ride to the resort. Yes it is long and bumpy, but it is a 3rd world country with no laws regarding driving except talking on your cell phone while driving, take it in stride. The location is spectacular. I actually welcomed its isolation from the other resorts. You could walk for miles down the beach without running into another resort or person, which we did! The welcome on arrival was nice. I cant believe some people would complain about not getting cookies or cold towels...boo hoo. Check-in was quick and we made it to our rooms right away.  The resort is absolutely gorgeous, great for pictures. The groundskeepers are working non stop to keep it looking perfect.Lots of foliage, and wildlife, occassionally you'll see a rabbit run across the trail in front of you, or a peacock. Complaints about no one speaking english is unwarranted and insensitive. As for no one at the front desk speaking english, is just bs. The staff, maids, groundskeepers, waiters were always friendly. Claude keep it up the good work you'll be manager one day! The entertainment at this resort is its best quality. Activities are all day, and the staff who put them on are excellent. Julio, MJ, $.50, Usher, M-Mouse, really make you feel welcome. The nightly entertainment is top notch, and its fun to watch the guys you hung out with during the day, performing at night. If you have children, this resort is a kids paradise and a parents. Compaints about the food are ridiculous, some people are just way too picky. The restaurants are fantastic. If the food at this resort is 'rotten' I have no idea what good food is. And selection? Crap, theres 7 restaurants and someone could eat only at the buffet all week and still not have the same meal twice.  The first legitimate complaint I've seen repeated on this board are the rooms. The first room we had was run down, with chipped paint, broken ceiling tiles, scratches on the walls....definitely not worthy of a 5 star or 6 golden apple status. Hopefully the renos will take care of this problem. Our AC was unbelievably cold, a lot colder than other rooms. Some of our guests had to switch rooms because there was no partition or curtain in the shower seperating it from the rest of the bathroom. We even had a few guests that found cockroaches in their rooms, not little ones either. Our second room, a honeymoon suite was in a lot better condition but the AC was weak, and there were a lot of little bugs, ticks I think, all over the room, even in our bed. We have the bites to prove it. The towel sculptures were a hit or miss with our guests, some received them others didnt.  Second complaint, would be the beach. Unfortunately its not the white sandy beach and turquoise water that you find more south and it is fairly rocky. Why they once named this resort Sunscape the Beach, eludes me. There is good swimming however, just make your way to the left side of the beach. Its strange because on our Outback Safari, not only 20 mins from the resort we went boogie boarding and the beach here was exactly as you would find it down south...strange.  Last complaint that Ive seen repeated are the vendors. I'm not sure if other resorts are like this, but every second night or so they put up booths up around the main part of the resort, with 3 guys per booth selling items all evening, and they can be pushy, even touchy. Although most are off the main walkways, they still rudely holler at you from a distance like downtown beggars trying to steal your change. Sometimes you have to dodge 5 or 6 just to make it to the lobby. Why the resort would think this is a good idea is beyond me. Hopefully they read these boards. The day time vendors who walk around the resort selling horse-back rides are no where near as aggressive and are mostly polite.  For anyone planning a wedding here the pictures you will have are breathtaking, just be sure if you have Dan as a photographer, he turns his cell phone off during the ceremony, and if he does answer it, to take a walk (dodo-head). Actually just ask for a different photographer. Juliana the WC is very on the ball. Any issues with concierge services talk to Nichola (spelling?), she is very thorough and speaks fluent english. Anyone looking to scuba dive though this is not your resort. Diving off the resort is less than par, and the diving excursions south are few and far between, as we found out. If you only do one excursion you have to do the Out-Back Safari. Although some of the stops seem a little fake and merely attempts to sell stuff, seeing the country side and real villages was really enjoyable.  All-in-all we had a great time. This resort is unbelievably beautiful and friendly and with a few changes would come close to the 5 stars it deserves. Clappy-Clappy!!

<Content>Amazing Time @ Dreams Punta Cana I stayed at Dreams Punta Cana July 3-8 and had a great time. I'd been reading the reviews and was very anxious about what my experience was going to be but that anxiety was completely unnecessary. I'm a 25 y/o female who was having a girls trip. I had a great time lounging poolside and on the beach, drinking, eating and partying at Desires Disco. I don't have one negative thing to say, the food was good (not outstanding) the staff was terrific (entertainment, bar staff, restaurant staff, housekeeping). I was treated like a queen (every request I made was happily fulfilled) and returning to NYC is going to be a huge adjustment. From what I saw and heard all of the other guests were having a great time too. It's a pretty large resort so if you're looking for more personalized attention and demanding absolute perfection this most likely is not the place for you. But if you're laid back, polite and looking to have an amazing trip then you will be happy at Dreams Punta Cana.

<Content>Natural Beauty is the only thing this place has going for it. Let鈥檚 start off by saying, we travel a lot and I know what to expect from small third world countries that cater to tourists in resorts. I know everything is not going to be perfect, nor do I expect it to be. In saying that: there are some things that cannot be overlooked. Let鈥檚 start with the hotel room. We decided to get the honeymoon suite for the extra space and the upgrades. When we got to the room, we noticed that the air was not working. We attempted to switch rooms, but supposedly none were available. The ceiling fans in the room were on motion sensors, so when you laid down at night to rest-your only means of cool air would shut off. You would have to wake up and either wave your hands or walk around to get the air flowing again. When you left the room, the fans would shut off; so your room wouldn鈥檛 cool down for you while you were gone. Not good when you are coming in from the pool hot and sun burned. Also, the frig in the room is also not cold. It鈥檚 basically cool 鈥搒o that means hot beer and soda. The juice in there was not OJ, but some orange drink knock off.The pool was very nice and very clean. There was plenty of chairs pool side and covered. The pool was the best part of the whole week.All-inclusive bars: yeah well if you are ok drinking very cheap liquor then its great. There is only one type of Dominican beer on tap and it鈥檚 not cold. Its room temperature. They have top-shelf liquor on display, but most of the claim to either be out; or when they do have it to pour 鈥搃t鈥檚 watered down and they won鈥檛 give you much of it. Any drinks you request made with fruit juice; fruit or anything fancy is out of the question. Restaurants: Again- nothing that is normally served hot is hot- and nothing that is normally served cold is cold. Everything is room temp. This was when I realized that the week would not turn out ok. I arrived on a Sunday and by Tuesday; I had extreme stomach pain from the food. I spoke with several people at the resort to see if this was an isolated incident, but it was not. There were others in the same shape. I was not able to get out of bed for one full day due to stomach pain, nausea, and dizziness. Basically if you wanted cereal the milk was room temp. Anything on the buffet was also not on warmers. The safest thing to eat was bread and potatoes. Stay away from anything on the salad bar and that contained milk or cream bases.Also, in the restaurants with waiters; it will take you at least 45 minutes to get a table. They are understaffed. There were plenty of tables available but no one to wait on you.Picture Scam: The photography crew takes pics of the guests with several different animals from the local zoo. (monkey, parrot, lizard) and then you have to go the photo counter to see if you want to purchase, etc. The price is $15 per pic which I find pretty steep- but it was vacation so we purchased a few. However, when it came time to get our pictures the next day- the barely English speaking girl behind the counter, claimed they were not ready yet. After several days of checking and being told they were not ready, we finally got very frustrated. She kept claiming that the pictures had to be sent off to be printed. This was not true, we had just seen another staff person print someone鈥檚 pictures from the below the counter. We told her that we were leaving that day and that we wanted our pictures. She still said the same line- not ready. We then asked for our money back. At that moment, she turned around, flipped thru some folders and miraculously pulled out our folder of pictures that were ready. Nice. The clincher is: The 5x7 you think you are getting is actually a 6x8. Upon noticing this error-and letting them know that was not ordered because you cannot get that size in the states; they will kindly tell you that you can purchase 6x8 frames at the desk for $25 dollars.Grass hats- make sure you do not purchase these. They will be confiscated at the airport because they are considered 鈥減lants鈥?and cannot be taken out of the country. Make sure you do not forget sunscreen. The cheapest, smallest bottle in the resort is $22.Also, the night vendors will start off with ridiculous prices on everything. I tried to by a silver and coconut necklace and they wanted $300 for it. By the time I was walking away suddenly it $20. So, be careful. The spa- oh yeah- we tried this too. The massage was great! However, the aqua spa which is $35 for an hour- half of the showers and saunas were broken; so you couldn鈥檛 do the circuit training anyways.The beach- directly in front of the resort- you cannot enter the water due to rocks and seaweed. However if you walk past the resort in either direction- its great. You just have to be careful that you are not on other resort properties-cause they will make you leave.At the end of the week, we couldn鈥檛 even get the front desk to answer the phone to come get our luggage. At this point I was ready to fill out a comment card or say something. So, after bringing my luggage down two flights of stairs and to the front desk, I was told that I could not fill out a comment card.Not a great week. We had fun as a group amongst ourselves for entertainment and in the pool, but the rest of it was not fun on any scale. I am very disappointed to see that this was a 6 apple (star) resort according to Apple Vacations. I would hate to see what a lower star resort had. I paid $3900 for this vacation; I certainly don鈥檛 feel like it was worth it.

<Content>Truly a Dream I am not going to write the traditional review that has been done so well by others breaking everything down. I just would like to start by saying please do not be mislead by the negative reviews. I have to laugh when people say they have traveled all over the world and put this resort down what world.AMresorts we believe to be a cut above all the others. There are many resons why we feel this way. To numerous to go into just a personal feeling we have. I will say the Dominican people are the nicest most sincere people of all the Caribbean Islands we have been too.Unfortunately the people who post negative reviews for whatever reason seem to outnumber the positive reviews and I believe the reason is when people have a negative experience they want everyone to know which I understand. However people who have a wonderful experience do not take the time to write a positive review. Its just the way it is!! What we need is for everyone to just take a few minutes and let everyone know of there experience even just a few words will help others know they have made the right choice. People just have very high expectations and are very hard to please no matter what the circumstances. Dreams is not the Four Seasons it is a Carbbean resort that caters to all young and old.We met so many great people on this trip and not one had anything bad to say except for some minor proplems which were corrected immediately. All of the people we spoke to are experienced travelers and know what to expect from an all inclusive vacation. There were others who were vacationing for the first time at Dreams and said they would most definitely come back.In closing I would just like to say get to know the staff it will make your vacation a true memory from the bellboys, waiters, bartenders, housekeepers, and entertainment team they are there for you to experience a wonderful vacation.People who don't have Dreams don't have much!!Keep the Dream Alive!!

<Content>loved every minute Stayed at Dreams June 15th untill July 6th.Ok the ride to the Hotel is a little bit bumpy but not as bad as some make out but worth it.Rooms are nice and quite big the nicest i have stayed in,but it seems small to Americans.Food is ok you will allways find something to eat.Pool out this world no problems getting beds even after 11am,beach not the greatest but again plenty of beds.We did not bring kids but this must be the best kids club going,theres a games room with pool tables, football tables,table tennis,mechanical bull,baseball pitcher,wii plus lots more.Bars were good with strong measures our favorate was lobby bar as it served top self spirits and bottles of bud light.Staff here are fantastic as all are from maids to gardners all very polite and happy.Yes i did get an upset stomache one day and i was also was hung over another but thats good going when you drink way to much over 21 days.Like i said we loved every minuteand would go back again but not next year made that mistake at the Rui's last 2 years and it just wasn't the same.

<Content>Fab holiday - not sure what some people expect !!!!!!! Have just returned form a Fab holiday at this hotel , please dont listen to all the bad reviews you read !!! not sure what some of these people want or expect. Each to their own however in our opinion it was briliant and cannot really be faultedThe hotel is well run from the cleaning staff to the managers entertainment teams and bar staff, as far as the language barrier is concerned we never never came across this, the staff who have customer contact are well spoken and fluent in English and always willing to give impromptu spanish lessons to all who are willing to learn, in my experience the staff are courteous and well mannered and treat each and every individual with respect and go out of there way to make your stay special, tips are not expected from anyone however i find it nice to recognise excellent service with a couple of dollars - that is so greatly appreciated by all.Our room was in block 2 ( 2316) which was on the 3rd floor with a fantasic view over the main pool, swim up bar and a (distant) view of the ocean. I have to say it was looking a little tired and could do with a lick of paint , and did have a musty smell, however not spending much time in there it did not spoil our experience. We had a problem with the mini bar not being stocked a couple of times but a call to the concierge and this was rectifiied within 10 mins and a courtesy call followed to ensure it had been done. For those who are worried about reviews that said the bed was uncomfortable we found the bed lush ( it was a super king 4 poster) with bedding changed daily and a turn downservice with chocolates each night before your return.The bars all serve premium drinks ( if you ask) if not you will get the local drink whereby the vodka gin and brandy all taste the same !! lol., check out the most extensive cocktail menu but be careful they are strong !Food was fab with a wide range of cuisines, at times there was a wait but only once did we wait an hour !! and then we sat in the attached bar and were refueled with drinks by the staff.We are quite early risers but never saw any problem s withsunbeds either at the pool or the beach, and people could get beds at any time of the day.one thing everyone agrees with The pool is fantastic with waterfalls bridges and oasis of trees .This hotel is currently undergoing refurbishments, to the a la carte areas and if i had to make a complaint it would be that at nights there was sometimes noise of them working in nearby areas ( sometimes till 10 pm) whilst you were eating , not too good if you wanted a quiet romatic meal., but again this dis not detract from the brilliant food, excellent drinks and well conversant staff.The grounds are fab with flamingos, parrots and peacocks roaming freely, the flowers and trees are some of the nicest i have seen and kept immaculately manicured.Please take some of the reports you have read with a pinch of salt as they must have been unfortunate one off experiences- that is what we did and will do in the future when reading other peoples thoughts !Have a great time !!! am sure you will

<Content>NOT as described This will probably take some time but bare with me as I would want someone to be as honest...We have been to the Bahamas, St Lucia, Aruba and Riviera Maya in Mexico. This was by far THE WORST vacation we have ever been on.Dreams is on the Atlantic side of the island (you don't have that caribbean water there - it's choppy and has ALOT of rocks - husband cut leg up). THere are no other resorts near you so you are kind of stuck.Day 1 - Wasn't too happy with the $10 per person tax you have to pay at the airport. Travel agent didn't tell us about this either. Ride from airport was about an hour. Very bumpy.Arrived at the resort, lobby was gorgeous. We booked the preferred club for an extra $550 for the week. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!! Ice cold towel to refresh face with was nice. No champagne tho. When we pulled up, told them we are in the preferred club, they put us in a beat up red pick up truck (I literally had to sit on my husband's lap because of the stick shift). They drove us to building 6 through the garbage area of the resort where the preferred club check in is. Check in was quick. Room wasn't ready so we decided to get lunch at the SeaSide Grille. Cheesesteak was HORRIBLE. The meat tasted processed. The only thing good was the bread. Servers do not speak much English at all. We finally got our room (#7116). Was OK room. Nothing to write home about. We tried to connect to the wireless internet (we thought it was included in our room - website says complimentary internet connection for preferred club. Well - it's not included in the room. You have a complimentary connection in the preferred club lounge...that is it. We had to pay $25 for this service for our room. Pool - gorgeous....Pool bar AWESOME (thanks Wilson!!!) Just didn't care for the topless french women walking around with so many children there.We ate in the buffet (World Cafe) the first night. Food was OK, again...just OK.Casino - what a rip off. They call it American Blackjack. They neglect to tell you with Dominican Republic rules....Don't waste your money.Day 2 - Breakfast at buffet. Omelets were good, Crepe station was good too. Went for our meeting with Pietro Tours (Cesar was cool). They went over all of the excursions with us. Told us there was a shopping area 10 minute walk down the street. Decided to take a walk over there. As we were walking there was a SECURITY GUARD on a bike that followed us to the shopping area....told us it was too dangerous without security. OH MY GOD....shopping was typicle. 20 shops with the same stuff trying to get $20 US for a coffee cup. Found a shop that has a girl from the Bronx there. She was cool. Didn't try to rip us off. Spent the day at the pool bar lunch at the BBQ on the beach - burger was OK, hot dogs SUCKED!!. Dinner Bordeaux- Husband had to wear long pants because of dress code (air conditioning SUCKS!!!). Sandals doesn't even have a dress code and this resort is no where near that calibre. Food was good. Better than the buffet. Called it a night after dinner. Ordered room service at around midnight....LIMITED menu, and not very good.Day 3 - Ordered room service for breakfast. Eggs, bacon, was OK. Spent the entire day at the pool and relaxed. Dinner - we went to Himitsu (the Japanese) for hibatchi. You HAVE to be there 45 minutes before the seeting for Hibatchi and hope they take your name. They only have 3 tables and do seeting at 6, 7:30 and 9:30. Food was good. LONG PANTS FOR MEN!!!Day 4 - went on the ATV excursion. Had a great time. Very expensive ($198 for 2 people). Was 1/2 day trip and was only 15 minutes from resort. Took a nap when we got back and just did the buffet again (husband didn't want to wear long pants - it was soooooo hot).Day 5 - Spent the day at the pool again. Dinner El Patio (Mexican). We walked out on dinner. The food was HORRIBLE!! We ordered fried chicken tacos for appetizer (there was no chicken in them and the cheese was spoiled - frozed mexican appetizers are better than these). For entrees we ordered chicken fajita quesadillas. Again, cheese was spoiled and barely any chicken. We weren't the only people walking out during our dinners. There was another couple that walked out also. We just grabbed something at the buffet. They had show in the theatre that night. Was fun to watch.Day 6 - Went to breakfast buffet and then went on the Caribbean Festival Snorkel. They picked us up around 1:30. It's over an hour to get to the boat. You have to take a speedboat to the catamaran. We snorkeled, went swimming with sharks and then interracted with stingrays (stingers surgically removed). This was by far the best snorkel trip we have ever been on. They will videotape it for $35. Worth it...but we were leaving the next morning and would not be able to get it to the resort on time. They had carnival dancers on the boat as well.Dinner - we thought we would go to Bordeaux (french) for our last meal since it was pretty good on night 2. Well, it took 40 minutes to get our appetizers, there were no scallops in there. Then they tell us they are out of french onion soup (are you serious??). Then they bring us this shrimp and calamari in a pineapple that was HIDEOUS!!!!. Our entrees came and our beef was like leather. Didn't even bother to stay for dessert and coffee.Day 7 - FINALLY GETTING OUT OF THIS HELL!!! Went to Preferred Club to check out. We voiced our opinions and basically wanted to know what we got for paying $550 for this Club. A newspaper and the lounge. We didn't get the turn down service except for 2 nights. There was no pillow menu. The room was the same as a deluxe room in any other building. There was no upgraded room service. There were no upgraded room toiletries. WOW - what a RIP OFF!!!!! They weren't happy with us complaining about everything, and I honestly could care less. They were scooting another couple out to the lounge so they wouldn't hear us. We stopped at the lounge to tell them on our way out. The Concierge just printed a bill and told us we would have to go to the front desk to pay. Are you kidding me????? The front desk????? What happened to VIP check in and check out?Overall....the resort is pretty. The beach sucks. The pool bar is AWESOME - ask for Wilson. The food SUCKS for the most part. NO ONE really speaks English. It's dangerous to walk 10 minutes to the shopping area. Entertainment was good. Excursions were fun. Go to Riviera Maya in Mexico or Aruba for a really enjoyable vacation.

<Content>Great Time at Dreams POunta Cana My daughter and I stayed at Dreams Punta Cana from June 28 - July 4, 2008. Our accomodations were in the Preferred Club, building 6. The resort is beautiful and well maintained, but what makes this resort stand apart from the rest is the staff in the Preferred Club section, building 6. The Preferred Club staff is, by far, the best that I have encountered at any resort (and I travel frequently). Check in with Ricardo Narvo was quick and easy and we were in our room in minutes. The rooms are spacious, clean and well appointed, even the bed was comfortable. Daily; Vanessa Disla, Jorge Polanco, Yan Le Guillou, Magalis Rodriguez, George and Bertilio greeted us with bright smiles and a cheerful hola and provided us with any assistance that we needed. Although the entire staff is great, it is Vanessa Disla that stands out as the best! Vanessa consistently provided us with attentive service and went out of her way to assure that our vacation was special and memorable - which it was! Vanessa made sure we enjoyed every aspect of our vacation - and even had a plate of chocolates delivered to our room one night and on the last night had a plate of confections delivered to the room with Have a nice trip written in chocolate on the plate. Vanessa provided us with the best service that I have ever experienced at a resort. And - I must add that George and Bertilio are the best bar tenders in Punta Cana.In addition, because we are repeat guests of Dreams Resorts (first time at Punta Cana), we were treated to a special dinner at the El Patio restaurant, which was wonderful and made us feel extra special.If you go to this resort, the Preferred Club is the way to go! The Preferred Club has a private lobby which provides use of free internet service, DVDs available for use at no charge, pool/beach towels available without the towel card, continental breakfast and afternoon snacks and a private bar. There is also a private section of the beach for preferred club members that has fabulous beach beds along with great lounge chairs and thatched huts for shade. There is wait service on the beach. But the biggest reason to stay in the Preferred Club - is that you get the best staff on the island to assist you with your vacation needs and questions.The resort and grounds are well maintained and beautiful. The pool is fantastic and you will want to stay in for hours. The beach is nice, there are a lot of rocks in the water that you need to watch out for, but the sand is soft, breeze delightful and it is a quiet place to relax and unwind.The restauranbts and food are good. A la carte restaurants and no reservations required (there is also a buffet restaurant if you prefer). The spa and spa services are also very good - I would recommend the hot stone massage. The jacuzzi, hydro massage and showers are great in the spa's wellness center.Overall, the resort is a great place to go. You have the choice of either R  R or lots of activities with the entertainment staff. There is always an activity going on, whether it is volly ball, aerobics, water polo, dance lessons, ping pong comnpetitions or crazy games such as water balloon fights. The Core Zone is great for all ages with pool tables, air hockey, fooz ball, archery and even mechanical bull riding.The only downfall is the air conditioning system - so if you do not like it hot - do not go in July - go during cooler months. The air conditioning in the rooms did not work well, but the ceiling fans allowed you to sleep in comfort.I would definitely recommend this resort - but stay in the Preferred Club section and let Vanessa, Jorge, Yan, Magalis, Ricardo, George and Bertilio spoil you! They will make you feel like royalty during your stay.

<Content>OK but not great Myself and my boyfriend traveled to Dreams Punta Cana Resort on 23rd June for 10 nights. I was a little unsure of what to expect from reading some of the reviews but it wasn't as bad as some people make out. The drive from the airport to the hotel was quite scary to say the least. The Dominicans are lunatic drivers and the roads are full of potholes but you are in a poor country so what would you expect other than same! We didn't receive our glass of champagne on arrival but we didn't mind. The staff were very friendly and check in was very swift. We requested a double room in one of the newly renovated building blocks and thankfully we got same. The room was clean, the air conditioning worked and the mini bar was stocked. The room was compact but we weren't going to be spending much time in it. The pool was absolutely beautiful, just like in the brochure, however the BEACH was not so nice. We were very disappointed. There was seaweed all over it and the water wasn't what you would call caribbean water! It was very rough and full of rocks. I was told by one guest that the beach is actually not on the caribbean sea but on the Atlantic Ocean. We felt let down by this. You think of the caribbean and you think of white sand, turquoise water etc but not at Dreams. This hotel is fantastic for children and really it caters for all ages. The entertainment team made our trip, 50 cent, mickey mouse, usher, lucas and michael jackson. They were fantastic. Activities are arranged throughout the whole day, you'll not be bored.The mexican restaurant was disguisting. The french restaurant was beautiful, food very good. The chinese, oceanic and seaside restaurants were all just ok. The menus are quite limited and are never changed. The world cafe was ok but you got tired of the buffet over time. We got very sick from the food and were confined to our room for the last 2 days. Only drink bottled water and don't use ice cubes. Stay away from salads as the salad leaves etc are washed in the dirty water. Make sure you bring tablets for stomach aches and the other end!! You will definitely need them. We had a good trip but wouldn't go back, not because of the hotel but becuase we like to experience different places. I hope this review will be of some use to someone.

<Content>Dreams, YES, Punta Cana, NO I've traveled all over the Caribbean without a problem. In Punta Cana I had my diamond bracelet stolen off my arm in Nero market by a professional. Now I can not get the report from the Apple agent because he said he has no recollection of us reporting the incident to him. Did he also not remember discouraging us from going to the police and hour and a half away or describing to us the person that took it???? I'm wondering if they are not all in it together and how many other times this has happened. So, don't where good jewelry on any trip as I have learned the hard way. Also, Dreams itself was wonderful. I couldn't say anything bad about it at all! Food, staff, entertainment, all exceptional! The beaches are not as beautiful as some I've seen, but if you like more a rustic, undeveloped country, this would be your place.

<Content>June 20th to July 3rd - excellent vacation Since this is a review of Dreams Punta Cana I do not intend to dwell on the flight (Continental direct from Newark to Punta Cana left on time and arrived on time), luggage (arrived safely in a timely fashion) or the much discussed transfer from the airport which does take approx 1 hour and is a bit bumpy in parts, since none of the above are controlled by Dreams. It does appear that they are putting in a new highway that will extend from the airport up the coast but I imagine progress will be slow. But it will eventually improve the journey.In summary we cannot think of a single criticism of the resort or its staff.We arrived at the resort at about 2pm on a Friday so our rooms were not ready. We went and had lunch in the World Caf茅 and for a walk around. Check in was efficient but we did not get either champagne or the cold towel, however to us this is not a major issue. It seems to some reviewers that this oversight ruins their entire vacation 鈥?not sure why.Anyway back to check in at 3pm 鈥?rooms were ready 鈥?6102 and 6103. We walked down and luggage arrived promptly. As we later found out our rooms were in one of the preferred buildings but since we did not pay for an upgrade we could not use the facilities. No big deal since we did not expect to. We had emailed Eileen the concierge to ask for connecting rooms and we got exactly what we asked for 鈥?connecting double and king. So no issues with check in or rooms. We inspected them carefully for any of the concerns expressed in the negative reviews but nothing materialized. We had taken ant traps (as we always do when traveling to these types of resorts) but never had to use them. No musty smell in the room.DiningOver the 13 days we ate in every restaurant, in the World Caf茅 and from the barbeque on the beach. None of the four of experienced any stomach issues and we must have eaten a wide selection. My wife ate of a lot of fruit and salads and never had any problems. One comment on the water served in the caf茅 and other restaurants. It is safe to drink 鈥?we weren鈥檛 sure until we saw them refilling the water coolers from 5 gallon Poland Spring bottles.World Caf茅 鈥?breakfast selection was excellent, even my teenagers who seem to live on cereal and pop tarts at home were impressed by the selection. Have Mercedes make a fruit smoothie for you. Also the orange juice tastes freshly squeezed. Don鈥檛 forget the fresh pastries and donuts on the far right 鈥?some folks never found them until their last few days. They also have the makings for mimosas and bloody marys. Lunch and dinner buffets were equally good. Dress is casual.Himitsu 鈥?we did this twice. No reservations 鈥?first come first served. 3 sittings: 6pm 7.30pm and 9.00pm. We got there at about 6.45 for the 7.30 sitting and had no problems. Just have a drink from the bar while you are waiting. It鈥檚 a set menu of sushi, soup, rice, beef, chicken and mahi-mahi, and then they move you to a table in the Chinese side for dessert. This caught us by surprise the first time but they need to do this in order to prepare for the next sitting. Food and service was good. They do insist on long pants but I was fine with smart sandals.Chinese 鈥?did not have to wait at around 7.30pm. Again good food and service. The food is a little different but we found it tasty. Just be aware it is not what you might expect in the US. Like Himitsu they do insist on long pants but I was fine with smart sandals.Mexican - did not have to wait at around 7.30pm. Again good food and service. Like the Chinese the food is a little different but we found it tasty. Just be aware it is not what you might expect in the US. Dress is casual 鈥?shorts and t-shirts are ok.Oceana 鈥?is now closed for renovation, as was the Seaside Grill when we first got there. Seaside Grill is now open and I believe they alternate menus i.e. Oceana menu one night, Seaside Grill the next. Oceana is seafood which was good and Seaside Grill predominantly meat. Again both a little different to what you might expect in US but still tasty.French Restaurant 鈥?This for us was the best. In our view the food was excellent and service was good. My wife and I ate there twice.Italian 鈥?this is really just a section of the buffet with waiter service. A separate Italian restaurant is under construction. Don鈥檛 expect too much and you will be happy.Beach barbeque 鈥?most days for lunch. I don鈥檛 know what is in their burgers but they are really good.In summary we were very happy with the food selection and service. We were at Dreams Tulum 2 years ago and were concerned that the food would not match up. But it did. Be aware that portions are on the modest size 鈥?not the huge portions you might get in the US (which you then take most of it home in a doggy bag). If you are really hungry order an extra dish or course 鈥?you are not restricted.Bars and drinks. As has been posted the cocktails do not have a lot of kick to them but get friendly with the bar tenders and they are happy to add an extra slug of liquor to your drink. Try the Wilson Special at the swim up bar. Wilson was surprised to learn his name is all over the internet! The Presidente beer is similar to Corona 鈥?fine cold in a hot place. I have read poor reviews on service at the bars and restaurants. The staff in these places work really hard and respond favorably to smiles and being greeted by name 鈥?try to be less demanding and be their friend and I think you will get better service. Although tipping is not considered necessary we found that a couple of bucks here and there made our next drink request move a little quicker.Beach 鈥?aware that this is the Atlantic Ocean we were not expecting calm Caribbean waters. We did have red and yellow flags most days and the sea was reasonably choppy.We did not use the ocean a lot. My older son did a windsurfing lesson, we kayaked several times and took the banana boat ride. We are familiar with Hobie Cat sailing but I felt that the surf was a problem so we did not take one out. I did get capsized in my kayak which was an adventure!The place would not be the same without the entertainment team 鈥?Melkis, Michael Jackson, Mickey Mouse, Usher, Fifty Cent, Luis, Josef and of course Stephanie. These guys work hard at providing entertainment that you can either watch or participate in (or both). We got to know the team over the 13 days and were sad to have to part company.Do not expect the evening entertainment shows to be of cruise ship or Vegas quality but they are amusing (even though if you are there more than a week you will see them twice). They are a diversion to fill the evening hour after dinner. Go with that in mind and you will enjoy them.Unfortunately we did have to visit the doctor while we there 鈥?my 13 year old developed some inflammation in one ear. The doctor was efficient and after a shot and some ear drops he was right as rain in a couple of days or so. Be aware however that any medical treatment is not cheap. $90 for the initial visit, $75 for the follow up plus cost of medications and other sundries. I would strongly recommend trip insurance (we do every time) which should reimburse most of the outlay.Overall I would say that we would definitely return except for the fact that we want to see other places.

<Content>Give the place a break Just returned today from dreams Punta Cana. I must admit that my wife and I were very nervous after reading some of the reviews on trip advisor. What follows is an honest appraisal of the hotel.The airport is beautiful, well maintained, and very efficient-would put the Charles de Gaulle in paris to shame.The ride to the hotel was a little bumpy-but so what. The guide accompanying us was a little embarrassed, but didn't need to be. this is a developing country, and the roads in Ireland were not that great not too long ago either. Give them a break. The hotel is stunning-the lobby magnificent, and the welcome very warm. the grounds of this Hotel are among the best i have ever seen anywhere in the world, and i include in that Sandy Lane hotel in Barbados, where we stayed for a multiple of what we paid here. truly magnificent. I totally agree with a review that said you get exactly what you get in the picture. Fantastic.The staff are friendly and work very hard, and very much appreciate anything you give them.The monthly wage is circa $150. the food was not great, but you certainly will not starve. If you go on the trip to the Caribbean island, which i recommend, do not eat the food, or have a drink with ice in it. I picked up a tummy bug, and others did too.It is a shame, if they can improve the food, this will be unbeatable. the beach is fantastic, paradise.This was the best vacation ever. Some of the complaints people have made are pathetic-they survey you after you check out. One person complained that the walks were too long between restaurants!get a life-or better still do the place a favor and stay home. i witnessed people, most i am afraid to say Americans being obnoxiously rude, and racist, to the staff.For people with a tipping culture, not many I saw came across for a staff that deserved a dollar or two. It was not staff some of these people wanted, but slaves.Great hotel-shame about the people who go there, in the main unfriendly, American, self absorbed, looking for a Ferrari at ford bronco prices-and not worth the 5 star service they get. Fact.

<Content>A Nightmare at Dreams - Please take this advice...terrible hotel! I'm a traveler. I've traveled all over the world and stayed at many, many hotels. Dreams is a 2+ star hotel masquerading as a 5-star. Please beware when booking a trip here. I'll tell you why...The only good thing about this hotel is the grounds...they are beautiful. But immediately upon your arrival you will be greeted, or not greeted, by only the beginning of the most unfriendly staff you will ever have the displeasure of meeting. No one speaks English except for the management, who stay hidden and unapproachable. The hotel advertises top shelf liquor included under its all inclusive umbrella, but if you watch, the bartenders all go into a room behind the bar to pour that top shelf liquor. If you don't specify, you get the NORMANDY brand, which is awful. Also, wine is not included, other than the rotgut house wine that no one with any taste would drink. My family and I ended up spending money to buy wine every night with dinner. Speaking of dinner, the food is verging on rotten. Out of all the restaurants, only one (Bordeaux, the French Restaurant) is edible. The World Cafe presents a huge buffet complete with flies all over the food and NO AIR CONDITIONING.I'm suprised more don't get sick due to the lack of cooling under fruit, fish, etc. The Seaside Grill has a funky taste to its meat and the servers are the worst I have every experienced. The Mexican is Mediocre at best, and the Japanese is awful, other than the show your chef will put on at the hibachi.Upon first glance, the rooms look nice...four poster bed, mini bar, etc. The mini bar is NOT stocked with alcohol other than Dominican beer. There is no air conditioning in the bathrooms and the air conditioning in the rooms is subpar. The rooms are NOT cleaned well and the hotel is virtually falling apart. On our third day at this resort, I fell in my room because the ceiling was leaking and the floor had become slippery. I hit my head rather hard on the cement wall, and when my mother called the front desk to report a MEDICAL EMERGENCY it took them 25 minutes to get to my room at which point I was sent 1 1/2 hours to the nearest hospital in a cab through some of the sketchiest and prostitute ridden shanty villages I have ever seen to spend six hours at a hospital with blood spattered on the wall and vomit on the floor. What if this medical emergency had been life threatening?Because this hotel is in the middle of nowhere on the edge of the jungle, it takes too long to reach anything including the hospital and airport. The roads are terrible, marked with potholes that don't allow any vehicle to go over five miles an hour. On our way from the airport, I watched two people vomit on our bus due to the bumpy ride that no one warns you about before your road trip begins.My family and I paid a little extra to be club level which would allow extra perks, such as not having to run around the hotel trying to find someone to provide towels, and free internet access. The staff in the club was helpful, but not up to par with that of other hotels claiming five star status. After much complaining we were sent a bottle of wine on the house, but it was not one we drank or had ordered any of the other nights. No one thought to check, they just picked the cheapest one. They talk a good talk but just can鈥檛 deliver - not worth the extra money.The pool is always dirty, as are the restaurants, rooms, spa, etc. The cushions at the pool are filthy. The entertainment is laughable. The service is abhorable. The morning of our departure we actually had a toast to leaving. Dreams Punta Cana has only been in existence for six months, prior to that is was another resort. They want to be a five star luxury resort, but fall very, very short. If you are a member of the Dreams Punta Cana management reading this, my advice would be to rethink your management and top level staff and downgrade your star status to three to avoid anymore reviews like this one.If you are a traveler considering this resort, please, please, please heed my advice or suffer a vacation from hell as my family and I did.

<Content>Memorable Dreams Punta Cana We visited Dreams Punta Cana the last week of March 2008. We booked this through Maritime Marlin Travel at the Halifax Shopping Center in Halifax, Nova Scotia and we had great service! This was an Air Canada Vacations package. Our travel to the resort was great and we had no issue with the travel time or road condition compared with previous travel to Jamaica and Bahamas. The airport was an absolute breeze as was connecting with our transfer to the resort.Cheak in was quick and easy, upon arriving it was aparent the vibe was relaxed and the resort was immaculate. Ricardo in the Preferred Club was very welcoming and we were set up in a great room even though we arrived prior to check-in time. We had a fantastic view from our Honeymoon Suite! We watched the moon rise from the balcony tub the first night! If you travel to Dreams Punta Cana I reccomend the rooms with the balcony hot tubs, they were a great experience.We met many great staff and guests during our stay! We remember Jorge in the preferred club lounge and Wilson and Leon at the pool bar among many others. Hernandez at the World Cafe breakfast omlette bar and cleaning up in the pool bar was one of the first staff to make an impression. We did not interact much with the 'animators' but they seemed like a fun bunch! We really had fun at the pool bar in the afternoons, spending time with Guests Teresa and Frank, Tony and Michelle and Debbie and Tim. Great memories!We found the food to be fantastic, especially the breakfasts. We did not try Oceana or the Japanese (cook at the table side, A La Carte was good though). The beach party food was superb.Some of the highlights of our trip were:Talking to Jorge, Wilson  Leon. We were there when Wison was recognized as employee of the month! Well deserved. Great staff!The viewGreat Weather every dayClean PoolMagic Show and Taino Show on the BeachCobow Bob's daily question of Giddy Up Today? Michelle and I had a great laugh over a drink with that one!Nice beach walksThe Rum-we come from a log line of rum drinkers and found the DR Rum absolutely fantastic! I'm not typically a dark rum drinker but the DR rum is so awesome I preferred it there...Pina Colada con Brugal por favour!Marinarium TourShopping at the small shops 5 min. down the road past the resort, they came and picked us up, great selection of Rum, Larimar, Amber and many other items at good pricesStunning setting, the gropunds were really well kept.Overall we had a fun time. We witnessed thoroughout the trip how much fun the kids in the Explorer club had, the staff taking care of this were fantastic, we loved their Pre-Show performances and games in the evenings. We joked that it was too bad my husband was too old for me to sign him in there. It looked like great fun and a positive experience!I would have no worries booking here again. We were a bit concerned based on what we read but many of the items mentioned have been addressed (e.g. water temps. were fixed durig our stay) and improvements were constantly happening and not interferring with any one's enjoyment (e.g. walkway upgrades, from recent photos I see the pool chairs are totally upgraded). The so called Towel Game was a non-issue to us. We found not need to 'reserve' and had no issue finding spots in the beach or pool areas. Also, we were not sick once regardless of what we ate, we truely tempted fate with what we drank, no issue.s BUT we were diligent with HANDWASHING and eating cold foods cold and hot foods hot. Chill out and repect each other and have a great time! GREAT JOB TO THE DREAMS TEAM! EXCELLENT RESORT  STAFF!

<Content>Great Family Resort My family and I went to Dreams Punta Cana from June 24 to July 1. The family is comprised of my wife, a 21 y.o. son, 14 y.o. son, 10 y.o. daughter and myself. We flew non-stop on Continental from Newark to Punta Cana. The flight was your typical flight, nothing extraordinary. Upon arrival in Punta Cana we were quickly greeted and processed and allowed into the country. You will need to pay a $10 fee upon entering. They also take a photograph of your entire party upon entering. This photo is made available to purchase when departing. I believe the cost was $8. After we got our luggage we were quickly asked if we needed assistance. The walk from the baggage claim to ground transportation is maybe 100 yards at most. We carried our own luggage and quickly found Pietro Tours. We were taken to the resort by Prieto Tours in a van with 2 other couples. The van was air-conditioned and comfortable. The roads to the resort are not the best but I鈥檝e certainly been on worse. If you鈥檝e ever been on the road from Mobay to Negril in Jamaica you would be thankful for this road in Punta Cana.RESORT ARRIVAL:Upon arrival at the resort we were greeted with cool washcloths and brought to the check-in counter. We had reserved two adjoining rooms. The reservation was accurate and we were quickly checked-in and escorted to our rooms. One room was not finished being made up so we went to eat lunch. By the time we got back to the rooms all the luggage was in the rooms and both rooms were ready.ROOMBoth rooms had champagne and fruit the first night we arrived. We had towel art the second room did not. No real problems with bugs. The a/c was adequate at times, better at others. We had no problems with noise from neighbors or the hall. The only noise problem was when the 21 y.o stumbled in at 3am after a night of drinking. As for the room size, these were the standard rooms. We had a king bed and a cot. There was adequate room to move around. The boys had 2 double beds. They had plenty of room. Both rooms had balconies overlooking the pool. All rooms have an electronic locking safe in the room. We used these for camera equipment, cash, passports, etc. FOODThere are # of restaurants on the resort. The biggest problem, we had was not with the food but with deciding where to eat. Rest assured that all water in the restaurants is bottled. I personally saw them empty 5 gallon bottles of water into the water dispensers in the restaurants. No one in my family got sick from any food or water. World Caf茅: This is the main resort restaurant. All food here is served buffet style. As is typical with most buffets some food is good and some is not so good. You can always find something to eat here.Da Mario: Italian restaurant adjacent to the World Caf茅. Serves pizza and Italian food. We ate here twice. The food was decent, just remember you鈥檙e in Punta Cana not Venice. Also there was one dish that my wife would have liked to have, but it was not available either time we ate there.Himitsu 鈥?Asian Food. Men will need to wear long pants and this is enforced. The most important thing to know about this restaurant is that there are two ways to eat here. The first one is to eat hibachi style. In order to have hibachi you need to arrive about 30 minutes prior to one of 4 pre-determined seatings. I believe the times were 6:30, 7:30, 8:30 and 9:30. The other method is to eat the regular restaurant portion and choose your selections off the menu. We ate hibachi which consists of fried rice, chicken, beef, shrimp and mahi-mahi. The food was goodOceana 鈥?Sea Food. This was my wife鈥檚 favorite. The food here is excellent but it gets very crowded and there is usually await. You will be given a pager that will alert you when your table is ready. BTW 鈥?Get the coconut shrimp. Bordeaux 鈥?French. This is food adults only (over 18 though we did see some that looked around 16). Men will need to wear long pants and this is enforced. This was my personal favorite and we ate here twice. The food was better the first time however. El Patio 鈥?Mexican. There is no dress code at this restaurant. We food is ok, not great but not bad either. Sea Side Grill 鈥?We did not eat at this one. This restaurant and Oceana share one building. Due to construction the resort alternated which restaurant was open nightly. Room Service 鈥?The food arrived hot and it was good. The only issue was that it took a long time for it to arrive. Give yourself about one hour from the time you order to the time it arrives.BBQ Pit 鈥?This is on the beach and is open for lunch. They serve hot dogs, hamburgers and maybe grilled chicken. The food was good and convenient if you didn鈥檛 want to get changed for lunch.DRINKSAs my wife is not a big drinker we did not spend a lot of time at the bars. Our 21 y.o. however made up for what we did not drink. He told me that the bartenders were friendly and provided plenty of drink. Two local drinks: Sammy Sosa and Mamajuana.  BEACHThe water was very rough when we were there. The red flag was up about half the days. It is important to note that this resort is on the Atlantic Ocean not the Caribbean Sea. There were rocks in the water unless you went to the left to the Water Sports shack. This is where water trampoline is. Is there toplessness on the beach? Some days yes, some days no. Some days it was only one, other days it was a few. My wife did go topless a couple of days. Nobody seemed to care or notice. You鈥檙e on vacation enjoy.POOLThe pool water was on the warm side though refreshing. We mostly stayed down by the iceberg since the 10 y.o. liked to climb it. You need to exchange your towel card for towels at the towel shack. The shack closes a 6pm. This wasn鈥檛 really a big deal. We had no problem getting lounges at the pool. Floats were harder to find. My wife purchased some cheap ones at home and brought them with us. We had the Water Sports Shack inflate one. We left it in our room for the next people.DISCOSeemed like fun. My wife and I didn鈥檛 go down. The 21 y.o was there 4 out of 7 nights.CASINOSmall we didn鈥檛 gamble.SPA ServicesThe only Spa service we used was the hair braining on the beach. My wife said the women was friendly and had the patience to deal with our 10 y.o. GYMThere is a well equipped gym on the premises. My wife worked out almost every morning. CORE Zone 鈥?This is where all the sports activities and teen disco is. There鈥檚 archery, air rifles, Wii, pool, ping pong, mechanical bull riding, a bar, televisions and things I can鈥檛 remember. If you have teenagers, you will most likely find them here after dinner.CONCIERGEEileen was awesome. She couldn鈥檛 do enough for us. Her staff is equally qualified.EXCURSIONSWe did three excursions. The whole family went on the ATV ride. This was a blast. They even included a Dominican rainstorm on our ride. We were cold and wet at the end but thoroughly loved it. I took the two boys on the Zip-Lines. This is more work than you would think. Also a good time was had. My wife took my daughter horseback riding. They were the only ones on this ride so it became a private excursion. My daughter loved, my wife would have preferred a padded saddle (lol).VENDORSThe resort brings vendors onto the property every other night. You can purchase art work, jewelry, cigars, mamajuana and other assorted items. A couple of key points. Do NOT pay the asking price. We were able to purchase most items for less than 50% of the original price. If you purchase any mamajuana, palm leave hats or other food items, these will be confiscated at the airport. The USA does not allow these items back into the country. If you want to bring home mamajuana there are two choices. Either purchase it in the gift shop or at the duty-free shop in the airport. BTW 鈥?Mamajuana is a Dominican alcoholic drink not something you would roll and smoke.SAFETY/SECURITYMy whole family felt safe while on the resort or while off the resort. We left ipods, some cash and other electronic items on the desk in the rooms, and nothing ever went missing. At night there was security in the resort. On a couple of occasions my wife and I took a walk on the beach late at night and felt safe. My son and his friends were on the beach at 3am and were asked my security what they were doing. This was to insure they were guests.OVERALLThe resort was a great family oriented facility. Though there were some issues there was nothing that would prevent me from returning. My wife speaks Spanish at a decent level. I speak very little but spoke what I could. I found that any effort to speak the language was appreciated. The resort is continuing to make renovations so I鈥檓 sure that things will only get better.

<Content>Would probably not go back.... Traveled w/ a large group for a wedding. They have no ability to accomodate a party this big. Every meal was a nitemare. A solid three hours long!!Trip from the airport was bumpy but better than I expected.Room- The room service was terrible. We did not get clean bedding for three days and I had to beg for towels and washcloths. We also had a ton of ants. The DVD in my kids room was broken. I did always have cold water in the fridge though! DO NOT drink the water from the faucet in the room!!!Pool- The pool was awesome! The kids and family really seemed to enjoy it!Food_ I thought the food was mediocre at best. One nite my husband and I both ordered the tenderloin at Oceana. I got an excelent piece of meat and he got something that looked like it came form the the Sizzler. We ordered the EXACT same thing!!! The service at the restaurants was poor as well due to a serious language barrier.Spa- The best bang for the buck. I was there for hair and massage services. they were both excellent!The lobby was constantly under construction which was VERY frustrating. They would be paintaing and sanding in the middle of the day as we were trying to walk through. Just what I want- sanded drywall on my kids head!!! it just looked terrible. They lost phone service resort wide 2x while we were down there as well. The photography was beautiful though! I highly recommend it! We got family photos done on the beach for a fraction of what it would cost here in the states.Overall, not what I would consider a 5 star resort.

<Content>Wonderful Holiday Just returning from a fantastic stay here with my family 16th June 鈥?1st July.After reading a number of very negative reviews i was somewhat apprehensive about the stay at Dreams Punta Cana but had a wonderful stay.The front desk staff on arrival were very friendly and helpful.The lower lobby was under repairs as there had been a bad storm a week or so before we arrived and the ceiling had been damaged but did not look untidy and was completely rectified by our 2nd week.The rooms were very nice and comfortable and very well kept by the maids who were also very friendly.I found the staff as a whole to be very helpful and pleasant and always greet you when you pass them around the complex, the bar and world caf茅 staff were always polite even though some guests were very rude to them.The food in the world caf茅 was plentiful and was constantly being replenished, as they were catering to so many people I thought the quality of the food was very high.The Chinese and Japanese was very nice and the service on the restaurants was great.The French was by far the best, the d茅cor and service was great and the food was as nice as in any restaurant I have visited.The entertainment team were extremely hardworking and do there best to get everyone involved in there activities.The pool was lovely with lots of beds, weather was also fantastic.We did get slightly irritated stomachs but nothing serious and nothing some Imodium didn鈥檛 cure.In all we had a wonderful stay and would not hesitate in returning to Dreams.

<Content>Excellent Resort, Excellent Vacation!!! I just returned home yesterday from a 7 night stay at the Dreams Resort Punta Cana. Im going to start off by saying that this is my second time to Punta Cana. In 2005 my girlfriend and I stayed at the Melia Caribe Tropical and we had a blast there. After staying at Dreams we both felt that Dreams far surpassed the Melia in all aspects. We could not understand all the negative reviews that we read in our days prior to leaving for Dreams. At one point we contimplated the idea of switching resorts but we decided not to. My girlfriend and I are in our early 30's and we had an excellent time. Ride from the Airport , Yes it is a long and bumpy ride, but hello people you are in a 3rd world country that is that is no where near developed. What do you expect? Check in was a breeze, no problems no hassles. Building 9 Room 9314 Junior Suite Room was nice, spacious and clean. Only complaint is that the A/C could be colder. Fridge stocked with Beer, water, soda, and juice daily, Fresh towels 2xs a day Turn down service at night. Jacuzzi on balcony was perfect.Food overall was very good compared to the food we had experinced at the Melia in 2005. And better that the Food at the Riu in Cancun, MX in 2007. Buffet great for breakfast, dinner was good as well, nice feature was that the food was covered in the slide top sterno tray.El Patio-Mexican, Excellent we ate there twice, Mariachi Band great atmosphere.Italian Restaraunt was in the same room as the Buffet but in a separate area, was ok n ot great.Himitsu, you have the option for Japanese style Hibachi or Chinese. We had the Chinese, also very good.Sea Side Grille  Oceana alternate closings we ate in the Oceana everyday for lunch it also was very good but the menu is repeated every day so you wind up ordering the same food. We did not eat in Sea Side Grille as the wait was too long.Bordeaux the french restaraunt was by far the best. A nice romantic atmosphere.Pool  Beach We spent everyday all day here right next to the Sugar Reef pool bar. Drinks of the Day are weak but just ask for a little extra booze and they will give you it with aout question. Wilson and Juan are excellent here a few dollars in the morning to them and they will treat you like royalty all day. Pool is fun very large, lots of chairs, shade and plenty of activities. There are also some quiet spots if you prefer. The Beach is not that long but it was claean and had plenty of chairs and shade. Beach BBQ also was a nice feature that we had never seen anywhere else. Oh by the way, we where at the pool by 10:30 everyday and we had no problems getting the same chairs.Entertainment stafff was great. They all go out of their way day and night to make sure everyone is having fun. The shows could be a little corny, but they all were entertaining and we watched them every night. Casino was fun but dont plan on walking away a big winner. Desires Night Club was a blast fun music, dancing and drinks.Overall I have to say that Dreams is a very nice Resort. ALL of the workers are extremely freindly, some more than others and you will have your favorites. It is very well mantained and very clean. The staff goes out of there way to help you to have the best experience possible. I would definetly recomend Dreams to anyone and would stay again without a doubt.

<Content>What a find!!! Just returned from a week at Dreams Punta Cana. My oldest son had his wedding there on Tuesday. Everything went off without a hitch! The rooms were clean and large, the pool was fantastic, the food was excellent for an all inclusive. The staff was very helpful with anything we needed. Julianna, the wedding co-ordinator did a fantastic job, from the rehearsal down to the wedding and dinner afterwards. Specialty restaraunts were wonderful especially the Japanese Hibachi style. Make sure you get Carlos (from Japan!) as your waiter. Loads of fun. Don't quite know what the people that give this place bad reviews were expecting, maybe the Waldorf??? I would go back anytime.

<Content>Fabulous Every worker there went out of their way to help. If you had a problem with something in your room, they were there in minutes. The rooms were very clean. The food was exellent. There were so many restaurants on sight to choose from. If all else fails there's the buffet, which was always great. The pool is awesome. The excursions we did through the hotel were wonderful. We did the outback safari. What a learning experience!

<Content>Great Value, Great Vacation Arrival in Punta Cana and transfer to Dreams - Once you arrive inside the airport you are immediately put into a line at the front of which your picture is taken with two girls in traditional Domincan dresses (which can be purchased for $8 when you depart Punta Cana). After this you are sent to a desk to pay the $10 per person entry fee. Our luggage was already off the plane when we reached the baggage claim area and an attendant took our bags to the transfer area. We booked our trip through Liberty Travel and the attendant took us right to their desk. The representative was very helpful and instructed us where we could find our bus to Dreams. The bus was a huge charter bus, seating about 50, however, there were only about 10 of us so we were very spread out. The driver explained that the trip would be about an hour so he would stop at a local market where we could purchase drinks for the ride. The market was right outside of the airport and the girls working at the market had bottles of El Presidente waiting to be purchased. Stopping at the market was a nice treat for the long ride ahead. The ride, despite what many reviews have previously stated, was really not that bad. I think it seems longer than it really is just because of your excitement to start your vacation. Yes, there were potholes, but our driver did an excellent job of trying to avoid them whenever possible. There is no highway, only local roads, that are shared by buses, trucks, mopeds, pedestrians. It gets a little crowded, but again, the driver did his best to make it as smooth a ride as possible.  Check In  Room- no issues here. Rooms were ready as soon as we arrived. We were in building 5 which I think was a good location. It was closest to the lobby/main building area, so we didn't have to walk too far for breakfast or the shows/casino/disco at night. It also wasn't a far walk to the middle pool area or the beach. The room was a typical hotel room - beds, bathroom, closet and walkout patio. Everything was very clean and the maid did an excellent job everyday and every night for turndown service. Pool - one of the best parts of the vacation. It's huge and only 3ft throughout so the water was warm, yet still refreshing. Despite other reviews, there definitely were enough lounge chairs even if you did arrive later in the day. The rafts in the pool were scarce and people did get greedy and hoard them by their chairs all day instead of keeping them in the pool for others to use. Not really a big deal for me though. Service by the pool was excellent. We consistantly had waitresses asking us if we wanted drinks, which were delivered within 5 minutes. You have to consider they take a lot of drink orders, and depending on how busy the bar is depends on when you'll get your drink. But again, it was always received in good time. The swim up bar was a bit crowded with only 2 bartenders at a time, which again, could cause you to have to wait a few minutes. But the wait is nothing crazy, and afterall you're waiting in the pool. Nothing wrong with that! Beach - We spent everyday at the pool and only walked on the beach once. The water was nice and blue, but the sand was rocky. I think you would definitely need to wear water shoes going into the ocean. Food - Excellent. We ate at the buffet every morning for breakfast and there was a ton to choose from. Orange juice was delicious and sweet which made the Mimosas even better! For lunch we generally ate from the Beach BBQ where you could get hamburgers, hotdogs, nachos, etc. There was also take out pizza available from the buffet. For dinner we generally ate a little earlier around 6:30 right when the restaurants opened, otherwise there was a wait to be seated. Our favorite by far was Bordeaux. We ate there three times during our week stay. We also tried the Mexican restaurant where the Margaritas are great and they have a mariachi type band singing at each table. The Italian restaurant was really a section of the World Cafe buffet and again was good. We also tried the Japanese restaurant at sat at the hibachi table. The chef didn't have many tricks while cooking, just basically cooked the food and served it. But there was a lot of food and it all tasted very good. Overall I had NO complaints with the food. Everything was delicious, and the portions were just the right size. Service - the best! From the moment we arrived for check in until we left a week later, the service was amazing. Each of the staff work very long hours and will do whatever they can to answer your questions, and provide promt, courteous service. Tipping is not necessary, but sometimes we found that we wanted to give something just because the service was great. Every employee we encountered was very personable, asking where we were from, etc. The service is definitely a reason I would go back to Dreams.Entertainment - Excellent. The entertainment staff work very long hours. You'll see them by the pool during the day leading the activities and again all night for the nightly show and dancing at the disco. The shows for the most part are entertaining/funny, and the dancing is great.  Negatives - there was only one negative aspect to the entire week and that was the vendors. I think they set up about three times during the week we were there and would not leave you alone! They set up their tables near the lobby/main building area so it's impossible to avoid them. They constanly nag you to have a look at their products. Once you get away from one table another is only a few more feet away and you're dealing with the same thing. This was my only annoyance during the stay.Summary - overall I would definitely recommend Dreams to someone travelling to Punta Cana. The hotel amenities were great, and the food, service and entertainment made everything that much more better.

<Content>Ok, but don't think I will be back I was at the Dreams Resort the week of June 19th-25th. I've read some of the other reviews and let me say lucky people to the ones that didn't have a bad ride from the airport. Ours was so bad that my mother was covered in bruises from her legs to her arms. We had to resign ourselves to the fact that we were going to be in a wreck, we just didn't know how bad. Luckily we made it to the hotel to be greeted by champagne and a cool towel, which after the ride was welcomed.The staff was very friendly at check-in and in the lobby. We were put in rooms 2225 and 2227. Both of the rooms had air conditioning problems. 2227's didn't work at all and 2225 only cooled the room to about 85 degrees. Both rooms had a musty smell and the maid service had to be called almost daily to restock the fridge. The showers ran really hot and then really cold. I suggest not messing with the temperature any when it turns cold or you may get burned a few seconds later when the hot water kicks back in. The food was okay. I think we ate at the buffet everyday cause it was quick. It got repetitive pretty quick. The Tex Mex place was good though. Have a good understanding of Spanish and be able to speak a little. My high school Spanish barely got me by. The entertainment crew was great. 50 Cent, Mickey Mouse and Michael Jackson were our constant companions. These guys love their jobs and it is evident. Found out that Michael lost some family in Katrina and Rita, but he is thankful for his job. What we saw of the island is poverty stricken. They have armed guards that patrol the place at night. My friend found this out walking the beach at night just to see a man with a gun step out in front of her. Scared her to death, so be warned if you feel like going on a late night stroll. The vendors that set up in the square will drive you nuts if you give them any leadway. If you aren't interested, the best thing to do is ignore then and keep walking. Otherwise you will be stuck there for an hour with the vendors fighting over you. If you are wanting to buy something, haggle. I talked someone down by $50. We didn't leave the resort, because we didn't feel it was safe to, and my little bit of spanish worked at the resort but I didn't think it would outside the resort.

<Content>Dreams Was Nice, But Would Not Return We stayed at Dreams May 19-24th for our 10yr wedding anniversary. Our overall stay was nice, but definitely not a six golden apple. We're not big travelers and have only been to Cancun, Nassau, and misc. places in the U.S., so I can only compare to these places.Our flight was with Delta and was fine. The trip to and from the hotel was no worse than what I expected from reading other reviews. Check in went smoothly, we went to our room, and that's when we had problems. We requested a king size bed, and got a room with 2 double beds. I called down to the front desk and spoke with the guy who checked us in. He said he'd see what he could do and call us right back. We waited 20 min before heading to the front desk. The guy who checked us in wasn't there, so we dealt with another person who got us a king size room, but we couldn't get it until the next day. We were fine with that and went back to our room.....to find our bags are gone!! We made the 10 mile treck back to the front desk and they acted like they've never seen us before. To make a long story short, after frantically looking for our luggage they realized that the initial person got us a new room, had our luggage moved, and never told anyone. We finally got to our room and it was adequate. It did not look like the photos on their website however. So I was a bit disappointed with that.The pool was fantastic, and so was the entertainment staff. Their shows were fun, a bit cheesy, but fun. The lobby bar has Budlight, and I recommend the Mr. Wilson drink at the pool bar. The food at the restaurants was hit or miss. The room service was always really good.We did the dune buggy excursion. It was fun and worth the money but it wasn't quite as exciting as I hoped it would be. I recommend NOT doing the horseback riding portion of it if that is the package you choose. The horses are very underweight and they use them over and over again....our tour guide PROMISED that the horses were in good shape and they only do one ride per day...that was not the case. Also, spend the $5 for a bandana to cover your face. It gets more dusty than you could ever imagine!We met a great couple from Boston too! Sean and Jessica, if you happen to see this, send me a PM!

<Content>It's a Crapshoot! FOODMy immediate family of 12 was part of a group of about 75 that went down for a wedding. I was the person in my group that was most concerned about getting sick. I finally summoned up the courage at the World Cafe and grabbed a plate the first night. I felt something on the bottom side of the plate and turned it over, it was covered in a thick layer of greasy remnants. I realized then that it doesn't matter what you eat or drink, if they are not handing the food, plates and glasses properly, all bets are off. I threw caution to the wind and ate and drank everything that was available for the rest of the trip and did not get loose in the caboose. I got the iron gut award. One member of the party had it on both ends and dehydrated, passed out, and ended up needing an IV. Bring your own nurse if you plan on going to the infirmary, it helps. $15 to walk in the door and there is price for everything.Another 4 of 12 had minor stomach issues but not enough to ruin your day and usually were over it in 24 to 36 hours. I truly is a crapshoot, if you are reading this, then you may already be going, so just take your chance and enjoy all there is to eat and drink. Folks on the plane at another resort said 7 out of 12 got sick so I think it's a DR thing. DRINKFirst time at an all-inclusive. The place is alcohol-fueled, which is fine with me, no one too out of control. Swim up bar is the happening spot. Wilson (I see Sama Sosa!) and the rest of the bartenders were awesome. We got in the habit of ordering more than one drink at a time since there was an occasional wait.BEACHBody-surfing a couple of blocks to the right, found it, Thanks TA.POOLAbout 95 degrees. We late getting out towels back one day and we left them at the towel house. Next day the guy said we should have taken them back to the room and bring them back the next day for our towel cards back. Seating was pretty open. No Problems. Pool Volleyball was good but they really need to replace the waterlogged pool volleyballs, too heavy to hit. We took a real volley ball from the beach and used that. ENTERTAINMENTRegarding the LOVE show with the kids? If younger, mostly went over their heads. If they are 11 to 14, they already know whats going on. RESTAURANTSWe had two group meals with the 75. They clearly do not have the staff to handle a sit-down this big. A course every 45 minutes was about average. Food was good. Went Chinese and French. Ordering is a crapshoot. Whatever they bring to the table, just eat it, even though it's not what you ordered, it's all good.DISCOGood times, lots of fun. Don't think they will play Viva La Vida again!CASINOThey don't look for Blackjack if they are showing an ace, so don't double down, it's their extra edge.ROOMCrapshoot. We had champagne, they didn't. They had towel art, we didn't. No bugs. Good AC. Heard every word of a wake up argument next door. One light rap on the door stopped it.

<Content>Honeymoon from hell Where do I even begin. We went to dreams for our honeymoon and the trip was far from a dream, it was more like a nightmare.We had problems from the moment we stepped foot in the resort. The front desk is so rude and unfriendly. The first room we had the ceiling was falling down in and they did move us to another room. The furniture is old and worn and some of it is falling apart. The bed was as hard as a rock. We were ripped off at the spa, we went for a 50min couples massage we were back at the reception desk in 30 min. I had to argue w them to get some money back. The food was terrible we both got sick for 2 days running in and out of the bathroom. The place was under construction and everything was a mess. there were wires hanging from the ceiling in the lower lobby and tarps and tools all over the floor wich we had to walk over. One of the resturaunts was closed the entire week we were there. There is no italian rest. it is in the world cafe on the side they put red and white checkered table clothes on and pretend its a different restaurant. We tried to pay and have a romantic dinner on the beach, we got down there and it was like a restaurant, 15 tables llined up and no privacy, then a quad came riding down the beach and was fumigating right onto us. We left it was absolutley rediculous. Our whole trip sucked and i would not recomend this resort to anybody not even my worst enemy. ( well maybe).

<Content>Dreams with some nightmares This was my and my husband's second time at this resort. This first time was when the resort was Sunscape the Beach. We were not expecting much, if anything, different with this visit, but did notice some suttle changes. The food was good the first time we went, but thought it was even better this time. However, the desserts still lack in the category of flavor. Perhaps it is a personal preference, but Americans like chocolate and lots of it. The desserts are always beautiful, but lack in flavor.Housekeeping and maintenance seemed to be lacking a little. I did not notice it the first time, but this time our bed broke and the door came off the armoire. We were in building 2, which is one of the older buildings. It was our understanding that building 7 was one of the newer buildings and we did have a chance to visit one of the rooms and determine it was a lot nicer.The major issue we had during this visit was the lobby ceiling falling in. Luckily it did not fall directly on us as we were in one of the shops off the lobby, but needless to say we were scared to death. We thought the whole building was coming down on us and we ran to find where to hide. I was hysterically crying because it devastated me. I'm usually not an emotional person, but with all the earthquakes and hurricanes all you can think about is it is happening to you. Luckily it was the drop drywall ceiling and no one was injured, but there were several of us visibly upset. None of the workers or staff ever asked any of us if we were injured or if there was anything they could do for us. There was no question that several women were crying or visibly upset. It was very disappointing that everyone went on like it was no big deal. I even asked one of the entertainment guys if it freaked him out and he said No, I've seen worse. Being from Michigan and not being exposed to hurricanes or earthquakes, I have not see worse. There was no sympathy or empathy for anyone. It had been raining fiercely and we had no idea if there was a hurricane or a tropical storm. One of the issues there is you really never know if bad weather is coming. We were informed later that it was a tropical depression (whatever the heck that means). I had a massage schedule for later in the afternoon. Between the ceiling falling and then helping two people with their drunken shortcomings (not the fault of the resort so I will not go into it here, although my husband and I played EMTs to a passed out girl in the rain) I had my massage. When I arrived and got dressed I broke down crying after all the drama and one of the girls offered me a peice of chocolate. I know that the resort could not control the ceiling falling, but they could control how they handled it afterwards. Soon after the incident I said I would never go back and wanted to go home right then. I also believe the resort should have some type of warning system in the event of bad weather. Whatever came through that day torn down trees and obviously had an effect on the ceiling. This information should have been shared with others.

<Content>Fabulous! My daughter (13) and I (39) stayed at the Dreams Resort in May 2008. We had a fab time there, dont let any of the negative reviews stop you booking this wonderful hotel. All off the staff are fantastic, from the hotel manager through to the gardeners, they just couldnt do enough for us.HOTEL  POOLThis hotel is immaculate, there were always people around cleaning. Pool is huge, it winds its way down through the gardens and hotel from the main entrance right down to the beach bars. It was never overcrowded and there were plenty of sunbeds available. The only negative thing I can mention is that the Americans tend to take all the pool floats and keep them to themselves even if they arent using them. My daughter asked 1 lady who had 3, if she could have 1, only to be told, go to the other end of the pool. My daughter being a fiesty little monkey promptly told her but you have 3 and youre not even using them! The lady then reluctantly gave her 1.ROOMWe stayed in room 3123, which is approx half way between the main hotel and the beach. This was great for us as we didnt have to walk too far for the restaurants or the beach. This area is really quiet too. We did have a room which faced out into the gardens (with a hammock on patio area), which I must say, I was slightly disappointed at first only to realise that if we went out the front door, the pool was there. The gardens were fab, full of fresh coconuts, wildlife and the most beautiful flowers I have ever seen. The room was extremely clean, the maids used to visit twice daily (morning and evening) with a turn down service when they left chocolates. Our morning maid was IRIS, what a wonderful woman, she loved to spend time with my daughter learning English and also teaching Spanish. When I return without my daughter, I shall be asking for a room from block 3101 - 3105, these rooms have the four poster beds and they face out directly onto the pool, with your own sun loungers. Theres a small bridge also crossing the pool, so the bar is within easy reach! The cocktails are a MUST!BARSThere are plenty of bars around but the main ones are the Coco Loco and the beach bar. The Coco Loco bar is located half way up the pool, where Rahul will be more than happy to throw a few cocktails together for you. You can get premium brands of spirits if you ask for them otherwise you will be given the local brand and they were pretty strong!RESTAURANTSThere are 7 restaurants -World Cafe, Steak House, Seafood, French, Mexican, Italian and Japanese/Chinese, so theres plenty to choose from. Food was fab and I had no complaints. A few people did get an upset tummy but I dont blame the food for one moment, the food was always hot and freshly made, I think its more of a combination of the change of envoirinment, sun, sea and too much alcohol. The thing I liked about this hotel is that you never had to pre-book your meals in the a la carte restaurants. There are busy periods, I would say 19:30hrs - 21:30hrs but they will give you a mobile phone and call when youre table is ready, so you can wander off to the bars and have a few more cocktails! If you dont fancy eating out, which me and my daughter sometimes didnt, room service is included in your all inclusive package, only downside being you cant order alcohol BUT you do have your beers in your mini bar along with soft drinks and fresh water. Tip your maid and ask her for an extra beer or 2 !!ENTERTAINMENTEntertainment is your normal 'holiday entertainment' Daytime activities are fun, we tried the Spanish lessons, Merengue dancing and lots of other sporting activities. We didnt experience too much of nighly entertainment as we were always tired from the day but what we did experience was good.BEACHBeach was beautiful, white sands and plenty of free loungers. Be careful if youre going swimming in the sea as if you enter the sea directly outside the hotel, there is coral, so you could cut your feet. If you come out onto the beach, turn left and walk a little way, you will find a spot were there is less coral (This is near the inflatable trampoline). There is also a daily BBQ on the beach, so if youre a beach lover and dont want to walk back to the main restuarants, there is still plenty of food n drink about. Try the hotdogs! WOW they were good!All in all, we had a wonderful time here and IIwould deffinately go back but this time for 2 weeks as 1 week just wasnt long enough.

<Content>Dreams - Punta Cana, the best vacation we ever had This was the best vacation we have ever had in 20 years of marriage. We have been all over the world and this place was by far the best. The food was excellant and there were plenty of different restaurants to choose from. The best for me personally was the Chinese. They had a wide selection in the World Cafe. The only thing that was missing for us was ranch dressing and flavored creamers. But not a problem I will just bring our own next time we visit. The Entertainment team was the greatest. The guys and girls were extremely polite and went out of their way for all the guests not just us but several did treat us like we were special. Those were Melkis, Angel, Meky Mouse, 50-cent, DJ TuTo, Stephanie, Usher, Luis and Michael Jackson. My teenage daughter Cassie made some special friends(see above) and she cried all the way back to Miami ( was already missing her new found friends) She wants us to buy a vacation home there.We plan to visit there next year and hope to bring the rest of the family. The Dance team was fantastic, the shows were great. My husband and I were in the True Love show and I have never laughed so hard. We didn't win but we sure had fun. We also met some wonderful people from the USA, Ireland and England. Maybe we could do a reunion same place , same time next year. We took 2 excursions , they were OK but now that I look back, We will not take any next year but just stay at the resort and have more fun. Again I would like the thank everyone at Dreams Punta Cana for a wonderful time.......Ann Owen, Florida USA

<Content>A very vert amaizing surprice Our little vacation to dreams was great ! I was shaky to go at first after reading some of the reviews especially because it was only my son ( 10years old ) and myself. The almost one hour bumpy ride was well wort it. Since our arrival every one was extremely friendly but also very professional Every one at the resort made us feel welcome and safe. After the bumpy ride the sparkling wine, orange juice and cold towel were waiting for us at the front desk. The rooms are not the greatest but ok since with so many activities in the resort the entertainment personal the gorgeous never ending pool and the great tours will keep you out of the room. We took the Santo Domingo tour, El Fieston, The four wheel bikes, and Laguna Limon, they were all great and we had a blast! I totally recommend them all. Try not to miss them. The roads do need a lot of work, they were very bumpy. That didn't stop us from dancing and screaming most of the time.The Restaurant were OK My son enjoy the world cafe in the morning,they had something different every day, and the chinese restaurant, (don't forget to try the fry banana with ice cream dessert ) myself, I enjoyed oceana restarant. Taking pictures with animals at the resort was very exiting for my son. They had a different animal every day.Watch out for the vendor they try to sell me a T-shirt for 25 dollars! You can do your shopping at the airport they have more rasoanable prices and better quality.Try to have breakfast early so you can enjoy most of the activities. Every activity we participate we got paid for and with that money we got a cap and a 40 min, massage. So participate in as many activities as you can they were so much fun! My favorite activities were the joga and aerobics class at the beach every day at 10:00 am with Mike. All the Games around the pool were fun too. We also enjoyed the Core Center full of sports like tennis and ping pong,pool tables and much much more activities for my son and myself. The kids club was excellent very well qualified personal. You do have to dress up for dinner. So I did enjoy putting on my cute shoes at night but they weren't very strict with the dress code specially with kids. They shows were all very good, simple and fun don't be shy go ahead and participate.Also if you can, tip this people who will give you a very good customer service matter what.They do accept tips.I have to give special thanks to Melkis, Mike, 50 Cent, Sharon, with the entertainment team they work so hard to make us feel welcome. Thank you to Raul in the middle of the pool bar for being so generous and creative with the drinks. We can't wait to go back and with the all inclusive deal we will be back soon of course only to Dreams in Punta Cana.

<Content>Average resort with some problems My husband and I went to Dreams for our honeymoon and we were somewhat disappointed. The food was so-so and as long as you order two drinks at a time you are good on that front. The night entertainment is beyond cheesey and I felt like I was at a 1950's camp at points. The workers just don't seem to use common sense there and we had a few too many problems. They will drop off uncovered fruit and chocolate to your room as a nice surprise but don't really think about all the ants that will soon infest your room. Soon you will have an ant farm on your floor and table. They turned off the water after a storm but only turned off the cold and did not alert anyone. My husband was in the shower at the time and needless to say got burned pretty bad. Also one day while we were enjoying our view from the honeymoon suite we also viewed an employee get off their bike and pee right in the bushes outside the room!We still enjoyed our honeymoon but we wish we would have read the reviews prior to booking the resort. We may have changed our mind and booked at a different location.

<Content>When can I come back? I traveled to Dreams Punta Cana with my husband, daughter (14 years), sister and her husband and daughter (6 years). We had a wonderful week and are sad to be home. The Dreams resort was clean, fun and beautiful and i would return and recommend it to others. Our daughters were entertained the entire week, with plenty of choices to hold their interest. They especially liked the iceberg climbing raft in the pool (the pool was amazing) and the shows at night. The staff worked so hard: they were up working in the early morning and still going strong until midnight. They were friendly, helpful and made the week entertaining. The entertainment team led games, exercises, shows, etc. We especially enjoyed getting to know the MC, Louis, JJ, Edward, Michael and really the ENTIRE entertainment team. The best barman, Roselio, was so friendly and remembered what drinks we liked. I would run in the mornings and when i finished, he always had a bottled water ready for me at the bar. The cleaning service did a great job as well. (We were in room 4329.) Our room was clean and neat and again, they were working in the early morning until late in the evening. Our VIP travel representative, Sharron, was amazing. She lead us through the entire week, providing practical advise to make our week more enjoyable and was always available for questions. We went on a snorkeling excursion and it was just as Sharron described it. A few tips: beach activities either cost extra or require a deposit that is returned, so be prepared with cash if you want to participate. Don't leave any valuable unattended. The World Cafe (buffet) you can walk right in and be seated, but the restaurants have a long waiting list, so put your name in early. Bring bug spray if you are prone to bug bites. The resort does fumigate, but it doesn't catch them all. There are roaming photographers that will take your pix on the beach or with zoo animals, but again, you will need cash to purchase any photos.We loved our vacation and hope to return another year.

<Content>Great Stay at Dreams Punta Cana We had a wonderful stay at Dreams Punta Cana! We traveled as a big group and our first day was rough ... lost luggage and some mix-ups with our accommodations. Remember, you are on Dominican time...a Dominican minute is 30 minutes, so sit back and relax, don't sweat the small stuff. The staff was friendly and the entertainment was outstanding. By the time you leave, you will be humming the Club Mix!The food was better than other all-inclusive resorts, a few members of our party experienced stomach issues, but nothing serious. The pizza was awesome and the spanish omellette on the breakfast buffet - these are a must! The beer was cold, but the mixed drinks were a bit water-downed, so you need to ask for rum, etc...the Sammy Sosa and Banana Mama were favorites. Even though the resort was all-inclusive, we found that tipping and getting to know your servers goes a long way. The resort is rather large, so map it out. The beach and ocean are spectacular. We found it to be breezy at the beach with plenty of sun and shady areas.  Our room was clean and the air conditioning worked just fine. Every morning we had a visit from a peacock! We highly recommend the zip-lining tour! Wow! We read all the reviews, many of them negative. Your experience is what you make of it!

<Content>Great vacation, great hotel!!!! Please don't believe all of the negative reviews about this place. My friend and I just got back from a long weekend and we absolutely loved it. Yes, the road from the airport to the hotel was very rough, but you are in a third world country.Overall, the hotel was well maintained, we constantly saw someone cleaning the floors or taking away empty glasses from the pool.Our room was clean, not the newest furnishings, however again, everything was CLEAN. Our fridge did not work upon arrival. We asked the maid for a new one and by the end of the day we had it.Overall the food was good. Bordeaux was the best restaurant, and the World Cafe was good for breakfast and lunch. Entertainment staff was great and so were the bartenders. Again, I was leery about this place after reading all of the negative reviews, but I was very impressed overall with this hotel and would definitely recommend.

<Content>Identity Theft Anyone? Rating scale = Great, Average, Terrible.Resort appearance was great, Beach was great, Pool was great, Drinks and food were nice to great, Service was great, Vendors every other night at resort were terrible. So where鈥檚 the big problem? The problem is security. Not so much while your enjoying your vacation but when you get home. While at the resort I purchased an Internet service within an hour of using the Internet service my laptop was crashed. Still not sure what is wrong with it or if room service had tampered it with. My wife and I met a few couples who we exchanged emails with. Two couples have sent us emails advising that their credit card numbers had been stolen at the resort and used in various locations mostly in the U.S. Always fun to clean up a security nightmare after going to Dreams. Thanks for coming and thanks for your identity.

<Content>Fabulous Vacation!!! Don't believe the nay-sayers about this fabulous resort. We just arrived back home today and are already planning to visit again. The rooms, pool, services, the extraordinary Explorers Club were far beyond our expectations!!! Although I will admit the ride from the airport was long and bumpy (it seems as if a highway is in the process of being built), it is well worth it. The Dreams staff were amazing. The Sugar Reef staff were great...it was our favorite place to hang out during the day. Everyone always had a ready smile and a friendly Ola. The entertainment staff shone brightly....I loved the dance lessons and step aerobics near the beach. There were so many things to do all day every day. The nightly shows were so entertaining...make sure to see the magic show, we were truly amazed. The food was very good, we especially enjoyed the mexican restaurant and the World Cafe buffet. My children both cried when it was time to go home. We will definately be returning to Dreams....and hope to be able to stay longer next time.

<Content>Highly recommend this resort We stayed at the Dreams Resort for a week starting April 29, 2008. We LOVED all of it! Even the process arriving at the Dominican Repulblic airport was very efficiently done, including going through customs on the way home. Hotel staff was extremely friendly and helpful, right down to the grounds keepers. We had 5 pools to choose from all clean and well maintained daily, plenty of chairs, towels, and umbrellas to hide from the sun. Pool floats provided made the heat of the day so enjoyable, along with a cold beverage from one of two poolside bars. No need to be shy about asking the bar staff the make it a double shot if the drink was too weak. Rooms were well kept; room refrigerator was always full when you returned at the end of the day. It was nice not to have to wear one of those arm bands to be at the resort, and NO reservations needed at any of the restaurants either, longest wait was 陆 hour. The French restaurant was worth repeating twice in our 7 nights. The hotel offered kids play area, and hotel staff supervised the children and planned daily activities for the kids that were enrolled for the day. We don鈥檛 have kids, but observed with 5 pools available, that we weren鈥檛 bother by children while we were relaxing with our adult beverages. The pool closest to the hotel had a large inflatable climbing rock for the kids to play on so most parents hung out in this area, leaving the other 4 pools for the adult guests. The only problem we had, was at our departing airport that our suitcases. Both check-on bags were over the weight limit and we had to shell out $100 to check two bags in, or stand at check-in redistributing garment in front of all the passengers! (NOT) Apple Vacations should have red flagged that information in the trip details. I highly recommend placing your bags on you home bath scale before you leave home. Before we left the hotel, the hotel was happy to bring us a bath scale (just for the bags!) so we could redistribute the weight to keep the weight below the required amount.

<Author>WorldTravelorCa_Usa
<Content>This was an amazing place, I've traveled to Punta Cana - 10 times Let me start by saying I travel 50 weeks a year for work. I am seasoned in world travel and expect the best. This was the best.Over the years I've come to see Punta Cana as the new Cancun. I travel here every year for at least a week for rest, relaxation, and great beaches. Keep in mind I live in CA at the beach.I was very nervous about trying Dreams because of the reviews. The travel agent repeatidly told me not to worry. Let me tell you having stayed Catalonia Bravaro, Iberostars, and many other 4 to 5 stars.. I rank this the highest of them all. The other hotels were fine did a good job, hands down, but I like to try new things and took the chance.Why was this superior..? The people were great! could not do enough for us. The drinks were premium labels, and service at the bars was quick and friendly. The food was amazing. There were 5 specialty restaurants.. and you could go to any of them as often as you liked with no exceptions. Most of Punta Cana you can only go to one specialty restaurant per visit. There were daily newsletters of activities all day long if you wanted to participate. My kids are grown, but there were many very nice playgrounds and waterslides for young children, as well as well supervised activities.We upgraded from beach view room, to a big suite. We went from small suite to multi-room suite with hottub on balcony. The room was amazing..NEGOTIATE.. the price they give you can be heavily negotiated. We were able to drop the price by 2/3rds what they wanted. (Keep in mind availability is the key). We were given keys to both rooms to compare before deciding.There was a wedding onsite each night. they really worked each day on making each wedding a memory. There were lots and lots of seating at the pool and the beach. You never had to worry about saving seats. There was entertainment each night and a disco.. I went to relax and enjoy time away from busy travel workschedule.. so this was not important.If you want to go to town it was a 20 - 40 minute drive, tours available. Other resorts offer more crowds, and sister/brother resorts.. this did not. But the choice of food far far outweighs the travel time to town.My traveling friend was a chef.. and picky picky about food. The choices included Prime Rib, Carribean lobster, Lamb chops, Steaks, ect. this was real beef imported from the US. The good stuff. There was a sushi restaurant, mexican restaruant, steak house, and italian restaurant. All quality. We ate at the buffet one night and had lots to choose from (turkey, veal, ect). Again this differentiates the resorts.. makes this a premier resort.I will go here again. I throughly enjoyed the people, the friendlyness, the service, and choices. They far exceed both our expectations.dwgraham242@yahoo.com

<Content>Not a good resort, save your money! We just got back Sunday from Dreams Punta Cana and I was not overly impressed...I will detail everything in my review coming up.Airport/Arrival/Check-in to Dreams:We had no problems getting from GSP to Charlotte to Punta Cana, DR. Upon arriving at the airport, and i must say, the airport is nice, the arrival gates that is. You have to pay the $10 and then you are on your way. We loaded up into our bus, we took Prieto Tours was our transfer bus. The drive is AWFUL!!! It is very nausiating and LONG. Roads are bumby so be prepared...we got to Dreams in an hour and 10 minutes. Upon arriving at Dreams, we were not greeted with champagne but with a wet towel, after we were already at the desk checking in...very disappointed in that. They promise you a glass of champagne and towel and we got 1 out of 2, and then when we asked for champagne, no one EVER brought us any after 30 minutes. NOT A GOOD START!!The Room:Oh where do I begin here....We get our room, we are in building 7, room 7217 (second floor), it is a honeymoon suite. We get in and notice that it has a very must smell, so we just start walking around the room just to see what we have and notice LOTS of things that arent right. 1. Rugs are dirty, literally have dirt on them2. Ants in the jacuzzi tub on the balcony and its dirty with dirt in it, and lines of ants all over the balcony. 3. Refrigerator is broken, is not cool and drinks are hot4. AC is blowing out hot air, not cool at all5. Room is just dirty, dirt on floors, in bathroom, over by bed, in the living areaSo after a brief shower, I go back down to the front desk and complain, telling them that we want to change rooms, front desk says there is nothing we can do, nothing is available and said that he will send a cleaning crew to the room. It gets done but we watch them every step of the way. They bring new refrigerator and still isnt cold, but it is the best they can do. Rooms are very outdated mind you as well, very dated. Its like they took the room and put cheap makeup over it to make it look dressed up. The entire week go better as cleaning goes, but the room is dated like i said and the AC isnt powerful at all, run the fans and the AC and it will stay cool for you.(Grade: D)Resturants:We went to Oceana the first night and it was good, I had the beef fillet with shrimp and my wife had the Salmon i think. It was good. Bordeaux was AWESOME! World Cafe is a buffet, good for breakfast. El Patio was good mexican food. But the biggest complaint I have here, is that Seaside Grille was closed the ENTIRE week we were there...this is one of the main things that sealed the deal between Dreams and the Excellence for us because we had eaten at the Seaside Grille at the Dreams Los Cabos as they are the same resturant at the resort. Very disappointed.(Grade: B-)Beach and Pool:The beach and the pool are very nice, the beach is good with a nice breeze blowing off the Atlantic and the water is not warm but it is not cold either, stay to the left and it will be good, we never went anywhere else but its fine. We did the sea kyaking and it was fun. The Pool was big and there are chairs in the pool that you can sit in and be in the water, the water starts to feel like pool water after awhile though. There are NO rafts though! This sucked also. Only pieces of them so dont bother, take your own or buy some there for $13...there are NO floats to use.(B+) Service:The service is pretty poor i must say...unless you show $1 or dollars, they are not speedy. It was an act of God to get a bottled water or diet Coke in the World Cafe for breakfast. Seriously though, you have to ask 3 or 4 people before they bring you one 15 minutes later. AWFUL. The service in El Patio and Bordeaux was the best. El Patio was so-so. The pool side service to get drinks and stuff takes forever, you can get 2 drinks by getting it yourself by the time the people come around with the one you ordered. A couple of us tested it one day. Also make sure you ask them to put alcohol in your drinks because sometimes they dont at all. (Grade: F)Departure:This was the icing on the cake, when you go see your representative at the hotel with your travel agency, they tell you, you dont have to call 24 hours before hand to check your status on your flight...so they tell you, you have to be at the airport 3 hours before your flight leaves, well when we get there, our flight is delayed 3 hours so we have to sit in the airport for another 3 hours...SUPER...and there is nothing there to eat, except a Wendy's and some little cafe places that dont look too good...and there is a pizza place as well. We missed our connecting flights back home and got home 3 hours later than we were supposed too. DO NOT FLY US AIRWAYS!!!!!!! They are going to start charging $2 for cokes, sodas on the plane, also they will be charging you to check your first bag of luggage, since its free now, DO NOT FLY THEM!!!(Grade: F)Other notes about Dreams Punta Cana:- Our rep at the hotel, Cesar, we voiced our complaints to him, he was all happy before we told him this, bragging about himself and everything and as soon as he asked us how are we liking our stay and the hotel so far, we started telling him, at this point, he didnt even seem like he cared, he started looking around and got very quiet, he said he was going to the front desk and tell them, but he never did. - We were promised a fruit basket and champagne bottle for our anniversary, and we never got it. Thanks Eileen! (sarcasm)ONE POSITIVE NOTE!!!!!- To Roselio at the Sugar Reef Bar, you are the Best Barman in the world. It was great to talk to you and hang out on the rainy saturday that we had. I hope your daugther had a very happy first birthday. This guy is the man! Go see him at the Sugar Reef Bar! Best employee on this resort.Summary:Needless to say, we were very disappointed in our stay here at the Dreams Punta Cana, and will never be returning here. The staff here act like they dont even care about the guests unless you give them money. We stayed at the Dreams Los Cabos for our honeymoon and it was a great resort! Go there!! They will love you there, you can read my review on that resort on the Dreams Expierences but under Dreams Los Cabos. This hotel is very outdated, the lobby is nice, but the rooms are very very dated..they have a LOT of work to do to get this to a nice hotel in Punta Cana. We should have chosen the Excellence and after leaving we heard good things about other resorts, especially this one and others that other travelers stayed at. We hung out with other couples at Dreams Punta Cana as well, and they were not happy either with their stays as well as others that we overheard at breakfast, lunch and dinner. Expect to see a lot of negative reviews on Trip Advisor coming up. They deserve it!!! I would rate this hotel as average and not luxury by any means.

<Content>Not so much a "Dream" I will start this entry by stating that we have stayed at the Dreams resort in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico and it was absolutely amazing! Don't let this review detour you from traveling there!Now...to Dreams Punta Cana...: Upon arrival at the airport, we were highly impressed with how quickly and easily the entry into the country, baggage claim, and finding our bus was. The hour and a half ride to the resort was absolutely brutal! We were so nauseated by the time we arrived that we could hardly stand. The potholes are terrible, our driver swerved to avoid potholes making you very dizzy, and we had to stop at five resorts before arriving to ours. When we got out of the bus, we headed toward the check in counter where they finally came to give us a cold towel. We never did get champage--even after asking for it and waiting for approximately 10 minutes. Check in was relatively easy--no problems there. Our room was actually ready upon arrival, which I was glad to see that it was.We made it to our room, the bag boy had our luggage waiting, and then came the disaster! Our refrigerator was not cold, there were drink and dirt stains on our couch and loveseat and rugs, the bathroom area was extremely dated, there were ants in our jacuzzi on our porch, the remote didn't work to our television......shall I continue?? It was not a good start to our vacation.We decided to go ahead and get showers and change and head to dinner. We were familiar with the restaurants because they are the same as the ones in Cabo. We loved SeaSide Grill and were thrilled to be going back. We walk down that way, and suprise surprise! It's CLOSED for the WEEK!!! This is the restaurant where you can actually get American food. We did go to Oceana and the food was average. As far as the other restaurants go, World Cafe almost made me gag before the end of the week because we had to go there SO often! El Patio's chips and salsa were great--but my entree was disgusting! Don't order the chicken quesadillas!! Himitsu (we went to the Hibachi grill) was good--the cooks don't know any tricks--but we were pleased since the food tasted good. Our favorite restaurant at the resort was Beurdoux--we had an excellent server and the food was delicious. Too bad we discovered this restaurant on the last night. To receive a diet coke, it was a complete act of God! Service was SO slow....the only thing that is quick is wine, orange juice, and coffee....if you want anything else, be prepared to WAIT!!!The pool was fine--the service was extremely slow to get drinks (and by slow I mean like 20 minutes) and floats are nearly impossible to aquire them. Bring your own!! Trust me, it's much easier! As far as the beach goes, it was very nice. I enjoyed being out there--we went in the kayaks and went swimming and we had a good time. One of our days was wasted because it rained the ENTIRE day--12 hours to be exact! I know this isn't the resorts fault but don't belive the locals when they tell you that it will rain everyday for 15 minutes and then it stops! One day we did an excursion to Alta de Chavon--it was nice but 50% of the trip was driving on bumpy roads! We met another couple who went on another excursion, and they said the same thing--that half of it was driving.This trip was just average. Small things added up to be not a great trip. Good luck if you are going there--I hope you have a better one!

<Content>4 stars out of 5 in my book The Dreams Resort is a nice place to stay. Location isn't the greatest but an hour trip is quite the adventure. Its a shame to see how people live and how people like us take things for granted where we live. Just brace yourself for the driving quite the trip. I am a country boy and I was scared at times with the drive. The hotel itself is nice. We were on our honeymoon and had the honeymoon suite bulding six. It was nice. It had no view. Just trees and such. But that is nice if you want to be alone. The rooms are nice. I didn't have any problems with the bed or shower or anything. One problem was that there was water leaking from the ceiling. I think this is a common problem. Had to call the front desk TWICE before they sent someone. The second time I called concerige and they had someone there within 1/2 an hour. They fixed the problem. I wouldn't spend the extra money if I would go again to get the honeymoon sweet. It gives you a jacuzzi and the special bar on the first floor to use. But just stay in the normal rooms your not missing much. Food was fine. People complain about it on here all the time but it is not that bad. People in the USA are too used to having meals that are one big meal and you can't eat it all. They expect you to get a 4 course meal. If you eat it all you will be plenty full. Room Service is what makes this hotel. 1/2 an hour wait and it is there. Menu is a little limited. No food problems. Drinks are good. Ask for extra rum they go a little skimpy on the boos unless you ask. Beer was good like the Presidente. Casino is quite the thing very small. Played Blackjack 4 nights total. After week was over I took about 50 dollars home. They hate to lose. Don't expect them to be like American Casinos. They will try to get you drunk so you don't pay attention. WATCH YOUR money they will try to take it if your not paying attention. This happen several times with many players. Be careful. Pit bosses look mean. But the heck with them and have fun. They shows are neat but we didn't watch many of them. Snorkeling was fun. Beach is nice. Stay to the left side(Less Rock and Coral) Pool is awesome I bet it is 3 1/2-4 football fields long. If you don't like kids don't come here. There are usually a few but most are out of the way in the Explorers Club. I didn't mind them. GO AND HAVE FUN. DONT LISTEN TO BAD REVIEWS. Would go back!

<Content>Best Holiday ever!!! My advice would be to not listen to the negative reviews and check it out for yourself!!!Had a standard room but no complaints at all, was hardly in there anyway... The whole resort was truely amazing!!! Excellent Gym  Spa, The restaurants were good but we mainly ate in the World Cafe. The Weather was beautiful  HOT HOT HOT!!! But best of all were the entertainment team, Esp JJ, 50 Cent and Stephanie... Miss you all so much that i cried all the way to the airport... I'm now saving to go back ASAP!!! Kellie and Jacqui xxx

<Content>Very Nice Getaway--Just what we needed! My husband and I, and our 9 year old went to Dreams from 6/8-6/13. We really enjoyed ourselves. It is funny the things you read on here, and how different the reviews are. It was the same at the resort. Same resort, same hotel, same beach, same food, MANY different opinions. I now will give mine.The ride to the hotel is everything and more on what the people have written about! There are pot holes EVERYWHERE! They are swerving to and fro and my daughter was in tears 20 mins into the 60 minute ride. BE FOREWARNED! But this is not the resorts fault, so onward....We got to the resort and we were greeted by smiles, cold towels and a glass of champagne. We got to our room, and true, it was small. But it was clean and that is all that matters. We don't spend much time in our room during a vacation. It was hot and the ceiling fan didn't seem to cut it. Also the refrigerator was warm as well. We called maintenence and they were there within a half hour and fixed both. They don't know if it is broken unless someone tells them. I wonder how many guests were in that room and didn't say a word about it, and suffered or have a negative thought about the resort. It's a shame. If you have a problem call the concierge or mantenance directly. We sure are glad we did.The shower does go from hot to cold a lot. Not that big of a deal...I just turned the nozzle. Maids were in our room twice daily, once in the morning and once to turn down our bed at night. We tipped them a little each day and got everything we needed.The lazy river pool was very nice but because it is shallow was very very warm by the end of the day. Still we enjoyed it. They have a rock climbing iceberg that my daughter loved, and as stated before in the reviews, they have a turtle trampoline tied down in the ocean which she loved. They are both for children only. Of course you had the typical idiots that the more they drank the more they tried to climb the iceberg. Almost tipping it over, putting children's safety at risk. My husband took care of that or I should say them real quick. Never had a problem with towels. Or getting drinks. If it took too long to get a drink, we just walked to the bar. It wasn't far, and they have bars everywhere.I didn't think the World Cafe (Their Buffet) was that bad at all. I didn't feel it was too repititious either. I guess we are low maintenence. Any time I don't have to cook is a good night to me! :) It caters to adults as well as kids, and actually has a section called Kids Corner with everything from the main meal to dessert there for the children. It is even a lower buffet area so the little ones can reach items for themselves. I thought that was really cool.We only tried the Italian and the Mexican restaurants. We had met a family that got very sick after eating at the seafood restaurant. They think it was the shrimp. Mexican was so-so as was the Italian. The Italian restaurant was in a little section of the buffet restaurant because of repairs being made after a major storm. Mexican restaurant was decorated nice, food was ok. Our daughter didn't care for them, and ended up getting stuff from the Buffet restaurant.Didn't use the Explorer's Club (Kids Camp) Our daughter didn't want to go. She met so many kids in the pool and beach, she didn't need to go.As stated by other reviewers the Entertainment Team is really good. These kids work their butts off from 9AM-Midnight for 11 days straight and then get 3 days off. They do a great job getting guests involved in the pool/beach games. You can earn play money that you can use at the Auctions they have every M,W,F night. Hats off to Mickey Mouse!!! You are the best on the entertainment team! You made our stay at Dreams so much better! Give this guy a raise!Weather was beautiful, not one raindrop our whole 6 day stay...thank GOD!We had a wonderful time, the employees were very friendly and we would definately go back to DREAMS.

<Content>beautiful people beautiful place My wife and myself are from Yorkshire England, and recently stayed at the Dreams, Punta Cana.The drive to the hotel was a bit hairy but I,ve experienced worse in other parts of the world.Upon our arrival we were greeted by staff with champagne who said welcome home, and let me tell you a home it was. we feel as if our family grew massively in the two weeks that we stayed at every meeting with all members of staff from maids to managers there were smiles, nothing was too much bother and everyone worked so hard to make our stay a fortnight to remember.The food in every resteraunt was in our opinion cooked by the most excellent chef's, taste and presentation perfect,in the most clean and pleasant surroundings.Again the waiters and waitresses were attentive and friendly adding to the dining experience tremendously.It does help if you speak some spanish as this appreciated greatly and in fact I learnt so much as all are willing to be patient in any conversation. The next topic is the pool and bar area,well choose your experience, you can just lounge and be served by the girls that regularly take your orders or join in the non stop party that is the reef bar, the excellent entertainment staff are on hand always keeping the day flowing with activities for all.The same staff provide a stunning show every night in the main theatre.We did not see one cockroach,nor did we get bit by mosquitoe's indeed the place was fumigated regularly.the accomidation was of a good standard that being said we weren't there to sit in our room.we had a violent storm in which the ceiling in the main building collapsed and trees were uprooted and heard people complaining as if the staff could control the weather,maybe some people live to moan.We met some cool guests from the U.S.A and England and had a blast.The beach was beautiful and cleaned every morning by hotel staff but watch out for the rocks (take beach shoes)In summary I would reccomend Dreams to anyone who want to meet wonderful people in paradise

<Content>Fantastic return trip. Firstly an apology on the length of this review. I knew it would be long though as there is so much to share and I know how much I love reading reviews I hope some of you at least get the same pleasure from mine. I was there from the 25th of May to the 8th of June. This was our 2nd trip to this resort - last year it was for our honeymoon in June 2007 when it was Sunscape the Beach.I've tried to break it into categories so that it is easier to read.Airport and Flight4 of us flew from Newcastle with Thomson's. We prebooked and paid for the airport lounge and even though it was 6.30am I certainly got my moneys worth at the bar!! The flight was slightly delayed but hey never mind it can't be helped.Thomsons new long haul flights are fantastic legroom was brilliant, it is 2 4 2 layout as well - I wouldn't upgrade to extra legroom there was plenty - and I've got fairly long legs!We paid the extra 拢5 to upgrade our TVs on the back of the chairs so we could control when we watch movies, pause etc and also watch more variety, was going to on the way back as well but for some reason we had for free, was worth the money though!Drinks service wasn't great on the flight - either way, I would change that but everything else was fine.Punta Cana airport - 2 or 3 flights came in at the same time so it was a wait for luggage but still got through quite quickly. No problems here at all. When departing here is a tip - there is a bar beside Wendy's which is air conditioned and lovely! We missed this last year but the couple we went with new about it from last year. Nice to cool down.TransfersThis was on a slightly larger coach as there were 23 people being dropped off at dreams. We had 1 stop 1st which seemed so far out of the way that I am not sure why they weren't on another bus so it did take over an hour. The roads are bumpy but nothing too bad although on the way to the hotel it did seem better but I think that is because we were on a larger bus on the smaller bus on the way back you felt it more - not sure why but it made a difference.Check In and OutWe didn't get any cool towels when we checked in but we did get champagne which was lovely. Check in was fairly quick and painless. We left our bags with the bell boys and gave them a tip - we were in the room next to our friends so they asked if they could leave all 4 cases in 1 room rather than get them mixed up. We were happy with that an went for a drink at the lobby bar - heaven! Bags were in our rooms when we got there about 40 minutes later.Check out was quick and painless - they saw we were really hot so they brought us cool towels, they asked us to fill out a comment for which we did and I think everyone should make sure that they do. There were loads of staff round asking if we had enjoyed ourselves and had any problems as well which I thought was great.We got a lovely welcome and congratulations letter for our anniversary from Eileen (concierge) which was a nice touch.RoomWe had room 1309 and 1308. These were next to each other but not adjoining rooms. This was great so we could easily meet with our friends. Champagne and Fruit basket in our room for our anniversary which was lovely. They were standard deluxe rooms and since I had a huge room last year I could see they were smaller but they were enough for just the 2 of us.Rooms in building 1 have not been renovated yet but I was happy which what we had.We did consider moving to building 6 and saw some of the rooms that were there - they do look amazing and when everywhere is renovated then it will be even better but it doesn't mean the rooms were bad that we had. We didn't move as we decided were was no real difference in size unless we had chosen a suite and we had an amazing view, I was happy with this.We had the new alarm clock and robes but no slippers, our friends didn't have any of this until the last week when robes appeared. I am sure that if we had asked we would have got some. We didn't have any towel art this year, hubby was pleased the petals go everywhere!, I liked the towel art but wasn't a biggy. We did have wonderful Rosa for turndown. I was so pleased to see her here still, she did turndown in building 6 for us last year and even without her knowing English or us knowing Spanish she is a wonderful funny woman who tries so hard to please everyone. She did leave us flowers art on a night time and if we went back too early for turndown to have been done we got lots of chocolate!!We did leave tips most if not all days for the maids. We had plenty of water, beer, juice and coffee left for us.FoodFirstly I have to let you all know about what seems to be a bit of a secret....I knew I had read on the forum about people having lunch at Oceana but the Sundial never mentioned it, however our Holiday Rep did so we went and checked it out. It is wonderful. It is only a continental breakfast - no omelettes or anything served here however bread rolls, meats, cheese, pasties, croissants, jams, fruit, juice and coffee all are here. We were they only people here apart from 1 day when there was another couple. So we used here most days instead of the world cafe. Please if you like a cold breakfast give it a try and it is truly wonderful eating breakfast in the peace and quiet looking out at the wonderful sea! I was in 2 minds about whether to share the secret or not but I recon if more people don't use it then it might get stopped which would be such a shame. World CafeUsed here for breakfast a couple of times when one of us wanted something cooked and it was good. Did seem a lot busier this year though but the hotel was at 90-100% capacity so I think this was natural.Also used here for lunch a few times and once for dinner. All were good with plenty of variety. Go here for pizza and pasta after the show or disco was great to take back to the room and meant you didn't miss room service if you fell asleep! Hitmasui (spl?)Japanese sideWe went last year and weren't going to try again however our friends hadn't tried it last year and wanted to give it a shot. It was a good laugh and the food is great. I think it make a difference if the whole table is a group of friends that know each other to smaller group. I enjoyed the meal and there was a good atmosphere but you could here a lot of people at other table having a loader time. If you want to go to this side of the restaurant you will have to queue up early! We didn't mind queuing as we had decided we wanted it on a specific night so we got some drinks and went up about 5.15 (opens at 6). Others that really wanted it did the same. What really really annoyed our group was that some people don't seem to be able to form a line and were just grouping around the front door waiting for it to open. Luckily when the woman came out and asked who was first one of us were able to speak up and were also backed up by others.It's not great that you have to queue to wait but if you do at least be courteous about it and form a line.Chinese sideLoved this, didn't need to queue for here, one night there was a wait but we decided just to go somewhere else - our choice. Food was great, service was quick. Would have liked to have gone back again but ran out of time!ItalianThis was good and liked the choices that there were. Made a great choice with the chicken something pasta and sauce. This wasn't our favourite although my hubby did seem to enjoy it more than anyone else and he's not a big pasta lover at home. Chose not to go back there again but only due to us having so many others we wanted to go back to. El PatioThe Mexican was much better this year than last year. I hadn't really enjoyed it last year but I did enjoy the food this time. The fajitas are not the best I've had but what do you expect! The lemon desert was delicious though. Only ate here once.Seaside GrillAte here only once I think!Enjoyed the food although didn't try a starter or desert we did try the salad bar which was excellent. It looked like the men and women had swapped meals though with the men having the kebab skewers which looked small but they said it was filling and I think I had some sort of steak which was huge.The seaside grill was shut most of the 2nd week and the floor was being retiled.It was often that either the seaside or oceana were shut which meant that the one that was open was very busy. Again if you want to eat there on a specific night be early unless you don't mind waiting. They will give you a buzzer and you can go to the bar and have a drink. OceanaExcellent Breakfast as I have mentioned already.Amazing lunch - the first week it was really quiet but busier in the 2nd week. It is table service and they service fantastic sandwiches, try and Cheese Philly Chicken Sub and the Mexican Burritos - they were great. The Greek Zorbas salad was amazing as well.We went here a couple of times for dinner and really enjoyed it as well. Remember to order a coffee at the end - it's some show if the guy is on! Wish I had had my camera out that night. Don't want to spoil it for you all though but it was great.This was one of our favourite restaurants. Bordeaux (Spl?)We had some of our best meals here but also one of our worst which I will explain in more detail as well.The first night we arrived we ate here as Oceana was full and seaside grill was closed. There was no wait at all and this was after 7pm. Food was good and service was quick. The next time we ate here was just my hubby and me for our anniversary and it was the best meal and service of the holiday. My glass was never empty of champagne and the food was wonderful, try the onion soup, rack of lamb and the double chocolate moose - wonderful.The 3rd time we ate here the service was slow more than one waiter seemed to want to serve us which meant that the wrong meals came to the wrong people - that you would think is easily rectified but more than one person had ordered the steak and I wanted it well done - don't like to see the pink! and 1 was ordered medium. When we asked which was which there was lots of confusion and I ended up with the wrong one which really put me off eating for the night. The others food they found was only Luke warm as well. I know it doesn't sound much when writing it but the service, not even getting drinks orders taken, water glasses left empty for ages, getting made to feel that what we were asking for was unreasonable and food that night was nothing like we had experienced before and we were really disappointed and in fact we left most of the food and left the restaurant. When we left the restaurant there was a staff member walking to the welcome host - I think he must have been the restaurant manager - he asked if everything was ok with our meal. Being quite vague we had said that it wasn't very good and that we were disappointed as a few nights ago we had the best meal ever in there, he apologised and asked us to come back the following evening where he would make sure that we had a great meal. We agreed as he really seemed disappointed that we had that experience and we had a couple of nights left. The next evening the staff couldn't have been more attentive. My hubby couldn't finish his as he was too full and they got worried that he hadn't enjoyed his meal. I did feel sorry for the waiter as it was the same one as the night before and he apologised for the previous evening. The fact that they took the time to listen and try and rectify the problems were great though and I would still say that this is my favourite restaurant on the resort. If you go at for when it opens you will find a lot of people waiting but this was mainly large groups trying to make sure that they would get seated but after 7pm but before 8pm we found there was normally no queue for here and got in no problem at all. The bar here has great views as well so try and get up there for a couple of drinks.Room ServiceTried this a couple of time. Although I couldn't see a real difference in the menu the food it's self was better this year and it came hot where as last year it was only luke warm. It was always quick as well which was great.Drinks / BarsA tip in case I forget I didn't know that you could ask for Champagne at any of the bars and it was included. We started doing this about half way through the first week and it was a great change for a drink with or with out your meal instead of the house white. I don't know if it is really champagne or cava but was lovely all the same.Lobby BarWas one of our favourites we would sit and chill out if it was too hot and relax on an evening on the comfy chairs and it also had the best variety of drinks. Bottled Presedenti and Bud Light as well as lots of different flavoured Absolute Vodkas - I think I went through 3 bottles of Raspberry Absolute and 1 or 2 or Citrus Absolute - it is wonderful and refreshing with Sprite!Chocolate was the best bar man for the whole resort, always remembering your drinks orders - considering we kept changing our this was a miracle.Excellent table service as well up here but I can't remember the woman who was the bests name. Sometimes service could be quite slow at the bar which was frustrating.Core ZoneThis is where they have pool tables, table football, screens, tennis courts etc and a bar.This was a great place to hide from the mid day sun or go when the weather wasn't great. They also put the football (soccer) on as well as any other games people wanted. The bar only serves beer and soft drinks so bring some down from the lobby if you prefer something else - you can bring bud light down and ask them to put it in the fridge!Swim up BarDidn't use as often this year but I think that is because we spent more time in the Core Zone and lobby bar instead or at Oceana having a lazy lunch.Still good though and was busy quite often.OthersKafe bar - didn't really use this - no particular reason why thoughSugar Reef - used a couple of timesBarracuda - didn't do food at lunch which it did last year while we were there.Oceana / Seaside Grill Bar - nice to wait here for your tableOther drinks to try - Dirty Monkey, Strawberry Daiquiri (you don't have to just have with rum - I had vodka and hubby Gin), Dreams cocktail, Really good cocktail list - just ask to have a look at it.StaffAll were really friendly. The ones that really stood out were Rosa and Chocolate.The 4 of us agreed though that the best staff who really worked the hardest at making sure everything was perfect were probably the maids and the gardeners. It's not to say that the customer facing staff weren't all great but we didn't feel that the maids and gardeners were appreciated enough - if you do have the money to tip people please please remember these guys - the gardeners especially don't get tipped very often at all.Couple of times we saw people come around to make sure everything was ok with your holiday and ask if you had any problems - I thought this was a great idea to really look after the guests.Great concierge is especially Eileen and Nicola. Eileen is amazing always running around relaly busy but always happy to help anyone. Nicola has only been working at Dreams for a few week but she has moved over from the UK and is lovely. Really wanted to help you out and make sure you were having a great stay.TipsWe were able to tip frequently when we were away. The couple we were with weren't able to tip as much but when they didn't they didn't feel that they got any different service. One thing is though that I will only tip when I get good service not to get good service. We took around $900 for souvenirs, cigs and tips and spent $800 most of that was on tips in the 2 weeks. I'm not someone to preach about tipping but we are lucky enough to be able to afford to so we did.Trips / ExcursionsThis time we didn't do any at all.SPAMe and my friend booked ourselves both in for an aromatherapy massage while here. We used the well being centre first which was wonderful - the ice pool certainly wake the body up!!PoolThe pool is wonderful and where we spent most of our days. After the bad storm the next morning naturally the water look awful - we thought there was no way we would get in there that day but the cleaners who are out every day worked extra hard and by 11am the pool was more or less back to new and when I get my pics posted you'll understand that is a miracle since it had gone green in some areas!Good - ok pool service for drinks but to be honest wasn't far to walk to a bar anyway to help myself. Beach We walked to the left and right when it was more overcast and it was lovely, felt safe and great for taking pictures.We did some snorkelling as well stay near to the reef and you will see more fish - enjoyed it.Beach service was excellent. We are more pool people though.CasinoReally good laugh but didn't win any cash. They have got rid of the bar in here which is a shame so get a drink from the theatre bar first and take it in with you. Waitress will come around as you are playing thoughDiscoGood laugh again. Some amazing dancers there as well and a full blown dance off between guests and staff took place which was brilliant to watch!EntertainmentBoth day and night this was great. The guys work about 15 hour days and still have a smile on their faces.They get you involved if you want to be and will just say hello and ask how you are doing if they know your are just happy to watch.The shows at night were good and people liked getting involved with them. Other guestsWe met some really great other people at the hotel from the UK, Canada and US, I do have a couple of comments to make though and these aren't specific to any nationality:Please use queues when they are started already, don't push in or pretend you haven't seen them - this is just rudeThe sand not being white enough is not a valid complaint in my eyes - to me the beach is wonderful, ok so it might be whiter in the South but that is the Caribbean Sea there!Please don't treat staff as if they are your slaves, from maids, bar staff and concierge - they will try and do their best to help you but they are not your servants.Please don't complain to concierge about the weather - it is not their fault - they really wish that it was sunny and warm for you all the time but they are not gods!Some of the complaints I heard were really petty and made me think that no matter where people go they would find something to complain about.Please dont take other people belonging from the sunbeds by the pool. Only happened once to us but was really disappointed - our last full day we had 4 beds for 4 of us by the pool, great spot in front of building 6. We were by the pool from 8am - 1pm then went for lunch and some shade over the hottest time until about 3.30pm. When we came back 2 sun beds had been moved, 2 towels had been taken and the sunbeds were not even being used! I couldn't believe this, all the guests know that you need to have your towel cards when you check out or you get charged and to get your towel cards back you need towels. Luckily we explained to the towel hut and they gave us the cards anyway but was really dissapointed in the other guest who had done this.Most people I talked to really like the hotel, some people I know did say they had an upset stomach but none of them I spoke to blamed the food - more to do with too much to drink, too much food, too much sun and not enough bottled water! Our group did suffer from this as well - I felt the after effects the day I got home!!Would I come back again - in a flash. We are thinking about starting a family though so it will be quite some time before we get away again if we do but I know for sure that I will be back some day and I look forward to seeing the renovations when they are completed.Again apologies for the length of the review and I have probably still missed loads out!Please feel free to ask me questions.ThanksEmily

<Content>Absolutely Wonderful To start off, my boyfriend and I booked our stay at Dreams 6 months in advance of our actual trip. Since the day we booked, I had read every single review posted on this website up until the day we left for Punta Cana. After everything i've read, I can finally give my opinion. Ride from the airport: Not nearly as bad as most people make it sound. I would say it is about 45 minutes long depending on the driver, and the type of car you are in. Yes, they do drive a little crazy, but you have to realize that they are used to it, and although it is a little scary at some points, I really do think they know what they are doing. I honestly never once felt unsafe.Check in: This was the ONLY part of our stay that was a little annoying, but quickly resolved. When you pull up to the resort, the baggage handlers greet you and immediately take your bags to bring them to your assigned room, which is a big help. My boyfriend is Spanish and was fortunately able to talk very easily to all of the staff. We were actually inquiring about upgrading our room, but surprisingly they did not seem that interested in helping us with that, so we decided to just request a regular, but renovated room, and just to go check it out. We walked to our room in building 5 only to find that it was a room with 2 double beds rather than a king size. Since the walk is kind of long, we decided to call the front desk from the room to try to get the situation resolved. The first person we talked to told us they had no other rooms available, and we would have to wait til the next day to change rooms. I knew very well they were lieing, so my boyfriend asked for a supervisor only to be transferred from person to person for a good 15 minutes with noone ever getting on the phone. We finally decided to just go back to the lobby. I was not about to give in, and magically as soon as we got to the front desk, and they say the angry look on our faces they suddenly found a beautiful king bed room. Unfortunately, this is most likely going to happen to you as well. I saw several other people going through similar problems with the front desk. Just be stern and do not give in. You can and will get what you want. I do not know why the front desk is like that, but I assure you that every other staff member in the resort is 100% absolutely wonderful.Rooms: We stayed in building 5, Room 5114. The room was absolutely perfect. The bathroom was actually pretty big, we had 2 large closets, 2 sofas, and a beautiful balcony with a table, chairs, and a hammock. The air condition and fan worked very well. We never had a problem with bugs, or hot water, or anything anybody else has complained about. It was extremely clean as the maids come twice a day to clean and tidy everything up. We would leave the maid a few dollars every morning, and she would always put fresh flowers and towel are on out bed and in the bathroom. Remember that a few dollars here and there goes a long way. They really do appreciate it. As far as upgrading, we are EXTREMELY happy that we did not spend the extra money for that. It was just completely unneccessary. Realisitically, there is so much to do, you are only in your room to sleep and shower. It is the perfect size, what do you need anything else for?Food: We ate at the world cafe for breakfast every morning. I cannot think of one complaint about it. They have everything you could think of for breakfast. An omelette bar where they make your omelletes and eggs any way you like them. A smoothie bar where the lady would save a fresh mango for us every morning. Just remember do not be shy to ask for anything. The staff is so nice and helpful, they will truly go above and beyond, and be more than happy to get you anything that you want. There was never a time that one of them did not have a smile on their face. Do the same in return. The Italian restaurant was not very good, but why would you go to the Dominican Republic to eat Italian, really? The Japanese Hibachi was delicious. We never tried the Mexican restaurant, but heard great things about it, and the decor in there was really pretty. The barbecue on the beach was where we ate for lunch every day. The hamburgers, hot dogs,and nachos were great, and they will even make some chicken and pork just for you if you ask in advance. Oceana was awesome for dinner. The view is beautiful and again they are som accomodating. i do not eat seafood so they would make a filet for me every night we went. They also have different kind of coffees they make for dessert that a guy comes around with a cart and makes them right in front of you lighting the alcohol on fire. Very cool. And, finally Bordeaux was amazing. It really was like eating at a 5 star restaurant combined with the great service and really good food. They know how to cook those filets PERFECTLY. To put it this way, my boyfriend and I are from New Orleans, so we are used to great food, and the restaurants at Dreams absolutely did not let us down.Bars: As far as the bars go, there are so many of them you really cannot be in any part of the resort where there is not one close by. Their signature drinks are delicious, although they can be a little weak. They do have top shelp alcohol available, but unless you ask for it, they just use their Dominican brand alcohol, which we found was not as strong. But, no worries, all you need to do is ask and they will literally place a bottle of Barcadi or Absolut right in front of you to add as much as you want to your drinks. The bartender at the pool bar even mixed my boyfriend is own bottle of Mama Juana to take on one of our excursions. We did bring a little over $100 in dollar bills, and happily used every last bit of it on tips. The staff works so hard and is so nice and obliging, they absolutely deserve the recognition and appreciation. Remember, outside of the resorts, the DR is really somewhat of a 3rd world country, and a dollar goes a long way for them. Every single one of them works 12 days straight, and then gets 3 days off, but spend alot of time traveling home each time. Entertainment: The entertainment team is soo great. They do their best to make their rounds to each qnd every guest, remember your names, and try to involve you in everything. But at the same time, they are not pushy at all if you do not feel like participating in the activities. Mickey Mouse, 50 Cent, Usher, Michael Jackson, and Stephanie are the main entertainers that host all of the games and activities, and are really fun people. The shows in the theatres every night are really good as well. Those people are awesome awesome dancers and can really put on a show. I looked forward to dinner and the show after every single night. As far as any language barrier that many people talk about in these reviews goes, I did not find that to be a problem at all. Like I said, my boyfriend speaks Spanish, so the staff would initially speak Spanish to us, but would quickly ask him if I also spoke it, and when he would say no, they would immediately switch to English and I had absolutely no problem talking to them.I know this was a long review, but I really felt like after reading hundreds of these waiting for my trip to come, people can say some pretty negative, but inaccurate things. Remember everyone, you are on vacation. Have a good attitude going into it and you will be nothing but pleased. Be nice, be happy. You are in a beautiful resort in a beautiful place. The pictures of Dreams on this website and theirs do not even do this resort justice. It is beautiful and immaculate, and I promise you that you will have a great time.

<Content>Pure Paradise I have just returned from an unforgetable honeymoon at Dreams Punta Cana, what can I say about this luxury hotel. The food was excellent, rooms clean and the most amazing pool and beach. Everyone was so friendly in this hotel and nothing was to much trouble for them. If you love fantastic entertainment then this hotel has it all, from casino to live theatre shows every night. I would really recommend going to Saona Island where you can swim in the carribean sea and then go back on a Speed Boat. We will definately return to this hotel, infact we loved it so much we are even going to bring the family. My only complaint about Dominican Republic is the roads, but apart from that top hotel, and the gardnes out of this world.

<Content>Great Place!!!!!!!!!!!!! We stayed at Dreams from late April to early May. From the easy check in to the easy check out and everything in between this place is a GREAT place to stay. We read a few negative reviews about Dreams before we went, but kept an open mind...sometimes you have to take these reviews with a grain of salt. We've stayed in Dreams, Cancun before so we knew basically what to expect from them, but you just never know from one place to another if you'll find the same great treatment. I'm so glad we went. The check in was smooth (after being met with champagne in the lobby) and without hassle. We found our room easily and from that moment on, we just had a great time. We didn't do any excursions or day trips as this was supposed to just be a completely relaxing vacation. Well, relax we did. The grounds are absolutely beautiful and well maintained. There's a little pond by the middle of the pool that has flamingos, koi and ducks that live in it. How great is that, right by the pool? There are 2 macaw parrots that live in a tree right outside the lobby. While relaxing by the pool, we met some really great people who we are still in contact with back home and already all planning another vacation together. We ate at the Japanese hibachi grill, and while it was a bit strange to see a Dominican chef cooking hibachi style, the food and atmosphere were great. The Italian restaurant was also great. The ambiance may not be the best because it鈥檚 located in the same 鈥済reat room鈥?as the buffet, but the food was excellent. They also have a really nice wine list to choose from. While the wine from the list is not included, the prices were reasonable and the wine was excellent. Almost everything is chargeable to your room, so even for the 鈥渆xtras鈥?there鈥檚 really no reason to carry cash for the most part. For families, there is an explorers club for the kids. We looked at it (we have a 9 year old son who was not with us for this trip) and it looked clean and well run. They had a varied schedule daily for the kids that took into account little ones to teens. Seemed like it could be a lot of fun. We鈥檙e looking into bringing our son next time we go. For the all inclusive drinkers, the beer never stopped flowing. Presidente, the Dominican beer is light and crisp and very good. They have a pretty good stock of harder liquor from very cheap to the more upscale brands. You won鈥檛 be disappointed. The 鈥渄rinks of the day鈥?were excellent as well. I absolutely recommend the Banana Mama!! Delicious!! My girlfriend is a little picky with food and while the food is not 鈥済ourmet鈥? it was delicious and she didn鈥檛 get bored with any of it and always found selections that she said she more than enjoyed. The rooms were Caribbean resort clean. Let鈥檚 face it, you鈥檙e not at your house, you鈥檙e at the beach. Don鈥檛 be picky鈥?.That having been said, the rooms were clean, changed and made up daily with fresh towels, mini-bar was restocked and normally a towel sculpture laid on the bed. It was charming. The pool was amazing. It went the length of the resort. The beach was, for the most part, clean but beware of the rocks. You can鈥檛 see them under the water and a few people got some pretty nasty cuts by hitting them. We were told to go the left hand side of the beach if we wanted to go into the water since there are fewer rocks there, but it we never got to try it out. All in all, you really can鈥檛 go wrong with Dreams, Excellence or Secrets. They鈥檙e all inter-related and we鈥檝e been to all 3 varieties. We鈥檙e staying at another Dreams in Puerto Vallarta in November. Already booked. Honestly, this place is GREAT for couples or families. We had a great time and as I said, already looking into going back with our son. What a wonderful vacation.

<Content>Facts not Opinions We are average travelers that like nice things. We have been to Aruba and Mexico. I will try to give facts not opinions.We are from Pittsburgh, the roads to the hotel from the airport are not much worse than some of the pothole roads we have here. The drive was about 1 hour, very nice the drive stopped and got my husband a beer. Presidente....great beer.Upon check in we were asked to upgrade to a suite for $100/night. I got this number down to $50/night but we decided against it. We were placed in building 5, third floor. For us, the perfect location because we were very close to the main building with the casino, entertainment shows  several restaurants.The room was okay. Not the best, not the worst. I would compare to an older Holiday Inn room. I found a maid the day we got there and asked her to change our bed sheets because there were hairs on them. She did so happily, although the new cover had hairs on them as well. Other than that, the room was clean, no bugs. I could hear the conversations of my neighbors. When showering the water changes from hot/warm/cold randomly. We had absolutely NO view from our balcony, it was just leafy green trees. I did not even open the door b/c I didn't want bugs to come in off the trees.I must start off by saying I'm a very picky eater and I rarely eat meat. I had a terrible time with food here. Infact, I lost 5lbs on the trip. Food in Aruba and Mexico were 10 stars compared to this place. The buffet gets REALLY old b/c its the same thing every morning. The do not have real bagels....they are more like bread. OJ was great, I refused to try the milk. The best restaurant in our experience was Bourdex.My husband got very sick the second day with diahrea and stomach pains. His problem lasted the whole 7 days. I have never have stomach problems on a trip however 4 days into the trip I succumb to the stomach problems also. We did not drink any water or use it to brush our teeth so I'm not sure what it comes from. Maybe the ice??? The pool was great. Some ignorant people try to take the floats out. However, by the end of the trip we just went up and took them back into the pool.The entertainment team made the trip for us. They would be the ONLY reason we would consider going back to this resort. Usher, Estephani, Michael  50 Cent were wonderful. They kept us busy at the pool with games all day and we won 4 bottles of rum for participating. If you do not participate you are really missing out!! These people all deserve a raise because they make the resort!The rest of the staff were all friendly, the conceirge left a little to be desired. We had trouble with our tranfer and they were less than helpful.Overall, I would only go back if the food was drastically improved. The food is the main thing holding us back from returning. We would love to see our entertainment buddies again!!!

<Content>There isn't a rating high enough for this resort and it's staff in my book! Travelled on my own with two boys 5 and 8yrs. Having followed reviews on this resort from autumn last year, I'm very pleased to add my own at last. Roads are ropey, but I've experienced same around the caribbean and as for safety the drivers travel back and forth and know the roads well so sit back and chill out. The resort is stunning, beautifully landscaped, lush and constantly tendered. Greeted with champagne on arrival and warmly welcomed with a smile by Concierge and the luggage arrived in good time to the room. Without exception, the staff were all friendly and warm, OK some spoke more English than others, but it didn't hold us back as we easily shared a few words and made ourselves understood. We threw ourselves into the spirit of it all and even learned some Spanish. The resort was busy, especially in the 2nd week, but we never had any trouble finding loungers and a shady spot. The evening stall vendors added colour and variety, they were friendly but certainly NOT aggressive in anyway - they don't just wander in, they pay for the priviledge of being there, so are not likely to overstep the mark and be thrown out. The shows were well structured, well choreographed, fun and some intereactive, in fact can't fault the entertainment and activities at all, plenty of choice daily. Dancers spectacular. As for the food, down to taste, but tried all restaurants, all buffets and room service (which was ample by the way - recommend the burgers). Overall good menu choices, especially the buffets, food was well presented, with attentive service. As for the tummy upsets, yes we did suffer in the 2nd week (in fact all week) but not to the point of requesting a doctor and we never felt sick, just tummy cramp and diahorrea after each meal but it was manageable even with two small boys who barely complained. It didn't put us off the food. Yes we were careful and followed all the rules for water and cooked food, etc, but before blaming the hotel there was also a chance the bug came from food served on any of the trips we took. Just pack some paracetamol and Calpol for the kids. I did tip but ad hoc and definitely did not see any difference in the excellent service we received all around the resort. As for the beach we loved the deep soft WHITE sand and palms, yes there was a smidgen of seaweed and areas to avoid in the sea, but if you really want to enjoy the beach and sea this won't put you off. We loved spotting occasional fish and splashing in the waves. The wet sand is great for making sandcastles. We experienced a twin double room and a honeymoon suite and both were great. This isn't a sterile environment, this is the tropics so expect a bug or two but most are tiny. As for mozzies, we weren't bitten all 2 weeks, but we did use repellent on the skin and in the room. Didn't see many people with bites actually, just sun burn. Kids Club amazing and we loved the mini-disco, you really can relax and know they are well looked after. I cheated at first and watched from a distance just to be sure, but very quickly realised these are professionals and cleared off to the spa! My 5yr old had a manicure (without the polish) and 8yr old the mud massage - they loved it and were treated no differently than if they had been adults. Fireworks were fun at the manager's cocktail party.The tours, well Soana Island is too long a day for young kids, tour swimming with sharks and stingrays was fab (and don't worry my two boys can't even swim) but we had an amazing crew member who looked after them with a lifering in the water and they had bouyancy jackets, snorkels and flippers. And would recommend the coffee/cocoa plantation visit which was educational and interesting, we especially enjoyed the boogey boarding at the end. Special thanks to dear James, Vanessa and Yann, Aris and in fact pretty much everyone. Nothing was too much trouble and considering the general standard of living in this part of the country (which you see as you travel around), I was humbled by their incredible work ethic and excellent levels of service. We went on this holiday to experience everything, the culture, the language, the food, the environment, the ups and downs as well as to relax and unwind and have fun. It is the combination of all these parts that gives us the special memories we will treasure. As for the hotel critics and standards assessors, I say forget your ratings, create a new one and start a trend ... Dreams rated top class for adventurous, open-minded travellers who want to experience a little of another culture, whilst wallowing in luxury, peaceful surroundings, fab food and service. Thanks Dreams Family and hope to see you all next year!

<Content>Wonderful Experience! We just got back from Dreams on 6/10/2008. I thought the resort was beautiful and the people are really nice. We were married on 6/7/08 and the wedding was incredible. The wedding planner Julia was very detailed and made everything run smoothly. The food was better than I expected. There were approx. 20 people in our party and no one got food posining. The ride to the resort is a little bumpy but, I did not mind it. The entertainment staff works really hard to make sure everyone has a good time. I will definately go back!

<Content>Okay trip, definately not a "Dream", though... This was our first trip to DR, although we have been to Cancun and Playa del Carmen numerous times, with a range of trips from luxury to just average. We were prepared for some of the problems that may come up from reading previous reviews. The trip from the airport to Dreams was a little rough, but took it as an adventure and arrived safely. Upon arrival there was no greeting, no champagne, no cool cloths as promised. Had to ask for the champagne, and waited about 10 minutes for it. Our check-in went quickly, although they immediately mentioned we might want to upgrade to the honeymoon suite the next day, so our 12 yr old could have her own room. We booked the standard room, but selected double beds for that reason. I also emailed requests for certain buildings. When we got to our room it was one King bed. It became clear why they were pushing the upgrade. They should have said so my child could actually have a BED! My husband went straight to the desk rather than call the concierge. After a while he came back pretty steamed because they claimed there were no rooms with double beds and he had to pay $275 for an ocean view just to get the beds. Hard to believe since as the week went on, the resort did not seem to be at anywhere near full capacity. Decided to make the best of it, since they promised to send up a bottle of wine on the house, and a better bottle. They did, but tried to charge us for it. The view was nice. Room was clean, AC was a little weak, but tolerable, and I decided it wasn't worth the complaint since I didn't think I would get anything better. Our Apple rep also told my husband the next day that he would take care of it, and by 2:00 p.m he would leave us a message since he was pretty sure we would get moved. My husband spent that day going back and forth from the beach to the room to check for messages. Never heard from our Apple rep again regarding this. Since we didn't want to spend the rest of our vacations haggling about it, we gave up. The middle of buildings 1 and 2 flooded near the stairwells after every rain, even a drizzle. I know that several rooms at that area you would not be able to even step out of the room without being in several inches of water. Food was mediocre at best. Went to World Cafe first night, very bland, overcooked food. Salads were good, but alot of the food in the warmers just didn't look appetizing. Oceana next was great all around, very good service, great food. But went back a few nights later and none of us got what we ordered. I ordered the chicken and shrimp combo, didn't get the shrimp and the chicken didn't match what the menu described and was very dry and tough. Sea side grill was hit and miss, my husbands steak was good, my shrimp kabobs (2) had 4 shrimp total on it. Daughters ribs were so tough you could barely separate the ribs, since they didn't remove the membrane on the back side before cooking them. This was after trying to be served two other table's meals by mistake, and being treated to the show of a waiter at the next table knocking over a stein of beer while serving food, all over the father of that family. Which he had ordered lobster and paid extra for, which was now ruined. Bordeaux was great, but so dark you could barely see the person in front of you. Mexican restaurant was terrible. Drink service was terrible, either they had no alcohol or were so strong you could barely drink them. And I like them strong. Got several different versions of a Mai Tai which was supposed to be the drink of the day. My daughter ordered room service the night we went to Bordeaux and was sick the next morning. Beach was as expected from reading other reviews, although it could have been kept cleaner. Been to several other resorts that mechanically swept the beach. Full of cigarette butts, and still had dirty glasses from the previous day in the mornings. Vendors are a very pushy, our Apple rep said to haggle with them, and we did for a necklace for our daughter. The next table we approached and started to haggle, a vendor from the other table ran up and said something in Spanish and our vendor stopped trying to get our sale. Just as well, since it was all pretty much junk anyway.The day before our checkout my husband went to the desk to check for charges on the bill. Everything was fine and they had taken care of that bottle of wine they sent to the room. We had $100 room credit as a part of our package, and had used part of it for an upgraded bottle of wine with our Bordeaux meal. That was correctly shown on our bill. We used the remaining portion for wine the last night at Oceana. Upon checkout they tried to charge us for both bottles and I had to provide documentation showing the room credit., then had to sign an adjustment form to correct their mistake. Since we had a 12:50 departure time from the resort we asked if we could possibly get a meal early, since the restaurants didn't open till 12:30. (Usually 12:40, they are way behind.) Concierge assured us they would open at 12, which we knew to be untrue since they didn't any other day. Never been to an all-inclusive that didn't have a steady supply of food somewhere at the resort. Be aware if you sleep late and want an early lunch you will be diappointed, or if you have a half day excursion you cannot get a meal before you leave. Had to choke down a meal and rush for the bus. Made the best of the beach and the grounds were nicely kept, but did not come close to being a 6 Golden Apple resort. Didn't experience any bend-over backward service, and we don't ask for much. I wonder now if you have to be in the Preferred Club to get the service they claim you will have. Wouldn't be worth the extra money to get what you should in the first place.

<Content>Excellent experience We went for a wedding and had a fantasic time. Would definetly go back again and stay for a week not just a week-end. When you go make sure not to miss having a Wilson Special at the swimup bar. This drink is excellent, as well as the bar tender it is named for!! Another thing not to miss is the Japanese resturant what a great experience, only make sure to get there early. There is limited seating and, no reservations it is first come first served.The bbq on the beach for lunch was very good and very convenient. I would definetly recommend this resort for anyone thinking about a Carribean vacation.

<Content>Terrible First our room was not ready for 3 hours upon arrival, the the bell boy lost our luggage, 2 hrs later we finally got our bags. I ve been to secrets excellence in punta cana and loved it, i went to Dreams and regreted it! After a few days my boyfriend and I had to go to the hotel dr. because we both got food poisioning. The concierge did not care and said make the best of your few days left here. When we got home and wrote them an email, they responded this is not our responsibility to make everyone happy! TOO TOP IT WE HAD ROACHES in our room! The hotel sent out a notice that I still have stating between 9am and 12pm we will be exterminating the rooms. We killed 4 Roaches in our room!!

It鈥檚 not USA, neither fine dinning restaurant. You can always find something in buffet.Rooms: Clean and we have never had problems with itPool: BeautifulBeach: Clean and no problems with chairs. I would recommend bringing your own towels.I still can not believe that people found so much to complain about.Stay in 4 Seasons or Hyatt next time and get ripped off.I would definitely go back.

<Content>Not what you Expect from a Resort with 6 Golden Apples This was our first time to the Dominican Republic and Punta Cana. My husband and I were looking for a Caribbean vacation since we traveled to Aruba and loved it, but wanted to try something different. Big Mistake. When we arrived at the airport in Punta Cana, it was very organized and ran smoothly. Dreams Resort is about an hour and a half drive away from the airport. We took the Apple Bus from the airport to the resort and this was the scariest ride of our lives. The bus driver drove crazy, swerving to miss potholes, people on bikes, other drivers and livestock. I would not even consider the path we took a road. It looked like Swiss cheese, not even paved. I have ridden on better roads while riding in a quad. To make matters worse, this road was the size of a one lane road in the U.S. and the people driving on this road, including our bus driver, kept passing the vehicles in front of them, turning this small road into a four lane road. It was a very scary ride and we felt very unsafe. When we arrived at the resort, the resort is very beautiful, however, they told us our room would be ready in an hour but we waited for 3 hours. Communication at this resort is very difficult, only a few people speak English enough to carry on a simple conversation. We had a room with a King Size bed and a swim up pool. The room was very old, not updated. Not worth the money at all. The swim up pool was not a swim up pool. Do not spend extra money on this. You still have to walk out of your room, around the bushes to be able to jump in the pool. The food at the resort was okay; the resort had the same breakfast buffet everyday, which got old after 5 days. Restaurants were okay; food portions were very small, nothing great at all. The only restaurants that we found to be good were the Japanese restaurant and the Mexican restaurant. I wouldn't waste your time on anything else. Drinks were good, however the bar service was horrible. On quite a few occasions, we had to wait at least 5 minutes before we even got served when the bars were not busy at all. The Entertainment Staff were great, and spoke the best English. The pool was great; however, do not go to this hotel if you are expecting a Caribbean beach. The sand is not white here and the color of the ocean is not blue. You are unable to swim directly in front of the resort due to boulders in the ocean, rock and seaweed. The beach is very disappointing. During our stay, there was a violent thunderstorm. While we were in the lobby, strong (hurricane like winds) swept through the lobby causing the ceiling to fall in on us and others around us. Thankfully no one, including ourselves were hurt, however, the Dreams staff and Apple Vacations Representatives did not check on us, see if we were okay, etc. The staff just cleaned up the debris and acted like nothing happened, when us and other guests were hysterical after experiencing such a horrific event. Needless to say, we would not return to this resort. Not sure how they got 6 golden apples.

<Content>Be careful! We recently visited Dreams for our honeymoon based on the fact that most sites rated it a luxury resort, one of the best in Punta Cana. Absolutely not true!! When you walk in the open air lobby is fabulous, the staff is also quick to greet you. But the luxury stops there, the pushy, aggressive front desk staff thrive on the fact that your excited and on your honeymoon. They sucker you into upgrading to a honeymoon suite, which we did. Our first room was musty and smelled foul. Our second room was slightly better, but not worth the extra money they make you pay (we also found out that other couples that upgraded paid much less for the SAME gross room.) The AC sux, they have sensors so it shuts off when your not in you room, so you room is always so hot. They also try to hype up the room service and concierge in the honeymoon bldg. Room service sux, they have literally four items on th menu and it's bite size when you get it. I called for coffee one night and they didn't have any. The concierge in bldg 6 had selective english skills. He had a full conversation with us the night before, and the next day did not understand us when we were requesting Bud Light. Yup..they do have Bud Light in the lobby bar and in Bldg. 6 and 7. They keep it a secret, so you drink that nasty Presidente. However after ordering four in two hours, they shut us off, We're all out! Ridiculous!!! And if you don't ask for rum in your frozen drinks they DON'T put it in. So when they try to get you to upgrade and they will, DO NOT DO IT!!The grounds are well kept and nice, but every other night they have vendors set up along the walkway (there is no way around them). So as you try to enjoy a nice peaceful walk around, you are bombarded by extremely aggressive salesman, I found them to be borderline assaultive, especially when my husband was not around. So be careful and don't get suckered in to buying their junk. The pool is large and they do offer floats, but we saw several guests hiding them in their rooms for the next day. And if you want a good chair in the sun you need to be out there early. We thought the middle of May would not be so crowded, but there was tons of travelers and way TOO many kids. As far as the beach goes, it was ok, but I've been to better.The food was nasty. The French and Mexican restaraunts were disgusting. The only place we actually could eat at and not get sick was the Japanese/Chinese restaraunt. We didn't touch the water but still got violently sick, thank god for pepto -bismol!!

<Content>Overall not a good dream First I would like to give you some background about myself. I travel extensively due to my occupation. I have also stayed at Secrets Excellence Riviera Maya and have been on several cruise lines (Disney, Celebrity, Carnival). In short, I consider that we are experienced travelers. When we stayed at Secrets Excellence Riviera Maya, we were extremely pleased with the resort and the level of service. It was rated 鈥? Golden Apples鈥?and we actually ended up staying at the resort because we booked a 6 Golden Apple Square Deal package. When we decided to book a trip to Punta Cana, we looked for another 6 Golden Apple property and chose Dreams largely because we expected it to be comparable to the 6 Golden Apple resort we chose for our prior vacation. Unfortunately, the issues we experienced with Dreams make it clear that Dream Punta Cana is not comparable to Secrets Excellence Riviera Maya in many respects and certainly does not deserve a 鈥? Golden Apple鈥?rating. When we arrived at Dreams, we were told that we had reserved a Deluxe Room. We were offered an upgrade to a Junior Suite at a cost of $400. We were told that the upgraded room was in the 鈥渞enovated section鈥?of the resort and was closer to the beach. (I recall that our original Deluxe Room was going to be in building 1). We chose the upgrade, mainly based on the recommendations in several online travel reviews we read prior to leaving. Though the room was generally attractive, large and we liked the hot tub on the balcony, there were some 鈥渞ough spots鈥?in the room. A vent was hanging partly loose from the ceiling in the bathroom. There were gaps between the boards in the ceiling in the bathroom area. There were also unpainted areas on the crown molding in the same area. All of these items may seem trivial but I would expect to see better attention to detail in a 鈥渟uite鈥? especially one which was recently renovated. Aside from the finish of the room, the mattress was rock-hard. We considered complaining about the mattress but spoke with two other guests who said that their beds were hard as well.We had problems with towel service during our stay. After the second day, we were not given wash cloths when our other towels were replenished. I had to call the local Apple representative in order to get them. On the 17th, we spoke with the maid who was attending to an adjacent room (and had just cleaned ours). She told us that she only had two wash cloths left and seemed reluctant to part with them. In addition to the room towels, the pool/beach towels tended to run out early in the day. On the first day we were told that once the towels run out, there are no more available until the next day. The quality of the food was generally mediocre at best. We found the best quality food at the Bordeaux Restaurant and the Sea Side Grille. We experienced the poorest quality food at Himitsu (Sweet and Sour pork which was so tough it was inedible). We ate most of our meals at the World Caf茅 Buffet. Again here the quality of the food was mediocre. The quality of the food was considerably better at Secrets Excellence Riviera Maya. The quality of the food at the specialty restaurants at Excellence was among the best I have had in all of my travels. Restaurant wait staff service was poor. The vast majority of the waiters understood very little English. We often resorted to pointing to items on the menu and still did not always get what we ordered. We experienced long waits for drink refills and between courses. It appears that the resort鈥檚 system only allows the waiters to refill water and wine. The other drinks and refills come from the bar and are handled by other wait staff. It seems that the signals get mixed between the table waiters and the bar service waiters.The quality of drinks was inconsistent between bars. I ordered the same drink often during my stay (a Tom Collins) and received several very different versions, some of which bore no resemblance to a Tom Collins. Your web page indicates that 鈥減remium brand liquors鈥?are poured but often our drinks appeared to come mostly from mixes already concocted in plastic gallon jugs. If we asked for a specific brand of rum, for example, we often got a blank look from the bartender. We were also surprised that there only appeared to be a couple of bar waitresses working the pool area. At Secrets Excellence and on cruises, the waitresses are at your chair frequently to take drink orders. Dreams only had them coming around about once an hour. Tipping did not increase the frequency of the visits so I can only assume that there just weren鈥檛 enough of them working in the area.The web page describes the beach as 鈥減ristine.鈥?Though the water is beautiful and there were ample places to sit, the sand needs to be cleaned. The resort staff picks up trash from the chairs and tables but there are cigarette/cigar butts and I even found a piece of a glass beer bottle in the sand. The sand should be either manually or mechanically swept in order to make it fit the billing of 鈥減ristine.鈥?/p>

<Content>Preferred Hotel????? Not Positive- Staff, Staff StaffARRIVALThe arrival and airport were fine, a typical island, somewhat organized arrival.The drive to Dreams was scary. We had to serve around potholes and cars. Our driver was alittle daredevil.FIrst Impression- Beautiful, open airyCheck In / Front Desk - Fast, easy and for an added touch a nice welcoming drink.Room- I reserved a oceanview king room. Our first room was terrible, 2 queen beds, rusted bed legs, shower floor mildew. Just plain dirty.Our 2nd room , room 1212 was in the first building second floor. Oceanview it was, clean it was not. The sofa was so dirty I wouldn't alllow my husband to touch it . There are sugar ants all over. This could be controlled by feeding them outside and they will move from inside to outside. The bathroom was clean however the toilet bowl seat was too small for the bowl and not on tight so it would move every time you sat down. The towels were horrible, warn, stained and not something I would ever put put for a guest. The mattress was hard, it was moe like a boxspring then a mattress. The air conditioner didn't work properly until 3am thats when you really felt it. I had the maid change all sheets and blankets, they were all stained and disgusting upon arrival. Remember to use the bottled water provided to brush your teeth, DO NOT put any water in your mouth you will get ill. The hotel does not have a water purfication system, this is listed in tiny letters in the booklet in your room. You will know your neighbors well since you will hear everything that goes on in the room next door. Our building number 1 is 750 strides or approx a half mile from the main building. You will be right in front of the beach and pool area but far from the main building. FOOD- I don't know how anyone can say the food was good. We rode back to the airpoirt with 6 people and every one of us felt the same way ,the food was terrible. The NY strip you order from the steak house is paper thin and you get fries, the veggie sandwich is onions, the japense steakhouse uses weird meat as well as the chicken tasting strange. If you're drinking this shouldn't matter. The World Cafe for breakfest and dinner was fine. The hamburgers on the beach are not made out of cow its something else maybe YAK. I've ever tasted something so fowl. Again if you're drinking it'll be just fine. My main meal was breakfest after that I ate food I brought from home. I will not go back here because of the food and smoking.SMOKING- If you are a non smoker beware there is smoking everywhere. I stopped 11/2 years ago and I choked the whole time I was there. They smoke in restuarants , at the shows, pool, beach, etc there is nowhere to escape it. Its even in your room. You can't sit on your balcony because the guy next to you is smoking so much that the air is full of smoke. I have no problem if there is designated areas for both but theres not and its really hard to handle.ENTERTAINMENT- There are some amazing dancers working here as well as staff that are so friendly they will help you in any way possible. The pool area dancers and workout guys were great. Their energy level is so high. Some of them go directly to the evening shows where they again entertain you by dancing and putting on a show. The shows itself can be cheesy but the people work very hard to do a great job.CASINO- 6 table games, 20 slots. I played one slot the whole 5 days and didn't win a thing. Very smoky.SHOPPING- 3 stores in the hotel. I love to shop hated these stores. I didn't buy 1 thing the whole time. Local shopping is far away. They say theres a shopping area 10 minute walk but my understanding was that it ws 1 shop. TIPPING- Althought tips are included I still felt I should tip. I tipped the maid $5 a day, I tipped the young guy who knew I drank tea every morning $3 a day, I also tipped a waitress who worked the dinner shift as well as the breakfest shift. If I drank I would've tipped the bar tender I used regularly something each day. POOL/BEACH- You are given a towel card when you arrive it entitles you to 1 towel per card. So bring your own towel so at least you have one to lay on and one to dry with. The pool is amazing. The negatives are the bar is in the pool and you have fools who poor their drink right into the pool, also children are all over the adult area which is a negative when you mix alcohol with stupid behavior. So thats really a parents issue but they could care less, there too busy drinking and smoking to wonder why there child is crying while the adult games are going on. Well he got hurt. The hotel should also encourage parents to keep there young children in the childrens area. The beach is nice but lots of ants and some flies. The chairs on the beach are uncomfortable. Theres a metal bar that goes across the back and diggs into our back. Theres no jet skiing however there is some water skiing, $30 for 20 min. Departure- The hotel does a great job of getting your luggage down as well as making sure you eat before you go, and having the transportation there on time. Airport departure- GREAT!!!! I wish the US was as quick and efficent as they were.OVERALL- I would'nt return because the hotel isn't as clean as it should be, theres lots of maintence issues with the rooms. Also the smoking is beyond normal for any place in the world I've been. Thats proberly due to the alcohol. I think young adults would like it if they were going for spring break. Thats what it reminded me of a hotel that went through spring break and hasn't recovered from it. This is not a luxury hotel by any means.

<Content>Buyer Beware I will keep it very objective but true: DO NOT expect too much out of this resort, because you will be very disappointed. I do not know how they can get all these apples and stars from travel agencies. This resort is really old and not up to par - rooms are very run down. 3 of the electrical outlets in my room are broken including the one in the bathroom with the cover hanging loose (very dangerous for my 2 year old). The disgusting air conditioning filter and cover fell on me from the ceiling when I opened the closet within the first 5 minutes of entering the room. Everything was falling apart and it is in dire need of upgrades. The food was far from good. All the restaurants are very unorganized. My husband waited over 20 minutes in separate occasions just for a draft beer. His steak at the Seaside Grill was so tough that we could not cut it nor could we eat it. We tip constantly in hopes of getting better service, but still were very disappointed. They advertise how they tailor to children, if so, it's definitely not to my 2 year old. We stayed there for 5 nights, there has not been once that they gave my little girl utensils, napkins or service. Not a single waiter asked what I would like to get for my child. I guess they assumed little child does not eat!!!We dressed up (according to their guidelines) to eat at the Japanese restuarant but found out once we got there that children are not allowed! Nowhere on any of their brochure or materials did it state that children are not allowed in the Japanese restaurant!Don't get sick. I did and I paid dearly for the medical attention. They want cash for everything and charged 10% premium if you pay by credit card.The beach is really not pretty at all, not what you would expect from the Carribeans. The photographers are nice and take good pictures, but once you are there to view them, it's high pressure sales like everything else at the resort. The lobby staff for checking in are very sleeky and sneaky. I, along with many other people whom I talked to within my stay, were soooo over them.If you have a choice, stay with a different resort. Spend your hard-earned money somewhere else.

<Content>FANTASTIC HOTEL - BEST SERVICE EVER We have just returned from the best two weeks holiday we have ever had at Dreams.. The hotel is magnificent and we have never experienced such incredible service before.Rooms We stayed in a honeymoon suite in the preferred club. It was well worth the upgrade - massive rooms, great maid service twice a day, jacuzzi on the balcony, free DVD rental - the list just goes on and on. Vanessa, Ricardo, George and Bertillio were fantastic. PoolAbsolutely massive and very clean - my kids loved the Iceberg to climb up on. As I have two young children, I was able to relax as the pool is the same depth all the way round which they could both stand up in.BeachWe were so lucky, as if you are in the preferred club we had our own private bit of beach which included 4 massive 4 poster beds, towel service and all the suncreams you'd ever need. I would reiterate with everyone else and say that it's best to go to the left - where the turtle trampoline is - there are no rocks thereEntertainmentExcellent again - the team worked so hardy, mickey Mouse, 50 cent etc. My children loved going in for the competitiions however if you just wanted to chill - they were more than happy to just have a quick chat. All I would say is that the shows at night are the same each week so they might wish to do it fortnightly however most nights my children were shattered by 9.30pm so it didn't affect usCoreZoneMy children loved the corezone - playing pool, table football, air hockey, ping-pong etc so they used to go there at midday for a couple of hours as it was all covered - in the midday heatFoodSome restaurants are fantastic (French,grill and Oceana for lunch) but was not impressed with the japanese, World Cafe at night or the mexican. Just a bit bland ExcursionsWe went quad biking which was fantastic (make sure you take a few dollar bills to give to the kids in the village you pass) and Zip lines which was great also Both were only 2-3 hours long which was great for my familyCaricaturistQuick mention that there is a caricaturist in the lobby at night - he was a fantastic artist and we have some great pictures to hang on the wall at homeOverallService, rooms, entertainment and pool were fantastic. Only slight disappointment was the food in some of the restaurants and the AC was not brilliant.

<Content>Great job My wife and I just came back from Punta Cana, we stayed at the Dreams resort since we have experienced these hotels in the past in Mexico (Vallarta and Capri). These hotels are great and Punta Cana was even better. Everything was perfect, food , service, rooms and friendly management . We met the general manager in many occasions and he made our stay even more pleasant. I highly recomend this hotel , the best so far...Thanks to all you guys for a great job..

<Content>Bad Apple Rating! We have just returned from our vacation  we were very disappointed. This was our first time in Punta Cana. We had heard very nice things about the island but I will think twice before I return, especially if I am using Apple as a guide to rating were we stay. It seems that Dreams is very overated in our opinion. The place is beautiful in the lobby  the grounds  very clean for the most part. But the service, the food  the rooms are another thing. But first can I just say that anyone thinking of booking at this place please note that there is a ride from hell to get there. This is something that they don't tell you. You are an hour or so from the airport. We came in at night  I thought that we I would be sick just from the bus ride. Now once we arrived the check in was okay, just glad that it wasn't very busy because they don't move very fast. We were able to get something to eat even though the buffet was about to close...one of the waiters, Miguel, from the Italian restaurant, was very helpful in getting us somenthing to eat, which would turn out to be our most visited spot. This was the only area were the service was okay. In the buffet area which was shared by the Italian restaurant in the corner of the big room, the service was terrible. A few bucks or a complaint at the Apple desk just might get you want you think is included in the price you are paying for a SIX GOLDEN APPLE rating....the rooms are small but nice except for the bathroom....no walk in showers in the regular rooms...just very high tubs to climb in  out of with a make shift shower....No tippy no towels for our room....no tippy no service after you sit for a meal at the buffet. You have fend for yourself...Now the food is not what you think it might be so brace yourself if you are booked at this place. Very poor menu  display of what desserts that they have. If it wasn't that it was too salty then it didn't have any taste at all. All the fruit you could ask for but sometimes not ripe do watch for that. Pool was okay for the most part. Beach really SUCKED!!!! big time. Remember that you are on the Atlantic side of the island so the beach  the water is not paradise!! just full of seaweed  rocks...no other resorts nearby so be careful of walking on the beach out from the resort area.....entertainment needs vast imporvement....disco needs to know that there are other people who would like to dance  listen to the music besides the native people who visit the resort.....the only part that I would rate very good was the young people who entertained you by the pool....the games  activities, these guy just were very good at what they do  to boot they are part of the entertainment at night which might explain as to the lack of it for wokring from 9 to 12 every day....If this was my first place that I have visited I might think it was okay but we have gone to other places  this by no means should be rated a 6 Golden Apple place....at best maybe a 4 red....you live  you learn as they say so I learned that a great rating doesn't alway mean it's what you get for your money so be careful

<Content>Don't Dream too Big! This was our third trip to the Dominican and our second stay at Dreams (formerly Sunscape the Beach) since 2007. We did not plan to stay here a second time, but since the hotel we originally booked was closed due to renovations, Apple bumped us to Dreams (a two apple upgrade) for the trouble. Rather than haggle with them, we decided to go even though we were not thrilled with our experience the previous year. Let me preface this review by saying that my husband and I are not high maintenance, very laid back and also realize that you get what you pay for, so this review will be focused mostly on the realities that we experienced versus the marketing materials that are presented on websites etc. Here is what we experienced:*The staff is friendly and outgoing once you get to know them. But you must make the effort to be friendly first. If you are shy, you may feel ignored or under-served. If you don't know any Spanish, try to learn some basic phrases. It really helps and it's a nice show of respect. We also tip regularly...it does help increase the level of service! *The resort is very large and sometimes the restaurant staff can not always handle the influx. Try and visit at off-times for best selection and service.*The food was good but not excellent. I became sick on day 3 after eating at the Japanese restaurant. Had to visit the Doctor who was WONDERFUL for a shot in the bum and antibiotics...lost 3 days and had to pay $237 in additional medical bills but I was not the only one. I met three other travelers who also suffered the same affliction after eating at the same restaurant. Not sure what you can do to avoid this, but I think the resort should really take a close look at refrigeration issues at Himitsu.*Premium alcohol was readily available as well as domestic beer at some of the bars. The house wine was great and mamajuana a must try! *Rooms were clean but very worn. We stayed in room 2326. Wonderful ocean-view but obviously in dire need of upgrades to reflect pictures on the website. The AC was very poor, but we were on the 3rd floor and didn't complain. Our toilet ran constantly and the fan in the bathroom was also broken. With the size of the resort I can't imagine massive upgrades anytime soon to bring them up to what you would expect from a Dreams resort.*Maid service was wonderful and reliable. The cleaning staff was the most outgoing and friendly.*The beach is rocky and a bit rough compared to Bavaro beach. We stayed on Bavaro once and have been spoiled ever since. Go to the left of the resort beyond the turtle trampoline and you'll be fine!*Plenty of activity by the pool by the lower bar and beach area. Entertainment staff was great! Hola Mickey Mouse! Plenty of chairs and shade by the pool...almost too much shade! Take your own pool floats as there aren't enough for everyone. *Make sure the guys pack long pants and a polo shirt for dinner. Some of the restaurants require them for dinner and they are not kidding! We were fine, but several couples who were not prepared did get turned away. The bottom line...don't think you are going to get the same level of quality and service that you would get at the Hyatt or Hilton. This hotel does not go out of their way for you once you are checked in, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but don't expect to be pampered unless you pay extra for it at the spa or for the romantic dinner on the beach. Six golden apples for this resort does not equal 5 stars for a top notch hotel, it's like comparing apples and oranges....no pun intended:)  In conclusion, my husband and I had a wonderful vacation together and took all of the little bumps in stride. We were just so happy to be away for a full week together! We met wonderful people and made lots of new friends over cocktails and pool volleyball...just wanted to share our experience so that you may gauge your expectations accordingly.

<Content>Six GOLDEN Apple rating????? Correct me if I'm wrong, but according to Apple Vacations the golden status is supposed to be reserved for Exceptional Standard of Service  Quality. We just returned and you have to be kidding me!! The wait staff / servers in ALL of the restaurants we visited were totally disorganized. In general, you get seated and wait for 15 minutes before someone would acknowledge you were there. We had to constantly flag people down for coffee, then cream, then water....you get the picture. And about 99% could speak no English at all, so trying to get what you asked for was next to impossible. Even the items you order on the menus (in the Oceana especially) aren't what you end up getting (try the Grilled Chicken Sandwich if you don't believe me). The fountains / ponds near the lobby were inoperable with stagnant water in all - definitely NOT a six apple rating to me. We've had a MUCH better experience at five golden apple resorts (e.g. Iberostar Punta Cana). If you can overlook the poor restaurant service and stagnant pond water, the rooms, pool, spa and beach were very clean - but not 6 apple worthy. Seems to me the owners (AM Resorts) of this place need to learn a lesson or two about proper / prompt service staff training from the Riu or Iberostar resort chains.

<Content>Great Holiday!! Just got back from a 2 week stay at Dreams with my fiance and two friends. Overall the hotel was lovely, rooms were great, food was great with excellent variety, the grounds were beautiful and well maintained, service in all restaurants and the bars was good. Air conditioning in the room wasn't that great though! Waiters and all staff couldn't have been more friendly and welcoming.The entertainment team were fantastic and made sure that you were involved in all activities, usually we wouldn't get involved but this time we did, and it was good fun. Mickey and 50 in particular were hilarious and always made an effort, they were great fun. Evening entertainment was also good.Overall had a great 2 weeks and would return to this hotel.

<Content>No service with a smile Just got back and what a disappointment. The food selection and quality was, at best, that of an average diner in the States. nothing was ever hot nor cold. The grounds were pretty but tired. The whole place was in need of an update and repair. Our room was decent size but there was no security latch, it had been pulled off the door. We had no phone service in the room. I made 6 trips to the desk to get it repaired and always got a smile, a yes and we'll take care of it, but nothing was done. The day before we left I found out they had never called the phone company to even report the problem. Hallways are dark, they need hand rails in stairways and we even had standing water in our room after it rained.  Look elsewhere!

<Content>The best holiday......ever!! We booked our trip through Portland Direct and were really looking forward to it until a few weeks before when we read some pretty bad reviews - we should never have worried at all.We decided to upgrade to the Honeymoon Suite and it was worth every penny, we did this via email with Irene from the hotel and when we arrived she was waiting in reception for us to personally escort us to our room. The hotel is really beautiful and the staff were helpful from the minute we arrived there. We were staying in block 6, which is where the Preferred Club (PC) lounge is. Our room was wonderful, with a massive 4 poster bed in the bedroom and 2 sofa's that turn into beds in the lounge. We had a TV in both rooms and a DVD player in the lounge, and although we don't go on holiday to watch telly it was a godsend when our 8 year old had had enough sun on a couple of afternoons as we could go up to the room and just chill with him. There is a DVD library in the PC lounge, which although isn't too extensive there were enough films that he wanted to watch. We also had a nice sized bathroom and a dressing room. The aircon was not as cold as we would have liked but this is not a criticism as we also had 2 big ceiling fans that, when switched on kept the rooms a good temperature. The mini bar was fine for us and it is the first hotel I have stayed in the Caribean that had coffee making facilities in the room. The maid service was very good, they came during the day to make the beds and clean the room and then again in the evening to turn back the beds.The staff in the PC were absolutely wonderful, Vanessa, who is the manager there was so friendly and helpful and nothing was ever too much trouble. It was the same for all of the Congierge's. The bar staff Jorge and Bertilio made our holiday, they were polite but very chatty and made such an effort with our son, he was so upset to leave them. Having the PC lounge was a very nice extra, as we used to sit on the patio and have a drink or 2 every evening before dinner and as it is not too busy we actually had a chance to have some lovely conversations with other guests who were also staying there.All of the staff in Dreams were the friendliest, nicest people and always seemed to go that extra bit to make your holiday even more special. Margarita, who worked in the Oceana restaurant at lunchtimes was a wonderful lady who went out of her way to do nice things for us - it was greatly appreciated. We decided to go to Higuey, which is the nearest big town one day and were told we could get a bus from outside the hotel. Whilst we were waiting for a bus a young man in a hotel uniform also came and sat at the bus stop and we started chatting to him. His name was Wilkins and he was a bell boy and had just finished working a night shift. When we told him where we were going he said that he would come shopping with us and show us the best places to go, we asked him how much this would cost and he just looked at us and said Nothing - Higuey is my town and I would love to be able to show you around He was a wonderful guide and was really good company. His English was very good and he seemed to take such pride in the Hotel.The food at the hotel is good, we liked the Steak House and the French restaurant the best. The breakfast's in the World Cafe would suit every taste, but they could do with investing in a bigger and better toaster (this is my only criticism of the whole holiday!) Both myself and my husband had the trots a couple of times but I don't believe that this was down to anything being wrong with the food, just the different oils it is cooked in as we had no pain or sickness and after 2 Imodium tablets we were right as rain.The pool is the best ever and deserves the awards it has won, and the beach is perfect with enough sunbeds and shades, and there was always a member of staff walking round bringing drinks.All in all I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anyone and we have alrady decidd to book again for next year and take the rest of our family with us. Dreams certainly lived up to it's name and after reading some of the bad reviews on this site i can't believe that the stayed in the same hotel!!

<Content>Food will make you sick - 9 days and still suffering We stayed at Dreams from 18 - 23 May. Upon our arrival the room we were given had a strong odor of mildew. As we were discussing the possiblity of requesting a move my husband noticed a large mass of mold in the vent. We did request to be moved. We were moved to a room that was much smaller but it did not have the mold growing in the vents or the strong odor of mildew so we didn't complain about the size.The food was not good and made us sick. We arrvied at Dreams on Sunday evening. On Tuesday night we got sick to our stomachs. There was another couple with us and they also got sick. It has been 9 days and we are still suffering. I finally went to the doctor yesterday and was given antibiotics and placed on a special diet for several days. I was told that I had acquired some form of a bacteria while visiting DREAMS. It seemed that just about everyone we spoke to while we were there was also suffering from stomach ailments. The grounds and the pool are well maintained and quite lovely. We would not return to Dreams, Punta Cana.

<Content>Absolutely the best hotel I have ever stayed in! I stayed at this resort for a week in May, with my boyfriend.I can honestly say that it is the nicest hotel I have ever been to. Everything was perfect; the only fault I could find was that the butter in the restaurants was too hard!!The spa is gorgeous and must be tried-so relaxing!I have been to many Carribean resorts, and I know how bad some hotels can be. I am not the sort of traveller who will settle for anything less than perfect. This was one of the best value holidays I have had. I have stayed at a top branded hotel in Jamaica, and Dreams is definately on par, if not better.Go now-why wait for perfection?!

<Content>Nice pool, shame about the food We stayed from 18th to 25th May and travelled with Thomson holiday.Flight:-We paid the extra for premium seats which we thought was worth it just for the extra leg room and the slightly better food and unlimited drinks and slightly better entertainment. The ability to jump the check-in queue with the premium seats was a definite bonus.Transport to and from airport: - bumpy ride, but I've had worse, you've got to remember that this is a poor area of the world and so is doing pretty well. The driving was a bit scary, but I've seen worse in Italy.Hotel room:-As pictured in the brochure. We paid the extra 拢70 for delux room, not really sure what the difference would have been from a standard room though. Maid service was OK but not consistent. We had the mysterious turn down service once. The air con was fine and the large fan was much appreciated. The minibar is OK - 4 bottles of pop, 2 beers and some water.Beach/Pool:-Both were excellent, didn't go in the water too far so can't comment on it being rocky in the ocean. The pool was fab biggest we've seen. There is drinks service around the pool but it's not consistent. Constently have music playing in the background - around the pool - they don't seem to believe in peace and quiet there.FoodWe tried the grill, mexican and japanese. Myself and my partner ended up with food poisoining the night of the Japanese - although we did have a Mr whippy ice cream from the bar that afternoon too (which I subsequently found out is notorious for breeding listeria bacteria), will never know which one was the cause - it's been a week since it started and I'm still suffering. Tried the nachos from room service which were OK but not startling. Bar staff were great especially at the main lobby.Other things:-We booked the romantic dinner on the beach for two ($50 per person). The menu is all seafood, which coming from someone allergic to fish was an issue, however we were told by the conceirge that there would be no problem with changing the menu to whatever we wanted. So we did. Needless to say when we showed up at the table the waiter knew nothing about it. However he (Modesto) did a very good job of producing a fine dinner seafood/fish free and earned a good tip for his trouble.Overall I don't think we'll go back to Dreams partly because of the food posoining but most of all the lack of care by the staff of the hotel when we told them we had been ill through the food, they didn't seem to care.

<Content>Dreams...more like a nightmare! Just returned from a 10 night stay at Dreams from 5-15 May. Dreams does not live up to its 5 star rating...Had a few problems with our room initally, however, we were moved with little or no hassle. The hotel grounds and pool were lovely and nicely maintained. Weather was lovely. Beach was not too good once you left the main area..it was strewn with debris, which should be cleaned on a regular basis. I know the hotel doesn't own the beach, but their guests do use it.The most disappointing issue was the food... it was dreadful...bring plenty of immodium..we went through 2 packets!! The world cafe (buffet restaurant) was very poor not only in decor but also in food quality and temperature...didnt have one hot meal. I came across dead fly in chicken caesar salad..no orange juice one morning..its on order we were told. The shrimp caesar salad in seafood restaurant contained salad and one prawn!! We tried all the restaurants, same story.I could go on..the food was horrendous!!!! One exception lobster was good..it was grilled so they couldn't get that wrong.The drinks selection was very hit and miss, there seemed to be a constant issue and moan among guests about the shortage and long waiting times, this didn't really affect us as we dont drink much but do like a glass of wine with dinner...house selection was appalling so we purchased wine as required usually around $40 per bottle. it went nice with the $15 per lb lobster (which was only decent meal we had)Staff were hardworking and friendly, however the standard of service fell well below 5 star rating. Entertainment team had vast array of activities during the day however the nightly shows were a bit on the tacky side..We also had a few issues with telephone calls to our room..6am alarm call that we didnt request....10.30pm call to come to reception on the second night of our vacation to settle our bill (there was no bill)..we did get a bottle of the house wine as compensation for inconvenience!!!The good weather was the best feature of this holiday..no complaints here!As far as I can see main issue is bad management. Solution = management shake up, new chefs, staff training programme and a refurbishment programme.Unfortunately, wont return to find out if this will happen!!!

<Content>Dreams Not impressed and certainly only a 2 or 3 Star Resort tops! The island is very dirty, lots of trash everywhere. The Dreams Resort is very pretty, clean and well kept.Although the food has alot to be desired, its very bland and tasteless. There aren't very many options or choices in the selection of food. There were 4 of us traveling and everyone had stomach problems, and just about everyone we talked to had the same problem and similar experiences and thoughts of the food. We booked swimout rooms after being told my the booking agent that the pool was open 24/7. Upon our arrival, the pool is open from 7am to 7:30pm and not much need for the swimout room and the additional $$$$. All-inclusive includes food, room and drinks but as I said earlier the food isn't very good, the rooms are nice but small and the drinks (house beer) is tasteless. The beer selection was their beer or their beer and only their beer (except at the upstairs lobby you could get 1 kind of light beer and 1 kind of regular beer just not the popular brands).The beach was average and the snorkeling was disappointing. Overall, the trip was very disappointing. Not at all what some of the reviews stated. Not a preferred spot for the Caribbean and no comparison to St. Thomas, St. John or the Virgin Gorda

<Content>Dreams Punta Cana Not So Great Just returned from 5 night stay at the Dreams Resort. My husband and I traveled there with a group of 18 people, all close friends and family. None of us were impressed. Last year we visited the Dreams Resort in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico and loved it.....wish we had chosen to go there instead this year. My husband and I didn't have any room issues with the exception of the air conditioning in our room not working the last day/night of our stay. That was the case for most of our group. Others had to move rooms a couple of times to get acceptable accommodations when they checked in. The food was not great, although we did like the Oceana restaurant for the seafood. The drinks were good, and in some of the bars you could get domestic beer. Service was slow for food and drinks. The pool was nice, and we enjoyed the swimup bar. The beach was clean. We were not impressed with the appearance of the resort, the grounds were kept, but nothing compared to the very lush, green grounds at the Grand Palladium in the Dominican. Out of the 18 of us, there were 5 of us that lost a day due to diarrhea and stomach cramping/pain. We booked our trip through Hotwire, and it was a good value, but we would rather pay a little more and not have all the travel time. We left DFW at 6:00 am and arrived at the hotel about 3:00 pm, and the return was even longer since we had to go through customs and immigration.

<Content>Beautiful Landscaping, Poor Food We arrived @ the Resort 2 couples 5/21 to 5/25. Upon arrival hotel staff spoke little to no English. We were given 2 double beds in each room. Our room the bed was lopsided and a little dingy; I immediately called the front desk to be swapped to a king size they told us 10 minutes someone will be down and it took almost 2 hours before we were switched. We were switched to 41074106 Nice king size walk out to the pool room.We booked with Hotwire so transfers from the Airport wasn鈥檛 incld in the All Inclusive Package; transportation from the Airport was 60.00 for 4 people, equivalent to 15.00 pp . And on the way back we just asked the hotel staff and they promptly made taxi arrangements cost 70.00 in total for us. Had we booked thru an agent the transfers would have cost more than 32.00 pp . The Drive from the Airport is about an hour and quite a rough ride the roads have several huge pot holes, they drive so reckless. Malnourished animals, Tons of Debris on the side of the road. Resort: The grounds of this resort is Beautiful, well kept lots of trees and plants the pool is the BEST travels thru the whole resort , Wasn鈥檛 impressed with beach at all, quite breezy and a fishy odor and the sand extremely hot even when wearing flip flops needless to say the pool is the BEST place to be Casino  Disco both a little on the small side but a wonderful addition to the Resort The Restaurants: The World Caf茅 is pretty much the main dining, the only place you get Buffett Breakfast, Lunch  Dinner (And they were all hit or Miss) Room service is absolutely the worst food ever!!!!! We ordered chicken tenders and fries, thinking they can鈥檛 mess that up. They did the chicken over fried and the fries were just soggy. The Pizza was the most consistent and the best thing going there. The Japanese Restaurant was great. Unsure what made me sick Thursday think I had food poisoning, I was out of commission for a little over a day鈥?I had continuous vomiting and diarrhea鈥? After speaking with several people quite a few people had gotten sick. The Drinks are great!!!!!! Make sure you try the Sammie Sousa and for you couples definitely try the MaMaJuana (liquid Viagra) it鈥檚 great... So good we bought some to bring back home in the Airport Overall we had a great time the entertainment staff is great, lots to do on the resort However the Resort is pretty much in the middle of nowhere, any excursions take an hour or more to get there The core Zone offers table tennis, Tennis, basketball, Table Hockey, Flat screens all around, They also Advertise the WII on the daily flyer, but when we inquired about it were told it鈥檚 broken鈥?

<Content>Dreams Punta Cana - PARADISE FOUND Hi Everyone,Here is my review of Dreams Punta Cana Resort  Spa from 5/18/08 through 5/24/08:FLIGHT:Delta non-stop from Atlanta fully loaded plane but smooth flying arrived 15 minutes early. You walk off plane on to tarmac and then to open air palapa airport.TOURIST CARD:$10.00 U.S. Dollars pay at one location walk about 20 feet turn it back over and then you are on your way to get luggage and then out door to either ride bus, private transportation or taxis to the resort.TRANSPORTATION FROM AIRPORT: We booked thru Mike's Marina and it was quite an adventurous ride stay buckled in and just try to relax. It only took us 35 minutes to get to resort. I think that might be a record, LOL.ARRIVAL AT DREAMS:You are riding/flying through countryside and then you turn a corner and it is like you are in another world. Clean and they welcome you with a cool washcloth and champagne upon arrival. I don't drink but I made an exception after that ride from the airport!!! CHECK-IN:We arrived at around 3:15 pm and I was surprised to be able to walk up to the counter and be waited on right away. We did not get upgrade talk we were assigned to Building 3 2nd floor room 3207. ROOM:We had 2 double beds and they do have the same bedspread as on the website. Room was clean not a broom closet by any means. We did have to call maintenance about a few minor things: a shelf in closet at bottom was broken called front desk repairman was there in less than 5 minutes. Never saw any bugs in our room. Due to humidity in Dominican Republic lampshades were in need of replacing but nothing that bothered me. Had balcony overlooking the middle pool area . Bathroom was fine had nice sized Shampoo Conditioner and Shower Gel and Body Lotion. No Towel Art or Robes and Slippers in our room entire stay.BEACH: We loved the beach plenty of chairs with palapas above them to shade you from intense sun. Beautiful blue-green water further out nice clean beach. Always had a breeze which was extremely wonderful. Water in ocean was salty !!! Imagine that LOL!!! Stay to left of sports hut smooth bottom, right in front of beach there is some coral that could hurt you. Smooth to the right as well. They did have waitresses to bring drinks to beach as well.POOL: Was great never crowded feeling although they could have had more floats but that is a personal preference for me. They have floats that are full sized, blue or purple. then it seems like people might have torn them into halves on some of them. Pool was cool after being in the ocean. Pool is what makes resort so unique it meanders from Building 5 all the way down to the Building 1 nearest to the beach. Also had waitresses to bring drinks poolside.FOOD:We ate at the World Cafe for breakfast each day as it was only restaurant open for breakfast. Oceana is only open during busy season for breakfast. Great selection of breakfast foods wonderful fresh made donuts and loads of fresh fruit pineapple my favorite was delish. Omelette's were great. Fresh fruit juices wonderful as well. We ate at Oceana, Seaside Grill, El Patio, Italian place inside World Cafe and all were great. Desserts not so great except for Key Lime Pie. World Cafe selection and variety of foods was our favorite with El Patio close 2nd. We did not eat at Bordeaux or Himitsu. ENTERTAINMENT:Another reason the resort is so wonderful. Those guys and gals work from 9:00 am to after midnight in the disco and if you wanted to get involved in those activities it was quite fun. We were there to just relax so we did not participate in any of the games but watched a few and everyone seemed to have great fun. DRINKS:First let me say I don't drink that much but I did have champagne upon arrival and one strawberry drink while I was here. Just my preference not to drink. My Dad had the daily cocktails and said they were good. He also had beer in room and said it was just OK. He had margaritas, house wine, other fruit drinks and said all were fine. STAFF:I found I was the one saying Hola more than they did which was kind of surprising to me after reading so many previous reviews but they always answered back with a Hola as well. Eileen and her staff should be commended though for handling all the guests so well. We always felt special no matter where we went on the resort.BEACH TOWELS:You do get a towel card which you exchange for one towel and then when you return towel you can get towel card back you are required to turn this towel card back in upon checkout.CHECKOUT:Quick and Easy we had no extras to pay for. We did not make one single phone call while on vacation which was wonderful.INTERNET:Wireless Internet is available but per the gentleman in Internet Cafe it is not working yet in Buildings 3,4 and 5. Though 25 hours for 25.00 U.S. Dollars would have been a great deal.TRANSFER BACK TO AIRPORT:Made the first ride seem like we were crawling along. Although it did take us longer to get back van we had did not have as much air conditioning as first van. We did go airborne once and I would never attempt to drive a rental car there as they JUST drive they have no center lines and have large potholes enough to damage cars badly.OVERALL:I asked my Dad and we agreed on 4 stars but although there were somethings that needed refreshing overall this place was extremely clean and tidy and we were never bothered by anyone including vendors a no gracias took care of them usually. I would recommend this resort to anyone and we will return again in the future. I will post pictures later this week. I really enjoyed my stay and would strongly recommend SPF 50 or higher to avoid sunburn.Any Questions feel free to ask.Knights3254

<Content>Wow Wow Wow Dreams is a Dream Come True Wow Wow Wow is all i can say about this Place.Stayed 28th April with my partner both early 20's. We booked through Thomson and as soon as we did came on here to read up on all of the reviews and forums and instantly became worried due to a vast amount of negative and bad reviews. We were even considering changing hotels due to my constant worries. I am 100% glad that we didnt as i had a holiday of a lifetime.When arriving at the airport and stepping off of the plane you immediatly know that you are in paradise, for those who havent been before the airport is a joy all in itself compared to the one you have just left, it just looks wonderfull, but i wont spoil it for you and give too much detail.The transfer to Dreams was a bumpy one as most people have said, but the driver did his upmost best to avoid all of the bumps and holes in the road, and it really is the other drivers that seem to cause the disrupt. This journey took about 45 minutes and shows you the real side of the Dominican that you become oblivious to once you arrive at Dreams.On arrival we were greated with cold towels and we had checked in within 10 to 15 minutes. And were told to go straight to our room and our bags would follow. Walking to the room was breathtaking, the grounds of this hotel are immaculate, i hadnt even been there an hour and i was glad i hadnt switched hotels.Our room was lovely with a big four poster bed, and bathroom and small sitting area, people say that the rooms are tiny, but for the amount of time we spent in there are room could have been even smaller for all we cared. Whilst unpacking i read the welcome booklet that was left in our room, containing everything you need to know about where everything is, the restraunts, dress codes and the room service menu. We ordered room service on quite a few occasions and it was lovely, we always tipped the waiter and it was usually with us between 30 - 45 minutes.The restraunts were amazing and it was exciting choosing which one to go to on an evening, we tried every single one and the only one we didnt really like was the Italian as it didnt seem to have a lot to choose from. At lunch time there is a beach bbq, the buffet or you can go to the seaside grill for lunch. The seaside grill was great for lunch as it had loads of different sub sanwiches to choose from: steak, chicken, beef etc.The beach itself is gorgeous and there was always a spot for us no matter what time of the day we went down. Becarefull to put extra suncream on when at the beach as the cool sea breeze makes you feel allot cooler than you actually are. There are ladies that come round to take your drinks order whilst round the pool and at the beach which i thought was fabulous. Make sure you try the Bannana Mama Cocktail, it is amazing. There are always loads of things to do during the day, but they never pressurise you into to doing anything if you dont want to. We joined in on a few different things and have to say that the entertainer are the best i have ever come across. melkis and 50 cent were stars in their own right and made all aspects of the activities enjoyable. They then put on shows at night which were well organised and fun to watch.There is a casino, which we spent an hour or two at, after the shows. The staff are lovely in there, and again there is someone who walks around taking your drinks orders in there, so you really do get waited on hand and foot. I played allot on the slot machines (jackpot party is the best, but be warned it is addictive) and my partner played blackjack and roulette.We saw that there were allot of excursions but we didnt go on any as we found that our time was too precious and wanted to make the most of our days at the hotel.We do not have a single complaint against this place and would definatly go back without a doubt, i just hate that iv got to wait a year to be able to do it.The buffet was vast and plentifull and there was always something to choose from. The staff in the buffet are lovely, and your glass is never empty at any of the restraunts.I could go on about this place for ever, so if anyone does have any questions then please dont hesitate to contact me.

<Content>Mixed reviiews....some good and some bad Well, to begin with I am always skeptical of people who write all negative reviews but we did have some problems here. I must say that the travel time from Texas, with driving/airport/checkins/etc was over 14 hours and when you are sitting at the swim up bar with a drink in hand it seems no different than Mexico....in fact we (19 of us) all agreed that we prefer Mexico. This was our second trip to the Dominican and I guess we just forgot how long it takes to get there. Do believe people when they say it is over an hour from the airport on a very bumpy road! Dominican Airport Transfers did an excellent job of transferring 19 people with different arrival times. They were punctual and very professional but BE PREPARED for the ride of a lifetime with constant passing, swerving, etc.etc. I would have felt safer in a New York City taxicab! Our driver did tell us that there are many, many accidents with few hospitals but needless to say I was thankful we arrived and departed unscathed! Anyway, back to the resort.....the staff was very friendly but hit or miss as far as the actual service went. Our room was missed for evening turndown service 3 of 5 nights and the waiters really tried but often seemed overwhelmed....the food was mediocre. Everyone found something they usually liked but we have had better in other resorts but also much worse. The drinks were cold and tasty and abundant. The pool was truly spectacular and just as many describe. The room......DO NOT be swayed to pay an upgrade for a walk out pool room unless you plan on using the pool in that area. We were only 10 feet from the pool edge and it was quite nice but since we met friends every day in a central area we probably didn't utilize a $250 upgrade. The air conditioning universally stinks! We heard comment after comment from our group as well as people we met that had little or no a/c. Our room a/c worked relatively well for the first 3 days and then quit. We took a small portable fan that was a lifesaver. The beach is quite rocky in areas but there are some nice spots also. The resort is very secluded and far away from other resorts so it is not safe to walk long distances on the beach or be out on the beach at night! The spa was firstclass! I had a 2 hour treatment (The Dominican Body) and traded the pedi/mani for a longer massage.....altogether it was a 30 minute coffee scrub, 30 minute mud wrap and 60 minute massage...for $150 plus tip and was really, really delightful. The spa itself is one of the best I have been to in Mexico or the Carribean with an array of water therapies to enjoy before your treatment. One last thing .....buy and take lomotil with you.....at least 8 of our 19 had from mild to severe gastric issues and we ran out of lomotil (or immodium). I usually figure that most times when you hear this it is a combination of sun and alcohol but several of our group NEVER have this problem on trips so this seemed to be quite a trend....not a fun one though! I hope this covers most everything but keep everything in perspective and remember that you are in a beautiful place and NOT AT WORK! Go and enjoy!

<Content>Review of our trip Just got back from our vacation and here is my review. This is my honest opinion of what my wife and I thought of. 1st - The Ride to Airport - Not as bad as some people say. The road was a bit bumpy but not to bad. Maybe we were expecting the worst and were surprised that it was not to bad. We landed at 11:30am and were in our Hotel room at 1:00pm not to bad.2nd - Hotel - This Hotel is beautiful and very clean. The grounds are kept good and is very easy to get around. Prepare to walk!!! The only thing bad would be the vendors that come in from outside a few times a week. Maybe 10 tables all selling same thing and pressure you to buy stuff.3rd - Room - We had a swimout room and loved it. The room was clean and not as small as people were complaining about. About the same size of a basic room an Atlantic City casino. We had our own lounge chairs on our back yard area and pool was 10ft away.4th - Pool - GREAT...simple as that!!! Never a problem to get a chair or a float.5th - Beach -GREAT.. water was very nice and yes you need to stay as far left as possible to avaid rocks in water. Very easy to find the rocks because they the color of water is darker. Tons of chairs and huts to use.6th - Food - Horrible...sorry to say food is not good at all, and we are simple people, not one to eat at fancy places and we just didn't like it. But to be honest we don't like seafood so maybe the seafood is good.. but probably not.. We both got sick for a day!!They say 7 restuarants but its more like 2. 1 Building has 3 rest. in it and are roped off to devide them. the Other has 2 on one floor and 1 on second.. MAybe thats the way they do it at all inclusives. Chinese rest. was good and in building by itself but you had to pay extra for hibachi grill7th - Entertainment.. not to good. There was 2 good shows that we saw in our 6nights there. Most of the shows are like a High School Play with dancing. We do go on cruises alot and the shows are 100% better. 8th - Casino - HORRIBLE.. most unfriendly people in the place. Not even a Hello or a smile..And I'm not bitter from loosing money (because I didn't) They made you want to not give them your money. Everyone at the resort was even talking about how bad it was in there.A few extra things to mention are the waiters were mostly bad. Never bringing you drinks when you asked for them. We would be lucky to get our drink before we were done eating. Maids were very good and kept the room clean. Pizza was extreamly good. Overall I would not go back or advice anyone to go but thats just my opinion. Unless you are a big drinker and want to hang at bar all night long then there is not much to do at night.. The beach and pool saved our trip.

<Content># 1 Best Vacation Ever We stayed at Dreams Resort from May 5th - May 12th. This was honestly the best vacation I have ever experienced. First I just wanted to say hello to all the amazing couples we met Billy  Lauren from NJ, Mike  Melissa from GA, Shawn  Brittney from D.C., Matt  Katie from PA and the No. 1 person I fell in love with was Mamajuana form D.R. This was me and my wife's honeymoon shared together. We are both in are mid twenty's. To start off please DO NOT READ any bad reviews. This was seriously the best vacation I have ever experienced. We had a direct flight from Baltimore, MD to Punta Cana. When we arrived at the Airport as you will pay a $10 Customs fee. Customs and Immigrations were a breeze. After that you will experience the famous hour adventure from the airport to the resort. Just close your eyes, hold on tight and pray to make it there alive. Once we arrived at the resort we were in an all. This was the most beautiful place I have ever been to with the palm tress, flamingos, parrots, monkeys and etc. Check in took about a minute and are room was ready on arrival. We stayed in a deluxe room # 1305. We had fantastic view of the beach and the pool. The beach was awesome. Go right near the coral if you want to go snorkling. This is where I saw all the colorful tropical fish. We got all are drinks during the day at the pool bar. If there are alot of people trying to get served just walk right behind it and get a drink at that bar. I did tip a dollar after most of all my drinks but alot of people did not. We always got are chairs right by the pool bar. This is where all the games and activities take place. You will need to get up by at least by nine to reserve a chair. Also I would advise packing a water float and water shoes. We had ate at all the restaurants except for the French. All the food was EXCELLENT and Im a very picky eater. Also we ordered late room service almost every night. Get the delicious pizza's and nachos. Not everyone follows the dress code of Men needing to wear long pants and collared shirts. I did not see anyone turned away. We did go the the Disco almost every night after the shows at the theater and had the best times. Alot of drinking, dancing, and fun. The resort also has a game area that included pool tables, ping pong, fuse ball, a bar and even a mech. bull you can ride. As for shopping they do allow the vendors to come in the resort some nights. They can be a little pushy to look at what they have to sell. I advise to talk the price down as low as you can go. We took a 5 minute walk right out of the resort and did are shopping. This was the place to go to shop. All the vendors had different stores with all kind of gifts and souvenirs. The resort also had a nice gym and spa. The spa is the place to go. Me and my wife received a nice relaxing 25 minute message. Last but not least I want to thank all the workers. They are some of the most out going, nicest, wonderful people you will ever meet. Louis, 50, M.J. and Mickus you are the greatest.

<Content>Great Vacation Hi ThereJust returned from a week at Dreams and we found it to be a very well run establishment. The food was great--especially the buffet we found it to have a wide variety of cuisine to sample.Loved all bars and their atmosphere, and overall the staff were attentive and provided good service.The pool was a massive playground for all ages and we played there a lot. It's a pity the pool night-lights were not operative -- it would look terrific at night.The activity's staff do a great job, as do the behind the scenes staff such as the groundskeepers, facilities maintenence staff etc.The beach is beautiful and spent time walking and taking the view from both sides.That sums it up for us.Go and Enjoy.

<Content>Don't be fooled by the 5 star rating! We just got back from a week holiday at Dreams (but more like a Nightmare! 鈥?this place doesn鈥檛 even deserve a two star). We chose this hotel after reading the reviews. Although there was a mix of positive and negative reviews, we still decided to go for it. It is a choice we regretted as we had an awful time there. Room: We requested when booking a top floor room but we were checked into a different room that had a funny smell 鈥?clearly it was not used often 鈥?it was also very small not at all like what they show on their website. Moreover the balcony door and the room door were not working and we had another guest walk in our room in the middle of the night. It took the hotel staff 4 days to fix the problem 鈥?which was very annoying given we were there for only 6 days. They didn鈥檛 even try to find us another room until the night before our departure which was useless.Food and drink:Food had little variety and was often not good at all. They used the same white fish and called it different names (today Grouper, tomorrow red mullet, mahi mahi, kingfish, etc). They used surimi (fake crab meat) and called it fresh rock crab. The food at Hitmitsu (the Chinese restaurant) and Patio (the Mexican) was disgusting. The only ok place to eat is Bordeaux (the French restaurant).With regards to the drinks, it was a hit and miss. The staff:Can be hard to communicate with them. They always act as if they understood you and often times don鈥檛. The service was not as friendly as we expected. Hidden additional charges: + tones of additional charges which you only find out once down there such as the lobster, the beds on the beach, the dvds, and a so-called room with a sea view which is quasi non existent

<Content>just for kids My 2 girlfriends and I went to DR to seek a place for my wedding. It will NOT be in Punta Cana! The room was nice but very small. They had no towels for us at the pool and told us to come back in one hour. We had lunch at the World Cafe then went back and they had plenty of towels. The pool was by far the best part of the trip. Except very poor service by the pool. Generally I am a beach person but it had a horrible odor. The pool was amazing. It wrapped around the entire resort. The food was less than average at all of the restaurants. The drinks were gross. Exactly what you expect at an all-inclusive. Room service was not good. A very limited menu. No alcohol permitted unless you want to pay$$$. Tons of kids. NO singles, if that is what you are looking for. Night club was cheesy. The photographer on site was terrific. A great place to take family photos, engagement pics or pics of the kids. The had daily animals walking thru the resort to take pictures with (monkeys, snakes, parrots). Expect to pay $10-$15 per photo. Be aware of the sun....VERY STRONG. I have traveled a lot but this was the strongest I have ever been around. Overall, just okay. Nothing spectacular! Would never go back.

<Content>Great Stay Wonderful visit to Dreams. Spent the week of May 3 to May 9 there, so Im just recently back.The good - Entertainment Staff - These folks show you a really good time. They are always out at the pool and beach trying to get people involved in activities. These included darts, croquet, beach and pool volleyball, and many other activities. You play for Dreams money to be used at an auction.The people my group got to know were 50 Cent and Stephanie, as they were around the middle pool often, which is where we were. Very nice people and I wish them nothing but the best. Stephanie, if you do read these, I hope your leg has improved since you joined the pool volleyball game.The surroundings - Ahh the pool, what can i say? Gorgeous, nice rap around pool that is shallow enough for all kids to enjoy. Plenty of floats to go around. Plenty of bars around the pool area, be sure to try the Drink of the Day. Give the Dirty Monkey a try, delicious. The beach is also beautiful. Great snorkeling, no need to pay for excursion to do this. Stay on north side of the beach to avoid rocks.The not so good - The food - to be honest, I had no problem with it, didnt expect gourmet, but my wife didnt care for it. Nice variety of restaurants. Stay away from beef dishes, they overcook everything.The bad - The room - Im just referring to the basic rooms. Ive heard the suites were great. Had water problem in the bathroom of our first room, safe and bug problems in the second room we switched to because of the water problem. Small and cramped, musty. Wouldnt recommend a room on the first floor. If you can swing it, go for a suite and get a deal from the travel company you work with that booked your trip. They will ask for 100 dollars a night extra if you want to upgrade.Overall - I would recommend this to all as its a great time and I will be back.

<Content>Truly a Dream Vacation My girlfriend and I spent a week in April, 2008 at what has to be one of the most relaxing, enjoyable resorts in the Carribbean.The room - with ocean view - was clean and comfortable, with an electronic safe, satellite TV, plenty of storage, iron, hair dryer, outstanding housekeeping and room service. The beach was clean, well maintained, and offered great swimming, snorkling (coral and lots of colorful fish just beyond the sand) and just plain ol' relaxing. Throughout the beach area were small thatched-roof cabanas and lounge chairs. Drink orders were taken and delivered on the beach throughout the day by resort employees. A snack bar offering hamburgers, hot dogs, sausages, fresh fruit and soft drinks was located on the beach. Such activities as ATV rides, snorkling, scuba diving, kayaks, Hobie cats were readily available - or could be arranged - at beachside. Fresh beach towels were readily available free at the beach or pool. The pool (with swim-up bar)was an attraction in itself - very large (but only three feet deep), situated among small islands, cabanas and palm trees. The restaurants offered a wide range of fare. The Oceanside had a wide range of seafood, and offered breakfast buffets every day. Only complaint there was that the buffet was invariably cold, except for a great omelet bar. The steakhouse offered outstanding steaks and salad bar. Another dining disappointment was Thai and Chinese food at the Himatsu. The meals (Thai sweet and sour pork and a Chinese dish)were more like tepic soups than the expected fare. The World View buffet was another great experience - every dish imaginable for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and an all-night (or almost all-night) pizza shop. The resort shops are very expensive ($14 for an 8-ounce sun screen). Periodic on-site vendors and nearby fishing villages offer a much better selection and better prices - but be prepared to bargain. (It's worth it!) There are bars and mini-bars throughout the resort, offering a very wide range of domestic and premium drinks, including daily specials. I highly recommend arriving with a large wad of one dollar bills, as you'll find yourself tipping for various services, such as at the bars, at certain restaurants, baggage handlers and others. The resort offer off-site tours through various vendors, such as a counrtyside excursion, horseback riding, swim with the dolphins, snorkling scuba diving, shopping and others. Be careful using a credit card, as fees are advertised in US dollars, but charged in pesos. The the staff was attentive, friendly, and courteous, contributing to a very relaxing, enjoyable vacation. I highly recommend the Dreams Resort and Spa to anyone whowants a laid back, relaxing Carribbean experience..

<Content>Amazing Time! The staff ROCKS! We stayed at Dreams Punta Cana from May 3-9th. It was my first all-inclusive experience outside of Club Med. The transfer from the airport to the hotel is about an hour. Once you arrive to the hotel you are greeted with Champagne and the words of Welcome Home . We did have to change rooms but they were very accommodating. We were are on the ground floor which is nice and convenient to the pool. If you have a child, you should ask for bldg 8,9. The explorer club for kids only is wonderful (Go Marilyn and Santa). The activities change daily. My son never wanted to leave. And the activities for adults is great. Stephanie and 50 Cent are amazing, they keep you very busy. And they enjoy what they do. The night time entertainment begins every day at 8:30 with a kids show, which is wonderful. Just pay attention to last minute location changes ie beach or theater.I can't say enough about the staff, they made the vacation a memorable one.Food - was okay. Skip the mexican, world buffet is fine cause it changes daily and you can always find something. I was a big fan of the pizza. Breakfast - get a smoothie, and freshly squeezed juices ie. watermelon, cantaloupe. Don't forget the donughts. And the restaurants by the beach are fine. The French Restaurant is great esp the view. The best treat was the custard machine by the middle pool bar and beach bar btwn 1-4. It's very creamy and refreshing.Use bottled water only to brush your teeth!!! Bring your on Pepto Bismol ($12 in the gift shop)

<Content>5 Star Resort not worth 2 Resort was booked for our third trip to the Dominican Republic this year (Love the Punta Cana Beach) making it our fifth trip to the islands so far this year. The resort was impressive as we arrived and the staff very friendly and accommdating. It however went downhill from there. Our room was very nice but the grass by our patio was 10-12 inches high which led to a very large pool which was starting to grow algae. You could wade to a swim up bar but it generally closed early making quite a few people unhappy. The dining experience was the worst that I have had in the islands. After generally an hour wait (they do provide a pager) you were seated with a limited menu and tasteless dishes. I mean it was BAD!!! The only decent meal we had was when I purchased a $50 US lobster for the wife and it was average. When we did check out we asked 3 times for a baggage pickup over a 40 minute period and received no response. How this resort can claim 5 stars is beyond me as it is the worst place I've stayed in years. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.

<Content>Very nice, but watch out for the front desk sharks...... The vacation was great except for the front desk and their manners and customer service. Let me explain the good part first.All other staff is outstanding. Truely worked hard to ensure a pleasent experience and it worked. The entertainment team were fun and envolved all, and at times put me into a belly laughter. The wait staff and bar tenders were all attentive and made the experience enjoyable. The leader's name is Melkis and between him, 50cent and Usher among so many more it was a lot of fun. Food was good, champagne all day, and grounds nice.Now for the watchout:Booked our vacation through Apple, started with a basic room then contacted the Hotel and upgraded to a swim out room. Later was contacted by the Hotel reservations to upgrade further at a discounted rate for the honeymoon suite. We spoke to the hotel and they said we could wait until we arrived and see if there were rooms availible. After arriving at the hotel, the front desk would not honor the discount. We offered to provide the email of the rate offered. So we decided to stay in the swim out room. That evening the room upstairs had a major leak all over our things in our bath and everything got wet. When we complained to the front desk we recieved no sympathy. When asked about the upgraded room they still would not upgrade us at a discounted rate, my wife had to verbally complain to even get a few percent from them. Later that day the person we spoke to in reservations who sent us the upgrade at a lower percent asked us why we did not contact him, we said we tried but the front desk did not know him and would not honor the rate in any event, he said nothing. So nothing was done. In the future I would watch out for the oldest trick in the books - bait and switch. Please note that the grounds were immaculate, but there is garbage all over outside of the resort and throughout the island. It's a shame that $3 billion dollars are brought in by tourism, but they do not have in effective garbage system. Lots of children and excellent for families. Not for us...we prefer an all adult resort, but Apple advised us that it would be quiet. Apple owns 50% of the resort and really pushes selling it!

<Content>Club Level did not meet expectations We are avid travelers, usually staying in high end resorts. We stayed at Dreams because we were there for a wedding. They did a great job with the wedding and reception. However, we would not return to this resort because the food was not tasty, rooms need upgrading and the service was hit or miss.We booked a deluxe room in the preferred club hoping that it would offer extra perks and we were disappointed. We鈥檝e stayed at the Club level/upgraded in the Occidental Grand in Cozumel and Swept Away in Negril. At those resorts, we received extra perks, but that didn鈥檛 happen at Dreams.The Preferred Club 鈥?Usually in Caribbean resorts we are greeted with a cold towel and a drink upon arrival. That did not happen. Instead there was long line at the front desk for check in. So, we just went directly to the club building (Bldg 6) and in still the check-in process took almost an hour.On a positive note, it was nice to have our own concierge to organize excursions if we needed to and access to the bar in the Club building. Though, it would have been nice to have a restaurant in the Club building. They offered only finger food.The Club advertises free internet use. We often saw the staff using the one computer with internet access that is supposed to be for club guest use. I needed to quickly check my email while we were there and I asked the staff if I could use the computer and she said 鈥渏ust wait one minute鈥? The staff members should not have even been on the computer, let alone ask a guest to wait while she did personal computer work.Rooms 鈥?Initially we were given a ground level room and it smelled like pesticide and there was note stating that they were exterminating. We didn鈥檛 see any ants, but our friends who were in a different building on the ground level had ants in their room. Our initial room adjoined with another room via a door and it was too easy to hear everything in the adjacent room.The club level advertises upgraded toiletries. Our room had one bar of soap and no shampoo, lotion, etc.Then, we moved to another room that was a smaller, corner room on the second floor, but without an adjoining room. The Club buildings are buildings 6 and 7. It鈥檚 best to be in Bldg 6 since that鈥檚 where the bar, finger food, computer with internet and club concierge are located. The rooms are decent 鈥?clean, but nothing special.Food 鈥?Overall, we did not like the food. The Best restaurants are the seafood restaurants. We didn鈥檛 like the Chinese restaurant 鈥?very marginal food. The Buffet restaurant had a lot of variety so we just picked food that we thought looked decent. The waitstaff in the restaurant was OK. They did the best they could but were clearly overworked.Facility 鈥?The pools were well-kept. The grounds were clean and attractive. The facility was well lit at night and the casino was small but fun.

<Content>fun in the sun! my boyfriend and I just came back from punta cana, we had a 5 night 6 day vacation that was absolutely amazing! food was great at most restaurants, our favorites were japanese  french. The French food was delicious, but very small portions, order alot! Employees at the resort were so friendly and nice, made us feel at home! we suggest to do some tours while you vacation. We did the Aquatic tour, which was speed boating and snorkling all in one.. out of this world! we also did Horse back riding, pretty cool but not our #1. We also rode ATV's. What an experience, definately something to look into while there! Pool side was great, wake up early enough to grab a chair, just leave your towel on the chair and go have breakfast at the world cafe. Fresh fruit by the pool every day around noon, lunch daily at most restaurants and also a BBQ on the beach. Beach was phenomenol but we did spend most of our time at the pool due to entertainment. Rooms were perfect for what we did, shower and sleep! We loved our vacation, can't wait to book again soon!!!! =)

<Content>I can't believe some of these reviewers stayed at the same hotel I'm amazed by some of the things I read in other reviews of this hotel. Let me start by saying overall, I had a good time, but I think I would have had a good time at most places. We stayed at the Dreams the last week of April, 2008, and this is what we found.We had three rooms while we were there. The first was already occupied when we got to it. The second had a leaky ceiling. The third was fine. They did move us and upgrade us after the first mishap and we had to wait a day to get moved from the leaky room. They were easy to deal with and everyone was very nice, but we heard about other rooms in the complex and it doesn't seem like the hotel is in good condition b/c quite a few people we talked to had something leaking or something else wrong with their room.Anyone that tells you the food is good might need to see a doctor. I did have a few good things to eat while I was there, but overall the food is aweful. The Mexican is by far the worst restaurant. I honestly think everything we ate there was prepared in a microwave. The steakhouse and seafood restaurants were ok, not great, but not bad. The thing we noticed is that they are very inconsistent with food. We ate dinner with another couple one night and everyone pretty much ordered the same thing and all the entrees came out different. Some overcooked and some undercooked. Bring a spice rack too. I thought the food would be spicy here, but it was surprisingly bland.Some miscellaneous good and bad items about the hotel. The pool is very nice. I've read some reviews that chairs and towels are hard to find. Chairs are always available. They just might not be right next to the pool or at the part of the beach you want, but there are enough. Towels are also available in the morning, but don't give your towel up b/c they run out after lunch. The bars and drinks are fine. If you want more liquor in your drink just ask for it. Most bars and restaurants seem to be understaffed though b/c you do have to wait sometimes, especially at night. They bring vendors in a few times a week to sell junk. I've been to all inclusives before and this is typical, but these vendors where very pushy. Avoid them. Finally, if you really want to go to the D.R., I would suggest something closer to the Airport. We didn't visit the hotels there, but we drive past and most looked very nice. The Dreams is a pretty good drive from the Airport on a very bumpy road, so if you're taking a 4 or 5 hour flight to get there you probably don't want to spend another hour driving that road. Check out the reviews for hotels closer to the Airport, I'm sure there's something good there.

<Content>One of the best Resorts in Punta Cana After reading some of the bad reviews, I'm certain that some people will complain no matter what.We (Me, My Wife and 16 year Old Son) stayed at Dreams Punta Cana from April 27th till May 04 2008. This was our 3rd trip to DR. We stayed at Iberostar Punta Cana and RIU Palace Macao before, and Dreams was by far nicest of 3.RIDE TO THE RESORTThis resort is at the very end of Bavaro Resort district so the ride is about an hour if you don't have to make any stops. Our bus stopped twice on the way, so it took us almost 1hr and 20min. Ride is very bumpy at times, but this was our 3rd time so we expected that.Iberostar and RIU is at least 40 minutes shorter ride.CHECK-INThere was a lot of people checking in at the time we arrived, so we had to wait for about 20minutes. I emailed the concierge with the room request (Building 1 close to the Beach), but we didn't get it. So that was little upsetting. But they gave us a new room next day so if you'll ask they will try to help you as much as they can.ROOMSWe stayed at 2nd floor Deluxe Room with pool view. Room is little on the small side, but not tiny as some people claimed. We had 2 double beds and pull out couch. Room, bathroom and all furnishing are in like new shape.BEACH AND POOLBeach is very wide. Cleaned everyday. With many chars and cabanas. But if you want nice shady spot, you have to get there before 8AM. There are many rocks in the water so you have to be careful.Now the pool is just huge, with tons of chairs and umbrellas, so even thou resort was full it never felt crowded.FOOD AND DRINKSDreams has 7 Restaurants (French, Mexican, Seafood, Steak House, Italian, Japanese and Chinese and Buffet) plus Beach Grill and Fruit Stand during the day. You don't have to make morning reservations to the restaurants, but if they full they give out beepers that work in a whole resort and they call you when your table is ready. I think it works great. We tried all the restaurants except Italian and Chinese and they were all very good.As for drinks you have many top shelf liqueurs to choose from plus many beers (like Heineken or Coors Lite).ENTERTAINMENT  STUFFAs with many other resorts you had plenty of games and entertainment during the day at the main pool and beach area.Plus nightly shows at 9:30PM, Disco at 10:30 and Casino until 3AMLots of very attending Stuff, waitresses waking on the beach taking drinks orders, plenty of pool bars etcIn summary, great resort with amazing pool and great beach. very good food and attending stuff.All in all we had an amazing vacation and would choose this resort again in a heartbeat.

<Content>Bit above average Staff was nice and on average responsive. Initially we've got connecting room (I think they were milking us for more money wanting us to upgrade), but next day we were able to change it for a better one for the same price. Other than that everything was alright.

<Content>Yeah it's a good resort Okay, Where do you start? I won't go on too much but will try to cover all important points!Staff, The workers here fall into three different categories, a lot of them are really good and look after you real well, the rest of them are simply either extra special or outstanding!Food, The buffet was good, nothing more nothing less, always something there to get you through to your next meal, on the other hand the specialty resteraunts were amazing and I would single out the French as being the pick of the bunch, their system of no reservations works like a Dream and encouraged us to try more speciality resteraunts than on any other vacation. If they are busy then you are given a pager which flashes and vibrates when a table was available while you go off to the bar.The longest wait we had was 30 minutes! It was only the Italian that didn't do a lot for us but then again we are not great fans of Italian food and maybe should leave this out. Service in all eateries was the best I have ever encountered.Drinks. Simply the best! Anybody reading any of my previous reviews will know that I do enjoy the odd drink or two and this can be the make or break. Fizzy water which is passed off as beer at most resorts is also available at this resort but a well kept secret is that if you go to the up-stairs bar from where you can if you wish watch the show they serve branded bottled beers, not just Presidente and Presidente light but Corona ,Bud,Bud-light and my favourite, Heineken. None of these are on display but are given out freely on request! A small tip goes a long way and my drinks were being made up exactly as I liked them and often without ordering them by just the second evening of our stay!Same story at the swim-up bar, a small tip and a smile at the beginning of the week (o.k. I had to do the hi-five and fist routine aswell) got me fast-tracked for getting a drink when the swim-up got busy which was usually 1.30ish until 4.30ish. Wilson is the man down there.Try for a Wilson Special. You won't find it on the cocktail menu. I discovered a new cocktail on this trip which we really enjoyed, it's called an o---a--o. I can't put the full name as some readers may find it offensive and report me which means that this review will be deleted and I do feel that it contains some useful info for travellers anyway check it out on the cocktail menu ,we could only manage to have two or three each per day . The Pool. Quite unique, never too busy in fact you could always find a quiet little alcove to enjoy on your own with the floaties provided, my wife spent hours on these while I spun her round, a kind of human rottisserie ensuring even all round tan. It was kept exceptionally clean and you can enter and exit the pool via steps leading up to your corridor if you are in blocks 1 to 5. Another myth which I must put to rest is that you have to be out in the early hours of the morning to get a good bed by the pool.Absolute Rubbish! Even on the day we left which was part of the Americans mothers day weekend at 10.30a.m. more than 70% of the poolside beds were available. The Beach. We don't spend a lot of time on beaches due to the biting tendencies of bugs but it looked gorgeous and there was a barbie every day, admittedly the sea did look a bit rough and nobody seemed to take advantage of free water-sports!Rooms Were ample and well serviced , up-graded rooms looked really amazing, sorry AWSOME! We also tried the room service which was very good, they tell you that it may take an hour but we had a 3 course meal delivered to our balcony table within 30 minutes. Bad points! I didn't really want to mention any as we really loved this place but I am trying to give a fair review. We had no bathrobes and slippers and also received no turn-down service, neither of these affected our holiday and if you really wanted them i'm sure a call to reception would sort this out, other travellers in our block had both got both. The only other niggle is that the pool closes at 8p.m. but they were out collecting the towels at 6p.m. so we got out of the pool one day to find all our belongings still there but nothing to get dried on!This is one of the smallest but best designed and most well run resorts that we have been to, there are covered walkways which link up every building on the resort so that you can still get out and about in the evenings should it rain which does happen in the D.R.Just a couple more points which may be of use. The french resteraunt is upstairs in the seaside grill(not signposted), there is also a nice terrace bar up there which doesn't get a mention, both the Chinese and Japanese are upstairs in the Reception area. The Sports Bar where you can keep up with your live games is not in the Dreams Disco but outside the show theatre.   Hope you find this useful. E1

<Content>Great Vacation! Just returned home from a week at Dreams Resort in Punta Cana. I had read many reviews before leaving and was a bit worried that the resorts website was misleading according to the reviews. Well, the reviews were wrong. The place was great! I had read a lot of reviews that said the rooms were small and dirty. Our room was the same size as any hotel room would be. It was very clean and the maids were very friendly and helpful. My only compliant about the rooms would be that the walls are very thin and you can hear everything your neighbors are saying. The food was ok. It could have been a lot worse. The French restaurant was our favorite followed by the grill. The only one that was bad was the seafood place. The portions are small at all of them, but you can order as many times as you want. The pool and beach are both amazing. I had read that it was impossible to get a chair at the pool unless you were there first thing in the morning. We never made it to the pool until at least 10 and never had a problem finding 4 chairs together. Same with the beach. The grounds were beautiful and well maintained. Our favorite part of the resort was the entertainment team. They were awesome, such a group of talent people. We made friends with a lot of them and enjoyed listening to their stories about the DR. The shows at night are great, esp Night of the Stars! I must say I have never been around such friendly people. Everyone said hello and most people on staff knew English very well. We had a great vacation and I would recommend the resort to friends as well as go back myself. Enjoy your trip!

<Content>Don't do it! Terrible experience! Not worth the money! We stayed at this resort for a wedding and were terribly disappointed. Right from check-in it was a nightmare. Took over an hour to check in and then when we tried to get a drink at the bar it took almost as long. Not to mention once we got the drink it had little to no alcohol in it. Which would be true of the drinks for the entire trip-- not good and with no alcohol. Service was some of the worst we have ever experienced. Visually, it was very pretty. Food was very disappointing and at times just plain disgusting! We ate french fries, bread and fruit most of the time. The best part of the resort was the kids explorers club. We have a 5 and 9 year old and they absolutely loved it! They went there most of our stay. Casino was fun too. And if you want pics on the beach or around the resort, the photographers they have are phenomenal....and you'll pay for it. Don't forget anything at home. Tylenol was $18 and toothbrushes $5. All in all, we would never come back to this resort. Service and food were awful and it is an hour ride from the airport. Also, difficult to get on a golf course. They make nothing easy for you here.

<Content>Very good vaction We stayed at Dreams from April 24th to the 29th.This is our 2nd time in Punta Cana, 1st at Dreams. The resort is well layed out. The lobby is beautiful, grounds spotless and lush. The pool is by far the best we have ever encountered. The way it runs the lenth of the resort with curves and coves make it so there is alway plenty of room to swim and lay in a lounger. The water was the perfect temperature. Cool enough to refresh you when you got in but not too cold so you did not want to stay in it. Loved the floats the resort provided around the pool as well. We never ran into a lounge chair shortage at either the pool or beach. We would get to the pool at 10am and could always find a chair in the sun. The shady spots were a little more hard to come by but even then there were plaenty of them till about 9 am. Like everyone says, the staff is great. They work hard and always have a smile on their face. We did not encounter any language barrier whatsoever.The beach was nice. Not the best we have seen but not the worst. We did walk a couple of miles in both directions. Not much to see but still a nice walk. The sand is soft and fine.The food is about average for an all inclusive resort. We ate in the French, Mexican/Latin, Steakhouse, Japaneese and the Buffet. We liked the French best followed by the steakhouse and Japaneese. We did not like the Mexican/Latin at all. We actually left our meal and went to the buffet insted. The buffet is one of the best we have ever been to at a resort. The breakfast spread has everything and anything you could think of, and then some. The dinner at the buffet had something for everyone. The deserts in all the resturants were average at best. They looked great but the taste did not live up to the look. Lunch on the beach was burgers, dogs and nachos. Again, just average. Lunch in the buffet was better but you had to be indoors in the middle of the day to eat. The steakhouse did serve lunch and was open to the air. The food there was good.Bars were all nice but, we feel they all dilute the alcohol except the lobby bar. There is no way you should be able to drink 5-6 drinks from the pool bars and still have little or no effect. Drink just 1-2 in the lobby and you can feel the effects. We were not the only ones to comment on the watered down alcohol, even the top shelf stuff.The weather was good. We had a bit of rain the 1st evening and a half day of stedy rain on the 4th day, otherwise it was sunny and Hot with temps in the upper 80'sWe were pleasantly suprised to see the widely diverse guests both in age and nationality. Everyone was freindly and outgoing. I think the workers attitude wears off on the guests. The workers never pass you by without an Hola!We never got to the spa but did use the gym on 3 occasions. They have some great equipment in there and we were able to work off all the food and drinks we were having. Loved the self serve ice cream machine and poppcorn machine.We watched 2 of the shows while there, the magic show and love show which was a version of the dating game with audience participation. That one was our favorite.Would we go there again? Probably but the only reason we would not is because we like to experience new places. We would recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Your DREAMS really will come true! I first want to write that I have read some of the reviews on this site and do not understand ANY of the negative things said about this resort! We stayed at Dreams April 4-11th. There were 16 people in our group. The reason for our stay was for our wedding ceremony.The bus ride we took from the airport to the resort was about 45 min. It is not as bad as everybody says it is.. it was actually enjoyable seeing the scenery. When we arrived-we were greeted with extremely friendly staff and enjoyed champagne and fresh cookies. Check in was very easy and painless. FOODEverybody in our group loved the food. My favorite was the buffet for breakfast. Everything that you could possibly imagine was there! All of the other food was great as well. POOLThe pool made the resort. It's huge! Even when the resort is at 100% capacity, it never feels crowded. There are plenty of chairs and floaties! MISCGrounds were in perfect shape. Everything was very clean. The scenery is beautiful.WEDDINGMy ceremony there was beautiful. The wedding coordinators think of everything and they take care of everything. It is so stress free. It was the most amazing ceremony! The photographers at the resort take beautiful pics. STAFFThe staff also makes the resort. Everybody is so friendly. Everybody is so willing to help. The entertainment staff works extremely hard and they an incredible job. I cannot say enough great things about this resort. I do not have one single thing that was a disappointment. I have absolutely no negative things to say about this resort.

<Content>Most Fun WE Ever Had We didn't want to leave! the hotel was beautiful, food was great, and the staff was outstanding, especially Stephanie,  Luis(entertanment staff), and Rondon  Rual (bartenders.) Anything you wanted ,all you had too do was ask. The standard rooms were substancial, the suites were incredible. The resort was very clean, and the 7 lovely restaurants were a pleasure.We will definately book again for next year, and we can;t wait to see all the new friends we met. We plan to book the same week together next year.Great place for kid's. We plan to bring our grandkids.Tom  SherryHartland, Wi.

<Content>The Staff bbed in my room I was in this resort in february 2008. You are very likely to have your belongings stolen from the cleaning staff. Lock all you can in the safe provided always.My son's brand new Ipod touch has been stolen during the cleaning and the direction did not admitted any responsability. Do not waste your time in complaining nobody will ever help you at the concierge. So cookies also disapperad from my nephew's room, is not acceptable in such a high level resort.The resort is then located in the north part of the island where unfortunately the sea is costantly weavy and it is not possible to bath, that explain why the resort has such a huge swimming pool.

<Content>Really Solid Trip 24 of us -- aged 85 years all the way down to 20-months -- spent a week at Dreams Punta Cana in mid-April. The occasion: my sister鈥檚 wedding. I have to say that I was quite concerned in the months (and especially weeks) leading up to the trip. My husband and I had a horrible time at the El Senador in Cayo Coco, Cuba, and I鈥檇 always put the DR and Cuba on the same level. This time we were traveling with a 22-moth-old, who is also a virus magnet (STRESS). Needless to say, I was having panic attacks. All of that melted away when we pulled up to the Dreams Punta Cana. It was breathtaking! The only damper was our room 鈥?it was small (which was to be expected) and REALLY musty. I must stress though, out of 12 rooms in our party, ours was the only one with a problem. After spending the night in this room, we upgraded. Wow! What a difference. It was huge!I cannot say enough about the staff, the pool and the grounds. I鈥檝e never seen a resort with so much vegetation. The gardens were beautiful and really well maintained. And the staff was incredible. They were so accommodating and helpful 鈥?especially with my little girl.Now for the main event 鈥?the wedding. It went off without a hitch. The gazebo was the perfect setting, the photographer was amazing鈥nd the food鈥ow! You usually don鈥檛 expect much from these resorts, but this was honestly better than most of the meals I鈥檝e had at weddings here in Canada.The downfalls 鈥?my daughter was too young to join the Explorers Club, the ocean was really rough all week, and the beach wasn鈥檛 the nicest I鈥檝e seen. But can those be counted against the resort? Nope.I would highly recommend Dreams Punta Cana to families or couples looking for a destination wedding.

<Content>Everything you could "Dream" of.... My boyfriend and I travelled with 2 other couples from Calgary, AB to the Dreams property in Punta Cana Feb 29 to March 7, 2008.Once you get over the drive to the hotel (an hour plus in a bus along rickety roads - and I do mean rickety) you will find a beautiful breath taking oasis. We have travelled numerous times to 4 and 5 star tropical resorts (all over the Caribbean, Cuba, Hawaii, Mexico, Florida, etc) and by far this was the superior of hotels.We upgraded to a Junior Suite with a private hot tub on our terrace (well worth the 120.00 CAD for the week). The room was 600+ square feet with a king 4 poster bed, walk in closet, double sinks washroom, separate livingroom, 2 televisions, IPOD docking station, etc.The layout of the resort has been done in away that it's spread out so that you never feel cramped but it's walkable for everyone.When we stayed the resort was at full capacity. There is one buffet that has the 3 meals daily which we never had a problem finding seating. The food is delicious and will satisfy all (kids, teens, adults, and seniors). They have the different spices unlike Cuba and have lots of variety. They had 5 or 6 a la cartes with a different reservation policy - NO RESERVATIONS! You just showed up and we were seated every night within 5 minutes between 6:30 and 9pm. This is unheard of. I can only hope that more resorts can offer this.The entire resort is well maintained, everything is clean, and the grounds are beautifully kept.If I had to complain about anything it would be the lack of chairs along side the pool. They had about one quarter of the amount of chairs that they should have. We had to be up and out by 6:30am everyday in order to get a chair. The hotel management is well aware of this and have said that chairs are on order. The pool is a lazy river type pool that is 3 feet deep the entire way and goes throughout the resort. It's nice to float along with a drink in your hand. The ocean is very rocky alongside this resort. I would highly recommend wearing water shoes and keeping small kids in the pool rather than in the ocean. My boyfriend did some rather significant damage to his toe and foot.The staff was very friendly. We had great weather and are planning on returning in the next year.

<Content>Sweet Dreams My husband and I are just back from a very relaxing 7 night stay at Dreams (April 19 - April 26). This was our second trip to Punta Cana but our first stay at Dreams and we did prefer this resort to where we previously stayed. Knowing that we were looking for a relaxing getaway, we did book a preferred club junior suite and we were quite happy with our choice. The suite was quite spacious with a king size bed, seperate living area, double vanity, walk in closet, and a large balcony with a huge jacuzzi. The preferred club lounge was quite accomodating with a private bar, internet access, and a nice library of current dvds to take back to our room, and the staff was always eager to take care of any needs we might have. The grounds were absolutely gorgeous and meticulously maintained (it's simply amazing to watch a man climb the plam trees barefoot with a machete to chop down the coconuts so they don't fall on the guests!). It's a little stroll through paradise from the front lobby to the beach as you pass by the beautiful foliage and encounter the flamingos on the side walk and the parrots in the trees. The pool is fantastic, with plenty of area for being active or just simply relaxing and we never had trouble finding a chair or a float in the pool on which to lounge. The beach was also fantastic and one of the perks of booking a preferred club room was having a private area on the beach where they provided beach towels, bottled water and they even had magazines and sunscreen for our use. It seemed like there was always a gentle breeze just when we needed it and our walks on the beach were fantastic - no crowds of people to run into. The food we experienced was average with the exception of the french restaurant, Bordeaux, which we found to be superb. I must note at this point that we did not experience many of the a la carte restaurants as I did become ill during our stay and was encouraged to keep to a very bland diet for the duration of my stay. I do not blame my illness on the quality or safety of the food as my husband and I ate the same things and he was just fine. I can however add to my review that the care I received from the doctor at the resort was outstanding! It's always a scary to be sick when you are away from home, but she provided excellent care and followed up to make sure that I was feeling better, which I was within a day or so. My husband and I have stayed at several all-inclusive resorts and our stay at Dreams was very enjoyable. I would not have any difficulty recommending this resort to others, though we will probaly prefer in the future to choose an adults only resort as we go for as much relaxation as possible. And ... please keep in mind that a vacation is what you make of it, choose to pack a positive attitude and leave the stress at home and you'll have a fabulous time (including the crazy ride to and from the airport)! Now, go have some fun in the sun!

<Content>I read every review, then I went to Dreams, and here is my review: I read reviews on Trip Advisor to arm myself before arrival at Dreams. What I've learned: Upgrade to a suite if you have children, more than two adults, or like to spend time in your hotel room. It's an additional $100 per night, but very well worth the extra money. Why? (see my room description). I have seen many rooms in different buildings while walking throughout the property. Some buildings are not upgraded and need work. In the older buildings (which I still found charming), the rooms are on the small end, but if you're just two people or three - and you don't plan on spending time in your room other than to sleep or get ready for your day, you will be fine! Email the property ahead of time and request a room in a building that has been renovated and you will be pleased.Arrival at airport in Dominican Republic: You pay $10 each for a tourist ticket, and not 10 feet away, you walk through a short line to hand over the ticket for entrance. Sort of dumb, but okay. We arrived on a busy Saturday afternoon and were out of the airport and onto our transport van within a half an hour. There are baggage handlers ready and waiting as you exit to swipe your bags and bring them to your transport van or bus. They are extremely aggressive (remember, they are desperate to make a living) and you have to make a choice to pay them a few dollars to carry your bags 30 feet, or carry them yourself. Same situation when you depart the airport. Our family happened to be the only passengers on our van ride to Dreams (Sunquest). We enjoyed the 45 minute ride through the neighborhoods to see how people live, animals roaming in fields, etc... Previous reviews complain of an intolerable bumpy ride and terrifying rules of the road, but I found it exciting ... having travelled plenty of places around the world, including 3rd world countries, I don't have the expectation that when I leave the United States that every place will be a carbon copy of where I'm from. So, relax and enjoy the ride. :)Arrival at Hotel: You drive through the gates and your van pulls up to a vast open-aired lobby, where upon stepping off the van, you are welcomed with cold, wet washcloths to freshen up, a glass of champagne and a cookie. Your bags will left with the handlers (very safe) and you will be given a ticket for each bag. Once your room is issued, the reception notifies the handlers where to send your bags. Very easy and secure system. Reception is very nice! You will see Ana, Kelvin, Francisco, Orlando, Aris ... these are among the nice people working in recepeption that will do everything they can to accommodate you. They'll give you a small folder with your room keys, map, hotel info, and a pleasant note that addresses the problem of saving chairs (read further to see my review on that).Room: I armed myself with reviews, so I knew which building I preferred (building 1 or 6) and floor I preferred (3rd). There is no elevator, but not a problem. If you have a child in a stroller, you can leave your stroller safely in your building's lobby, just at the staircase. After reading reviews, I knew I wanted the suite upgrade. We have two children (1 and 8). We got a spacious King-size bedroom with plenty of room for an additional roll-away bed *and* a crib, and you still have lots of space left. The pull-out sofa sleeps two, if needed, in the living room. Large bathroom and vanity area with walk-in closet. Two televisions (living room t.v. has a DVD player). There is a lovely balcony with a jacuzzi and a sitting area. You have plenty of electrical outlets (you don't need conversion adaptors if you're from the U.S. or Canada). There are plenty of toiletries (though the shampoo is combined with conditioner, so you may want to bring your own conditioner if you want well-conditioned hair). You'll have a mini-fridge, coffee maker, and a digital safe (no extra fee). If you get building 6, you will have a Club Room to enjoy snacks, open bar, two large drawers of DVDs, and concierge ready to help you with anything you need. The fridge is re-stocked twice per day with beer, water, soda, and juice. The housekeeping service is impeccable! Tips are included in your package, but we brought tons of U.S. dollars and tipped our maid $10 per day. She cleaned our room twice per day, re-stocked, replenished towels, and her efforts make a huge difference in your stay. The bed is slightly hard, good pillows and plenty of them, lovely sitting area with two sofas and an entertainment center with DVD and T.V. Bedroom has a flat screen t.v. Photos on Dreams website of suites are accurate. Photos of deluxe (regular) rooms do not represent all the rooms that I saw, except for in the upgraded and renovated buildings.Restaurants: World Cafe was great for breakfast. They have any option for breakfast that you can think up, including egg whites. The food is good quality and well-prepared. I happened to notice they are very particular about food safety, as a team of health officials will roam around from restaurant to restaurant making sure the food is the correct temperature and everything is up to code. The restaurants were fantastic! I'm a vegetarian, but eat seafood, so I lived on shrimp, sea bass, mahi mahi, and salads. All were fantastic! We enjoyed the French restaurant, though service is painfully slow. The Mexican restaurant was fabantastic, too. I loved them all! They open between 6:00 and 6:30 and if you want first seating, be there within 15 to 30 minutes of opening, otherwise, you'll likely have to wait. We waited 1 hour for the French restaurant. About 20 minutes for Mexican. Never had to wait at the Ocean-side restaurants, though.Drinks: There will bar servers roaming around the pool and beach to take your drink orders. The drinks were great! They serve them in 12 oz glasses (plastic). I read on a message board that you may want to take a pony keg (32 to 52 oz cooler to have the bartender fill it with beer, so we bought one, but found it unnecessary. The servers are always there and give you prompt service. If you prefer double alcohol, ask! They want to make you happy. We tipped $2 each time she brought us drinks, even though tips are included in your package. If you can afford it, tip! All of the wait staff, reception and workers at dreams travel hours and hours to work and stay in fifteen-day shifts. They come from extreme poverty and if you can afford to tip, that money goes a very long way for them!Pool and beach: Reception includes a note in your folder about saving chairs. We stayed for one week during a very busy time and were subjected to the very good rule of no saving chairs until 9:00 a.m. We have no problem getting chairs, though, on the beach or by the pool. There are plenty of beach and pool activities to keep your kids happy, and for you to relax and enjoy. The pool is endless! It's sparkling clean, as is the beach ... staff works all day and night to make sure everything is squeaky clean and beautiful. Try to get your beach chairs to the very left of the beach (no coral or rocks) near the floating turtle.Side notes: After all the research I'd done beforehand, I learned how needy Dominican residents are. I brought $500 in single dollars for tipping. I filled several suitcases with school supplies, baseball hats for the grounds keepers and pool cleaners, toys for staff's children, and make-up for the maids. I woke up the first morning and passed out hats and baseballs to the early-morning workers and they were so appreciative. By the end of my weeks stay, I passed out 150 baseball hats. I searched Ebay and Craigslist for bulk items at wholesale, or below wholesale cost. I tipped everyone generously - can't emphasize enough how hard they work from day to night (you will see the same person serving you coffee at breakfast late at night serving your dinner - they work endlessly!). You will get to know a lot of the workers (their names, all about their kids ... it's such a friendly place with easy conversation and lots of opportunity just to chat it up). More notes: bring all the supplies you think you will need. If you get a sore throat and are not prepared, it'll cost you $10 for throat drops in the gift shop. $20 for sunscreen, $8 for Pepto ... you get the idea. Anything we didn't use, we gave to the maid and staff that we got to know, and those items were much appreciated! More: Pack way less than you think you'll need. I brought 7 swimsuits, two sun dresses, 5 sarongs, and 3 pairs of flip flops for a week stay. I over-packed! We brought our clothes and valuables as carry-ons, as I'd read way too often that people's luggage gets delayed or lost. More: No gels or liquids (other than baby formula) can be carried on when you leave Punta Cana. You can bring them in, though, in 3 oz or less. TSA website tells all. Baggage has changed May 2008 for many airlines. They've got from two check-ins to 1 - make sure you check the airline's website! There is a $20 per-person exit tax at the airport. If you booked through travel agent, it's already paid. If not, you have to come with exact cash.More: Malaria medication ... we didn't find it necessary. They sprayed for mosquitos daily (around 5:00 pm). I didn't get a single bite. Hep injections? We had our doctor give them to the kids, just for extra protection. I'm more worried about getting sick from all the people coughing and sneezing on the plane than suffering from Hep or Malaria problems. I think I covered everything.

<Content>Loved Dreams in Punta Cana Dreams is simply dreamy! It is sparkling clean, gorgeous, just lush and perfectly manicured...flowers, green grass, palm trees, gardens...The beach is perfect, with huts to provide shade for the fair of skin. There are plenty at the pool also. Staff was eager to please, always with a smile and high-five.The restaurants were delicious-- I especially loved the Oceana, but salivated over the Bordeau, Grill, Japanese, and Mexican as well. We never had a bad meal! Drinks were made with top shelf liquor-- we just relaxed and enjoyed. I highly recommend the Spa-- I had a heavenly body package--and was walking on air...PERFECT Resort, just perfect!

<Content>Best holiday ever, Dreams is the Best We (a couple in our late twenties) stayed at Dreams from the 2nd to the 14th April. I鈥檓 glad I didn鈥檛 change resort after reading some of the negative reviews, these people must have stayed at a different resort. Everything about this place is great. The building, gardens, rooms, pool, beach and restaurants are all kept immaculately.The rooms are clean and the maid service is great, everyday you are left a list of the next day鈥檚 activities, weather and some chocolates. Everyday the room was cleaned, minibar stocked and towels changed.The restaurants are all good, as was the food. The world cafe (buffet) had something for everyone, breakfast, lunch and dinner, the omelettes are great that Emilio makes. The Japanese is amazing, ask for the Japanese and wait i your told there is a waiting time, the food and show the chef (Jose) puts on is worth it.All the staff in the resort are very very friendly and all work extremely hard in making your vacation as pleasurable as possible. Our vacation would not have been the same if it hadn't been for the Entertainment Team they are amazing so a big THANK YOU to Michael, Luis, Usher, 50cent, Julio and Stephanie, they work so hard and really made us decide that we would be back to Dreams. The shows at night are great and the dancers are really good. There are photographers located on the resort by the world cafe and the pictures they take are amazing (thank you Laura) you are not committed to buying but once you see the pictures you will want them, it's a great service and at a great price.There are plenty of beds by the pool up to about 9.15 after that there is still beds but not as many. There are always beds available on the beach and it is a little cooler there. You are not allowed to get up at 7am leave your towels on the beds and head back to bed, if you do the security will bring your stuff to the towel hut. If you get beds before 9am you must stay with them until around 9.15 it鈥檚 a good idea and make sure the people that want beds get beds.Thank you to all the staff for the best vacation ever and especially to the Entertainment team, we will see you soon.

<Content>super hotel when we got there We booked via Thomsons here in the UK. I had read reports here before we left about construction etc so contacted them 4 times  on each time was told there wasnt any. However, there was..When we landed at Punta Cana we were told the hotel was overbooked for our first night so were taken to Sunscape Casa Del Mar; in no way was this a 4 to 5 star resort. Buffet was very poor, room was not good, door locks didnt work properly etc. We couldnt wait to leave next morningOn arrival at Dreams we were greeted with towels and champagne  immediately upgraded to a honeymoon suite as our room hadnt been ready the day before. We were also given $100 credit to use in the spa,  then they delivered free champagne and fruit to the room.The suite (7204) had a separate bedroom, living room, big dressing area etc + a jacuzzi hot tub on the balcony. It was heaven. We had a partial sea view.Our chambermaid did a lovely job every day on the room, and the nightly turn down service was nice.The pool is wonderful, stretching the length of the resort. There is a small problem for swimmers tho in that it is only 3 foot deep the whole way so serious swimmers take note.The beach was lovely, and the staff continually raked it etc.The bartenders were quick efficient and courteous. Premium brands all the way.The buffet was very good indeed.The a la carte restaurants were, a bit up and down. We found the french adult-only wonderful. The beef fillet  Lamb dinners were superb. Mexican was very good but always empty so lacked atmosphere. The italian (part of the buffet) was ok. The Chinese was very good indeed, but be warned if you want a romantic meal it can get very loud because of the diners in the Japanaese part (more of that later). The seaside grill was poor. The roadhouse good. As we were there 14 nights we sampled them all more than once. Light lunches at the seaside grill were good.The downer on the food was the desserts - they were pretty poor throughout.My wife is a vegetarian, and it would have been nice for each restaurant to have a veggie option. Too often it was a greek salad or a few veggies on a plate.We had booked the resort as it was marketed as a romantic destination. Unfortunately, my ideal of that does not equate to some of the other guests who were staying there, who seemed intent on getting as drunk as possible. There was one major incident that involved a whole party being thrown off the resort,  we did have to contend with people drunkenly running up and down the corridors at 3 in the morning banging on doors etc. We also had a neighbour who decided to have a party in his hot tub at 3 in the morning waking everyone up. (these were middle aged people not teenagers)The construction work at first appeared to be only the paths, but there was work going on in the rooms neighbouring ourts during the day, and quite loud it bacame if you went back for a siesta.The staff were all very polite indeed and have nothing but praise for them, despite being spoken to by some guests very badly indeed.Towards the end of our break there there was an awful lot of Head Office staff there running the rule over things. New high quality loungers appeared round the pool. They seemed to be making every attempt to make it a truly wonderful 5 star resort. However, to make that work they may need to review some of the the clientele that they attract. They can help this by enforcing the dress codes in the restaurants, sitting in a posh french restaurant opposite people in flip flops at night isnt really on. We dressed as per the dress code why couldnt the others? Sorry if I sound a snob hereOne last point, if you are going there for more than a week, the standard deluxe rooms might indeed be a bit small.All in all it would take much to make this a true dream destination

<Content>Incredible Resort!!! My daughter and I had the opportunity to fly to Punta Cana on April 18th for eight days in conjunction with the wedding of her daughter/my granddaughter at Excellence Resort just down the beach, leaving Minnesota during a snowstorm! How awesome is that? Our flight to Punta Cana went without a hitch for the most part -- connecting flight was on time from Atlanta, and we arrived to be met by sunny 80-something degree temps and LOTS of people, including the photo gals (hola!!) and dancers trying to get our attention as we made our way to our luggage. We paid our $10 on arrival -- crazy tax if you ask me considering how much we spent in country as well as traveling there! Kind of confusing getting to our transportation through Viator, but made it, and then on to the hotel. Our driver was excellent in negotiating the roads (and potholes) and we arrived to the resort being met with cold washcloths. On arrival, there was some confusion regarding our reservation, and in the process of check-in I lost a purse with my Spanish translation dictionary and $25 cash for tips in it. That was never located even after several attempts through the front desk and concierge. That made us rather angry, but not too much could be done about it -- someone just lucked out. Our first room was on the ground floor towards the beach, musty smelling, and we were greeted by a centipede crawling on the floor. It was obviously not the picture that we saw when we originally booked. In addition, the fridge was not working and neither was the A/C. Maintenance was called but no luck there in solving the mechanical problems. We called the front desk to change rooms but were told the resort was full and it was not possible. My daughter however did persist in the request after going to the beach and pool later on with it being obvious the resort was not full judging by the amount of people we saw. The second day we inquired again, and after two visits with the concierge, were able to transfer rooms after 3 p.m. to the other side of the resort, third floor, ocean view. Then our vacation kicked into gear! The food was fantastic, the drinks awesome (just be sure to tell them you want liquor in the drink), and the beach and pools wonderful! Even the afternoon grill by the beach for burgers and brats was great! Plenty of fresh fruit all the time even from the fruit stand by the pool area. The restaurants (5 of them) must have excellent chefs -- our food was always presented beautifully, and tasted great! The staff was for the most part very friendly, and seemed to want to please us whenever they could. We loved the Three Amigos who serenaded us every night at dinner (except for the Chinese restaurant) and the theater activities every evening were incredible. The children were always a part of the theater evenings, and the staff was very gracious in including them with their music and dancing. One could tell that the Explorers Club kept the kids very busy, and they must have had lots of fun judging by their interactions with staff on stage at the theater in the evenings. We loved walking on the beach and felt very secure with the security staff always in attendance, even in the evenings. The beach area was nice and clean, and we knew their was coral a little ways out, so had water shoes in case we went out that far. Other nice areas down the beach for swimming though, so no problems with coral for us. We were a little bummed out that we could not use a hobie cat because of not being certified which also included extra cost, as well as any use of the spa which would have been over and above. It was nice not to be continuously approached by vendors on the beach, although the guys trying to sell the horse rides, got to be a little annoying. Don't know if they got takers for the 120 horses they said were just up the road. The gounds of the resort were very beautiful, and it seemed like gardeners and other staff were always busy doing something. All in all, our stay was incredible, and I would go back again. We would just know to request a room off the ground floor, and midway between the beach and the main building of the resort. I would also inquire about the suites the next time -- I think that is what we were supposed to have, but could not seem to get that across to the gentleman at the front desk. This is a very family oriented resort, although we did see a couple of wedding parties there with a wedding at the gazebo one evening. I would also perhaps book my stay in a different way than an online service such as Hotwire.com. When we needed some answers, it was virtually impossible to get a satisfactory answer, and were in more wonderment after the phone call to Hotwire.com as to how to proceed with getting our questions answered. In the end, we just read a lot on the internet at different sites, and hoped it would all turn out okay -- which it did.

<Content>Good, but not dreamy . . . My husband and I relied on previous reviews from Apple Vacations and from Trip Advisor prior to booking this trip. As Apple Vacations is supposed to be a reputable and reliable travel company in our area, we were thrilled to see that Dreams Punta Cana received the highest rating of 6 Golden Apples. Boy, were we surpised when we arrived!Our room was nowhere near a top rated room. The hotel is old, and in desperate need of remodeling/updating. The decor is old, the paint is peeling, and it certainly has seen better days. As stated in previous reviews, the rooms are extremely small, but clean. Far from top-notch accommodations.Although our room was very disappointing (room 3214), it's location was good and the view of the pool was wonderful. The pool, the gardens and the grounds were absolutely beautiful--clean and well kept. Although there was a bit of the towel game, there were plenty of chairs available, both at the pool and at the beach.The beach was clean and had plenty of chairs. It was very windy while we were there, so we did not participate in any of the water activities on the beach. The daily barbeque was nice--a nice respite from the buffet or Seaside grill.The food at the buffet was average, however, we only ate at the buffet for breakfast and an occasional lunch. While only average, there is a plethora of choices and all should be able to find something to their liking. The ala carte restaurants were surprisingly good. We enjoyed the Japanese Hibachi tremendously--ate there twice. We ate at the French adults only restaurant as well as the Oceanside(seafood) and Seaside Grill(steaks). All were above average, service was great, and we really loved not having to make reservations at any.The cleanliness of the resort in general and of our room specifically were fine. The maids did a wonderful job and all of the staff went out of their way to accommodate any requests or needs that we informed them of. With the exception of one of the pool bars, all of the staff were friendly and helpful.Our vacation was great, the weather was wonderful, and the hotel was fine--not great. The service was above average and the staff were very friendly, accommodating and helpful. In a nutshell, the room was subpar while the rest was very good.

<Content>Thanks for excellent rest in Dreams Punta Cana resort  Dreams Punta Cana Resort  SPA is the dream in reality. The wonderful landscape, comfortable rooms, tasty meal in all restaurants, the affable personnel do the rest unforgettable. But the main treasure of hotel is the entertainment team. Competitions, games, dancing lessons, aerobics, a disco and certainly evening shows will not leave indifferent anybody. Entertainment is excellent. It was the best vacation in my life. Thanks for excellent holidays.Galina from Russia.

<Content>Fantastic stay at Dreams My mom and I just returned from our first visit to Punta Cana and we had an incredible stay at Dreams Punta Cana. Check in was quick and easy. It was great not having to wear a wrist band or use towel vouchers. Bottled water is available at no charge everywhere at the resort and in your room. Drink lots! The ala cart restaurants were also fantastic with no reservations required. They were all open every night, the menus were great, portions were perfect, and the meal presentation was always beautiful. The serenading three amigos singing happy or romantic songs made dinner extra fun. It would definitely not have been the same without them! Service at the ala cart restaurants was superb. We basically only ate at the main buffet for breakfast and it was excellent every day. We grabbed burgers and a brat from the beach grill a few times, good as well but a couple of burgers were served quite rare. I echo others鈥?comments on the Entertainment team; excellent, dedicated, and talented group. Rooms vary and we did change rooms initially, which was difficult and took over a day to accomplish. We were overall happy with the quality of both rooms, however the first room on the first floor of building 6 was noticeably very musty and we had wedding formalwear with us. The second room was very similar, not quite as nice but no musty smells lingering so we were happy to hang our dresses there. Note that it is a tropical climate and your clothes will have some odor when you return.Service everywhere in the resort was very friendly. They always have a smile and usually some song and dance. Drinks were sometimes an issue. Bartending across the resort is not consistent, but they are always friendly none-the-less. A couple of mornings we ordered mimosa at breakfast and it never arrived. We joined others in making our own on the last morning from the unattended cart of champagne and orange juice. The only consistent drinks were the drinks premixed in the machines and then it was a challenge to have the liquor added to the mix. Drinks were seldom shaken or mixed well. Most common was to have the liquor poured on top of the slushy drink and handed to you with a straw. We had to stir most of our drinks before we could drink. There is bottled beer in the lobby bar and they have Bud, Bud Light and MGD in the back. They are randomly out of these and then only offer the local Presidente beer. I found I could get a Bud Light about every other time I asked for one.Be very cautious about security. Honesty is not a forte, but the staff is super friendly none-the-less. I imagine lost and found is always empty. We had a quick disappearance of an envelope with $25 left at the check in counter and it was gone in a flash. When we called from our room to the front desk we were transferred back a forth and finally after about 20 minutes we just walked back to the front desk and no luck getting any answers. We went on to have a fabulous vacation, but it was a little reminder to be diligent with using the safe and keeping track of any valuables. Overall this is one of the best all inclusive resorts I have stayed and it was an incredible value. I definitely enjoyed every minute of my stay and was not quite ready to go home after seven nights.

<Content>Some what dreamy My family just returned from an 8 day stay at the Dreams Resort. The beginning of our stay was not all that dreamy. When first arriving we were to have 2 rooms with an ajoining door and were told that it was not available and my family (husband, 2 children 4 and 7, and myself would have to spend at least our first night in 2 rooms far away from each other. They did end up putting us in a sweet for the night with the option to keep the room but at an additional charge!! That then meant unpacking for the night and repacking the next day to be move to our original room which was not cleaned and ready to move into the following day. So, I spent my first day trying to get our rooms while my husband and children enjoyed themselves at the pool. Once the new rooms were ready they were very nicely kept. Be careful if you have a swing on your patio because my 7 year old was sitting it one and it fell out of the celing and she fell to the cement floor getting a little bruised up.The good side to the trip was that the hotel is in excellent condition. The staff, especially in the restraunts and children's club, are wonderful!! The Explorer's Club for the children was great, our kids loved the workers, the club itself and all the activities. The only downfall is that there is not enough shade for the kids if they are going to spend alot of time in the club.Overall it was a nice resort.

<Content>The Best Holiday eve, the staff make this place Myself and my boyfriend stayed here from 2nd - 14th April and we didn't want to leave, it's just Paradise.The trip from the Airport is not as bad as people say, it is bumpy but it's soon forgotten once you arrive at Dreams.I had the best holiday ever in Dreams and this is mainly because of the GREAT STAFF and the BEST ENTERTAINMENT TEAM ever, Michael, Luis, Usher, Julio, 50cent and Stephanie made our vacation and that's why we are already saving to go back as soon as we can. This resort is beautiful, the buildings, pool, gardens and beach are kept immaculatley.The restaurants are very good, the world cafe has something for everyone, if you can't find something you like in here there must be something wrong with you. The Japanese is amazing, if your told there's a waiting time it's worth the wait, Jose one of the chefs is great and puts on a great show. Emilio in the world cafe makes a great omelette, and the champange is plentiful for breakfast to.The rooms are clean and kept beautifully like the rest of the resort.The sunbeds by the pool are plentiful but you do need to get there at 9am to get a bed where you want it, there is always room on the beach where it is a bit cooler with the sea breeze. The staff are also constantly cleaning the beach trying to make sure that there is no seaweed.All the resort staff work extremely hard and that is why it really angered me when people were rude as it seems alot of people are when they are on holidays, manners such as please , thank you or no thank you cost nothing so everyone should try using them the staff make such an effort to make sure everything is perfect for you, so don't be rude.I'll definitley be back to Dreams, the sooner the better.

<Content>A few bumps, but still a perfect trip Almost a perfect trip, but would 100% go back to Dreams. We did not like the sales pitch at the front desk, that we could switch rooms halfway through our trip and pay $100 more a night for a better room, would you want to feel like the room that you booked was inferior? They also were so busy pitching us that they sent us to a room with 2 double beds, instead of the king that we requested. Switching rooms was a pain. Our new room had a broken frig, which was replaced after we called, a safe that worked some of the time, and a broken chain lock. We dealt with it and told them to fix it after we left. The linens and the room could use a little TLC, but it was definately acceptable.Besides those facts, the hotel was perfect for us. The pool was amazing, the food was great, and the grounds we beautiful.Beware of charging items on your credit card to the vendors on the property at night, they charged us in pesos and it equated to an extra $30 over what we had negotiated on.Overall they trip was great, we would definatel go back, and the value was exceptional.

<Content>We had a great time! We just returned from Dreams Punta Cana. I traveled with my husband, 11 year old, 9 year old, 7 year old and 3 year old. We were there for 5 days - just enough time. I use Trip Advisor a lot but have never written a review. I am a particular traveler and have been to many, many places. I had read a number of negative reviews about Dreams but chose it because I thought it would be kid friendly. It was! The resort is clean and well maintained. Our rooms were very nice. The food was good - great for the rest of my family- (I am a really healthy eater and for me, it was fine). The older kids had a lot of freedom and I felt they were very safe and they had plenty to do. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. I overheard a group of ladies in the airport complaining about their resorts (too big, terrible food, overpriced, lots of drunken revelers, etc.) but I felt that Dreams was very nice and had none of these issues! It is not luxurious or fancy but that seems common in the Dominican Republic. The ride from the airport is long. And most importantantly, do not pre-book your transport with a shuttle service (we used Turinter) that will drop off other passengers at other resorts first or it will be ENDLESS! However, once you arrive, the staff passing you cool towels and chilled champagne will make you forget the ride.

<Content>Amazing Place Just got back from Dreams Resort and I cant say enough how great it was. The Restaurants, Pool, Bars, Entertainment Team, and Beach were all spectacular, I've been to Hawaii, Mexico and Siesta Key in the past 2 years and this trip was far and away the best. We ate and drank like Kings and the staff really treats you like royalty.

<Author>BrownDogUpstateNY
<Content>It is their pleasure and mine to write this review! First, let me start off by saying I did not meet one person who was not pouring over the Tripadvisor reviews the month before there own trips. Everyone of us were anxious because of the negative reviews that appeared just before we left for Dreams. This is our very first trip to the Carribean and we were not disappointed. PLEASE DO NOT BELIEVE THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS!I am just now cleaning the sand from my flipflops and realizing I will not be living in my bathing suit anymore! My family and I just returned last night from eight days (April 13-20th) at the Dreams Punta Cana. I suppose if you wanted to knitpick you could find things. We went Preferred, two deluxe rooms as we had five people. We were in building seven, our rooms connected and they were spacious and wonderful. Margarito our daytime housekeeper could not do enough for us. Whether we were up at 6AM or 2PM (the guys liked to sleep in after fun at night!) our rooms were clean and well stocked at our convenience. Our floor was quiet and we were never disturbed by noise from other guests or the women cleaning rooms around us. Everyone who works there goes out of their way to accommodate you. There is some renovating going on but they try very hard not to inconvenience you with it.We met so many wonderful people from all over the US and Europe. Communication with the staff is not a problem whether you speak Spanish or not. I think the friendliness of the staff sets the tone as the best part for us was meeting other guests especially poolside. So Hi to The Guys from Rhode Island and their families, also to Mark and Diane, Nancy and Rocko, David and Tina, and Pauline and Mr. Ironman!!!The pool is magnificent. Disregard the person who wrote about the conga lines because if you were in a noisy area just move. The upper end of the pool has the iceberg for kids and that is crazy and fun for kids, the lower end has the swimup bar and that is crazy and fun for big kids, but there are so many sections you can always find a quiet spot. As far as getting a spot at the pool, we were panicked that we would have to set our alarms for the Crack of Dawn. NOT AT ALL. By 11am it was alittle tough if there was more than two of you but we had nine and went to the pool for 8:30-9 and had no trouble. Rafts...just wonder through the pool you can always find one. Most people when they were done looked around for someone to give their raft to. There were some who horded the rafts but don't let them set the mood for your vacation, they are few and far between... The ocean is beautiful and warm. If people are saying it is dirty I am not sure what they are talking about. If it is the seaweed that washes up have they forgotten IT IS THE OCEAN! Stay to the left by the water sports, the water is as warm as the pool! We walked to the left one late afternoon and there was debrie there but I do not think that is the resorts fault. They have enough to do within their beach area without trying to clean the entire coast line!Food was good. We never waited for a table or a meal. From the reviews I was really nervous about quality and portions but we never went away hungry. If you did you could head to the World Cafe. A couple of nights we ate at different restaurants and then chose to walk to the World Cafe for dessert. The walk justified being able to indulge in dessert!!! The guys ordered room service every night! Some previous reviews complained about the distance between things, again, what were they talking about. The walkways are beautiful, the walks were wonderful and the distances were not that great. Better a little space than to be one on top of the other.Finally I have to mention the spa. My husband and daughter went the first day of our vacation for pedicures and manicures. My husband raved about his pedi all vacation as they massage your feet as well as all the other stuff!!! I think he convinced some other men last week that their manhood would stay intact should they go for the pedi!!! Our last day five of us went for massages and our daughter a facial. It includes an hour in the Wellness area...it was without a doubt the absolute best way to end and incredible week.We loved the All Inclusive, we were not disappointed in our room or the service or in the food in its quality or quantity. We tipped but not because we felt we had to but because we wanted to and we felt the people we encountered were so disserving of it. We left little things for Margarito in the morning and for the nice woman who turned down our beds and had our rooms feeling like a true retreat at night. We would go back in a heartbeat!!!Thank you to everyone in the World Cafe for my birthday cake and birthday well wishes...

<Content>We loved Dreams PC! We arrived in Punta cana at 12 noon on 4/13. Customs went pretty smooth. I loved the open airport. We did have to pay tyhe $10 entrance fee (per person). We then avoided the baggage handlers by say no gracias. We saw a representative holdiing a sign with our names on it. they had transportation waiting. We ended up getting a private air conditioned ride to the resort. The ride went faster than anticipated. The ride on the bumpy roads didn't phase us. we have back roads where we live that are in that condition. We arrived and were greeted as we stepped out of the van with champane and a cool cloth. Check in was done by Orlando. He was very helpful. We decided before we even got there that we were going to get the upgrade. We upgraded from a deluxe room to a junior suite($100 per night). I even got to pick which building I wanted according to the rooms that were avalible. Room: We ended up deciding on building 6, room 6305. This room was on the third floor and had a great ocean view. I am so glad we decided to upgrade once I saw the room. I would recommed the junior suite to anyone who has 2 kids who don't want to share a bed. There was a pullout single bed next to a couch. thekids had their own seprate beds and their own TV. We had our own king size bed and flat screen TV. We also loved the jacuzzi on the balcony. The kids used this and we used it on many nights. We had maid service twice a day. The turn down service at night was great. We always got the nextdays sundiakl to decide whta we wanted to do ahead of time. The sunrises from this room were amazing. My youngest son got up at 6am everyday to capture pictures. The only problem i noticed with the rooms were the patio door doesn't have a handle on the outside so becarful not to close yourselves out. I am not sure if it was just our door or others that were like that. Not a big deal though we just left it open a little. Meals: We went to the World cafe for a late lunch. There are so many choices and the food was good. I loved that they had a section for the kids foods too. We then ordered room service later that night. The platter with chicken tenders and calimari was good. The next night we went to El Patio and invited BB to go with us. El Patio was great we ate there twice. We also at at seaside grill one night. The steak was great and I'm not a steak lover. Our last night we opted for Himitsui. We got there before 6 Pm as was recommended. There are only 3 Jap. tables so it is first come first serve. We were so full after that entertaining dinner. That was very good. Most mornings we went to the World Cafe for beakfast. it was the best! Eggs were made anyway you requested them. The homeade fruit smoothies were made to order as well and very good. We loved breakfast there. A couple of days we got pizza (made to order) from the world cafe in a box to eat by the pool. That was about it for lunch because we didn't want to leave the pool. The ice cream machine at the barracuda bar was great for afternoon snacks. Bars: My favroite bars were the preferred club bar and barracuda bar. The reasons were the drinks were the best. I will go into the favorite bartenders. Our favorite at barracuda bar was Raul. He was great always singing and saying Happy Hour everyday! He was great with my kids too! Always talking to them and making them whatever non alcoholic drink they wanted. Our other special friend from the preferred club was Bertillo. He is a very special person. he knew quitwe a bit of english and was always asking more. He was also great with my kids. He always went out of his way to do special things for my family. I think he'll make a good mamnger someday or whatever he chooses to do. People: The people who work at this resort make it a truely special place. they are some of the nicest people i have ever met. Even when sometime there was a language barrier they still showed their pride in their work. Resort: the pool was the best part of this resort. you never felt crowed even though they were at full capacity. My kids throughly enjoyed the pool and the iceberg. The beach was nice. The ocean isn't too calm but it was a refreshing breeze. Thekids tried beating the waves catching them on the beach. We loved going down and walking on the beach at night. The grounds were beautiful. We loved the flamingos and feeding the macaws in the trees. Peacocks also roomed freely. The fruit lady was great she made fruit carving for people all day . The fruit was great. Excursions: The only excursion we did was the Carribean festival. That was well worth the money and the kids got to go for free. It was awesome swimming with sharks and stingrays. The mamawana on the boat ride back and the show was great. Nelson: Our Exopedia representative at the resort. He was very im formative about what we should watch out for like drinking the water out of the faucet wasn't a good idea to use the bottled water. He also suggested putiing lime on our seafood and salads to help if there was any issues with the food. He also told us about a drinkl to get at any bar if we did experience any stomach issues or pain. he said get a glass of wrm water with a squeesed lime in it and a teasp of salt. We drank these sometimes preventatively. He also was unbiased on the excursions to take. he set up all of our departure transportation. We didn't have to worry about anything. BB: It was also an added bonus to meet BB. My family enjoyed meeting her andhaving dinner with her. they were always asking where she was and when they were going to meet her. It was such a pleasure meeting and spending time with the person who gives a lot of the information about this resort. It is very comforting to have someone like that when planning a trip. I am sure there is more that i forgot but i can't think of any more right now. Anyone has any questions please feel free to ask or send me a message . I will be happy to answer any questions. i will try to post pictures soon. Tracey

<Content>Amazing, Relaxing Vacation!!!! Left Newark, NJ on Saturday, April 12, 2008 and arrived in Punta Cana. Customs was a breeze. We made our way through the baggage claim (this was quite hectic), tried to be polite but firm with the porters who try to 鈥渉elp鈥?with baggage (the phrase 鈥淣o necisitas. Gracias鈥?works very well), negotiated with a cab driver ($60 USD) and were on our way to Dreams! Our very gracious cab driver stopped and picked us up a few Presidentes (quite different from the laws in the US), which made the ride seems a little quicker. Yes, the ride is long and bumpy but we arrived at Dreams in no time. Were greeted with champagne and 鈥淲elcome Home鈥?鈥?not a bad way to start a vacation! We were quickly shown to our room. We opted against the upgrade (an extra $100/night, although some couples we later found out were offered $50, so it may be negotiated) and were placed in Building 4 in a Deluxe Room. Building 4 is halfway between the lobby and the beach. We were on the second floor with a view of the pool. Room was perfect size, with a king size bed, love seat, desk, TV, and fully stocked mini bar. Hit the pool, and then back to the room where we ordered some room service (pizza and cheeseburgers) and went to bed early. Room service was hot and delicious, and arrived within 20 minutes. Our room was always clean and tidy with the mini bar stocked daily, fresh towels and towel art, with nightly turn down service (what a treat! I loved the Sundial to let you know what was going on)The rest of our days were literally full of rest and relaxation. Had several breakfasts at the World Buffet. We found the food here to be out of this world. What a variety! I don鈥檛 know about people who say it鈥檚 repetitive. I could have eaten here for another week and still have found new things to try on the buffet. My personal favorite for breakfast was the Mashed Plantains with the pickled red onions 鈥?I am an adventurous eater and these were quite tasty! Also there was an unbelievable assortment of pastries 鈥?the homemade donuts literally melted in your mouth鈥?especially when dipped in hot chocolate. These are better than any Krispy Kreme or Dunkin Donuts鈥?I even splurged on two the last day. If we were still hungry or ate early, we made our way to Seaside Grille for lunch. The Chicken Kebobs and Fajitas were unbelievable. I wasn鈥檛 a big fan of the Philly Cheesesteak, but I believe that鈥檚 just because I am used to a different style. Also good here were the salads. The Tuna Salad and Greek salad were both delicious. Another option we tried was the BBQ on the beach. The burgers were great, as were the nachos. The chips are homemade and unlike anything I have ever had in the US. Very nice dipped in cheese. We never made it to the Buffet for lunch, as we were usually around the swim up bar area.Days were spent at the swim up bar, playing volleyball in the pool, floating around or bouncing in the ocean. Since we are water people, we just threw our towels anywhere, even on the cement and stayed in the pool. It was tough to find a chair by the swim up bar, but like I said, we stayed in the water. Chairs on the beach were very easy to find. The beach is huge and the water is beautiful! We stayed over to the left, by the turtle/water sports area and never experienced any coral and cuts and bruises. We were tempted to try kayaking, but the folks that we met who did try said it was very difficult and exhausting. The pool though was definitely the highlight of our trip. We had great luck finding rafts every day鈥?yes, a few people hoard them, but most people were gracious enough to give them up if they were getting out of the pool. And the staff at the swimup bar was amazing 鈥?Wilson, Leon and Juan 鈥?these were the gentlemen who made our trip. Always smiling and chatting, always happy to be at work. My favorite drinks included the Coco Loco and the Banana Mama, although I also tried the Wilson鈥檚 Special, the Dirty Monkey, the Mojitos, the Margaritas and of course, the Cerveza. We tried a few of the restaurants for dinner. We ate on the Chinese side of Himitsu, Oceana, Seaside Grille and Bordeaux. For the most part, the food was out of this world. My Mahi Mahi at Oceana was absolutely unbelievable. The Dim Sum at Himitsu was also very tasty. My boyfriend loved his surf and turf at Oceana. Neither of us was a huge fan of Bordeaux. The chicken here was slightly bland. Overall, I wasn鈥檛 feeling well that night so I don鈥檛 know if it was the food or just me. The one part of the food we did find disappointing was the desserts. We tried the Cheesecake, the Coconut Flan, the Chocolate Mouse and the Brownie Sundae, all of which were actually tasteless. The best dessert we had was the chocolate cake from room service. I should note here, though, that the service at the restaurants is quite remarkable. The staff wants to make sure that you have an unbelievable experience. My boyfriend, who has worked in several restaurants, commented on how proper they were, always serving from the correct sides and pulling chairs out for you. The only restaurant we ever had a wait at was the Seaside Grille, which was only 20 minutes and they gave us a beeper to wait at the bar.We also ordered room service several nights, as we were just too exhausted to go out. The room service pizza is very good, as are the sandwiches. Also, the service is unbelievable. We never waited more than 20 minutes for our food. We had every intention of trying the night life, with the Disco, the Casino or the Shows, but quite frankly were too exhausted and usually went to bed early or would watch a movie (the resort had HBO, Showtime, Starz and Encore for movie channels, so we would usually find something for our quiet nights in)Overall, this vacation was the trip of a lifetime and unbelievable. The grounds are gorgeous and well taken care of. Yes, there is some construction going on but nothing to get in the way of your vacation. I would highly recommend this place to anyone. We went looking for a relaxing, romantic vacation and we found it. I have no idea what the complaints are about. I have never seen a staff of more dedicated employees who want to ensure that their guests are taken care of. I have traveled to Puerta Plata, the Bahamas, Mexico and parts of Europe and this was easily the most hospitable and welcoming place. We can鈥檛 wait to go back next April!!!

<Content>vacation is what you make of it and this one was great! After weeks of reading reviews on Trip Adivsor i went back and forth in regards to our choice of resort. Now that I am back all I can say is....vacation is what you make it and will always provide life lessons along the way. Many of the reviews previously written about this resort seem to be from those who did not give it a chance or had expectation of perfection. Let's remember you get what you pay for and when you add up airfare, room, food and drink(including room service) I think this resort is a great deal. Now for specifics.Arrival: The airport has a caribbean feel. Do know that you have to pay $10 per person for a tourist card which you give back 20 feet later. Got through customs fine. One snag on our trip was the non-arrival of our luggage. This was not do to the fault of DR or American Airlines as our bags got held up in TSA but verifying the arrival of our the luggage the next day was difficult. Overall the language barrier is difficult but if you are patient you generally can communicate. Helpful Tip: when traveling with more that one person...pack half of your belongings in each bag so that you have something. The gifts shops do not provide a full selection of clothing and therefore can be difficult. We finally got our luggage at 10 p.m. the next day. Although I cannot say the ride was tramatic as others write on here, it is long and there are no driving laws so it seems so it is defintately an adventure. The scenery is both beautiful and yet sad as you see many living in confitions that you would not wish for them.Check In: The Lobby of the resort is very nice and check in was a breeze. Of course they offered upgrades at a price and indicated we could change our room at any time we chose. We took a look at our room and were pleased and decided not to upgrade. Our travel partners chose to upgrade and upon seeing their room I thought about upgrading as it was spacious and had a jacuzzi but could not see spending the extra 70-100 a night.Room: Our room in my opinion was the average hotel room with 4-poster bed. There were some small bugs but hello you are in the Caribbean and it is to be expected. Our fridge was fully stocked everyday. Our maid service was excellent with both morning and turndown service. We were in building 7 which was centrally located and fairly quiet.Pool: Amazing and seemingly endless...we had no problem finding chairs and generally ventured down at 10. The swim up bar was nice and the cocktail waitresses came around fairly consistently. The floating rafts in the pool are generally available however you will find some rude people taking them out of the water and thinking they are only for their use. Beach: Not sure what all the talk about rocky beach is in other write-ups as we found it to be sandy and soft, lots of chairs available on the beach. We snorkled two days and although not a lot of fish still a good experience.Food: We went to all the restaurants and of couse on occasion did not like an apptizer or entree but overall we were pleased. Bordeax was our favorite, duck was overcooked, but lamb was GREAT! Oceana has a nice selection of fish which was well prepared, waiters at all restaurants were pleasant but Juan as Oceana was our favorite and Johnny Be good who made coffee drinks was great! The Asian restaurant was good as well. Some restaurants we would order two entrees to try and they were always willing to serve them. Breakfast at either buffet is nicely done. Lunch we had at The Seaside Grill or there is always hotdogs and hambugers served right on the beach. Room service was excellent in regards to speed. We often had late night nachos and ordered breakfast in twice. Drink options in regards to cocktails is plentiful but not many beer selections...presidente and bohemia are prettty much it. I did buy corona at the market up the street. I would recommend having drinks made with island rum!Shopping: The resort has people selling things there everyother night. It does get annoying as they are always calling out at you to buy things. I would recommend walking the 1/2 mile right out of the resort to the shopping area where the deals were much better.Excursions: We went on a fishing boat....caught no fish. Went on ATVs which was a great experience as we got to see more of the countryside and culture.Money: Bring cash as there is no ATM in the lobby. there is a surcharge for using credit and even then cash advance is not always available in the resort. There is a bank by the shopping area but line is long and do not forget to bring passport.Spa: Is AMAZING...I had two massages and a facial and all were wonderful. The hydromassage area you can use prior to or after your service is decadent.Entertainment: The staff work very hard....shows are entertainlg but not on par with shows I have seen on cruises etc. Casino very small. Disco is nice size but don't be surprised if after a long day you do not make it up for that as it is usually around 11. the game area is nice as they have pool tables, air hockey and foosball. We did not bring kids but it seems that there is much there to do for them.Overall all a very successful and relaxing vacation. I would go back but would like to experience other resorts as well.

<Content>Amazingly beautifil! I wish I was still there! To start off I can't understand how anyone could say anyhting bad about this place.I went with my boyfriend for a week and we just got back. It was amazing. The beach is beautful and goes on for miles. There was always enough chairs and places to sit on the beach. The pool was harder to find a spot but we managed to find a great one. The pool is so long and the perfect temp. We had a deluxe room with a balcony and it is not as small as a brrom closet as someone said. The room was the perfect size. Nice bathroom, clean, balcony. Perfect! We were hardly in there anyway. The food was awesome. The mexican and the buffet was definnitely the best. So much food to choose from! I like the ice cream they had during the day too!Tours: We did the ATV's right off the resorts, Extreme buggies(the best!!!!!!), Saona Island, and speedboats. We loved them all!The grounds were beautiful and spotless we saw parrots, turtles, peacocks, and flamingos! I would go back in a heartbeat and recommend this to anyone. If yyou have somehting bad to say about this resort you must be too picky and probably should just stay home next time. I dont understand how you can be in paradise and complain!

<Content>Good but not great We (husband, 10-year-old daughter and I) had a great vacation and Dreams was nice but it did not strike me as great. The things that stood out on the vacation were the friendly people of the Domincan Republic, great excursions and the general comfort of the hotel including a great pool. See below for specifics.GROUNDS: Nice grounds but not spectacular. Well kept but the open area around the lobby did not do much for us. Very nice lay-out of the resort though, nothing feels too far.FRONT-DESK/CHECK-IN: Fairly helpful but the least friendly people at the resort. Arrived in the middle of the night and did not get one smile out of the guy. Did not bother me too much but I have to say I did overhear a few arguments so I think there is a bit of an issue with expectations not always being met.ROOMS: Had booked a Junior Suite and had asked for a quiet/renovated room. Stayed in building 8 and we were very happy with the room and the location. Big suite and very clean. Cleaning staff was great. We would run in and out but they were always ready to come and clean when we asked them too.FOOD: Overall so-so. The buffet was extensive and OK; you could always find something. Included some nice things as well. The setting was also so-so. Tried Oceana and the Chinese restaurant (as the Japanese was full). Did not care for either but were very entertained by the Domincan Coffee maker at Oceana. Did not hear great things about the food from other guests either.ROOM SERVICE: Definitely a perk! Worked very well for us. This way you can get food at 430 in the afternoon (had just come back from an excursion). Very courteous and efficient staff taking orders. They all spoke excellent English which really helps when you order on the phone. Food very OK. Salad good (except one day when it was a bit brown). Nachos so-so but the guacamole was great so that worked. Great Fettucini Alfredo.POOL: Very nice! Really liked the lazy river. It makes it feel less crowded and you get different sceneries. All the action is at the end and that really works. You can have a quiet rest at the top of the pool and then swim down for a livelier crowd with lots of activities going on. My daughter enjoyed the ice berg. The resort was busy but we always found chairs.BEACH: Mixed feelings. We liked it but it was not great. It was quiet (no people around) and vast but at the same time the surf/current was a nuisance. It was closed for water activities several days but still not enough waves for boogie boarding. We may have just been unlucky but I probably would not take that chance again. Seaweed was bad a couple of days as well. Still, we made the best out of it and again we really enjoyed that it was not so crowded.EXCURSIONS: Outback safari - Really enjoyed this. You move along at a nice pace and get to see the landscape and learn about the country. Included a stop at a Dominican small farm home, cocoa farm, ranch for lunch, boogie boarding at Macao (fantastic beach with great waves!). Ziplining - really liked this one as well. Good for beginners. Took about 3.5-4 hrs so not an all-day thing. Again, a nice way of getting out on the country side. Horseback-riding: Went with Ranchero. Yes, I know the horses are skinny and it does not look like much but we had a ball. The horse-people were very friendly and we really enjoyed it. Decided to do it again on our last day and then they just took the three of us to the place and we went alone with a guy.One thing we liked about this resort was that it had a mixed crowd. I would not recommend it to honeymooners or for a romantic get-away but I think it works for all others.Finally, I would like to say that we were very close to giving Dreams four stars but opted for three. The not so great food and unpredictable/not great beach pulled it down. For the rest probably a 4.

<Content>Fantastic!! I have to say this is the best holiday I have ever had!The staff in the resort are amazing and cant do enough for you. The food was varied, there was a french restaurant, steak house, seafood, oriental, mexican and the world cafe so there is something for everyone. If you enjoy a holiday with things to do then you can join in the actvities everyday on the beach or if you'd rather relax then you can also do that. Our first week fell on spring break and there were certain nationalities who got up to put there towels on the sunbed at half 6!! We saw them as well on our way back from the sunrise - well worth it on the beach! Our room was standard and there was plenty of room for us both, you are given the option to upgrade on check in though if you would like an ocean view or jacuzzi on the balcony.There are a few stalls about 15 mins from the hotel but it is very difficult to walk round and browse as everyone wants you in their stall so beware!

<Content>Luis, Julio and the gang make Dreams a great resort. This was my first to a resort and my wife's third. We had a wonderful time. The weather was beautiful. The food was better than expected - and I am the world's pickiest eater. The staff was especially nice. Even the language barriers were not trouble. Our evening housekeeper, Rosa, was a gem. We cannot say enough positive things about the entertainment staff. They made the trip incredibly memorable. Luis especially, Julio, and Michael Jackson were great fun and very personable. The remembered everyone they saw and are a tremendous asset to the resort. The Apple Vacation staff are truly great. They gave us warnings as to what to avoid. The recommended excursions were dead on accurate. Sonoma (sp?) Island was incredible. All of the tour people were very helpful. Apple takes good care of their customers. As a first timer, I would definitely go back to Dreams Punta Cana.

<Content>Not a Conga line by the pool person.... My basic review of this hotel is that if you are on a budget, or if you are traveling with a group of children this is probably a good choice for you. Personally I would not return. We did have a great time - no point in getting upset when you are on vacation - and my complaints are not that bad. Its just not the upscale resort that they profess it to be.I read what felt like hundreds of reviews before leaving for our vacation so nothing we experienced really felt like a surprise. We were traveling with 5 adults and one 2.5 year old child. The hotel itself is fairly nice. It needs a facelift - mostly in the rooms. On the first night we stayed in a deluxe suite and decided to upgrade to their honeymoon suite. The rooms are clean - but just average. The Honeymoon suite had nicer linens and was larger, but the tiles in the bathroom are very old and the caulking on the floor kept coming up. I personally found the pool to be quite disappointing. The entire pool is maybe 3 - 4 feet deep and the activities are non-stop. If you are a conga line by the pool kind of person you will love it here. Loud music, contests, dancing, water games ect. Its non-stop. The entertainment staff seem like nice people but they don't read social cues very well. If I don't respond to your constant high five or handshake when I see you - perhaps you can just smile and let me read my book. It is true there is a fair amount of trash on the beach. I also felt like a lot of the other guests were not very respectful of keeping the area clean. Empty bottles here and there, cigarettes, plates, water bottles ect. The beach is nice, not great, but average. If you enter the water to the left of the floating trampoline its sandy and fairly clear. The best money we spent was joining the club room. For 50 dollars a day you are given access to a private section of the beach. The club room is in building 6 -- it comes with an excellent concierge staff, food, and very nice bar. This made the trip feel more intimate. I think because we live in a large city, it felt hard to get away from people at this resort.The food is really mediocre. Keep in mind there were people raving about it, so to each their own. Every person on our trip did get a little sick - nothing more than what you might expect from being in Mexico.All in all the basics were there -- the weather was great --they keep the rooms very clean -- it just didn't have a luxurious feel at all.

<Content>What Can I Say, "Excellent" I began reading reviews of this resort a couple weeks prior to our trip. I found some bad reviews but mostly good reviews. For my wife and I, it was Excellent. Both she and I have been on a number of 7 to 10 day vacations and this was by far the best. The pool was huge, the food excellent, the staff friendly and helpful. The stories of getting up early and reserving your pool chairs were true, however, she and I don't live near a beach and prefered to be on the beach everday. Most staff members spoke enough English to get by and understand, some hard to understand. I figured I'm going on a vacation in the Caribbean so Fine Casual ment nice button down shirt and dress shorts for dinner. However, there are 3 restaurants (Japanese,Mexican and French) which require Fine Casual nice shirt, pants and closed toe shoes for men. I did not bring pants or shoes (flip-flops only). But Dreams staff saved the day. There staff provided me with a pair of pants at no cost to use. With any trip especially outside the U.S. your going to find some differances and negitives. All-in-all, this was a trip we booked through Liberty Travel/Apple (MaryJane) and it was everything and more. The very few negitives were far outweighed by the positves. Also, if it is a trip for two, you'll meet some of the most interesting and friendly people from around the world. Met some great people from Bristol England, Toranto Canada, Iowa,Conn., Vermont, Calif., .........Great people. My wife and I get nothing out of this review except the satisfaction of perhaps putting other minds at rest before traveling. There is no PERFECT Resort and there is always going to be something one dislikes. If kept in mind you'll truely enjoy and Relax as we did.

<Content>Awesome Family Resort My wife and I took our 6 year old son to Dreams from April 5-11 and we had a fantastic vacation. We have traveled the world and stayed in everything from the Ritz down to Hampton Inn's and Dreams is a great place to go. Anyone that wrote a bad review must have a negative attitude or never have left the U.S. * Drive from the airport: We booked our trip through Costco Travel which saved us several hundred dollars and included transfers to and from the airport in an airconditioned van. Although the roads did have pot holes, it was a straight drive and the roads were not hilly windy. It took right at an hour as expected so no surprises on that front.* Kid Club:Our 6 year old son LOVED the Kids Club. The staff was top notch and they listed the activities for each day so you could make sure your child was there for the things they really wanted to do. They give the parents a cell phone and call you when your child wants to leave. They had activities in the Kid Club area as well as on the beach. They would even take the kids to lunch and dinner if they wanted to go which allowed the parents a meal to themselves which was nice. Marylyn was in charge of the Kid Club during our staff and we couldn't of asked for more.* Restaurants:We are not buffet people but were pleasantly surprised at this one. It was huge so never a wait and always a seat (inside or out). For breakfast the staff walks around serving coffee at your table and they have fresh squeezed fruit juice at the buffet. They also make fresh smoothies where you pick out the fruit. They basically had any and everything you could want for breakfast and we ate there every day for that meal. The sit down restaurants were all good and the only thing we heard was bad were the ribs. We mostly had seafood but the beef at the French restaurant (adults only) was good as well. We did not have a bad meal. As far as the bars go, the best one is in the lobby because it is the least crowded and tends to be a little bit more upscale than the rest. At the sit down restaurants they offer you a wine menu for wine with an extra charge but you can get the house for free. It's not the best but was good enough.* Tipping:I was amazed at how few people would tip, even a dollar. I heard that the maids salary is $8 a day and most of the restaurant staff make $10-$15 a day and they work from 8am-10pm for 11 days straight then get 4 days off. You can imagine how happy they are for even a dollar. We tipped $1 for breakfast and $2 for lunch and dinner and were loved for it. For the maids we left $2 a day. I rarely tipped at the bars because no one else did and you got the same drinks and service either way.* Rooms:We had a standard room with 2 queen beds in building two. It was not over looking the pool and it was just fine for us. I would not recommend paying the upcharge to have a room on the pool side because the non-pool side rooms are only an extra 10 ft. away. The room was not huge but was nice for a standard room and worked for the 3 of us. We had a great time and will return again in a year or two.

<Content>We had a great time. Overall, we rate this resort 3.5 out of 5 stars. Things we really liked: the beach, the pool, the buffet (World Caf茅), the daily lunch barbeque on the beach, the daily competitions (e.g., ping pong, darts, bocce ball, etc), the wide range of kids/adults at the resort. Things we really didn't like: the distance of the resort from the airport (at least 1 hour bus drive), entertainment team shows at night, the food at the restaurants other than Himitsu and World Caf茅 Buffet.As you can see, there are things we liked and things we didn't. Nothing was so bad that I wouldn't recommend this resort to my friends.Room Pointers: There are 9 guest buildings at the resort. See map here: www.dreamsresorts.com/drepc/resort-map.html Buildings 1 through 5 are on the north side of the pool and buildings 6-9 on the other. Building 1 is closes to the beach, followed by 2, 3, 4, 5. On the south side of the resort, building 6 is closest to the beach, followed by 7, 8, and 9. The room numbers are a 4 digit sequence (e.g., 1111 or 2311). The first number is the building. The second number is the floor, and the last 2 are the room number. We were initially put in room 9108 (building 9, floor 1, room 08) and it was aweful. It was far from the beach and actually had a door leading to the adjacent room. We walked in and could hear every word the people were saying in the next room - no joke, clear as if they were in our room. So I went back and requested a different room. The front desk attendant asked me if I wanted to upgrade for more money. I was firm and polite, saying I didn't want to upgrade, I just wanted a room that offered some privacy. Without much trouble, maybe 15 minutes, we were put into room 1111 (building 1, floor 1, room 11). That is the BEST room!!!! I'm not even kidding - we were right next to the beach, the main pool, the swim-up bar, and our back patio was half facing the beach. For the price, we got a screaming deal. Although, the room was very small. It was just me and my wife so it was fine for us. Some people may find it annoying to be so close to the beach and so far away from the main lobby and World Caf茅 restaurant, but we thought it was the best. Walking a bit to get to the buffet was enjoyable for us. My room recommendation: Building 1 or 2. Call ahead of time and request it. Other Pointers/Thoughts: Excursions: We did 2 excursions: the Marinarium (a.k.a. Caribbean Festival) (paid $88 each/$176 total for both of us) and the 4-wheeler tour offered at the beach on the resort (paid $80 for 1 ATV for us to share). Of the 2 excursions we did, we enjoyed the 4-wheeler tour better. Riding the ATV up into a local town to see the people was such a great experience. It may sound boring, but it offers a glimpse of the real Dominican Republic and is a great culture experience, not to mention the great scenery. The Marinarium excursion requires a 45 minute bus drive to another beach. You then board a large catamaran with about 50 other people and cruise down the beautiful coast in blue waters and enjoy music and dancing. Snorkeling is mediocre, but fun. Then you get to swim with the rays and sharks at the enclosed cage out in the ocean. In actuality, the people are all in life jackets (required) so you just float on top and look down below you about 7 feet at the sharks and rays swimming on the bottom of the cage. You aren't really close to the animals. My only other snorkeling experience was in Riviera Maya, Mexico at Xel-ha ([--]) and the snorkeling there was far far far better than what I experienced on the Marinarium excursion.Seats at the Pool:I read on tripadvisor prior to leaving that getting a good spot at the pool was a nightmare. Our experience was not so. We woke up every day at 7:30, walked out of our room and had basically every chair to choose from. The trick is to get there by about 7:30 or 8:00, sit in the chairs and relax until about 9. Put your towels on the chairs, your books, etc. Then by about 9 you can just get up come and go as you please all day and nobody touches your things. That was our experience anyway. Sure, if you sleep in until 9, then go straight over to eat breakfast and then get to the pool at 10 to find a spot, you will be left with nowhere to sit. Just get up early and enjoy the beautiful Dominican Republic morning - absolutely awesome, serene, quiet, and relaxing. Remember: you can sleep at home!!!! Wake your lazy butt up and get a great spot for the day :)Entertainment Team:The entertainment teams works their butts off for 16 hours a day, but I thought their entertaiment was borderline annoying. I did like the competitions they offered throughout the day, as I mentioned above, but at night they would put on shows that were, in my opinion, boring and monotonous. They would do the same dance over and over every day, with the same music. And the guys on the team would just say things like wow, wow, wow! over and over. Then they would kiss some of the the girl guests on the cheek and then start saying wow, wow, wow over and over again. Just a bit boring in my opinion. The funny thing is on one night they had a live band playing as sort of an opener to the entertaiment team show, but the live band was awesome!!! Why in the hell did they stop that great live band only to stand up there and do that lame dance again?!!!!! They tried to do different things, like they offered spanish lessons for 30 minutes on a couple of days, but i went and I spent nearly the entire 30 minutes learning to count to ten in spanish. They should teach you how to ask for change and other useful things for travelers. Who, honestly, wants to waste 30 minutes counting to ten? Key Thoughts: We got our room for 6 nights for approx. $1400 USD through cheapcaribbean.com. Stay in buildings 1 or 2 if possible. Eat lunch on the beach at the daily cookout (burgers and dogs, with fruit). Go on the ATV excursion. Get up early (7:30-8:00) and stake out a great location - my recommendation is near the swim-up bar. . . it's near the beach, pool, great bar, and daily activities in that end of the pool, etc.Any questions - email me at greg.gunn@gmail.com. I'd be happy to talk with you about the resort. As a side note: I went to Dreams Tulum, Mexico 2 years ago and LOVED it there. I would recommend Dreams Tulum also.

<Content>It Is What It Is. No time to look for all the negitive. I'm sure in time this resort will be equal to other dreams resorts. This resort is still in the transition of updating to Dreams style resorts. Much needs fresh paint,and rooms could use some upgrades,but try to relax till this happens. For the money I guess its a fair deal,considering the premium drinks served at many locations,food abundant but just middle of the road. Nothing to really speak highly of. I don't mean to offend anyone elses take on this resort,this is just my opinion. friendly,and eager to help staff. All in all just go enjoy and dont worry abot the small stuffremember your on vacation, No time to get the blood pressure up over something we have no control over. Dreams rates at 85% out of 100 in my book. Im sure most of you that go here will enjoy this resort a great deal. Pool is nice but a bit to shallow.But great for chick watching. Kids were out of the way tucked away somewhere int he resort not in the adults way. Casino is bad,they cant even count so be careful.

<Content>Excellent tropical trip Dreams is a stunning resort, with beautiful landscaping, accommodating staff, lovely rooms and generally good food. My husband, our 2 adult children and I enjoyed everything about the resort. The beach is also spectacular, and yes it does have rocky areas in the water but if you walked a little to the left of the resort you could play/swim in the ocean safely. The free form pool is amazing and you can access it from each building quite easily. There was some minor construction going on while we were there but it never bothered us in any way. The new owners are going to great pains in making this resort wonderful with added landscaping, walkways and coverings over the walkways. The food at the World Cafe (buffet style) was incredible with the hundreds of choices it offered. The French and Seaside Grill restaurants were excellent. The only warning I have is that the food at Himatsu and El Patio were very salty and it all tasted the same. Overall this was an awesome vacation spot and we would recommend it to everyone!!

<Content>Loved Dreams My husband and I and our daughter and family were at Dreams in March. We absolutely loved it. Check in was efficient and the desk people very accomodating and friendly. Our room was spotless, we had more towels than we could use, every evening the maid would check to see if we needed more. The food was good, not terrific, but good, and the French restaurant was excellent. We found the resort very clean, the bathrooms by the beach were always very clean and that is hard to maintain. The staff were extremely friendly. They had the best aquasize classes i have ever had at a resort. The pool was wonderful, the best feature of the resort. I would say that the only thing at the resort which was not as good as the Bavarro side was the ocean, it was quite rough, and there was a lot of coral in the sand, Actually, they had to close the beach down at the end of our time there. I would highly recommend this resort for families with children, and older travellers, actually anyone

<Content>Good Resort, Couple of things to Note Just getting back from Dreams. I read many reviews on Trip Advisor before going to Dreams so I thought I should give my 2 cents for those doing the same. We were 2 couples down there for one week.The road from the airport does have a lot of potholes, turns, etc but it didn't bother us as we were all too excited to see how the locals live. They seem to be building a new highway to fix this problem though so in a year or 2 that would be an issue.Arrival was met with champagne and a warm welcome. Quickly we got our rooms. Going into our room we originally had 2 beds and we wanted one king. Our friends had the same and their roomed smelled of smoke. Surprisingly, the bellhop who was delivering our luggage called the front desk from one of the rooms and we quickly got them changed so no big deal. He brought us there to make sure they were fine. The new rooms were much better, no smell, and with a king size bed. The resort has without a doubt the best pool that we have seen. The beach was very nice as well. We were on the beach the first day but the rest of the time the wind was too high so we stayed at the pool which was no problem because it was so beautiful. We stayed closer to the swim up bar side of the pool as there were much more activities going on down there.For the towel game that so many reviewers mentioned before me, well that game is over (Thank god). The resort has instilled a new rule, no unaccompanied towels before 9 a.m. Beach bags are not a person so if you leave it, it will be removed with the towels and brought back to the towel hut. People still did it though which is funny considering we each got a notice when we checked in and there are signs everywhere. Most people don't like to get up a 7 so 9 a.m. is much better. We would go grab our towels around 8:45, find a good spot, wait until 9, and then head for breakfast. Although there were many spots still available even after 9 most days as the pool is so large.Entertainment (if you read anyone before me) was the best I have seen. All day long there is plenty to do, even on the rainy days. The staff try to involve people all day long in fun and easy programs. The shows are night were good. Some were really funny, some were just dancing. We stayed for some, some we watched for a while then hit the disco which was always a blast. The entertainers all hit the disco at 10:30 and they get people dancing. They disappear at the stroke of midnight as they start very early again the next morning but they got so many people dancing by then, the party just continues. Michael Jackson really puts off a great dance show (ask for Beat It, you will love it). The entertainment staff and the servers/waiters are the best I've seen as I mentioned.The food was very good except we each came down with a little bit of an upset stomach but we have been to many resorts (5 before this one in places like Cuba, Jamaica, Mexico) so we are used to a little upset, after all it is mostly new food to us. The French was our favorite but we did like them all, the Italian was only good, the rest were great. You can grab personal pizza's at the buffet and bring them back to the pool at lunch time which was awesome. The house wine you get with any supper is only marginally okay, if you want better wine, you will need to charge it to your room.We have 2 complaints about this place. Most rooms (maybe all) are rooms with a cheater door to another room (I guess for families when needed). That cheater door is very poorly insulated so you can hear everything that is happening in the next room. We had a noizy neighbour so we ended up having quick snoozes at the pool because of the not-so-good nights sleep the night before. The resort really needs to either remove most of those cheater doors or insulate them for sound. My advice is to bring ear plugs. Or if you are travelling with another couple, get your rooms right beside each other as you will probably be going to bed around the same time. 2nd complaint is Go Travel Direct gave us a optional tour orientation instead of telling us about the resort orientation. Orientations in my mind are to learn about where everything is at the resort and show us where the optional tour desk it. Go Travel direct changed that to nothing about the resort and only optional tour information. They talked for a long time on each optional excursion you wanted to do. If you wanted to know where the buffet is then you had to ask for it (which we all did as we arrived and did the orientation soon after). Not the end of the world but Go Travel Direct should pay attention to what other tour operators doing for a Resort Orientation, not a Tour Orientation.The swedish massage at the spa was ultra good. We did it on the one rainy day we had. Plus you get full access to all the spa facilities sauna, showers, baths, etc for 1 hour before your massage so it was really realaxing.The street vendors come in 3 times throughout the week and set up booths for booze, jewelry, etc. Don't be offended to offer then 1/4 of what they initially ask for as they start out way too high to get the unseasoned traveller to settle on 50%.Rooms are a little small but if you've even been to New York or Paris, the rooms are giants compared to either of those 2 places. The bathrooms are nice and clean. We had a couple of ants the first night, which disappeared with a little splash of water and never came back. Anyhow, outside the room noise complaint which was the only real issue we had, everything was what we expected and we would recommend anyone go there (with earplugs).

<Content>Great holiday, just what we needed. We stayed at Dreams for 14 days during March and, unlike some of the previous blink of an eye one, two or even six day based reviews, we feel that the following report has substance yielded from a decent duration at this hotel.Before going into our views of the hotel's facilities and standards, I would like to make a few acknowledgements to certain individuals that made our holiday such a great experience:Marilyn - head of the Explorers kids club, not only did she give my son days and days of great memories packed with fun and adventure but she kept a careful eye on him and all the other kids applying sun block etc, really caring for the youngsters, we couldn't get them out of the place.Luis - entertainment staff, exhausting just watching the amount of effort he put into his workload keeping everyone busy enjoying themselves, knew many guests by name, a difficult task with such a high turnover of patrons, but it made people feel special.Joseph, Mickey Mouse, and 50 cents - entertainment team, all doing a great job.Our review - Dreams is one of the most westerly of the Punta Cana hotels, therefore takes a little longer to get to, about an hour by coach. Road is bumpy but all part of the experience.The entrance and lobby of the hotel are refined and luxurious.Check-in was smooth, we were offered upgrades, but I had booked a deluxe room with garden view and was pleasantly surprised as we had a partial ocean view as well. The room was adequate in size for my wife, 8 year old son and me, all 'bells and whistles' as promised e.g tv, dvd, aircon, dab radio etc, everything you would need, no complaints. We have stayed in suites in other hotels in Punta Cana, however, how much time do you spend in your room? Every day we left a couple of dollars for the maid and were rewarded with a variety of towel sculptures each evening. Part of the deal is free room service, never waited more than 15 mins for this, food was hot and drinks chilled.The hotel free form pool is like a lagoon, huge and meandering around the grounds, imaculately clean. We were wary of the 'dawn rush' for sunbeds but this was amended by the management implementing a 9.00am minimum reservation time. Some people still tried to beat the system by sending one person out earlier, they would then have to sit there until 9 guarding the sunbeds, I found this amusing whilst walking down to the Oceana restaurant for breakfast.Always plenty going on during the day, a daily sheet was left with chocolates as part of the turn-down service each evening itemising the next days itineraries. Most people seemed to take part, however there were plenty of private areas were a book and a cocktail could be enjoyed whilst soaking up the sun. The beach infront of the hotel was well looked after each morning. There was a high tide for 3 days, and weather a little stormy, this had loosened sea vegitation which washed up. A team of staff spent solid days cleaning this up. The beach was closed off for a couple of days during this period for safety reasons, riptides.Every occasion to celebrate was taken advantage of, e.g St.Patrick's day, staff dressed in costumes, games and water balloons, but Easter was special, cleverly the entertainers had invited the kids down to the beach for a sand castle competition, at 11.00am, to everyones' amasement, Easter Bunny landed on the beach via helicopter, and the egg hunt began.We tried all the restaurants and thoroughly enjoyed the food in all of them. The staff work very hard and are always smiling and attentive.Evening entertainment was a joy. The shows were enthusiastic and colourful.Last but by no means least, if you've got kids beware, the kids club is so good you will hardly see them, they can come and go with your consent, but they just seem to have non-stop fun, by far the best club we've experienced.Summary - As you will have read, we had a great time and will return. This complex is thriving to improve daily, there are the occasional 'pecadillos', but it all adds up to a great experience. Well done to Yann and his operation.This is an honest report compiled by a very satisfied family, don't allow derogatory reports referring to this hotel to put you off from enjoying the same experience as we did. I have stayed in several of the finest 5 star hotels in Europe and U.S. This is a very fine example of a 4plus star hotel in a country with a struggling economy, this must be taken into account. You would have to go a long way to beat it.

<Content>Awesome Place for the Family My husband and I and our two daughters ages between 8-11 to Dreams in Punta Cana. We have been to all-inclusives in Mexico several times and this was absolutely one of the best experiences we have ever had. The staff was polite and courteous as well as their service being outstanding. The Explorer Club was fabulous. My girls wanted to go every day. They are tough customers about kids' camps at resorts, but they loved it and made some friends. The entertainment staff was amazing. They were friendly, respectful and really got involved with the guests in a very relaxed way. Every day at 3:00 pm they lined up at the side of the pool where the swim up bar is located and did a line dance to kick off the pool games which were a lot of fun. Some of the games the kids could even get inolved in, such as the water balloon throwing. It was a fabulous place. I HIGHLY recommend it. The place itself is clean and spectacular looking. Food was awesome too.

<Content>Multiple fabulous stays! When I read these reviews, I am a little confused! I can't believe that some of the reviewers stayed at the same hotel we visted. This March was our 9th or 10th visit to the DR, and our third stay at this hotel. Every visit has been fantastic! The staff cannot do enough for you, and they are very proud of their English which they have worked to improve over the years. Many of them, suprisingly, given the number of people they see, remembered us from previous visits and the registration staff have even greeted us with Welcome home! The food is at least equal to, if not superior to most of the other hotels where we have stayed ( and there have been many) - there is something for everyone - the variety and quality is excellent! Is everything like what we have at home? No - but if I wanted everything to be like home, I would stay home. The one thing I do agree with is that there is hoarding of the pool floats, and there were parents who even allowed their children to take 3 or 4 floats so they could stand up on them, or jump onto them. We asked once if we could have one, and the parent told us to go find another one. But that couldn't ruin the great vacation! Our room was very quiet and clean. Every day, we came back from the beach to find our bed decorated with flowers or animals made from towels. These people work very hard, and a kind word goes a long way. Any noise that we heard was from some of the guests, not from the staff. I remember a stay at another hotel where the cleaning staff would yell to one another in the hallway at 7:00 am. I never once heard a cart rolling or heard the staff in the hallways here. As to the beach, we walked several hours each day, and the beach was beautiful! The staff work very hard to keep everything clean for the guests, and they are constantly going around cleaning up the drink glasses and bottles left around by some of the guests. As to the sea grasses that washed up on the shore - how could anyone blame the hotel for that? There was inclement weather and rough seas, so it washed up. I saw the staff out there most of two days with huge trashcans and rakes trying to stay on top of it and clean it up as it washed ashore. We were there over spring break and Easter - the staff really tried to make Easter special for the children with the parade/show and with the Easter Bunny arriving on the Beach by helicopter. By the way, we did not have children with us, but we thoroughly enjoyed watching the Explorer's Club Team interacting with the children. The children appeared to respect and enjoy the staff, and seemed to really be having a ball! The activities group worked endlessly to keep people engaged - do they ever rest? We travel a lot, and our vacation to Dreams, Punta Cana is the one we always look forward to; we come home relaxed, rejuventated, and anxious for our next trip there! We love it, and already have our next vacation planned. We have referred many people there, and every single one of them has come back to tell us how pleased they were with everything! Kudos to the managers and staff at Dreams!!

<Content>Not what we expected I must say my wife and I were very disappointed with this resort. We have been to Punta Cana seven times and this resort was not what we expected. Upon arrival the lobby looks nice, but that is the extent of it. The rooms are absolutely tiny. There is not even enough room for two people to walk around in the room comfortably. The food and the service is subpar at best. The beach looks nice in the pictures, but let me assure you that it is not nice at all. It is very dirty and you need to go to the left near the frog trampoline to be able to go into the water. We transfered to the Majestic Colonial with the other four couples that we traveled with. I must say that all ten of us came to the same conclusion regarding Dreams. TNT Vacations was very accomadating and moved us from Dreams to the Majestic Colonial within an hours time and the Majestic welcomed us with open arms. Thank You TNT Vacations for your quick response to rectify a bad situation.I cannot recommend Dreams to anyone.

<Content>Fabulous Our first time at Dreams. From the moment we arrived our vacation started. Coctails were given to us as we checked in. We did upgrade to the Large Suite, we had a large bedroom, livingroom, hudge balcany with a hot tub overlooking the pool  ocean. Wonderful. The staff was magnificant - always eager to please even to the extent of serving in your room. Getting into the restaurants was not a problem at all. When you treat people good, they inturn do the same. The POOL - one of the largest, you could float all day, if you choose (we did bring our own floats), plenty of games in the pool  beach if you want to play (the games where near the swim up bar) therefore the rest of the pool was very quiet. Something for everyone. Lovely beach with plenty of palm trees for shade. Entertainment for all! Some shows envolved the audiance  others were extremely professional. Casino for those risky enough to play. Food available all day - even pizza at 2:00 in the morning. Magnificant SPA - which everyone must try. There's so much to do you never have to leave. The vacationers were extremely friendly, The best time!!! Oh, there destination wedding are great. The first vacation I did not want to end. Our favorite staff member is MICKEY MOUSE - he's the best!

<Content>I would not recommend this resort to my friends Rooms: They gave me a room with two double beds when we asked for a King bed. It took them so long to move us to another room. For some days, they didn't clean our room so we were out of towels. We had to call them numerous times to have our room cleaned. Bed  pillows weren't that comfortable. Furnitures looked old, cheap and dirty. Not worth what we paid for.Food: Horrible. I've been to many cruises and all-inclusives. This one is the hands down worst. Too many flies flying around in the restaurant and on your table and food.Beach: Okay but too rocky. Nobody got into the ocean b/c it was too rocky and dangerous. Seeweeds everywherePoolside: Good and relaxing. We stayed most of our times here.Bars: They don't know how to make cocktails. But services were good.Casino: Most horrible experience we had during any vacations in our lives. Nobody spoke English at the casino. All the dealers seemed mad or upset at something. They spoke Spanich among themselves constantly (speaking ill of the guests). The casino manager would not say anything to that. They all need to be fired if they want to keep this resort open. On our 4th night, every guests in casino left at once b/c the casino employees were so rude and everybody got so angry. We almost got into a fist fight. This should not be happening at a vacation resort.I would never ever come back to this resort or any other dreams resort nor recommend this hotel chain to any of my friends.

<Content>What a shock!! What can i say..Very disapointed. My wife and i have traveled to Punta Cana many times and this resort was by far the bottom of the barrel. My wife and i Changed rooms 3 times on the first day. The first room was very dirty and the phone in the room was not working. The rooms were very small and similar to the rooms you would find at a motel 6. There were ants in the rooms and the last room we stayed in had cigarette burns in the sheets, how gross. I wont even get into how bad the food was because you dont really go on this type of trip for the food. Thank god TNT prides themselves on service because they got us out of that place and into the Majestic the next day. What a life saver. Please do not waste your time and go to this resort because you will be so disapointed it isnt even funny.

<Content>Very Disappointed Sorry to disappoint you, but, we went to Dreams starting March 23, 2008 and left on the 24th. This hotel was terrible. The rooms were extremely small, ants and other crawly things in the rooms. The locks on the doors were not working. We didn't even have a chance to try to enjoy this hotel. I think we were sold on the newness, and upgraded amenities that were supposed to be there. As we walked down the walkways, we were sprayed by the sprinklers. We were a group of 10, thank you to TNT for sticking with their promise to keep their customers happy. We called them, and they moved us out in exactly 1 hour to the Majestic Colonial. We know how hard we work to pay for a vacation, and to be that discouraged from arrival on is just not worth it. Sorry, but this was our short story.

<Content>Dream come true Not sure if we were at the same resort as some of these other poeple on here because we didn't find any of these problems. We were getting a little worried about going after reading some reviews, but we were not disappointed. It is the first time we have brought our daughter who is two and a half on holidays and we were a little worried about entertaining her for a week but there was no problems at all.The ride from the airport is not as bad as I've read or expected. Sure the roads aren't great and they drive a little crazy, but your in a third world country and I felt safer then riding in a cab in Mexico. Upon check in we were greeted with cool clothes, cocktails(punch for my daughter and pregnant self) and warm chocolate chip cookies. Our check in was fast and our bags were at our room right behind us. The rooms were a bit small but except to shower, change and sleep who spends time in the rooms anyways. The beach was closed down due to rip tides, but that's hardly the hotels fault. The water right in front was not the nicest to swim in but if you took a quick walk to the left by the floating trampoline the beach and water are beautiful. There is also hardly anyone over there so it's like a beach to yourself.The chairs at the pool is a little crazy, but we never had a problem on any day to get a chair when we went over after a morning at the beach. As people would leave they would give us there chairs or the workers would find empty ones and bring them over without being asked to. As for tipping and waiting in line. We did tip but never felt the need to and always had the same service as when we didn't tip. Also as far as waiting for drinks that never happened. If I could get served that fast at home I would be very happy. As far as I could see all of the liquors were top self and not stingy either. If my husband says a drink is stong then it is. Also they carried Bud Light which made all the men happy.We have been to quite a few all inclusives and this is the first time I can say I don't think I had a bad meal. I appriciated them having a kids section at the buffet for breakfast and dinner. There pizzas were alos great. We ate at the Mexican, Japanese and the Seaside grill and all were very good. The seaside grill had very good steak. BBQ on the beach was good and having fresh fruit by the pool was great with little kids who would need snacks. Also NO ONE GOT SICK!! As I previously read we were a little worried as two of our group had previously been to Dominican and got very sick, but not here.A would recommend hiring the hotel photographer to take some family pics, we did and they turned out so amazing. As far as I'm concerned this hotel was great and I can't wait to go back. I would also like to say that we very much enjoyed their Easter activities. The Easter bunny flew in via helicopter and landed on the beach. She then took all the kids up the resort for and easter egg hunt. My daughter loved it.

<Content>Absolutely beautiful and the people amazing Please disregard any negative reviews. Their are always people who just can't have fun and have to criticize. If you love it so much at home then you should just stay there. Here it is: just got back from Dreams Punta Cana and had a truly wonderful time. Most amazing pool ever. My 4 and 9 year old swam the whole day everyday and loved it. They also loved the Explorers Club where they got to hang out with kids their own age and participate in organized activities. The staff were all very friendly and loved their jobs. They all spoke enough English to communicate with, no problem. The grounds were beautiful as was the hotel itself. The rooms were modest but clean and comfortable. You don't go to Punta Cana for the rooms. The food was very good especially breakfast and lunch. Dinner was o.k. The bars were all well stocked with name brand alcohol and their were at least 10 different kinds of fun and fruity drinks which were made with or without alcohol which was great for the kids. Both my kids loved the sports area where they had 3 pool tables, 2 ping pong tables, several fousball tables, air hockey, WI system, giant chess board, archery, rifle shooting, basketball court, ... and TV's set to American sport networks. The entertainment staff was tons of fun, organizing dart tournaments, crouquet competitions, mini putt games, water balloon fights, volleyball...etc. Luis was the best he kept everyone happy and entertained. Great guy. The bottom line is that If you can't have a good time here then their is something seriously wrong with you.

<Content>Can't wait to go again!!! Just returned from DPC and are ready to book for next year.The ride from the airport is a bit hair raising, but the time goes quickly as you see beautiful landscape with banana and mango trees, which our children (age 12 and 10) had never seen before.Upon arrival we were handed cool towels and champagne (fresh juice for the kids). It took a while to get our luggage into our room. Next time we will pack our bathing suits in our carry on bags.We were glad we booked the family deluxe rooms, (2 rooms). The rooms are small, this made it much more comfortable for all of us. Our room was always clean and mini bar stocked fully.Met with Shannen at VIP travel. She is extreemly helpful with resort tips, excursions to take and not to take. For example: on the resort there are guys trying to sell you horseback riding. I heard this is a rip off, the horses are thin and rode all day long.There is another horseback riding excursion, which we did, about 10 minutes off site. This was fabulous. We also went on the Caribbean Festival excursion. We swam with sharks and sting rays, then experienced a coral reef with the most beautiful fish. Prices were reasonable on both trips.The pool is awesome. We participated in many pool games. Hubby and kids played water polo everyday. The only pitfall with the pool is getting chairs. Be there by 8:00am and stay there until 9:00 or they will take your things. After 9:00 your safe for the day.Even though it was hard getting up at this hour, we did meet a lot of nice people within that time (hi Bruce, Sue and Ryan - lost your e-mail, still looking). Lastly, the employees are exceptional. There were a few that really made our trip memorable. Odalis (World Cafe) always greeted us with a smile and helped us when we had to leave, to catch a flight, before the restaurant opened. She put together a terrific lunch for us. (Odalis- this is the lady with the sore bootie after riding the horse). Another all star employee is Mickey Mouse. This guy is a great entertainer, water polo player, dancer ..... and always willing to help no matter what the situation is, he has a positive attitude 24/7. Mickey, hope the ankle is better.Dreams, keep up the good work, see you next year!

<Content>We all loved it Our family spent five nights at Dreams (March 20-25) and really loved it. It exceeded our expectations. We were treated to wonderful weather, terrific hospitality, and comfort and a festive feel throughout. We would have loved a few more days at Dreams.Our family suite of two adjoining rooms was perfect for a family traveling with two children. Our room was updated and spotless. We spent our days moving between the fabulous pool and beach, and were able to find seats at both. The ocean was closed for a few days for what was said to be unusually rough conditions. I loved the stretch and aerobics classes on the beach, as well as the afternoon step aerobics class on the deck (get there early if you want to get a step and don't forget your exercise shoes). My kids loved the batting cage, soccer goals, games and activities along the beach, and enjoyed the paella making contest! They loved collecting the resort money every time they participated in an activity, but were disappointed with how difficult it was to spend the money at the evening auctions. I think it would make more sense for the resort to offer less combination packages of prizes and more individual prizes that were kid friendly (less rum!!) so that people could actually spend the resort money.As for the food, we especially enjoyed breakfast in the World Cafe. The fresh-squeezed juices and smoothie bar are to die for! The kids figured out that they could get little pizzas to go at lunch time, and brought them out to the pool. The Seaside Grill also let you do take out if you don't want to eat your lunch in the lovely open-air restaurant just right by the pool. I didn't find the dinners at the specialty restaurants to be as good, but they were still fun. It was somewhat competitive to eat at the Japanese restaurant, but it seems like they are trying to get a better system in place. The Mexican restaurant often has strolling musicians which is fun. The only complaint I had is that there is no brewed decaf coffee anywhere in the resort, just Nescafe crystals (yuck!)My kids loved the entertainment staff. They were so much fun and always smiling. The music at the dance classes was great. The staff definitely adds so much to the festive feel of the place.Contrary to other reports, we didn't find there to be any lines of any significance at the bars and had no trouble with coral in the water (it was completely smooth). The only other tip I would give is to bring conditioner. The hotel doesn't supply it.Enjoy your trip. You will love it.

<Content>It was a "Dream Come True" I can't not say enough about this trip. We had a group of 11. All of us said we can not figure out what all the Donna Downers that write in and say they that they didn't like the Dreams. We were there from March 23-29. Our biggest disapointment was when we had to board the bus to leave.I just read some of the postings and can not figure out what resort these people were at!!We had a very early day of travel on Easter Sunday. The ride from the airport is interesting and is bumpy. So what! When we arrived about 3:00 pm we were handed cool clothes to refresh. The staff at the counter were very nice. We were told our room were not ready yet and we shoud have some lunch. We did. We walked down to the Seaside for lunch. After lunch we walked back and registered. Our bags were already in our rooms.Monday we had a meeting with our VIP travel person Sharon. She explained the the resort. She told us about the beach and you should swim to the left in the area marked. If you didn't you could find rocks. Well, I did! I was knocked down by a wave and hit a rock and broke my toe! Not the resorts fault! They didn't put the rocks there! It did not spoil my stay!I have read that the help wasn't friendly. Again what resort where you at? We could not be happier than with all the staff. All very freindly and helpful and all had smiles. We did tip, but not one of the staff acted like we needed to.Wilson at the pool bar is great. As is 50 Cent and all the rest.We had great meals at all the restaurants. There was something for everone. We did enjoy Himitsu restaurant dinner the best. It was our daughters 16th birthday and they made it very special with a cake and song. She loved it. We did have a wait for dinner. Here is a tip. Put in your name. Go down to the World Cafe and order a few small pizzas for a snack and order some drinks and sit on the balcony out side the restaurant and enjoy the evening with friends. What's the hurray? Your on vacation!The drinks were the best. Always trying something new. Could always find a name beer at the main bar in the lobby. But why drink name beer when you are on vacation? Stay home for that!Finding chairs was not a problem. We spent our time at the beach. You can sit by a pool anytime. The pool is great! If we needed more chairs we asked the staff and they brought us more. Everyday the staff raked the beach. It was very clean. A wonderful breeze everday.We met and talked to alot of people form all over the world and all said they could not say a bad thing about the Dreams.We did take a day trip to Saona Island. Well worth the money. It is an all day trip. You should check it out. We met alot of people from other resorts and it sounded like the Dreams was the best resort to stay at.We are already planning next years trip to Dreams.The Ocean's 11 Group.

<Author>GreatExpectations01
<Content>Everything You Wanted to Know (almost) But Were Afraid to Ask Just 10 short days ago, we were nervously anticipating our long-planned trip to Dreams Punta Cana. It was a spring-break trip so we booked it last October. That left us a lot of time to read TripAdvisor reviews and worry about some of the things we heard. I'll start out by saying don't be afraid of what you have read. In balance, this is an above-average resort for Punta Cana, and there is plenty of opportunity for a fun  relaxing vacation. Its not perfect, but I think you could expect to pay a lot more for perfect. Here are the details of what you can expect. First, arrival at the airport. Having been to Punta Cana before, we were ready for the gauntlet of porters and other people who hit you in waves you when you arrive. Expect to exit the plane via stairs, then be shepherded from the tarmac to a queue to get your picture taken. A lovely young lady in a colorful outfit will pose with you and your travel group. This is an officially sanctioned thing, and they have access to your reservation, so the pictures will be available to buy when you leave. They are $8. Important note: go to the bathroom on the plane before you arrive! Especially if you are female! The bathrooms are just before baggage claim and they are small and over-utilized. In three visits to Punta Cana - the ladies line is always out the door. The mens room had no hand towels, but there was an attendant there to unroll and hand you a ball of toilet paper. (now that's class!) The next gauntlet is the baggage carousel. Depending on how many flights are coming in, there will be a cadre of porters looking to carry your bags for you. They can be very aggressive and will reach out and take the suitcase right out of your hand. Several firm no's will chase them away if you don't want this attention.  The next challenge is when you pass through the customs area. People looking to sell you a ride will be yelling for your attention. We needed to exit customs, and take a right to get to the small hall with desks set up for the different ride companies. We had reserved our trip with Travelocity, and their partner was Prieto tours. They had a desk, but importantly a big cushy tour bus. Some of the other ride companies had small minibuses or vans. I've also read about people taking taxis. For the long ride to Dreams, I think the big tour bus was the way to go. The ride to the resort really drives home the fact that this is a third-world country. For some people who have lead sheltered existences, it will seem that this is unbelievable poverty. Realistially, from the bus you will see fields and houses and small towns. Some of the houses are cinderblock with tin roofs. There was at least one gated-community with stucco townhouses and red-tile roofs. There is apparently a new road under construction, but it looks like they are on the 10 year plan. The road gets progressively more pot-holed as the end of your ride. The drive of our motorcoach managed to swerve around the big potholes and the soft suspension cushioned the others. If you are prone to motion-sickness, sit up front where you can see and it should be fine. My daughter has frequently gotten ill on car rides, and we put her in the front seat and she was fine. After the interminable ride we arrived and discharged passengers at a resort called Grand Bahia Principe, then ten minutes later arrived at Dreams. Maybe they should have dropped us off first, since the other resort looked nicer! In any case, there is a suitably grand entrance at Dreams. The benefit of taking an arranged ride like we did is that the lobby staff was expecting us. There were cold towels, champagne and fresh-baked chocolate chip cookies waiting. During the week, we saw another group that was greeted by musicians and dancers. The friends we were meeting there got none of this, they just walked in. Go figure! (Note to Dreams management: you might want to figure out how to have a more consistent welcome process - you could have the guard at the security gate sound the alarm or something like that!) The check-in process was not as smooth as it could have been. I travel a lot - all over the world - and most places have gone paperless. I never show up in a major city with an itinerary printout. The desk staff was flustered by the fact that I did not have one! I told them if they had a PC with access to the internet I would be glad to print one for them! Two minutes later they found the reservation, and within 5 minutes we had keys, a map, etc.  Now, having read many of these Trip-Advisor reviews, we were tipped-off that we shouldn't send our bags to the room straight-off. We went and checked out the room first. Its a good thing we did since the rooms were not what we expected. We are a family of 5, with three kids in the range from10 to 12. My wife had corresponded with Dreams management via email, in advance, and requested adjoining rooms. What she meant is that we wanted two rooms next to each other, that had a door that opens between them. In the world of Dreams, these are connecting rooms. What we had were adjoining rooms which just means that they are next to each other. Shame on us for missing this fine point, as we are not in the hotel business. But hold it, Dreams is! They should have clarified this when we made our request. To confound things even more, each of the rooms had only one bed. Even worse, one of the rooms smelled like a smoking lounge. A side-note on the smoking thing: major hotel chains like Marriott have figured out that in this day and age, you really have to prevent smoking in non-smoking rooms. This means signs on the door, in the room, and a threatened fine if the patron violates the rules. Once a room has been smoked in, it takes some effort to clear out the smell.  When we went back to the desk, the answers were: the hotel is full, we have no more connecting rooms. They would be glad to send someone in to the stinky room with some air freshener, and here is the definition of adjoining again. When we persisted, we reached the following arrangment: They would give us two other rooms separated with only one room in-between. We would end-up with the right number of beds, and if we came back the next day after 2pm they would get us connecting rooms. This sounded like a good solution, and we went with it.  Now for those of you who have been keeping track of all of the reviews, our first two rooms were building 4, our second two were building four. Our final adjoining  connecting rooms in building 5 were fine, no smells, clean and functional. They were garden view with a view of building 3. From the reviews, we learned that there is a gradually remodeling going on and that some rooms were upgraded and some weren't. Our friends were in building 7 and my wife saw their rooms and said they looked upgraded, and that none of ours were. I think the differences are very subtle and I couldn't tell the difference. The bathroom fixtures are the same, and the decor seems to be about the same. Our one night rooms were ok, one had a slight odor of bug-spray and had a few ants (like 3, no big deal). The other was fine. The ant room was a connecting room and there were noisy people in there. Unlike most places, were there is a double-door on connecting rooms, there is only a single hollow-core door between connecting rooms. This has the same noise-dampening effect as tissue paper. If the noise-makers on the other side are your kids, no problem. Otherwise...well you can put up with it for a night.  (Note to Dreams management: In the end our family slept in 4 rooms. Out of those, there was only one working TV remote control. The batteries were probably just dead - but this is one of those things that the cleaning staff can check pretty easily. Same goes for telephones - if there is so much static you can't hear the person on the other end - its time to change out the cord.) Its important to note that the cleaning staff is fantastic. These ladies really do a nice job with what they have to work with. They are one of the things that keep this a 4 star hotel and prevent it from slipping to 3. They scrub the rooms twice a day. They make towel sculptures, they refill the fridges with drinks, and they leave you little chocolates at night. In short, they work their butts off and do a really nice job.  Here's the scoop on the restaurants. The primary restaurant is the World Cafe. Its buffet-style, with servers who will bring your drinks. As you've read, no tipping is neccessary. But $2 when you plave your order can help keep the wine-glasses full. The staff is authentically friendly, and they try really hard. There will be some translation issues, and inexperience issues, but generally high scores for the restaurant staff. The restaurant upstairs (near the check-in desk) is the Japanese / Chinese restaurant. We tried the Japanese one, and it is kind of what you end up with if you knew someone, who knew someone, who knew someone who had once been to Benihana and tried to recreate it. Still it was fun and the staff was nice. Watchouts: No reevervations are taken, you have to show-up when they open at 6:30 and put your name in. There are only two hibachi rooms and they each seat 12 people. Also, they will present the wine list here, with prices into the 3 digits. You can just have unlimited house wine for free if you ask. Because of the language barrier, it is very tough to make accommodations for kids who won't eat everything that's served, and there is no kids menu here. At the end, we had too much food at the Japanese place, and a lot went to waste.  There are 7 restaurants alltogether, in two clusters that share some infrastructure like restrooms. The one in the front building includes the Japanese/Chinese upstairs, and the Mexican/World Cafe/Italian downstairs. The Mexican has its own entrance, but is adjacent to the World Cafe (separated by a wall with french doors). We tried the Mexican one night. They had a Mariachi band going from table to table playing requests. The food was OK (a theme), but at the Mexican restaurant the portions were comically small - especially for the kids dishes. The good news is that you could just pop in to the World Cafe afterwards for cheese and fruit. We never tried the Italian, but the kids just walked over there and got pizza when we had dinner at the World Cafe. There is nothing separating the two. Is it really a separate restaurant?? Or just a different station in the buffett? I'm not sure. The rear restaurant cluster is beachside. There is Oceana on the first floor right next to the beach. This is a seafood restaurant. Adjacent to Oceana, with a separate entrance is their caricature of a steak house. Upstairs is the elite, adults only, Bordeaux. First Oceana. Food is OK. High point is the flaming after-dinner drinks. These guys are pyros, but is was fun. The steakhouse menu had steak, ribs and surf and turf. I was really hungry so I ordered the latter. There was a salad bar, with just a few items on it (basically lettuce and tomato). When dinner came I found that the ST consisted of two half-size skewers (each about double the size of a toothpick. There were two one-inch cubes of steak on each toothpick, and one piece of fish. Nice appetizer, but where was dinner?!? Another trip back to the World Cafe was needed. The best of the restaurants is Bordeaux. First there is a big bar, with plenty of room, and a great bartender - Fernando. Remember to go up there to take some pictures. Just like everywhere else, they don't take reservations, but the key is to wait in the bar upstairs.  The Dreams definition of a French restaurant is clearly dim lighting. But the food is good. There was a mix-up on our order (they must of swapped us with someone else), but they fixed it quickly. The manager Melvin was really good. The swimming pool rocks. Is it the biggest swimming pool in the free world? Maybe not, but it is definitely the signature feature of the whole place. It is well maintained, clean, and the chlorine balance seems to be fine. There is a bar at mid-pool, waitress service, and the party is always happening at the swim-up beachside bar. The beach is just as you have read. Its a great place to cocoon under a palapa, and read a book while a waitress brings you hourly pina coladas. Every review comments about the fact that you cannot swim on 75% of the beach (the 75% to the right when you are facing the ocean). The coral is visible inches under the water and you would have to be loony to swim there. But from the reviews, I guess people regularly walk there and cut their feet. Swimming over on the left was fine, though. We had a blast on the floating trampoline. You can also sign-out ocean kayaks or a Hobie Cat for free. There were only two Hobie Cats and I didn't see them go out much. There is a motor boat and it cost $15 a person to get towed around for a hair-raising ride. We had a tour of the spa, which seemed really nice. We didn't use it because it seemed too pricey and we got occupied doing other things. A 1-hour massage there is $110. I expected to pay $60, and would have gone as high as $75 per hour. For a place like Punta Cana, and a resort like this, $110 was too high. There was a functional gym upstairs. The Games Area is something we used a lot. It is run by Julio, our main man. There is tennis (two courts), basketball (one court), pool tables, ping pong tables, foosball, a super-sized chess set, a Wii game on a flat screen, a bar, archery, and (our favorite) target practice with a pellet gun twice a day. They also had bicycles, which we didn't try. We also played tennis (clay courts and all equipment is provided). There is a small race-course for RC cars, but they said the cars weren't working because the batteries were shot. (note to Dreams management: go to Walmart.com and stock up on RC cars! The track looked cool and we wanted to try it!) There is a staff of entertainers that try to keep everyone happy. They run the sports area, hold aerobic classes, and conduct silly games all over the resort all day. The ones I remember are Julio, 50-cent, Mickey Mouse (he is the one with two balloons stuck to his baseball cap). At the end of the day, these same people perform in a show. They work a long day, and then are forced by a choreographer to perform in drag. Here is a tip on the games - for all of the pool games, etc, they hand out Dreams play-money that can be redeemed in auctions held before the show on Monday, Wednesday and Friday only. Also, right before the auction, the winner of each of the day's events are awarded a certificate suitable for framing and a small (350cc) bottle of rum. If you collect 5 certificates, you then qualify for a drawing for a free trip back to the resort for 2 people. Now the manager has not worked out this play money / auction thing really well. The auction, as I said, is held only 3 times a week. Generally, only 3 or 4 caches of prizes are auctioned off (e.g. a bottle of rum, a tee-shirt, and a hat). The prize caches end up going for $15,000 to $25,000 in play money. You only get $200 for participating in a pool game. The winner of a game may get $500 to $2500, or maybe zero. This means that 95% of the people in the audience have absolutely no hope of getting a prize! The contest winners, on the other hand, get rewarded twice. This leads to a culture of a few houndish families that spend their days playing game after game, hoarding the play money, and winning all the prizes. (Note to Dreams management: You need to rework this system!). I'm not going to go over all the details of the screwed-up system whereby people reserve chairs at the beach and pool. The result is that 100% of the chairs are taken at any given moment, but less than 15% are being used. We found that if you pick out your spot at 8:30 am, and stay there in place till just after 9:00 you can hold a decent spot. Note that the staff resets between 8:30 and 9:00, that is, collecting any personal items or towels left out before then. You need to be there to hold a spot. They really need to fix this somehow. It is the most screwed-up part of the place. Almost done. Here are some odds and ends. There is a tiny little casino, we didn't go in. There is a disco. It is for teens until 10, then adults only after that. We didn't go in. There are plenty of bars, with brand-name alcohol, and they keep it flowing. No complaints. There is an internet cafe, a room with some PC's connected to the Internet. I never saw anyone in there. (note to Dreams management: you may want to lower the price for this?). One thing I was concerned about was getting sick. We were told that the water and ice in the restaurants was safe, so we drank it with no ill effects. In the rooms, we used bottled water for drinking, brushing our teeth, and even rinsing our toothbrushes. We were told this is recommended. Out of a group of 10 people, only one - my 10 year old son - got traveller's diarrhea the night before we left. He was also had nausea and was generally miserable all the way home. He was better in a day, and he wants to go back to Dreams. A tip: be sure to pack both the Adult and children's Immodium - just in case. The resort seems to have the illness thing worked-out, and we heard of no one else getting sick. When you check out, the entertainment staff is there to say goodbye, and interesting to hand out cards referring people to TripAdvisor!! They are actually good, hardworking people who try very hard to keep everyone happy.  Check out went smoothly, and as soon as we left we missed the place. We had a lot of fun, a lot of relaxation. and a lot of high-living. Would we go back? Maybe. We'll see.Would we do this week over again? Yea, we would.Good luck with your stay! Be open-minded, not so picky, and you'll have a blast.

<Content>Relaxation in the Sun Dreams Resort was a good family vacation. Rooms were small and not a lot of storage or area to put suitcases. No draws - only shelves. Everything was very clean. Restaurants were very difficult to get into and you couldn't make reservations. Found many of the dishes extremely salty but in general food was average. The buffet was plentiful and varied and the children loved it. The pool was very nice and spread out. Chairs were at a premium because the resort was full. Beach was nice but had rocks or coral to the right so it was better to wear beach sandals in that area or stay closer to the left side. Had tennis, basketball, three pool tables, table tennis, archery, darts Wii so lots of activities. Entertainment in the evening was by staff. Sometimes it was annoying when the outside vendors were allowed to sell their wares three nights a week. A few were quite assertive.Our grandchildren have asked to return next year.All the staff were very friendly and very helpful. We especially liked Joseph for his relaxed manner with the children and so did many of the other parents. The shy children would respond to his soft spoken manner.Cleanliness was excellent everywhere we went.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel for Children My husband and I along with our two children (aged 7,9) stayed at the Dreams Hotel from 13/3/09 for 2 weeks. We all had a fantastic time and I would definately return to the hotel and recommend it to others visiting the Dominican Republic. The hotel was very busy during the two weeks, especially over the Easter Weekend, with the majority of guests being from Canada and America.ROOMWe had two double beds, which made the room feel quite small, but we had everything we needed, and it was fine for the amount of time we spent inside. The maid did a great job, and left us a variety of interesting towel sculptures.POOLThe pool was fantastic, and kept very clean. The towel situation is something you just have to accept. Whilst we were there the hotel instigated a new procedure, whereby you could reserve beds in the morning before 9am, but only if you were there as well. Lucky for our family, I am a natural early riser and got up most mornings at 7.30am to secure our position!! Pool Volley Ball and Water polo, along with Crazy Water games were all a great success.BEACHBeach was lovely. It was closed for four days during our stay due to the size of the waves and undercurrent. On the other days it was lovely and the kayaks were fun. The area in front of the hotel does have some sharp rocks, (there are signs indicating this), but to the left, it is fine. Just a quick reminder, the beach has a lovely cool breeze and the sea is cool, so you don't realise how burnt you are getting, Sun Factor 70 was required for our children.FOODWe all thought the food was very good. The breakfasts in World cafe were lovely. During the day a lady near Block 6, prepared fruit for you - the pineapples were wonderful. The Beach Barbie was popular and food tasty. In the evenings we tried the Sea Grill - lovely, Bordeaux - fantastic, and the Chinese - great, but most evening we were at the World Cafe, as it was so easy with the kids just selecting what they wanted.The bar service was very good, and drinks were always on hand.Ice Cream was available in the afternoons at the two bars in the pool area.KIDS CLUBMy 7 year old adored the kids club. The staff were very happy and friendly and the club was very secure and spacious with its own pool. He chose to go there in the morning and stayed often until 5pm, and wanted to go back in the evenings until 9pm. We registered him with the option of him coming and going as he pleased, but he chose to stay and was really upset to leave. On a couple of nights both boys went to the club at 6pm and went to dinner with the staff, so allowing us to have a quiet dinner by ourselves.ENTERTAINMENTThe Entertainment staff were very good and worked very hard. The days were packed with activities starting every half hour for Under 12's, Teenagers and Adults.Everytime you involve yourself in an activity / win a competition etc, you gain Dreams Dollars, At the end of the holiday, you can go to the Auction and bid your Dreams dollars for T-shirts, hats, horse riding etc, my kids got really into this and loved the auction, where we gained a T-shirt for $17000!Overall we had a fantastic holiday, and we hope to return to he hotel next year.

<Content>Love this place This was our 4th trip to this resort. We just love it. The pool is fantastic and so is the staff. They are always trying to make your stay very comfortable and they are very eager to please.Restaurants are great. Food choices are unique at each, with many different selections. Top shelf bars!!!!The resort was Sunscape the Beach prior to this year becoming Dreams. I didn't think it could be better, but it was.We'll be back again next year!

<Content>Loved the Resort, Not the Food We were two families with three kids ranging from ages 10 to 14 years old. We stayed at Dreams Punta Cana March 16 to 23 inclusive.We all really liked this resort, the layout was great, never felt we were too far from anything. The pool was fabulus the 11 and 10 year old loved the iceberg in the first pool.  Chairs were at a premium, especially as the beach was closed for three days due to rough water conditions and it was Holy Week. We never did have a problem securing chairs, however we were at the pool usually before 7:30 am, and someone sat with the chairs until 9am. The resort has instituted this practice that you cannot reserve chairs prior to 9am, unless you occupy the chairs. We did see the security guards removing towels and peoples belongings if the chairs were unoccupied prior to 9am. This practice was not well communicated, and we learned of it through word of mouth. The resort should post these rules in rooms on on the palapas around the pool, so everyone is aware. There were some unhappy and distressed guests when they returned to their chairs and their belongings were missing. I tend to be more than underwhelmed by the food at any AI we have stayed in, and this resort was no exception. While I did not go hungry, I thought the food bland and a tendency to be overcooked. We ate a virtually all the restaurants, and the only real wait we had was at the Oceana, which was also my least favourite meal.We thought the staff at this resort tremendous. The staff went over and above to accommodate our requests whether in the restaurants, room service or maintenance. The activities staff were fun, friendly and great with the kids. There was no shortage of activities for anyone. We did attend some of the nightly shows, and they were what we expected.The Spa is lovely, lots of staff and very well maintained. Great gym plenty of equipment, and again well maintained.I would be very interested to see this resort this time next year. I was my perception that the organization was continuing to make changes to the esthetics of the resort. The rooms do need an update...they are small, but for the amount of time we spent in them, I didn't mind. The buildings and rooms could at the very least use a coat of paint.I would return to this resort, it caters to families and does this very well. We felt very secure in allowing our kids to wander around the resort on their own.

<Content>3rd time here- next year is #4-better than ever! This march was our 3rd trip to this resort in the last 3 years and was the best. It was hard to believe but the place got better from last year! Because of my wife's schedule it was just her and I this time around. We were to go to the Eden, but changed after reading the ongoing negative reviews from this site about its growing pains. Got there right on time and arrived at noon and had 3 hours to kill until we got our room. We had packed our swimsuits in our carry on-quickly changed and proceeded to the bar for 3 ice cold Presidentes in bottles-pure heaven! Went to eat at the Seaside grille and hung out at the beach until our room was ready. No problems at all. As expected our room was clean and well stocked with towels and refreshments. All week long we had great room service with turndown of the covers when we went for a drink later in the evening. Had great experiences at all of the restaurants and liked the French the best-great beef! One night we attended the Seaside grille for dinner and were told it would be an hour-no problem-we went to the buffet and had a great dinner there. Always had great service and there was always plenty of staff to make sure our glasses were full and our food was hot. We spent all of our time at the beach this year and really liked the waitress service that came around every half hour or so. The beach is great and the water is gorgeous. There are some rocks to the right that you should avoid, but outside of that-fantastic. We tipped regularly for the great service we received as it was even better than the previous times. Do yourself a favour and experience this place for yourself. It gets better all of the time and I'm sure will be in the top 5 in time with the great people that are there. We wil be goin back in 09' for trip #4 to dreams ...Presidente here we come!

<Content>the pool from my dreams the hotel was breathtakingly beautiful . the pool was the finest and the largest i have ever been in. we were met upon arrival with champagne and cool cloths,which was a nice touch. however they call this the most beautiful beach in the world and i completely disagree. you could not ever get in the water the waves were very high and very strong and the coral would cut you to pieces. also there was alot of trash on this beach. the rooms were very clean and nice. no lights burn in the hallways after a certain time the halls are dark and scary. the girls in the overpriced gift shops are very rude and do not speak very much english. the food was so-so. the beautiful tropical weather and the pool make up for alot of the other things but make sure you take lots of tip money if you want to get waited on at the bars with out waiting for a very long time . they expect tips after every drink. i probably would go back to punta can but i do not know about staying here. one more thing stay out of casino they do not understand the games.

<Content>Dreams Punta Cana - great all-inclusive resort Beautiful resort. The lagoon-style pool was very nice and the beach was fantastic (water was a pretty blue). The weather was great (mid to upper 80's). All food/drinks are included at all restaurants/bars which was great and convenient. Tipping is optional. The resort was mostly couples  families. The hibachi restaurant was very good  a lot of fun. The mexican was good too  had live entertainment. The world cafe was a good breakfast place (donuts were delicious!). The french restaurant was a bit fancy/stuffy but the food was decent. The Oceana  grill had a nice atmosphere  open with a partial ocean view. There is also soft serve ice cream available at the beach bar all day. Room service is also free (except you should tip here) and fairly quick. They also keep your fridge stocked with bottled water, soda  beer. We did have some issues getting the right room as there were three of us (me  my two sisters ages 21 - 39). Our first room had one king size bed. We eventually got moved to a room with two double beds  a cot. We also had a missing piece of luggage that didn't make it to Punta Cana until 3 days after we arrived. The concierge tried to be very helpful but they are very laid back here  we ended up having to make a lot of the calls ourselves. It helps if you speak some spanish as there was somewhat of a language barrier. Sharon (Brittish woman) from VIP travel was a huge help in helping to get our luggage back! There are a few shops at the resort which have some basic stuff as well as some bathing suits  clothing. Also cigars  souvenirs. In the center of the resort were Dominican vendors selling jewelry, paintings etc. They are very forward. Keep in mind you can offer them 50% or less than their asking price  they will most likely accept your offer. We recommend this resort for couples and families with small kids. The nightlife is a bit lacking. There was some Karaoke one night  a couples dating game type show another night... the bars were not too crowded so if you are going as singles or if you like more evening activity you might be a little disappointed in that respect. The grounds are beautiful  it was incredibly relaxing  the palm trees gorgeous.

<Content>Very disappointing vacation We just returned from Dreams and were very disappointed. We booked a deluxe ocean view room and it was the size of a broom closet. We had 2 adults and 1 child and we would have been miserable in the first room. We had to then upgrade the room to an ocean view suite for another $600.00. When we checked in they were up selling the suites at the front desk , so they are aware that the rooms are bad. The other problem is that the suite wouldn't be ready until the next afternoon so we couldn't un pack for over 24 hrs. Our view was then of a dirty vacant lot with the ocean in the distance. This was the worst view we've ever had on any beach trip and we take at least one per year. The food and alcohol are suppose to be gourmet and top shelf- nothing could be farther from the truth. The French restaurant was un edible and was served cold. The Mexican was ok but also cold. The Italian was just a small roped off section of the buffet, the Japanese was over cooked, and at the Chinese four meals were sent back. We didn't even try the seafood for fear of cold seafood. The only decent food was at the buffet [ we are NOT buffet people EVER] but it was hot and seemed fresh so we were stuck with it. We had to eat EVERY meal there. This was our fear with booking an all inclusive trip and our worst fears came true. We did not have a decent drink or glass of wine unless we PAID for an upgraded bottle of wine. The drinks at the pool were just loaded with sugar and syrup and they only offer one kind of local beer. Not what you expect when they say  premium alcohol. Another HUGE problem was the chairs at the pool. We had a large group and so 3 or 4 of us would get down to the pool every morning at 6:30 and get our chairs and STAY with them until the others got down. [ we let the small children sleep ] We did not leave the chairs until the magic 9am time when it was allowed. The people that put their towels down on a chair and then left for breakfast came back to find their belongings gone and thrown in a garbage bag by the towel hut. They tried to do it to us while we were sitting there on our chairs, [ they actually started picking up and taking our belongings ] which caused a big fight at 7 am. This is not how I want to be treated on vacation. Long story here but I want to save others the disappointment that our 4 families suffered. We would never go back and all the  golden apple  ratings are bogus. The beach was not very nice either- it was dirty, the sand was not white and both sides of the property was vacant lots littered with garbage. Choose another resort is my best advice.

<Content>Beach, food and First Aid a big disappointment The beach, the food and First Aid were a big disappointment. Several people came out of the water with serious cuts and scrapes from the rocks. The sand had a lot of debris in it and the beach was closed for the last 3 days due to rough conditions brought in by a cold front so if the beach matters, beware!The food was pretty poor with the exception of the Japanese Restaurant which was great! All other food was borderline inedible and I am not a fussy eater. The beef and pork were really chewy, the Italian was extremely limited and poor quality. I never want to see another hamburger or hotdog again. Ended up eating mostly fruit and lost 5 lbs. in 10 days.First Aid there was a hidden shed with only band-aids and a warm body. There does not seem to be a procedure in place or at least it isn't followed. The employees/vendors attempted to perform their version of First Aid and did not appear to be properly trained. The pool was amazing complete with a floating iceberg climber for kids, excellent games for adults and plenty of rafts to float on. The entertainment was really good at the pool and the theatre and the rooms were fine. Clearly this resort caters to families and children and has an incredible all day and all night Kids Club and too many events to keep up with.The employees worked really hard and long hours and days and wore several hats (so to speak). They absolutely went out of their way to be halpful and make it a great experience. They absolutely deserve any and all tips offered.

<Content>Pros and Cons The ride to Dreams was as expected, bumpy and long. But nothing to stop us from going. We did have an issue where the porter at the airport quoted us $35 for the taxi ride and then we found out mid-way through the trip that the cost was actualy $60. My husband and I are both spanish speaking so there was no mis-communication. Basically the guy at the airport had never heard of Dreams and just quoted us a price anyway. We had done our research before and new the normal price was $60, they have set tarifs on taxis in Punta Cana, so I was just angry at the fact that I felt they were trying to get one over on us. Onto the resort itself ,we arrived and checked in with no issues. Our room was normal size, clean, and fairly updated. We ran into problems on about the 4th night when we started seeing cockroachs in our room. We advised reception and they sent maintance with pesticide to the room. I know this is the tropics but I still should not be seenig cockroachs in a supposed 4* hotel. The next day we saw another cockroach and went back to recpetion. They first offered us masages which we rejected. It was very difficult to speak to a manager, you had to go through several levels of assistants and supervisors first. But we were persistant and when we finally did get him he gave us a suite for the rest of our stay along with masages for the each of us. The suite was beautiful, if I were to go again I would only stay in the suite. As for the food and service, it was not very good. You can always find something to eat but don't expect good quality, you just won't find it. The service was bad 98% of the time, I think one night we actually had a good server. Some nights we waited 15 mintues just to get a drink, and forget getting a second one, trying to get the waiters attention. The restaurants are way understaffed. Also you are unable to make reservations so expect a 30-45 mt wait to get a table. On the positive side the pool was great. The first 3 days we had no problem getting a chair by the pool, then for some reason by the 4th day you had to be out there by 8am to get one. The beach was nice, there was coral in the water, but if you go to the right or the left there was plenty of clear blue water free of coral to swim in. There is a nice little gift shop to the left of the resort on the beach, its about a 10 mintue walk. Only pay half of what they orignally quote you, overall its a much better deal than what you will get in the hotel. As for woment not wearing their tops, you are going to a foreign country, you cannot expect all countries in the world to be just like the United States. If you have kids and you don't want them to be exposed to other cultures of the world, I would suggest you stay i the U.S. Overall I don't think I would go back, but that is more because I like to try new places. If I were to go back I would undoubtedly stay in a suite, its liket stepping into a completely different hotel.

<Content>Great vacation at Dreams Punta Cana Had a wonderful vacation at Dreams Punta Cana. Just stayed from March 9 through March 15, 2008. My husband and I along with another couple, good friends, all of us in our 50's. We were delayed in Cleveland on March 8 due to the snowstorm so our trip was delayed by a whole day. Ended up leaving Sunday around 5:30 p.m., arriving around 9:30 p.m. in Punta Cana. When you arrive, you'll have to pay a $10 U.S. cash entry fee. You'll receive a card that you'll turn in 20 feet from where you purchased it. They like U.S. $$. Then you'll get your passport stamped, pick up your luggage and we were greeted by the Apple Rep, that showed us to the bus to take us to Dreams. The ride is all you've read about. Terrible. I will say, I'm sure our driver did the best he could under the circumstances. I guess I'm glad it was dark, so I couldn't see! When we arrived at Dreams, the front desk had us in their system as no shows. This was due to the fact that we were a day late. They found rooms for us but we were supposed to be next to our friends and that didn't happen that night. They said, we'll just get you in these rooms for tonight and fix you up tomorrow. We got our luggage to our rooms and proceeded to the disco, which was the only bar left open. Julio made a great chocolate martini. Lets just say we had our share, then went directly to bed. Our 1st room was in building 3, top floor. Had a great view of the pool. The next morning, we went back to the front desk to get our rooms straightened out. They moved us to building 5, 2nd floor, right next to our friends. It worked out great but I will say our 1st room had a better view. Didn't matter much as we weren't in our room much. By the way, the higher the building #, the closer to the lobby and buffet. The lower the building #, the closer to the beach. There were 5 buildings on our side. To travel between buildings, you had to take the walkway, take a left, then take a right, through the hallway of building 5, then take a left, then take a right through the hallway of building 4, etc. This was the well lit route at night.After we got our rooms straightened out, we found out that our Apple Rep had let the front desk know of our delay, so it was the front desk that dropped the ball on that one. Our room was great. We had a larger than king size bed. It was a bit harder than we're used to but not terribly uncomfortable. Our bedding was clean and in good condition. The room was very clean, kept very clean during our stay, as was our bathroom and shower. The shower had a small shower wall but as long as you were a bit careful, the water stayed in the bathtub. The towels were fluffy and seemed new. There were no signs of bugs at all. Anyhow, off to the beach. The Beach: Was beautiful. The sand was soft and light brown and the water was that beaufiful aqua color. Many palms and lots of sunshine, if you wanted it. There were also little palm huts you could sit under. In the water in front of the resort, it is a bit rocky but you can definitely see the rocks. We took water shoes but didn't use them much. I like the feel of the sand and water on my feet. Facing the water, if you go to the left of the resort along the waterfront, there is a beautiful, sandy beach and water area past the watersports area. It is a beautiful and safe walk along that beach area. You'll come upon a couple of gift shops that are safe to visit. We went down there a couple of times. You'll see Alexanders 1st, then down around the turn, past the tipped over palm, you'll come to Daniels. We did end up buying a beautiful oil painting from Daniel. Just be sure to negotiate with him. The 1st day we went, he started out at $175. When we went back, we ended up paying $30. He also wanted my hat for his mother! :) The Pool: Was just like you see in the photos of the resort. Beautiful, clean, long and very refreshing. It starts up near the lobby area and continues down to the beach. The only problem we had with the pool was the pool chair saving. Of course, you have to join in or you won't get chairs. While we were there, they changed the chair saving rules, that you can't save chairs before 9:00 a.m. Be sure you do it or you won't get them. Take along something other than your pool towels, like flip flops or t shirts, or you risk someone taking over your chairs. Get your pool towels the night before so you have them handy 1st thing in the a.m. There are floating rafts for use and we didn't really have a problem getting them when we wanted to. At times, we had to hunt them down but not a real problem. The swim up bar is at the end of the pool towards the beach. It was nice and the bartenders on the water side seemed to do a great job. While we were there, they began replacing all of the chair pads around the pool. Seems like they are upgrading a bit at a time.The Drinks: The drinks were definitely plentiful. But our husbands were the big drinkers in our group and they had a couple of comments they wanted me to mention. It was a problem getting the top shelf liquor. Seemed like they had to ask for it every time and watch to be sure that is what they ended up getting. The staff leaned towards other brands. By the way, they had no Captain Morgan Spiced Rum, which is what we drink. They served their own Rum, which we didn't care for. The foo-foo drinks were good but filling. My 2 favorites were the Miami Vice and the mudslide. But they do have menus that describe the drinks in detail. Our husbands also noted that the tippers seemed to get better service and more booze in their drinks. The Food: We ate at the various restaurants during our stay. The World Cafe had a large selection of food. We mainly ate there for breakfast each day. It was very good. The omelet guy was very popular, for us too, and did a great job. The food was all hot, if it was supposed to be and plentiful. They kep everything filled up. The staff was more than accommodating. If you needed something, they were more than willing to help you out. At times, there was a language barrier there but if they didn't understand, they went and got a manager, who did understand and we ended up getting what we were asking for. They were all very friendly, with lots of ola's and smiles. Just to let you know, the decaf coffee is instant. The orange juice is fresh and very good. The dress here is casual.All of the other restaurants, you need appropriate dress.The Japanese was great, as was the French. The one thing I'll tell the ladies about the French is, it was cold in there! But the food, the presentation and the staff were all great. The Chinese was ok. My husband had the mahi mahi and it had bones in it. Made him uncomfortable and he didn't finish it. The Oceanaire had very slow service but a nice atmosphere. It was down by the beach and all open, plus it was a warm, beautiful evening. The other problem with the Oceanaire was that the portions for the guys were very small. The Jack Daniels shrimp had 4 pieces of shrimp. Not near enough for them. Our friend attempted to order 2 main entrees and our server said, one entree per person. That really wasn't ok with any of us, as this is an all-inclusive and any cruise we've been on, you order what you're going to eat. The only thing I'll say about my meal is, I'm not a seafood eater at all, so the only thing I could really order was the beef and it was very difficult to cut. Not my favorite meal. We tried not to eat lunch every day, with the big breakfasts, but we did eat one day at the World Cafe and one day at the Seaside Grill, which was very good. You'll have to try the Macaroons.The environment: The temperature was around 89 degrees during the day and around 77 degrees at night. The sun was shining all day every day. Beautiful!! It was great, especially since we have winter 7 months out of the year. There were no bugs so I guess I don't know if it was because that season was over or what but we did take bugspray, since others advised it but we never used it once. It was just plain beautiful. The entertainment: The staff worked very hard to keep everyone active and involved. They were young people who all seemed to enjoy people and their jobs. The entertainment staff worked during the day and also in the evening at the 9:30 show that was in the theatre every night. They did a great job and you could see that they put alot of work and energy into their performaces. Good job guys!!! I will say, that I read on trip advisor that Dave, the piano man was great. I'd have to disagree. Didn't like his show at all. The excursions we participated in: We went to Saona Island, which I would recommend to anyone. This was a great day. We took a van from Dreams to catch a larger busload of people from other resorts. The only thing I'll say about this is, we had a meeting point that we arrived at about 15 minutes early, that included shopping. Well, if you go into the shops, you'll be followed around by 1, then 2, then 3 people, until you are so uncomfortable, you'll just go back outside and wait for the bus. The busride was, I think, about an hour but we did get to see some of the countryside and sights, along with some of the towns or city areas. Showed how they live, etc. Once we got to where we were going, the boats were waiting. We took a small boat out to the Catamaran that was taking us to Saona Island. This was a great trip on the water. Very relaxing and beautiful. Took about an hour to get to the Island. Once we got there, there were plenty of beach chairs, lunch, entertainment, some drinks and the water and beach were beautiful. We spend most of the afternoon there. When done, we boarded the speedboats that took us across the water to an area where we were to see large starfish. We were able to go into the water here, as it was very shallow. Well, amongst our group, we saw one starfish. But it was still fun. We got back on the speedboats and went back along the shoreline to where we were to get back on the bus and head back to the resort. Was a very fun day! The other excursion we went on was the Outback Safari. This was ok for us but our friends enjoyed this more than Saona. We boarded an open air truck that took us through the countryside to see how the people live. We had a great guide, Sammy Davis Jr, who was very knowledgable. This took us to a cocoa and coffee plantation, which was interesting. Of course with each stop, they were selling their products. That was ok, as that is how they make their money. When we left there, we went on to a ranch for lunch. It was ok. They served beans, rice and chicken. From there we stopped at a typical school to see the children, then off to a beach, Macao, to do boogie boarding. It was beautiful as we were approaching, but there were wild dogs everywhere that weren't getting along too well. Didn't like this part. I would have enjoyed our beach more and didn't really care to boogie board, Although, alot of people did and seemed to be enjoying it. Then back to our resort. This was an all day trip as well. The resort: This resort was beautiful, clean and I can't say enough good things about it. I guess I should say that this is the 1st time we have vacationed at an all-inclusive resort so I don't have another to compare it to but we have done cruises and I would not hesitate to do an all inclusive again. They have vendors come 3 times during the week. They set up their tables to sell their wares. They don't like to take no for an answer, so you need to be persistent at times. Or, you can walk on the outside areas to avoid altogether. They didn't bother me. I did buy some of the Larimar jewelry. Just be ready to negotiate and they will, as they know that all of the tables around them are selling the same things. The staff, as I mentioned before, were all hard working, very friendly with smiles and hellos and were great. All the way from the maids that cleaned the rooms, to the servers, to the bartenders. There were many weddings that took place at various times during the week. It appeared that alot of planning went into this as well. Seemed very organized. Some in the gazebo and some right on the beach itself. Didn't need to worry about rain, as they only get 25 inches of rainfall a year!We had a great vacation!!!!

<Content>Needed R  We stayed at Dreams 3/3 - 3/7. I had read so many reviews that I was going crazy and couldn't decide what to do. I decided to book Dreams and I am glad I did. The staff was very accomodating and helpful. Our room was always very clean and the frig always kept full. We used room service often and everything came wrapped very well, clean, and in a timely manner. They always came sooner than they said. The pool was the largest I have ever seen and very well maintained. Our only complaint was people were saving chairs by the pool as soon as 7a.m. By 8 there were no chairs left!!!!! People were hording chairs and floats like it was their job!The beach was very nice. Plenty of chairs in the sun or shade. Drinks were always being served and the beach bar-b-que wasn't too bad. At least you had food that was handy so you didn't need to leave to eat. There were rocks here and there but we found a clear path out into the surf and followed it everyday. The water was clean and warm and the waves were great.Our disappointments: the horrible ride to and from the airport (too long,too rough), the food was good not great, drinks were not that strong, and no chairs available by the pool after 8 a.m.Overall, we had a restful vacation. We had a great time and met some really nice people. Would we go back??? SURE

<Content>Not what we expected........ Well, let's just say when we arrived in Punta Cana we did experience the ride everyone talks about on here. It wasn't horrible but it was enlightening to see the poverty that is overwhelming. We arrived at the hotel and the arrival was pleasant warm cookies and champagne.......We were given two rooms next to each other and they were on the ground level. They looked run down but not horrible. There is a hammock on the patio to sit on and my son was sitting on it and all of the sudden it came out of the ceiling. I heard a big thud...Thank God he only got a lump on his head. If it were an older person it could've been much worse. There were bugs in the room. Many things were not working so little by little they fixed them. I felt like I was doing a walk through for a new house. We met some very nice people who worked there and who were on vacation and that made it all worth being at Dreams. The food was not great. The best restaurant is the adults only one. The rest of them were hit or miss. The wait was ridiculous at most of the restaurants. The other thing that was horrible was the chairs being taken up at the pool. You MUST get up by 7:30 to have a prime spot. I hate playing that game but I wound up doing it because I needed shade and the little umbrella huts were hard to come by. My two teenagers had a wonderful time because they met a lot of friends. So, for me the vacation was a success. I would not go back there again. I didn't find the concierge there helpful or concerned at all about my son and his head. The beach was beautiful but the ocean was closed off for two days because the water was too rough.I'm sorry if this upsets people but I travel a lot and maybe I am spoiled. I guess one thing I would have changed would be to upgrade to a suite. I think I would have been happier but with two teens I thought that two regular rooms would be nicer......oh well.Just got home an hour ago and wanted to get this on here while my memory was fresh.

<Content>Clappy Clappy, Happy Happy Three of us (myself, wife, and 15 year old son) stayed at Dreams from 15 - 22 March 08. This was our first experience with an all-inclusive resort after 8 cruises in the Caribbean. I won't go into all the superlatives that have been already covered in previous reviews, but I will touch on several real pluses for us as well as a couple of very minor issues which could make the stay even better:Pluses - 1. The staff is OUTSTANDING! They make every effort to ensure your stay is memorable. From the moment we arrived to be greeted with cold towels to freshen up at check-in to the moment we boarded the shuttle back to the airport we treated as valued guests. We speak very little Spanish and the staff varying degrees of English, but we could always let the staff know what we were asking for. The entertainers were very good, and one in particular, Stephanie (Clappy, Clappy) was just great. If you go, ask her about her $27,000 enhancements (you'll know when you see her down by the beach bar).2. While the staff is # 1, the environment is a close second. The grounds are beautiful and well maintained (cleaner than Disney World); the pool is spectacular; and the beach is wonderful. Yes, the rooms we had were not large and some of the trim could use some fresh paint, but they were very clean and the maid service was top-notch. We got the rooms we requested (two connecting) the first time. One negative here: the hallways are all ceramic tile floored and as a result noise echoes at night were bothersome (to me) the first night. After that I slept just fine.3. Restaurants were fine. Go later rather than earlier to cut down on the wait to get in, or go the World Cafe (never a wait). We had good meals at all locations. Especially good steaks at Bordeaux and the Sea Side Grill.4. Location - Yes the resort is 50 - 60 minutes from the airport, but the roads were not as bad as some have made out, and it affords you some time to see what life in the DR is like for the majority of inhabitants. We passed some commercial areas, several resort and condo developments, and then as we neared Dreams, some farm land with grazing cattle, horses, goats, chickens, etc. All in all, interesting to me and worth the drive.Minuses -1. WRT to the lounge chair issue, management is well aware of the problem. The root cause of the problem is people reserving multiple lounges in several locations, and then not coming back for extended periods of time, if at all, to use them. We received a separate notice in our check-in packet noting the problem and advising us of a new policy that any lounges with towels, books, clothing, or other personal items left unattended before 9:00AM would be removed and kept at a central location for retrieval later. Bottom line is if you get up early and reserve lounges, you'd best be prepared to stay with them until at least 9:00AM. This was not a major problem for us, but I understand the great amount of frustration over this issue. Not an easy problem to solve as long as there are inconsiderate, selfish people out there.6. A couple of nitnoids here. The World Cafe could use more spoons, tumblers, and salt and pepper shakers on the tables. The Soft Serve Ice Cream machines were pretty unreliable. Water pressure in the rooms was great, but occasional temperature fluctuations occurred.Bottom line is that we had a great Spring Break trip and feel the experience was worth the money. As several other reviewers have noted, in this world there are a certain number of people who will never be satisfied with anything that happens in their lives. All the rest of us can do is pity them, and hope they are not seated next to us on our future vacation trips. We recommend Dreams unconditionally!!!

<Content>Great Vacation!!! We stayed at Dreams Punta Cana from 3/1 through 3/8/08. I must admit, I was very worried about my decision to stay there after reading the reviews. Not to worry---we had a wonderful time. We covered several generations from 50+ to late teens and none of us would hesitate to return. Prior to leaving home, I did take the advise of another reviewer and emailed to confirm our reservations. Almost everything when off without a hitch. The first room key we were given did not open the door, but the very polite bell hop, Saurez, opened it with his master key and just said to go to the front desk where they reset the key card. We had a super saver room this time, mainly because we were paying for 3 instead of the usual 2. It was fine. I am assuming they were the rooms that had not yet been upgraded. It was not large, but it was always clean and suited our needs just fine---we only use it to sleep, shower, and change after all.The food was wonderful. Some of the best I have had at an all includsive resort. Our breakfast was, of course, at the World cafe. Lunch was divided between the World Cafe - which has a panini maker, and the Seaside Grill - where you could actually sit down and order, rather than the typical lunch buffet. We tried almost all the resturants for dinner with no complaints. I was a little worried about not making dinner reservations. We like to eat at prime time- 7:00ish and do not like to wait. We never had a problem. When we wern't seated immediately, we got a beeper and could wait at the nearest bar.The pool was wonderful, we are early risers, so no problem reserving our pick of spots each morning. Although I must admit, some people are very inconsiderate. They must have reserved places at the pool and beach, because often times we never saw anyone use places that were saved. I have no problem with people saving a place--but just save one and use it for pete's sake. We bring our own floats, so getting one for us was never a problem. You can often pick they up for a buck at a discount store, they take up no room in your suitcase, and we just leave them.The entertainment team was great. They certainly made the trip very enjoyable for my granddaughter, who we took as an early graduation present. She came home with several email addresses to keep in touch. I'm sure she will be looking to go back during spring break next year at college. Hats off to 50 Cent, Mickey Mouse, and Usher. The shows were the typical resort shows, we enjoyed them, although I am sure not everyone will. One note, do participate in the daily activities. They are great fun and a way to meet the entertainment team as well as people from just about everywhere. We met people from all over the U.S. and Canada, as well as England, Germany, France, Finland and Russia. Some of the activities are a little too virgurous for old grandparents, but many, many are not. Have fun and try some. We never missed the aquagym with 50 Cent, but also did the crazy games on the beach--like a water balloon toss and egg toss. Just check the program they leave in your room each night for times and places of the activities.We prefer the pool to the ocean, so I can't comment on the rock problem I read about. The beach was wonderful for an early morning, or midnight stroll. I find it hard to believe that anyone could leave a bad review, but I guess there is no pleasing everyone. I can't wait to go back--maybe 2010, we have our sights set on Jamaica next year!

<Content>Best family resort ANYWHERE! Okay-seriously...this is an amazing place and anyone on this site who doesn't agree...they must have had some really bad luck and that is that. I'm a very seasoned travellor...have been many places all over the world and atleast 8 other Carribean islands so you can take my word for it.We loved it from start to finish and even considered dropping life back home and staying another week. We had friends arriving the day after we left and we can't wait to hear about their trip.The place is 5 star all the way. The rooms are beautiful and clean and we had just a plain deluxe room...no upgrade. We even got an early check in..arrived at noon and our room was clean and ready for us...the cookies they greeted us with were still warm! And the champagne was cold...they even greeted my son with a juicy red apple.We were on the first floor in building 3 right at the bridge and that was great because we had easy access to the pool with our 5 year old. The grounds and beach are beautiful...simply amazing.The EXPLORER'S CLUB for the kids is first rate...our son had so much fun. Some days he just wanted to play there for hours. It was great that they gave us a cell phone so we felt at ease that if there were any problems we could get to him within minutes. There is so much to do for kids and the place is definately the best for families. If I was going there for a quiet romantic place with my husband, I'm sure this would be a different review.Overall the food was good...we tried several of the a la cartes and we never had to wait more than 10 minutes for a table and services was good...the Mexican food was really good. Great variety at the buffet every day too and staff was pleasant and very attentive.All 600 staff members at this resort work so hard and very long hours to make our trip enjoyable. I would like to thank them all for that.We read about the bad drive but we flew into La Romana airport and the drive was one hour 15 mintues each way but 80% of the road is brand new...maybe one section had some pot holes but our drivers were very careful and we drove through several villages and one big city so the drive was really interesting and went by quickly.Overall I highly recommend this for a high quality vacation for the whole family.

<Content>A Nightmare to Pleasant My husband and our friends (2 other couples) booked the Dreams about 6 weeks in advance. When we arrived at the airport we were taken to a beat up looking van (we booked ahead of time) which was to small for 6 grown persons (2 of which were 6' plus). As we are pulling out we ask the driver (who said he spoke no English) how long to Dreams . When he said an hour and a half we knew there was a problem right away. When we said we had been told aproximately 1 hour he stopped the van and pulled back into the parking space and called a person in charge. The person in charge appolgizes and says we get free massages for our inconvenience. When we look puzzled he then tells us that the next day we will be moved back to Dreams. Well......unbelievable.....they were going to take us to another hotel without even telling us! This person pretty much held us hostage in the van as he would not move from the door nor would he tell the drive to take us to Dreams regardless of what we wanted. It turns out that Dreams overbooked (a computer glich) and we had no rooms. To make a long story shorter.....we pretty much told him after 45 minutes of sitting in this hot van to get the heck out of the way and tell the driver to take us to Dreams so we could speak to the manager at Dreams ourselves. After a trip from hell from the airport to Dreams we finally arrived....tired, hungry, annoyed, and mad as hell. We were almost three hours late. Our friends from Scotland who were waiting for us couldn't get any information from the front desk about where we were, except that we didn't have reservations! Dreams still tried to tell us they had no rooms but after an hour or so they finally gave us one room to put all our luggage in. Through relentless hounding and tracking down the manager into the night, we finally all had rooms by 10:00 p.m. Our whole day was shot. It turns out we were not the only ones in this predicament. There were at least four other couples/families who had the same ordeal as we did. The manager did work very hard to get us rooms (probably because we wouldn't leave him alone). I think he was afraid we'd all camp out in the lobby. We did get free massages (which was the best I've ever had by the way) and supposedly a credit for our first night stay (which we are still fighting for). The next day at the pool was heavenly and one of the couples actually got engaged that day! We had great food except for the last night. The Japanese Habachi was fabulous. If you want fun, laughter, entertainment AND good food, I recommend it.Be careful at the beach. The beach itself was beautiful but our friend from Scotland was the only one who went into the Ocean.... and ended up stepping on sharp coral, getting cut and needing stitches. The medical attention was excellent I must say.Everyone was friendly and the Sammy Sosa's were something else! Once we got over the horrendous first day the rest of the stay was very nice. We were only there 4 days and that wasn't enough. (especially since our first day was a wash).I've had time to cool down, so as to whether or not I'd go back to Punta Cana.......I probably would, but I'd try a different resort. The majority of people don't have severe problems with checkin, etc., as we did, but just remember it can and does happen. I never thought it would happen to me.If you do go.....enjoy the people, food, drinks and the wonderful pool! We went with great friends and that made the whole ordeal worth it.

<Content>What you on the web site is what you get My wife (mid 40s) and I (early 50s) returned last night from this slice of paradise. We were slightly apprehensive based on some of the negative reviews. We now wonder if the negatives stayed at the same resort we did.What were we apprehensive about?1. Ride from the airport. Yes, the road is narrow and has many potholes, but the ride was not a life-threatening experience as others make it out to be. We enjoyed the ride and the opportunity to see the countryside and the towns in which people live.2. Tipping. We did not feel compelled to tip in order to get good service. We felt comfortable giving a tip when we received good service, which was most of the time. It is a good idea to have a good supply of one dollar bills for this purpose.3. The room. The room was clean and lovely. We had plenty of room for two people. We had more than enough towels and washclothes and the room was straightend twice a day. The main thing about the room is, you really are not in it very much except to sleep and change and it is more than enough room for those activites. You also have a balcony if you want a place to eat if you order room service.The resort grounds are beautiful and well maintained. The staff is friendly, fun and most of the time helpful. As everybody else has written, the pool is beautiful and clean. The reserving of chairs is a problem and the management is working on the problem.The food was good and we enjoyed having the opportuntity to eat at different restaurants. Just like everybody else you find your favorite. Also, if you eat dinner at the buffet, you receive the same service as you do in the other restaurants. Here are some suggestions: 1. If you get to the resort in between meal times as we did, and nothing is open, you can order a pizza from the Italian restaurant and don't forget about room service. They don't have a menu, but you can just tell them what you want and they will bring it to your room. 2. Also, the first night we were there we were handed a wine menu with prices. This is only for people who don't or won't drink house wine. If you want wine just tell them you want a glass of white or red wine and they will keep filling it and filling it and filling it.3. Lastly, I suggest you take the Spanish classes they offer at 10:00. They are a lot of fun and it helps get you involved. The staff really likes when you use Spanish and they love to teach you Spanish.Just read the good reviews and bypass reading the bad reviews. I don't know where these people visited, but they didn't go to Dreams in Punta Cana or they just are VERY and next to IMPOSSIBLE to please. Have as good of a time as we had!

<Content>Truly Relaxing - Great Time We have just returned from 21 nights at Dreams Punta Cana. Like a lot of other travellers we had been looking at TripAdvisor frequently as this was our first holiday in the Dominican Republic and our first holiday for 21 nights.We were a little anxious about some of the reviews but to be honest I think some people just like to find fault rather than point out the good things.To give a brief overview, yes the road is a little bumpy on the way to Dreams, but no worse than some of the roads we have travelled on in Europe, especially Malta!I think a lot depends on which room you are allocated at Dreams and agree with some of the other reviewers that if you do happen to be allocated a ground floor room or a room right next to the cleaners station, you may not be as happy as we were. However, reception appear to be very happy to move people if requested, so my advice would be: if you are not happy with your room, ask to be moved immediately so that it doesn't spoil your holiday.Getting a bed around the pool does seem to be a problem. We are early risers but when we went to the pool area on our first morning at 7.30 am every sunbed (and there are loads of them) had a towel on them. We are not normally beach people, but we decided to spend the first day on the beach because we couldn't find a spare sunbed around the pool. This was the best decision we have ever made and enjoyed it so much on the beach that we spent the next 20 days there too. However we did learn on day 3 that the pool staff put the towels on the beds around the pool (rolled up). If a towel was not rolled up or had something else with it like suntan lotion, a book, etc that meant the bed was taken. If the towel was still rolled up and nothing else was on the bed it meant the bed was free. But as I said we enjoyed the beach so much we spent every day there.The staff are absolutely fantastic. We drank in the Cafe Kafe most nights and found Jose the barman and Marie Magdelena the waitress absolutely amazing. They made us extremely welcome, always greeted us with a smile, remembered what we were drinking and kept our glasses full the whole time.The entertainment team work so hard all day long to keep everyone happy and amused. They work very long hours but still manage a smile and take the time to come and have a chat with you. They do not hassle you to join in and welcome you if you just want to sit and watch rather than take part. Micky Mouse, 50 cents, Usher and Stephanie are a credit to the company and work tirelessly to ensure that guests are enjoying themselves.We found the food in the World Cafe totally acceptable and cannot understand why people would complain. There was always so much choice, that anyone who couldn't find something they liked must be an extremely fussy eater. Our only complaint was that during the evening the air conditioning was just that little bit to high, making it extremely cold in the restaurant, which meant it was not only uncomfortable but also that the food chosen soon lost its heat - but to be honest that was our only complaint about the food. We only tried a couple of the other restaurants and they were fine, but we spoke to others and they had tried all of the restaurants and everyone we spoke to said that all the restaurants were good.The beach is truly lovely and you do feel like you are in paradise when you walk along to the other hotels. It is so peaceful and relaxing.The grounds of the hotel are beautiful and immaculate and the team of gardeners work very hard to ensure that it remains that way.It is very good value for money for all inclusive because nothing is limited, more or less everything is included and all the drinks are proper international brands and we struggled to find a drink that they did not have on supply. Even bottle beers were in good supply and various well know popular brands.Our only recommendations to the hotel would be to change the way towels are issued. If they introduced a voucher system it would stop people getting up at the crack of dawn to reserve beds and it would also stop some of the very selfish people who not only reserved beds around the pool, but who also got extra towels and reserved beds on the beach and hardly spent any time on either! In Mexico we were given a token and each day when the towel bar opened at 7.30 am you exchanged the token for a towel, at the end of the day you returned the towel and they returned your token, it seemed to work very well and did stop the majority of bed reserving.We would also recommend that they introduce a two week entertainment programme rather than the current weekly one. Obviously we were there for three weeks so did expect some repeat performances during the third week, but it being only a weekly programme it doesn't really cater for the majority of people who are there for two weeks.All in all we had a fantastic time from start to finish, our room in block 2 on the third floor was lovely, the staff were fabulous, the food was good, the weather was great, the grounds are immaculate and everyone goes out of their way to ensure that you enjoy your stay.A special hello to Jose, Marie Magdelana, the gardeners and the entertainment staff and a very special hello to Dinny the guy with the lovely smile that serves omlettes and eggs at breakfast time. We really don't know how he managed to be so calm and professional when some guests were so rude and impatient and ungrateful when ordering their omlettes and eggs. We went to say hello to him every morning, even if we didn't want eggs, just so he saw at least two friendly faces each day.Some people complained about the market traders that come into the hotel 3 times a week selling, hasselling them. Yes they do approach you and ask you to look at their goods but a polite no thank you is sufficient. If you think that is hassle you obviously haven't been to Turkey and Tenerife and some areas of Europe where you really do feel hasselled at times!We would definitely go back to Dreams and we are sure that with all the hard work they are doing it will be even more luxurious when they have completed all the work they are doing to make everyting that much nicer (which by the way didn't bother us or interfer with our holiday at all). We would definitely recommend Dreams to others.

<Content>Dreamy Dreams, Disappointing Food Overall, I think Dreams was a good choice for a nice all inclusive in the DR. The pros are great. Beautiful beach, amazingly huge pool, beautiful grounds, relaxing atmosphere, and thoughtful staff (who aren't too pushy) like other AI's.The cons. The rooms are dull, and need some repair. The food is blah. The buffet was the best bet, I thought. And at lunch, eat at the seafood grill near the pool. It was the best food on the resort. The french restaurant has some good appitizers. The japanese restaurant was really salty, the seafood restaurant for dinner was flavorless.The other problems was the distance from the airport. This was a bit annoying with a bumpy bus ride, but no big deal.Take dreams for what it is. A good resort in a beautiful place, that just needs a few improvements.

<Content>Dream was great We just returned from a weeklong stay at Dreams Punta Cana, and it was a very good vacation. The resort is beautiful and well kept for Dominican standards. If you really look you'll find things wrong, but we looked at the big picture. The three things that were a let down were the ocean,the vendors and the noise. The ocean was really rough, and the last two days it was closed. They have a fantastic pool, so it wasn't too bad, but it for a seaside resort you kind of expect the ocean. The room we had was very nice, but the hallways echo loudly, and the walls were kind of thin. We hardly slept at all the first night, but we got used to it. A few times a week the resort lets in vendors to sell their stuff around the lobby. They are really pushy and you have to firmly tell them you're not interested. The vendors in Mexico were nowhere nearly as pushy.The positives were the food, the bars, the weather and the entertainment and activities. Our kids loved the Explorers Club last year in Cancun Dreams, but hardly spent an hour at the club here... they're a little older now, and found plenty of kids to play with in the pool and on the beach.The ride to the resort was a bit of an adventure, but it's a different country and you have to be prepared for different things. It's a little bumpy and wild. One last thing, don't exchange your US $ for Dominican. You won't need it as everywhere we went thery wanted to be paid in US$. I tried to get some Dominican coins for the kids, and couldn't find any, even at the airport!

<Content>Not What You Pay For!!! Call in advance before you leave to make sure your room is still reserved and it is what you booked! It took my boyfriend and I 3 rooms until we just settled. Now my advice to you is DO NOT let the bell boy leave until you check out the entire room (the bathroom) to make sure it is right for you. The shower head stopped at the top of my head and I am only 5'2! The food is awful...stick to the chinese and Japanese but they are VERY SALTY! If you can not find a chair at the pool ask a grounds keeper and throw him a few bucks and before you know it you will have chairs by the pool. When going to the beach sit towards the left...the right is allllll rocks. Also we were told that this resort was on the Caribbean side which it is not it is the Atlantic...Pool is gorgeous...Bring enough sun block it is at least $20 in the store. The best excursion was Sonona Island absolutley breathtaking! DO NOT FLY MIAMI AIR...The plane is soooo small you can not move and we were delayed a total of 4 hours due to mechanical problems...kind of scary! I also went to Wal-Mart and bought the long floats for a dollar so you don't have to search the pool for a float and it was also relaxing to lay on the float in the ocean. Also do not be fooled this resort is not brand new it is only re-named. Remember fight for what you want...front desk will act like they have no idea what you are talking about and pretend they speak little english!!! We called this trip nightmare resort and spa...look into Iberostar or RIU. If you do stay here we had the best time at the lobby bar.. the bartenders were incredible and this is the only bar that serves Bud Light, Heineken and so on. We are 22 and 24 and were the youngest couple at the resort. They are doing it over so it might get better but it is very secluded! If you stay here I hope you have better luck then everyone we stayed with in February 2008.

<Content>Didn't Want to Leave Trip Advisor helped me before we went so I want to help someone also. We traveled with 4 adults during spring break week Mar 9 - Mar 15. This was not a spring break hotel. There were a few but mostly families and adults from all over the world. As Americans we may have been the minority, but it was no problem at all. First our ride was late at night and a little more than a hour on a bumpy road but bus was very nice and comfortable. No stops for other hotels, someone told us they stayed 15 minutes from airport and it took them an hour to get there due to so many stops. We were greeted with Champagne and sent off to our rooms. The only problems we had the entire time was regarding rooms. We traveled with friends and she is like Heather Mills (married to Paul McCartney) so maybe you can understand her handicap. We had booked together but our room was in building #9 and their's #7, both on 2nd floor. Difficult for her, so being so late we waited and told the apple rep the next day although we could not get rooms together they did moved her room to #8 on the first floor just behind #9 and it was no problem. Thanks Rafael. Then we had asked for a shower chair, they did not have one at the hotel and we were told to use a balcony chair, this didn't fit in tub but a parsons table from the pool area worked ok. Always make the best of things and try not to complain, some of these reviews are very harsh. The staff will try their hardest to make everything nice and it was. I cannot say enough wonderful things about the staff, no one passes you without saying Hola, they remember you and your drink if you go to the same place, totally amazing. They changed the chair saving policy the last day we were there so no more saving pool chairs until after 9am, thank goodness but we are early risers and did have to save before that. Weather 89 and gorgeous. My Husband and I did the zip lines and we are in our 50's. It was a blast. We asked apple rep about Saona Island and they said that they would accommadate the handicap so we went and they were so gracious, they picked our friend up and put her in the boats, it was so nice that she was able to go. Again Thanks Rafael. Casino very smal 31 slots and some tables but we managed to win a little on the slots. Food good to very good, remember that ranch dressing is not creamy white in other countries. We tipped here and there, seek out Wilson the bartender he is great and ask for his Mr Wilson specialty yum, Mango and something. Pool is exceptional, floats not a problem just look around. The beach is very nice and we took out a double kayak, very fun. Shows were fun and they make up for anything they lack with sooooo much enthusiasium, I'm not sure when they all sleep. So Thanks Dreams for a fabulous time and everyone just go and have a good time, thats what it's all about. I certainly miss this vacation already.

<Content>Wonderful Wedding on a Beautiful Resort My new husband and I, along with 31 family members, just came back from Dreams where we had the best wedding ever. This was my first visit to Punta Cana, and it definitely will not be the last. For the last eight months, I have been visiting this website to get any type of information I could, and for the most part everything was true. There were a few negative reviews that scared me terribly, but I guess you have to see it to believe it because I did not experience anything but exceptional service. There was one little bump we came to during check-in, but it was quickly resolved, and I definitely wouldn't base my overall rating on this one little experience. The Food: The good thing about an all-inclusive resort is the fact that you have so many choices. If you try one restaurant one day, and you didn't like it, then try another one. We always found something we liked. There are few people that had upset stomachs during the stay, but it's hard to say if it was the food or the unlimited drinks. As for myself, I never got sick from the food. The Staff: Wonderful!!!!!! Everyone is just so friendly, and by the time you leave, you will feel like you've made so many friends. The Entertainment: So amusing. During the day, there is plenty of poolside entertainment. We only went to one night show, which happens to be the same night my brother's girlfriend won the Miss Dreams Competition and a free trip back to the resort. The Beach: Beautiful. It is very rocky, but the good thing is that you can see the rocks. I loved just laying out on the beach and taking a dip in the pool wich is like 20 feet away from each other at the closest points. My Wedding: A fairytale come true! It could not have been any better. Juliana is amazing!! She exceeded all expectations that I had and much more. My guests are STILL talking about it. Overall, this has been one of the best vacations I've ever been on. I would most definitely recommend this resort to anyone planning a trip to Punta Cana, and I can't wait to go back myself.

<Content>Beautiful resort We went to Dreams from 3/8-3/15. This is our 3rd time in Punta Cana and 2 times with kids. Our kids are 3, 6  9. Last year we stayed at Club Med so we had some comparison. Our primary reason for booking this hotel was the fact that they had a kids club for 3 years and older. Overall I think Dreams is a nicer resort. The drive to the resort took a little less than an hour going to the resort. On the way back to the airport 2 of my kids started feeling car sick from all the bumps. The scenery is interesting and try to take it in. We did try to upgrade to the Preferred Club and was told that we could go into adjoining rooms both with outdoor jacuzzis but we would have to wait until that evening to check in but we could put our stuff in one of our original rooms (again we were going to have 2 regular adjoining rooms). That evening we were told the room wouldn't be ready until noon the next morning and they gave us the key to our regular other room. After not unpacking all night when we went back to the desk the next afternoon they had no what we were talking about and said they could upgrade us but not to adjoining rooms. That would not work with 3 young kids. We ended up staying in our original rooms and finally unpacking. The rooms were clean and since we had 2 of them didn't feel too small. One room would have been way too small for 5 of us. We ordered room service every morning and had breakfast on our balcony. It was very nice. They never got our order right but who cares? We had heard so many great things about the Kids club so we were looking forward to trying it out. We thought that it was terrible. There was definitely a difficulty with communication. We did not find this anywhere else on the resort. We were told we needed a copy of our sons passport because they did not believe he was 3. They insisted on keeping the copy in their file. They also told us that they don't change diapers. Fine we could live with that since they give you a cell phone if they need to reach you. We can always run back and change a diaper. We sent him with our older daughters so they could check it out for us. They ended up taking care of him the whole time. There were 2 small kids playing in the pool and walking near the pool when we checked in and we could not see anyone watching them. The kids area is really nice looking and looks like fun. However that day there were a total of 5 kids in the camp and we had 3 of them. They don't break them out by age so even if there were older kids they play with 3 and 4 year olds. Our daughters told us they did not want to go back. We tried sending our son again on Thursday by himself just to get a little break. When my husband went to drop him off he started crying a little and the woman who barely spoke English told him that they won't take crying children. He said he would stop in a minute or so once someone took him but she just stood there and said no crying babies allowed. She also looked horrified when my husband mentioned he still wears diapers and to call us if he needs to be changed. She refused to take him since he wouldn't stop crying. We did put the 3 kids in again that evening just to go to a nice dinner. He cried a little but my daughters ended up carrying him in and he stopped. This time there was about 7 kids in there. On our final day at the resort we went to get out passport copy back and we were told that they keep it and won't give it back. I argued with the woman for quite some time. She finally asked Marilyn that works there and Marilyn said she would give it back. At least Marilyn seems nice and speaks pretty decent English. She liked my son. We were very disappointed that the kids camp was so boring and that they gave us a hard time about our 3 year old. Maybe it was just a slow week for kids and it would have been more fun for our older girls. They all loved the kids camp in Club Med and they broke them into 4 or 5 age groups and had probably 50-60 kids minimum each day. Granted Dreams didn't have as many kids as Club Med but still for a resort this size we were surprised to only see 5 kids in the camp including ours. I wish we would have known before booking that they really didn't want 3 year olds. The resort itself is very nice. The pool is the nicest we have seen. We are big beach people but hung at the pool most of the time. The beach was a little breezy but we did hang there 2 mornings and 1 afternoon. It is clean and the water is nice. We didn't swim in the ocean because there was enough of a breeze to keep you cool. The guys that clean the beach will give you a fresh coconut if they have any. That was really nice. We did get a notice in our door on our last day about the towels on the chairs and how you can't put them on before 9am and if you do they will remove them. What we did after not finding chairs for 2 days was put our towels on 2 chairs right before bed every night. We also included a beach toy on each chair so we could find the chair. This worked great for us. One night my husband did see them cleaning by the pool but he gave one of the guys $10 and asked him to leave the towels. They were there the next morning. We had to play the game. It was very annoying to see all the chairs with towels and no one ever show up or they would show up after lunch. Floaties in the pool were not usually a problem. We did have 1 girl complain because our 6 year old got a floatie before she could get to it and she was mad that our daughter was using it. Again there are some floatie hogs that would take them out of the pool and put them by their chairs or use them on the chairs as extra padding. Food was good. A little inconsistent sometimes but still good. We liked the Sea Side Grill for lunch and the beach barbeque wasn't too bad. The fresh fruit everywhere is great. Loved the fresh fruit stand by pool. We ate at the Japanese but they wouldn't let us sit near the grill because they said our son was too little. The food there was good. Bordeaux was really nice and the restaurant is very pretty. The buffet was good but surprised that the food wasn't as kids friendly at dinner as Club Med. They managed to find something but thought there would be more for them. Some nights we could get pizza others you had sit in the Italian area. Drinks were great at all the bars. Nice size glasses with fruit garnish. Ice cream and popcorn by the pool bar everyday so that was nice. Entertainers were good and lots of activities going on during the day. The people we met at the resort were all very nice and the workers were nice. We did tip the drink servers especially the ones that would bring the drink to you. They come by all day long. Also left tips for some of the servers at the restaurants. We tipped out maid quite well and she had great towel art everyday waiting for us. Loved that!!! Really nice resort and we recommend it. If you are thinking of the kids camp please try it out and hopefully you will have a better experience. Just be prepared for not too many kids and difficulty with communication. They should advertise if for kids 4 and older not in diapers and don't cry when their parents leave them.We did have a major delay when we tried to leave on Saturday. Had nothing to do with the resort but is an Apple Vacation issue. It happened at the airport and we were delayed 15 hours. Unfortunately Apple never communicated anything with 178 people on the plane. Keep that in mind if you are using Apple Vacations. Don't expect any help at the airport.

<Content>Best All-Inclusive I've Ever Been To I used this site a lot to book my vacation so thought I should add my comments. I chose Dreams because it was rated best in Punta Cana for young children. It definitely lived up to that label. The Explorer's Club was phenomenal. My kids are 6 (boy) and 10 (girl) and they didn't want to do anything but go to the club. They did different activities every hour (e.g. bike rides, pool time, video games, mini-soccer table, sand castle competition, Spanish lessons, ice-cream parties, picnics at the beach, movies at night, mini disco, fashion show, soccer games, treasure hunt, etc., etc.). Outside of the club they had a trampoline in the ocean, an iceberg in the pool to climb, sports centre with ping pong, billiards. I could go on and on. There are a lot of activities for adults too.The grounds were immaculate, the restaurants were great (8 in total) and the buffet had a huge selection. As in any buffet there were some things that were just okay but I always found something that was really good. Honestly, there is such a huge selection for every meal that you can't go wrong.The service was really, really good. Everyone was very friendly. I haven't been to an all-inclusive in over 5 years but this one blew me away. Drinks served to you at the beach and by the pool. A fruit stand on the way down to the beach. Ice cream machines at the bars - my kids helped themselves to at least 3 or 4 a day - what the heck they're on vacation.We got a junior suite (room 8306) which while not really close to the beach had an ocean view, living room, walk-in closet, great shower, jacuzzi on the balcony, 2 tvs (one flat screen) and a dvd player. We booked through Flight Centre and Sunwing. It really wasn't all that much more for a junior suite (maybe $400) and while I didn't see the other rooms I understand from other comments here that they were small. The junior suite was not small.I talked to a number of people there and none of them could understand the negative comments on this website about this resort - except one and it's really hard to blame this on the resort...the saving chair thing was a problem. If you didn't have a chair saved by 7 am you'd have a hard time finding two together later on.As I mentioned, the last time I went to an all-inclusive was about 5 years ago at the Barcelo Maya in the Mayan Riviera which was a 5 star. I thought that was nice - this one was even better. Maybe they just improve every year.While I don't want to judge anyone, if people aren't impressed by this place, it might be because they had one or two things happen that just pissed them off or they need ultra-luxury - though I can't imagine needing more than what this place offers. I didn't find any nickel and diming though the staff really appreciated the tips.I could go on and on about this place...two sets of parrots, flamingos, fish. The pool was huge (though a bit cold for me). I don't normally find myself raving (I must sound like I'm getting paid to write this - I'm not!) but our whole family had a great time. I also found a lack of information on best resorts for kids so wanted to make sure I let people know that their young kids would enjoy this place. (I did hear some comments from older people that the place was a bit too big for them - there is a lot of walking.)Anyway, don't hesitate to go.

<Content>Greatest Resort Yet We have just returned from one of the best weeks vacation we have ever had. My son got married so we had the trip booked last fall. The wedding was beautiful (on the beach), well planned and carried out without a hitch. The people involved were very attentive to the bride and groom to make this a memorable time for them. The resort itself was wonderful, I can't say anything negative about it. The rooms were clean with a private patio (we were in room 6101. There was lots of pressure in the shower as well as hot water, and the beds were very comfortable.The grounds were truly beautiful, lots of trees and greenery everywhere as well as fountains and a pond with fish and flamingos. The pool was huge and looked very nice, but I wasn`t in it as I go for the ocean and the sand. The beach was great, and yes there were some rocks in the ocean but not a big issue to me. Ate most lunches right at the beach, the nachos were great. Lots of bars the favourite being the beach bar.Food was pretty good. We ate at the World Cafe the most and there was a huge selection, always able to find something good.Found the restaurants hard to get into, would have been easier if reservations could have been made, however did try the french one and it was very good food and service.The staff was very friendly and attentive right down to turning down our beds at night. We like to try different resorts each time we travel but would not hesistate to come back to Dreams should we return to Punta Cana, it was a fabulous place.

<Content>Amazing place....don't look at the bad reviews!! Anyone who writes a bad review on this resort should just stay home in North America....obviously they are just looking for an American style holidayWe have been to many different resorts and this is, by far, the best.....the bus trip is 55-60 minutes and is bumpy BUT you get a feel for the area of the island and see the way the local people live.....so relax and enjoy, it is NOT a problem and they are continually doing construction so it will get betterThe check in/check out and the service in ALL ASPECTS are all wonderful.....the rooms are great (people say small but how long do you spend in your room).....the food is the BEST we have had in the all inclusive resorts.....if you cannot be happy with this food you should stay home and eat more hamburgers and friesThe pool area is the best.....it gives you many different looks and now that they are addressing the seating problems it is great.....All the staff is friendly and helpful....I see people complaining about language barriers but we ARE VISITORS.....maybe we should try harderIf you enjoy beach walks you can go for miles to the north west (left).....the resort is about 2 kms along the beach from the nearest resort that way.....there is a run down/hurricane damaged resort just to the south (right) but, otherwise, you are isolated......there are no difficulties with beach vendors....there are a FEW around but they don't bother youAll in all.....it is a great spot.....don't be afraid and ignore all the bad reviews (those are written by people who must be VERY PICKY......)....if you have young kids this IS your place to goGood luck......we will go backJohn and Erin

<Content>"Dream" Vacation This was our first trip to the Caribbean and it won't be the last. The worst part of the vacation was the ride to the resort and Being from Labrador...That wasn't too bad.  Right from the start we were treated like royalty. We were greeted with champagne and hot towels. Our luggage was taken care of and the fun began. The staff was very friendly and helpful, the rooms were amazing with our very own patio  they were very clean. The only complaint I have about the food was that there was too much to choose from and we ate too much. It was all great. The beach is just like we see in the magasines...long sandy and very clean. The pool was to die for and was great to cool off in on those hot hot days.(we especially liked the swim up pool bar) The lounge chairs were hard to get but we caught on pretty quick and my Brother in-law got up extra early to save us a spot. There was always something to do thanks to the great and energetic entertainment team. I especially like Dominican 50 cent. He always made people laugh. They were all great and treated everyone the same. Our favorite hang out was at the Baracuda bar with Wilson the bartender...He was our favorite(or as he would say...Family) I can honestly say that this was my dream vacation come true and I can't wait to go back again. I recommend it to everyone. You won't be dissappointed.

<Content>"Dream" Come True!!! I have to say that I鈥檓 already planning my next trip To Dreams Punta Cana. From the moment I stepped foot into this beautiful oasis my senses were filled with fragrant incense and grand luxury. As I pulled up to the hotel I was welcomed with smiling faces and the utmost warmth. I immediately left my world behind and entered a tropical paradise which I can鈥檛 wait to return to.If you want to get away  Really enjoy yourself then Dreams is definitely where you want to stay. The rooms are situated near the beach and the serpentine pool which encircles the area. You can either sip on pina coladas and soak in the sun or you can participate in the countless, fun activities the staff has prepared during the day at the beach  poolside. Every night a very talented team of professional entertainers create a Beautiful show for your enjoyment. I have to say that the entertainment staff and management team is one of the friendliest, professional, hard-working, and multi-talented group I鈥檝e ever met. Can they move!!! I had the most amazing time with everyone and anticipate my next vacation. They made the trip most memorable(Happy Happy, Clappy, Clappy) and without them my vacation wouldn鈥檛 be the same. I miss them all already-Mickey Mouse, 50 Cent, Michael Jackson, Usher, JJ, Carlos, Harvi, Judy, July, Latecia, Louis, Bezil , Julio, Jose (hope I鈥檓 not forgetting anyone)The staff is so accommodating and the dining experience was Excellent. From a multitude of restaurants and cuisines from which to choose the food is delicious and very well prepared. The hotel itself is impeccably clean and the spa is ohh so divine.So, would I recommend Dreams? In a heartbeat!!!

<Author>mid-Canadatraveller
<Content>a review from "normal" people! Arrival - After a horrible trip that included a fog delay and loss of luggage (we were NOT impressed with Sunquest/Skyservice), we arrived in Punta Cana after dark. Everything we had heard about the road from the airport is true and much more. It is the worst and such a long ride (longer in the dark it seems). We were so relieved to find this beautiful resort at the end of the day. We had cold towels and champagne in our hands immediately upon stepping off the bus. Check in went very smoothly, although we had a bit of trouble navigating around the resort in the dark.Rooms - We originally were in room 2623. This was a very clean, somewhat small room. It had everything one could possibly need, including a spectacular ocean view off the balcony. We later upgraded to a suite (7314). This was a beautiful room with double balcony with jacuzzi tub on the balcony. There is a living room, bedroom with plasma TV, huge bathroom area with walk-in closet. The housekeeping service was excellent, always clean and supplies always restocked. Turn down service includes soft music playing, bed turned down, chocolates, etc. There is nothing like it to make you feel pampered.Restaurants - We tried all the restaurants and they were all good. We never had any stomach troubles at all (that's a first!!). The buffet was never too crowded we found at any time of day. The a la cartes had a no reservation policy which sometimes made for a long wait if you were hungry! But if the wait was going to be too long, we were off to the buffet. Our favorites were the shrimp martini at El Patio and the chocolate mouse at Bourdeaux - to die forBars - There was always a friendly face ready to serve you behind the bar. Premium brand drinks, lots of variety....what more could you ask for? If you couldn't decide what to have, any of the bartenders always had a recommendation.Beach and Pools - It was always a bit windy at the beach, so aside from chewing a bit of sand, the beach was beautiful. There are big palm trees as well as shelters for shade, and the sand is beautiful fine powder. The pool is definitely the drawing card for this resort. There are none like it anywhere! It just goes on and on and there are plenty of floaties to hop on and float away the day. The only thing is, this place definitely plays the towel game. Since there are no towel cards, people can pick up 6 towels and leave them at various places at the beach and pool. We saw SO many prime spots that were basically unoccupied for hours and hours, but with towels on the chairs. We're just not sure how to remedy this problem since someone will always start this towel game - towel cards or not.Grounds - The grounds are immaculate and very well maintained.Activities - There are any number of activities one can choose to do here. There were a couple of days that an activity was listed on the daily newssheet, but it never happened. Not sure what this was all about, but it was not too big of a deal for us.Tours - We did not take any tours this time. We hired a cab and went to Plaza Bavarro one day (did I mention that Skyservice lost our luggage?). This is quite a large mall, but with the same old stuff as always - cheapy, cheapy and lots of work bartering..Conclusion - I would definitely recommend this resort to anyone. We would probably not go back, just because it is far away from anything and the road is just SO bad. We felt it was just too much travelling time to do anything off resort. The locals say that it will take maybe four or five years to finish the new road from the airport to the resort, we we would try again then. The resort itself is spectacular, and just the right size. As always, we were amazed by the Dominican people - such a happy, friendly, beautiful people.

<Content>Superb hoel with excellent entertainment staff I've just returned from a 2 week holiday at the Dreams Punta Cana and can throughly recommend this hotel. The service is excellent and the staff are the most friendly out of all the hotels I have previously visited.The location is perfect on a long white sandy beach which you can walk on for miles. The swimming pool meanders through the whole resort so there is access form all the lower floor rooms.I am keen on exercise so was very impressed by the air conditioned gym which had free weights CV equipment and even swiss balls.Don't forget to take your trainers!The activity programme run by the very fit entertainment team was fantastic. very well organised and great fun.Ricky was Ace at step and aerobic classes very motivating and great music.Usher did a great yoga type class and was brilliant teaching the dance classes.50 cents did a fun aquaerobics.The shows were superb and the dancing was amazing . The only comment I could suggest is to do a 2 week rolling programme for those that are there for 2 weeks.The food was just excellent plenty of choice. I loved the world buffet but the speciality restaurants were also excellent.I would definately return to this hotel The hotel is as good as the staff working there. They all seemed happy and this creates a great atmosphere .An exceptional friendly hotel with a great entertainment team.

<Content>Horrible to Unbelievable! Just returned home from our vacation to Dreams Resort from March 8-14, 2008.I purchased our trip on Expedia.Com, which was the 1st time I had ever booked a vacation thru them, I had always used Apple, so I was a little nervous. Our arrival to the Punta Cana airport was easy, and Club Caribe (which is Expedia.Com's local representative in the DR) was waiting with a big sign with my family's name on it. They took us right to our own van - it was nice, airconditioned. A Club Caribe Rep traveled with us to the hotel. The ride there is exactly an hour long trip, and buckle in because it is like and hour long rollar coaster ride. Upon arrival to the resort, which the lobby is beautiful, check in was quick and easy. They have a lobby bar right next to check in so your spouse can grab some drinks while check in is going on. (At this lobby bar, you can get Bud, BudLight, MGD, and Heiniken-Awesome addition to the resort)Now the Horrible - Checked in to room #3329, but doors did not lock (and I have a 4 year old and 2 year old) so I was not going to stay here. So they moved my family to room #3323 - but the same thing once again, doors did not lock. So for the 3rd time in an hour, they moved me to room #3223-finally both doors locked. We went straight to dinner before it shut down for the night - We asked for Milk for the kids, but could not get any. I was a little hot at this point - 3 rooms, and no milk for my kids! We went back to our room to find ants all over the bathroom sink. I was so upset I called Expedia on my cell phone to ask to switch hotels. They said wait till the morning to see a manager - I said ok. I went to bed and at 2:15 A.M. - My wife woke me up screaming because someone was entering our room through the front door. I jumped up and started to shout and tell them this room was occupied - the resort had gave other guests room keys to check in to the same room. At this point I was over the top mad. At 6:00 A.M. I went down to the front desk and asked for a manager to switch hotels.I had them call Expedia.com from the concierge's desk and had a rep take all of my information of what had happened. While I was doing this a Manager came up to me and appologized for all of the mess the night before and asked us to please stay and she would make everything righted - they offered us an upgrade to a Honeymoon suite in building 7 at no additional charge for the week. The Expedia.com rep gave me a reference # and said to check it out, and it was my choice to stay or leave, they would take care of it for me. I went to look at the room with the Manager - room #7212. This is where my stay went from Horrible to Unbelievable. Wow! The room was Huge, and much cleaner than the previous 3 rooms. Definately a renovated room. Hot tub and flat screen tv, with a bed that could sleep 4! So much more space - for those who say your room doesn't matter because you are not in it that much, I completely disagree with you. Your room is what makes your vacation complete. If you can upgrade to a Suite, do it.Pool:Awesome! So big, and honestly, I did not have a hard time finding seats. We always sat in front of the Baracuda bar, which was ideal beacause it is next to the Towel center, the kids water climbing mountain, and it is where you can sit on the pool ledge with your chair, yeah - actually sit in the pool.Food:Average. Not as good as all inclusives in Mexico. The best part of food was that you did not need reservations with any specialty diners.Drinks:Great! Go see Wilson at the Baracuda bar, and have his Wilson Special! The also have a Dreams drink of the day each day. As I said earlier - Heiniken, Bud,BudLight, and MGD up front in lobby.Staff:The best I have ever been around for kids. They would never walk by our kids with out saying hello and playing with them. The Explorer's club was great! Kept my 4 year old having a great time.For my 2 year old, they had the Kids club down at the beach, she loved it. Only negative is that I wish they were closer to each other. The shows at night were very good.Beach:Silky Soft, brown sugar is the best way to say it! If you like to body surf go to the right of the resort and about 200 yards there will be a tree that sticks straight out to the water. I used this as a marker to swim at, because there was NO rocks at all. The only Sad thing, is that the beach is so beautiful but once you leave the resort, there is trash everywhere along the shoreline.Transfers back to the Airport was as easy as it was getting there.After the 1st Night - This resort won me over and I would reccomend this hotel to anyone (specially parents with young children).I hope this helps -

<Content>Wonderful Experience The accomodations were beautiful and relaxing and drinks easy to obtain. We were particularly impressed by the entertainment personnell, specifically Willie and Melkis, who went out of their way to make our experience fun and enjoyable. Their enthusiasm was contagious and encouraged many to get involved with their daily antics. We would certainly return.

<Content>Fantastic Holiday We had a great time at Dreams the entertainment in the day kept us busy so no time to get bored.Great entertainment team especially Stephanie,Joseph  Micky Mouse. The rooms and hotel are very clean  nicely decorated, the only complaint with them is the beds are a little hard. We upgraded to a honeymoon suite which I would highly recomend it as a jacuzzi on the balcony ,luxurious  very spacious with walk in wardrobe. Good selection of restaurants although sometimes food was not as hot as it could be,a good variety of food so always something for everyone.The staff were always very friendly and eager to please.I would not recomend to go horse riding as the horses are not very well treated very underfed(Emaciated ) you could see every bone in there body(they are not owned by the hotel it is an outside company that sell excursions at the hotel. My sister is now going this year to Dreams due to me  my husband haveing such a good time.The grounds are beautifully lit up of an eavening  they have ponds with pink flamingos.Every eavening they also had entertainment in the theatre along with varous bars and music also a diso if you could stay awake long enough after all the activities during the day,very relaxing by the pool and on the beach if thats what you prefer plenty of beds but you need to be up early for around the pool but always beds on the beach.

<Content>Dream Our family vacation was wonderful! The hotel is beautiful. The entertainment every night wonderful and the activities during the day were great! Joseph on the entertainment and activities department is especially great with interacting with the participants. He is an asset to your hotel. Every employee we came in contact with was always smiling, personable, and couldn't do enough for you. The resturaunts were great and the selections were as well. The Spa was very relaxing and nice. The rooms are nice with a balcony, table, chairs, and hammock. The beach is gorgeous with grasshuts and lounge chairs. The chairs were all out on the beach and around the entire pool to be sure to get one we would get up early and put something personal on it like a book, etc. Finding one away from your family or friends we would drag it across the beach in the sand. Having a beach attendant would be nice. Dreams is a beautiful resort for a vacation. Our family really had a great time.

<Content>Just Back from Dreams Just back from Dreams Punta Cana. This is our fifth stay at an all-inclusive. Previously, we have been to the Playa del Carmen, Mexicao area, but wanted to try something new. Dreams is about in line with the other 4 star resorts we have stayed at with a few exceptions. The food in the specialty restaurants did not require reservations, and was actually good! There were four of us who each tried different things. Print this off and use while ordering. I will tell you now what is good. Particularly enjoyed the French Restaurant (order the filet and the shrimp/crab appetizer) The grand marnier choc moose for desert is excellent. The Japanese was great food (the chef wasn't too acrobatic, but did his best to entertain us seated around the grill).. but excellent food. The seaside grill was just ok but the Rib Eye was great there. The Oceana was just ok, but the tenderloin and shrimp was great. Don't wast your dinner at the Italian or Mexican. The World Cafe (buffet) is pretty good on most nights. They have italian night which is great. Try out everything. The service at the resort was excellent. If you're seated anywhere for longer than ten minutes without being asked if you would like a drink, be surprised. Everyone is either naturally nice, or very well trained to be nice. You will get an ola from everyone from your room maid to the gardener. The rooms were just ok. The AC and water worked well, but they are showing a bit of aging. We upgraded to a swim out room for $60/night. That put us in a ground floor room in building 2 next to the main pool area. It was a great location to sneak back to the room in the afternoon without having to walk all the way back to a front building. Plus, we enjoyed a late night swim occasionally which we were able to do from just a few steps out of our room. The pool was excellent. Although if you want a chair with shade, you'll have to be up by 6:30 a.m. to get your pick. Even the chairs without shade are gone by 7:30, and you'll be relegated to a beach chair. The ocean is good, although most people were not swimming in it. I love to swim in the ocean and was there every day. This particular resort is about where the Carribean meets the Atlantic. The water was nice, but not quite the full-on carribean clear water which is an hour away from this resort. The temperature of the water was a bit cool (which probably kept most people out). Veer to the left side beach, and it is completely sandy and rock-free. No seaweed problem at all. Weather was great (we were there March 1 through 9). Rained a couple of hours about two of the days. We took the ATV excursion right from the hotel for 80 bucks. It was great fun. We also rented a car from a place just outside the resort. I don't recommend this, but we are adventurous. We drove all over the place and saw the real DR. You will have a wonderful vacation here. No regrets. I probably would not return, only because of the distance from Utah. (8 hrs of flight plus connection to the DR as opposed to 4 hr nonstop to Mexico). But, hey, we saw a new country. Plus, the service in the DR is much better than any of the Mexico Iberostars, Barcelos that we have stayed in. Enjoy!

<Content>Great Time Went to the Dreams with my wife and had a great time. I think you have to be extremely nit picky to come back and say anthing negative. The staff was extremely friendly. Everyone was happy and friendly, and the entertainment staff was always a lot of fun. They offer activities all day long and some are silly but fun and it breaks up the day if you choose to participate. But its all very serene and relaxing. They keep the grounds up very well and have flamingos and peacocks walking around, it felt so tropical and relaxing down there. The place is great if you want to have fun and drink or if you choose to kick back and read a book its perfect for that too, the complex is so big there is room for everything. Like other reviewers said, swim to the left on the beach to avoid the rocks in the ocean. As far as food goes, we were pleasantly surprised. The Oceana serves a nice lunch, the world cafe is great for breakfast - fresh bread, so good. I would avoid the italian restaurant, that was wasn't worth it. The mexican place was good, and the french restaurant - the Bordeux was my favorite, excellent food. We did the hibachi too, which was a lot of fun and enjoyed the food there too. The chef puts on a good show. All in all, you will enjoy the food, its very good, both in taste and in presentation. I think only the strongest of food critics can say anything negative. What I liked most is there are no reservations or wristbands, so you can go to any restaurant you choose anytime, and the wait was never that long. The entertainment is hit or miss. Some nights were funny where they had interaction w/ the crowd and some nights they just danced on stage, which can be considered far far off broadway, but they try w/ their nice costumes. This place is great for families too, as I noticed a lot of kids having fun in their explorer's club. They didn't have a bank or ATM in the hotel, so make sure you bring plenty of cash with you, for tips or if need cab fare. I would recommend sticking to the resort as the outside grounds are not worth seeing and the excursions are too far away. All in all I'm very pleased we went. The place was very beautiful, the food was great, and the staff were all very friendly and helpful.

<Content>Great vacation Had a lovely vacation at Dreams Punta Cana. The room was clean and attractive. We had a swim up room, so we were extremely close to the pool. This was an upgrade provided by the hotel due to the fact that they could not accomodate us the first night because they had overbooked the hotel. We stayed our first night at Sunscape near the airport. They provided the taxi the following day to take us to Dreams and supplied us with a voucher for the spa and VIP package. Although they were great to have tried to make it up to us with these extras, we still had to wait two days in a row until 3 p.m. to get our room. So it definitely was disruptive. The restaurants were great and all the staff we encountered were extremely gracious. Perhaps with the exception of one person at the front desk the day of our departure. I did have a digestive problem with something I ate, I suspect at the World Cafe.We were told that arrangements had been made by our tour operator that we need not vacate our room until 3 p.m. on our last day due to the fact that our pick up time was 10 p.m. When we were contacted by the front desk on our day of departure at 2 p.m. they told us we had to leave the room at that time. They did send us another bottle of champagne though. Altogether we had a lovely vacation and would definitely return to this resort.

<Content>Vacation In Paradise!!! Our Family recently returned from Punta Cana, Domincan Republic. We stayed at the Dreams Resort. Our family had an amazing time and plan to come back next year. At our resort there was an employee named Maycol Guerrero and he was a great help to us, and also a very good entertainer. We enjoyed his company every night and had a blast watching all the entertainment at the resort. We would like to Thank the resort for the amazing time we had and all the employees who made the trip worth while, especially Maycol Guerrero. Thanks again!-The Sloan Family P.S. We were wondering if there is anyway we could possibly get a hold of Maycol Guerrero to thank him ourselves and just to talk to him. If that is possible, please e-mail me, or have Maycol e-mail so I can send him pictures of him with us! Thanks again.My e-mail address:kata_sloan@hotmail.com

<Content>Excellent All Inclusive Resort We went for 7 days to attend a wedding held at the Resort. They did an outstanding job with the service and food. The staff is attent and happy. The rooms were nice as well. They cleaned every day and came at night to refresh towels and turn down the bed. The restaurants had great food and the beverages were delicious and plenty to drink. The beach was large with a decent amount of chairs. The pool was very large, clean and had floaties to relax on. The entertainment every night was fun. The Spa was reasonably priced and very relaxing. The only problem was the 1 hour drive from the airport. Otherwise I give this resort a 10.

<Content>Fabulous holiday We have just returned after having the most fabulous holiday. We normally holiday in the USA or Europe hiring a car and villa / apartment, so having total freedom so were not too sure about going to our first all inclusive holiday resort. Having said that the holiday proved to be ideal realxing break.The flight out on First Choice was excellent.The journey from the airport takes an hour or so and is an experience but not so bad as to put you off going.The hotel highlight had to be the staff, they are so friendly and happy to help with anything we wanted. The good thing for ourselves was that the service offered was excellent without the atmosphere being too stuffy with regards to dress codes etc. The bar staff were again excellent with no waiting times required at all. We found our room to be clean and adequate, not exceptional as it was not brand new but certainly better than most in Europe. We had a problem with the hair dryer and it was replaced within a couple of hours.The pool and beach are both good with quiet and lively areas to be found with ease.Overall the hotel was perfect for what we required, but we went to relax and did not leave the complex.

<Content>Best Hotel Ever We just got back from the Dreams Punta Cana resort complex and i can say that without resrevation that its the best holiday i have ever had. There were some aspects that weren't amazing but i'll get to that. I booked online so i wasn't sure which operator i would be with...in hindsight this was a mistake! My girlfriend and i flew from Manchester with MY Travel..possibly the worst operator i've had experience with! I had read some reviews  tried to upgrade to their 'Premier gold' status prior to departure but was unable but as we got to the airport early we were given the option. The 拢120 PP was well worth it, with extra leg room, free drinks  seatback tv's (albeit fuzzy  ageing) it made all the difference. The return journey on the other hand was a completely different story! The trip on the ageing arecraft was very uncomfortable  the overhead tv's were very poor quality. I think the worst thing was seeing a disabled man dragging himself up the steps of the aircraft when bording as apparently they'd told their rep that he could walk... The My Travell staff stood by  watched - HORRIFIC!! Anyway - beware of My Travel, Thomas Cook have just taken over  will no doubt continue to use this near obsolete fleet. Make sure you have $10 each to get in at the airport  save $20 each to get out. Just take dollars, we didn't bother with peso's  found that everywhere prefered dollars anyway.Anyway - to the rest of the trip, Dreams is about an hour away from the airport by bus.. make sure you sit away from the front so you dont have to watch all the near misses with oncoming traffic - terrifying! but once you get there you are greeted by one of the most beautiful lobbys i've ever seen! The staff are helpfull, friendly and polite.. if a bit overzealous at times. The rooms are beautiful and clean. We upgraded to a honnymoon sweet whiich had private jacuzzi  turn down service twice a day...in case you er..ruffle the sheets in the day for whatever reason..The pool was massive  clean but we found we had to get up at the crack of dawn to put towels out on loungers as there never seemed to be any free (be out at 6:30 if you want your pick). Also, if you want quiet, the area furthest away from the swim-up bar is best. There is another bar close by and waitresses to bring you drinks so you only miss the noise. The beach is idilic but again, be prepared to be up early to reserve the best. When it says 'all inclusive' it is just that! Every bar  restaurant, all drinks, all food, and pool towels. The bars have all premium spirits you'd expect in the U.K but the only larger they had on tap was 'Presidente'?? It wasnt bad but we stuck tto cocktails. Take small bills for tipping. one or two dollars, we arrived with only larger notes..expensive! There are a wide range of activities to participate in if you want  the spa is Excellent! go there on your first day if you can, you'll really get into holliday mode quickly. The massages are worth the money. There are a few trips to go on but would only reccomend the trip to Saona island - sail to a paridise island  power boat back. At $90 pp this was well worth the money!The complex is in the middle of nowhere really with shops. They were a bit overpriced but stocked the essentials. The non hotel sellers still got in.. apparently they pay the hotel to get entry. They were awful  spoilled the tranquility. They are pushy  will try to get as much money out of you as possible for what i can only describe as complete tat. Don't go near them - dont even browse, they dont understand 'just having a look' once you stop they wont let you go!There were a few negatives - there always are, the good things about Dreams greatly outweigh them. We are already planning a second trip there, which says it all really. (We just wont be going with My Travel)

<Content>OVER RATED My boyfriend and I just got back from a 4 night stay at Dreams Punta Cana. I was not impressed at all. I stayed previously at the Melia Cribe, So I had another hotel to compare it to. And there was no comparission. Dreams SUCKS! Dreams Hotel Lobby was beauitful, the grounds were nice, the pool was okay. The Pool water was a little chilly. The Beach was awesome. There was no rocks, the water was very clean and clear. The food was okay. But the thing I hate the most was the ROOMS. The rooms were small and DIRTY and VERY OUT DATED. Our room smelled very musty. and it was dirty. Not to mention, that we had the biggest bug i've ever seen crawling around in our room. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to any of my friends or family. I am by far not a hotel snub. I have never complained about a hotel ever or ever written a review. But after such dis appointment from this trip, and money wasted, I figured I should share my experience.

<Content>water volleyball, loved it We stayed for 7 nights, Feb 27 to March 5,2008. It was our first time at a all in-clusive resort and we loved every minute. The many choices of places to eat made it fun, I tried dishes I've never tried before and drinks I've never heard of before and it all was fantastic. The best part of the vacation was the friendly staff, they were always there with activities and getting all interested involved to play. I had never played water volleyball before, but on our 2nd day , we got into a game and we played everyday, always new players joining in at different times, we met alot of fun and interesting vacationers. Joseph and 50cent were our favorite employees at Dreams, they taught us how to dance some new dances, we were in the contest games they were doing, and just had a super time with them. All the employees were very friendly, helpful, and just fun to be around them.We recommend this resort to anyone, familys , honeymooners, and older folks, its a place for all ages to really enjoy themselves.I hope to get the opportunity to visit again in the near future.

<Content>Perfect DREAMS vacation! We had a great vacation at Dreams last week! A truly fantastic hotel. The only down side is that it takes 1 hour to get to it, but trust me, it's all worth it. Who cares if it takes an hour, you're going to be in paradise when you get there!There are 6 restaurants, each with great staff offering great food. We loved Himitsu the best. Make sure you visit the grill on the beach, we went there everyday for fresh hamburgers, if you're lucky he'll have chicken and pork chops too. There's also the fruit lady on the side of the pool, she cuts fresh fruit daily for you!The entertainment staff was amazing. They are funny and really know how to work the crowd. They work very long hours and are very committed. Go 50 cent! Make sure you participate in the activities each day, a great way to meet people and it's so much fun, and you get money for it! The shows at night were great, packed with lots of dancing.The casino is a bit small, but I don't think the hotel needs a bigger one. I never had a hard time finding a seat, but the dealers are very grumpy and some are brand new, so make sure to watch your cards and make sure you're paid out correctly. All the staff at the resort had smiles on their faces, except for the casino dealers!The beach was fantastic, stick to the left side, there are less rocks and it's also a bit quieter. All the beach activities happen on the right side. We had no problems finding chairs on the beach, and we usually got out there around 11am. The chairs around the pool seemed to get filled fast every morning, but when we headed over there around 3pm, we'd find some empty ones.Each buildling has it's pros and cons at the hotel. You may be farther away from the main lobby and show stage, but you'll be closer to the beach. We were in buildling #2, and loved it. It was so convenient to be so close to the room when you're on the beach.The rooms are always clean, fresh towels, fresh fruit, and stocked mini-bar. You must try the spa, it was worth every penny. The jacuzzi was great, we did the honeymoon package and it was very relaxing.There were no mosquitos at all on the resort, I might've seen only one or two. The grounds are kept beautifully.Our flight was delayed for 9 hours coming back home, but we already checked out and Sunwing put us up at the Bavaro Princess for one night and that hotel was disgusting. I don't know why expedia rates it higher than Dreams. BOOK DREAMS!!!A vacation will only be as good as you make it. This is a fantastic resort, easy to get around, and a guaranteed great time. I'd go back in a heartbeat.- Lucy Liu and Jacky Chan

<Content>Entertainment team--Excellent We just returned from a 7-night stay at Dreams and found the hotel clean and comfortable. What made Dreams stand out from the usual resorts was the fantastic entertainment team and the show people. Julio, Mickey Mouse, Usher, 50 cent, Joseph--They kept us going all day and into the night. I've never had so much fun. After the evening show, the dancers would come to the disco and continue the fun. Thank you Ana and Jolie and the guys whose names I don't even know. At the restaurants, the hostesses and wait staff treated us like VIPs. Sanchez and Carlos and Belkis ( the one who is not pregnant) at Oceana, thank you. And Roselia not only makes the best drink in town, she delivers it with a sweet smile to my spot on the beach. This vacation made a couple of 68-year-olds feel like kids again. Thanks guys. We'll be back.

The resort is very well kept and the rooms cleaned to perfection....I have never come across such a WONDERFUL staff....It started with the desk clerks, the restaurant staff, the cleaning staff and best of all the entertainment staff.....The entertainment staff was amazing...There were many activities from early morning until late at night when the Disco closed....They are so friendly and always so kind to all the guests.... They all have many different talents and Dreams gives them the opportunity to shine in many different ways.... They are all very out going and at all times keep the guests laughing and having a great time.... Joseph with his amazing voice, 50 Cents and Julio with there humor, I feel bad I don't have everyones names because they were all amazing....I could go on and on..... Everyone on the Entertainment group where GREAT!!! The restaurant staff were over the edge friendly and always very helpful....The bartenders were great, making all the kids those special drinks and keep the adults very happy...The cleaning personal took so much pride in there work it was always a pleasure to see them in the morning.... All I can say is that at this Resort the staff are definatly always there for you 100%.....If you decide to check it out, the key is to participate... like I said the entertainment personal are there for you everyday of your stay..... The shows in the evening are worth planning your night around..... and don't forget the many day time activities.....Would love to go back again!!! Thats it from Canada!!!

<Content>Loved Dream, GoTravel - not so much We booked our trip here with GoTravel. That would be my only negative. GoTravel advertised great flight times on there website, but they ended up changing them 4 days befor our vacation. We had to fly home at 1am in the morning (with 3 kids) and book another day off work (I've heard they do this a lot). Unfortunately, they tell you there is nothing you can do about it...so in the end we decided to suck it up and go with the flow. We did the 4 1/2* wildcard, so were to find out where we were staying when we got there. When we go to Punta Cana and stood in GoTravel line they informed us that we were staying at Dreams...but...they had no room for us the first night so we had to go to Sunscape for one night. We had decided to go with the flow...we were on holidays. Sunscape was a nice short ride from the airport, so the kids were in the pool by 1pm and enjoying the sun. Sunscape made the BEST margaritas I have ever had and their service was AMAZING. The pool could definetely use some upgrading and the beach was very crowded, but we were only there for one night. The next morning we put on our bathing suits, packed up and took a cab to Dreams (the GoTravel rep was no help with this, we were really left to figure it out on our own). From here on in the trip was AMAZING, we had a very exciting cab ride to Dreams, lots of passing and honking (which my husband and 3 boys thought was a hoot). When we got to Dreams our rooms weren't quite ready, so we headed for breakfast and the beach. Everything was beautiful. When we our rooms were ready we were pleasantly surprised that they had upgraded both of our rooms to honeymoon suites in the Preferred Club (yes my 13 and 15 year old had their own jacuzzi on the balcony and King Size bed). The service here was awesome, for our inconveniences they also gave us $100/room to use at the spa (so needless to say Mom enjoyed a half day there). My youngest (5 years) loved the Explorer Club and the soft ice cream stations at the bars. A great resort for kids, lots of games and acitivities. The food was good, no one got sick at all. Lots of room on the beach but if you want a chair by the pool be up before 8am or wait until the afternoon. We had a great time in the end, the flight back was a little painful though!

An absolutely beautiful setting, gorgeous beach, fantasic restaurants and the cleanest place we have ever been to !!! The 300 yard long floating pool is wonderful !! The service people are immaculate and sooo polite and helpful !! Probably the best Entertainment Team in the Caribbean ....who wouldn't love Mickey Mouse and 50-Cent !!!! We travelled with Apple Vacations and they were great !! The weather was magnificently boring !!...89 everyday !!! We couldn't have asked for a better escape from the deep snow of Vermont !!!

<Content>An Amazing Place Before I left for my trip I read dozens of reviews of Dreams written here. While most reviews were very positive I have come to the realization that some people are chronic complainers and are not happy unless they are miserable and complaining about something. Who cares if there is no internet in the rooms or you see a bug outside? You are on vacation relax and have a good time! That being said the resort was amazing and I have ZERO complaints. The Resort: The grounds are beautiful. The pool is excellent. The beach is clean and wonderful. The bars have top shelf liquor and there are so many things to do, water sports, dance lessons, pool games, etc. The rooms are good but who really cares because you don't go on vacation to sit in you room right? Don't bother upgrading to the Honeymoon Suite for an extra $100 a night. It isn't really worth it unless you plan on not going to the beach or pool and sitting in your room all day. Hey I can sit in my room all day back in cold New York. Food: The French place was excellent as was the Seafood and the Asian Restaurants. The Italian was pretty bad, I wouldn't suggest it. I didn't get a chance to go to the Seaside Grill or El Patio for dinner but I heard they were good. World Cafe (The buffet) was ok but keep in mind it is mass produced buffet food. Not great but not bad either. I wouldn't go there for dinner. Hit it up for lunch and breakfast but go to the Ala Carte restaurants for dinner. Drinks: The bars all have top shelf liquor, good Dominican beer and fast service. You order a drink and the bartender will remember you and hook you up the second you come back. Our favorite bar was on the one right in the lobby. Get to know they bartenders, they are all cool guys/girls. We suggest you try the drink called the Dirty Monkey. It is so good. Wait Staff: They were all excellent. They went out of their way to make sure to are happy. Always with a smile on their face and they alway remember who you are. They work very hard. I wish I remembered everyones name but some guys we loved were Nunez (who looks like Arod's twin brother), Manuel and Enrique. Tips: Tipping is not required but when you see how hard they work and how nice they are you will tip. We tipped everyone. They deserved it and it really doesn't feel like that are working just for tips. They really want to make you happy. This includes the luggage guys, front desk, maids, even the guys cleaning the grounds, everyone is so friendly. Excursions: Our tour company leader from Prieto Tours, Cesar was great and gave us some good insider information. We went to the Caribbean Festival which we suggest. I heard Catalina Island was not that good and the Cave one was very good. Entertainment: I saved the best for last. The entertainment was amazing. Daily shows in the theater, pool games and parties, beach games and parties. The dance staff is very talented and are fun to watch. The other entertainment guys Melkis, 50 Cent, Usher, Julio, Joseph and the rest were funny and fun to hang with. Joseph is one of the nicest guys I have ever met. He always came over to talk to me and make sure I was having a good time. Good times. When I left they all gave me hugs and I really felt like I was leaving my friends behind. Every night after the show they give a Meringue or Bahchata lesson then they go to the disco to hang out and dance with everyone. It was so fun when they were in there. They staff was by far the highlight of the resort. So to sum it up the place was amazing, with a reasonable price, lots of fun and well worth going to. I would go back in a heartbeat.Once again I don't know how anyone could have any complaints

<Content>50 Cent is the Man! I went away with 25 people for one week. While we stayed at Dreams we had a wonderful time! The reason we had a wonderful time was because there was one entertainer there who made sure my whole family was having fun! That entertainer was 50 cent! He was the best! He made our trip be the best trip we have ever been on. 50 cent works hard and works real well. He captured our minds and our hearts while staying at Dreams. He entertain my family at the pool, on the beach, on stage, and in the disco. He is an excellent dancer, and he is fun to watch. We all fell in love with 50 cent, his smile, his personality, and his entertainment. I would go back to Dreams Punta Cana in a heart beat because 50 Cent made our trip fun and exciting!

<Content>Dreams Came True In Punta Cana Wonderful! I had read so many reviews that i was going to change my mind last minute . We had stayed at Dreams in cancun last dec and it was excellant.Then after reading reivews for punta cana i got alittle worried. Boy am i glad i did not listen to them. It was my hsuband 60th birthday.On arrival loved the airport. The ride was alittle rough but i knew what to expect after reading other reiews. Not that bad,they are improving the roads. Upon arrival met orlando, who was so nice. He gave us such a wonderful room.Upgrated us to bld 1 with a view of ocean and pool and a jacuzzi. Check in was quick and easy. Our room was not ready so he told us to go eat .Staff could not do enough to make our stay pleasant. Always a smile,alway helpful. On my husband birthday odeila and Belkis had our table all decorated with flowers and a big cake with candles and about ten staff members singing . The rendevous bar with Jose(the banana man) and domingo and jensy and carillo alot of fun. The sugar reef bar great.(down at pool) pedro ,raul,jonathan and garcia great. Dave at lobby bar at night(adult only) was great and so much fun there. The entertainment staff and the pool guys were the best. The fun never ended with them. The down side is coral in ocean but it is not real bad if you stay to the left. The guest do hold on to the blue mats for laying on once they get them. But that is not dreams fault. They should just take them out. The food was great everywhere. Only one time was the rib eye tough but tasty. everthing else was great.I would go back in a minute and plan to go back with my family again.Do not read the bad reviews because it was great. They work hard and try to do everything they can to make your stay wonderful. great lady giving out fresh fruit. constant service on beach for drinks and great grill food.

<Content>Breathtaking from Seattle Washington We just returned from a wonderful vacation at Dreams in Punta Cana. What can I say but that it was outstanding, fun, and quite an adventure. I researched for months before I decided on this location and this resort and as the former guest commented, my family owes me big time!  We had an absolute blast and have never been treated so wonderfully by hotel staff and we have taken several vacations. Now, I will say the ride from the airport to the hotel was exciting and I just tried not to look forward at what might be coming at us as we passed! The ride was not as long as many have stated. I felt it took no longer than 30 minutes to get to our hotel. A big hello and thank you to the following wonderful employees: 50 Cent, Mickey Mouse, Stephanie, Enderson, and Francisco! Stephanie, if you are reading this review it's papas wife.  We took one outside adventure to Saona Island via a catamaran and what a day! It was an excellent way to experience the culture of the Dominicans and see how it really is outside the resort. This jaunt on a van and then a bus made the trip from the airport seem like kids play lol.  There is also a flea market about 7 blocks to the right of dreams, go there for your souvenirs, they love to barter. If you can go to this country and stay at this gorgeous resort do so! Hi to all the wonderful friends we met even those Republicans! lol

<Content>Perfect Family Vacation Just returned from 7 night stay. Traveled with one set of Grandparents and our 7 year old Son. It was perfect for all of us.The resort is absoutely beautiful and the pool is magnificent. Kept our Son entertained the whole week. Felt very safe letting our Son wander without constant supervision. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Standard rooms are very small, we upgraded to a suite which was worth every penny. Food was good but not exceptional, choice of drinks is by far the best we have expereinced at an all inclusive - top shelf available at every bar and restuarant.. Choice of restaurants is great and rarely had to wait more than 30 minutes for a table.

<Content>Outstanding To start off, with all due respect to those that have submitted negative reviews, I must say, either your not frequent travelers or nothing would make you happy so you should stop going places. Do not get me wrong, if you look really hard you can find things wrong, but my wife, our family, our best friends, and my opinons you would truely have to look very hard. Now to the review. If you have never been to the D.R. then just the airport alone will set you up for a true island experience. The thatched roof airport is wonderful to see as you taxi in. The road to Dreams is one thousand per cent as some have stated, right up there with the most thrilling amusement park ride. It seems the D.R. govt. does not put high priority on patching and repairing.However, the ride becomes very much worthwhile when you enter the gates of Dreams. From the moment you step out of your transportation to the moment you leave, you will be treated to some of the finest service and friendliest people you will ever meet. Suddenly you find yourself saying Ola to everyone you meet. Upon check in we were handled swiftly and professionally. We were offered an outstanding deal to upgrade our rooms which we took advantage of, at a wonderful price. While the paperwork was completed we had an amazing fruit drink made from pineapple, passion fruit, and mango juice.Got to cool off with a fresh towel, and enjoyed starting our Dreams Diet with homemade cookies. After completing checking in, we were lead into paradise Some of the most beautiful grounds that I have ever seen at any of the 50 plus resorts we have had the pleasure to have visited. Some will think that the distance between the lobby and the residence buildings is a bit long, but I found it a wonderful way to stroll through the lush vegetation and marvelously maintained grounds. Upon arrival at our room (our bags were waiting) we walked into a dream of a suite. Living room, bedroom, balcony with 3 person hot tub, and dressing/shower/walk in closet area. Everything worked and if you had the desire, the plasma television ( one of two) was a nice added feature. Of course our next mission was to visit one of the several bars and sample the drink of the day.. What can I say, the bar staff's are not only excellent at their jobs, but, a great source of entertainment at the same time. Drinks are fine, they do add a little extrakick if you tip. The selection of drinks is excellent, and the beer they serve (Presidente at the bars and Bohemia in the mini bars) is as good as any pilsner you can get. All the bars are very good.The restaurants are varied and so are the selections. Our favorite for breakfast was the World Cafe. (take an outside table if you can, they are the best next to the fountains). Lots of selections, however if you truly want FRESH WONDERFUL Fruit wait to go to the fruit bar next to the pool. (Pineapple or Papaya on a stick) When we had lunch it was at the Seaside grill, or the BBQ on the beach. Most of the time we found ourselves still full from breakfast and just enjoyed the fruit, and the best soft serve ice cream around. Dinner our number one spot, The Japanese is AWESOME, but come hungry as they give you more than enough to eat. Second, would be Bordeaux, EXCELLENT FILET. Third all the rest (exception do NOT order the steaks at the seaside grill, very tough) . I would suggest simply getting the house wine either red or white are very good Argentinian selections.The beach is outstanding. It is true you must go to the left for pure sand in the water, directly in front of the resort, you must have water shoes on as there are rocks that are not fun to step on. Plenty of loungers and chairs. To those that may be offended a warning, many of our friends from overseas due choose to go topless but this just adds to flavor of the vacation. The POOL IS well there is no word for it. How do you describe a neverending half mile of water that flows over waterfalls, has a huge iceberg for kids, a swim up bar and lazy lagoons for you to enjoy. Plenty of floats, the seating gets a bit confusing as there are the early rising lounge hogs that place their belongings on chairs at what has to be 3 am and then it is very customary to simply leave towels when you are done at the pool on your chair. After noon this gives the impression that the charis are in use, and they are not. BIG TIP if there is not a pair of shoes or shirt or book on the chair and there is only a towel, it is 99% not being used. Move the towel. As far as the entertainment, they work hard, they are not Las Vegas or world class cruise liner levels but they are entertaining. The Casino is just big enough to lose your money in, and the Disco is plenty big enough to dance the hours away. If you are going to dance till all hours of the night, go to Vegas, NY, or some place else. However if you think 2 AM is fine then you will be happy. After a full day in the sun your beat anyway. The stores are a little expensive, and the vendors they bring in can be a little aggressive but not any more than you will find at any of the islands in the Caribbean. If you want a deal, go to the beach and take about a mile walk to your left to Alexanders. After laughing that you have been told this is a shopping mall, you will fined this 2 room building has great deals on Cigars, both from D.R. and Cuba and island jewelery. DO NOT TAKE THE first offer, give them a counter offer of 50% AND THEY WILL go with it.Tiping of course is not encouraged but you just have to when you see how hard these folks work. With regard to getting ill. I did BUT it was my own fault and it sounds like I had the same symptoms as many of the reviews I have read. Guess what, it is called dehydration. Easy to get, go out in the sun, drink booze and forget about drinking Gatoraide or WATER and you get all the symptoms from visitng the great porcelin bowl to headaches.Would I suggest this for singles looking for other singles NO WAY. Would i suggest this for college kids looking for spring break NO WAY, but for families, couples, and everyone else 1,000,000 per cent yes. If you are open to truly meeting wonderful people from all over the world YES.Would we go back, the only question is when does the flight leave! Hope this helps you make your DREAMS come true.

<Content>Wonderful escape from Toronto winter! Just returned from a wonderful week at Dreams in Punta Cana. We usually prefer adventure travel but the rest and relaxation of an all-inclusive was needed and Dreams met all our expectations.We had no difficulties from check-in to check-out despite the resort being full to capacity. We arrived late, check-in was a breeze and our room was waiting for us. We were in building closer to the beach, which was a bit of walk to the main building but that was fine. The room was comfortable, clean and nicely, if a bit blandly decorated. We needed a room with two beds (they were doubles which was a bit small for a couple) and the room was also a bit cramped for three people. We were on the third floor, which wasn't a problem and we had a nice balcony with a lovely view of the pool and the beautifully landscaped grounds. The only real criticism of the room was the single door between the adjoining room which allowed for annoying transfer of snoring sounds, talking, TV and the smell of cigarette smoke. A double door would have provided better insulation. As mentioned the resort was beautifully landscaped with tropical plants, palm trees, flamingos and fish in ponds and parrots in the trees. All the buildings and walkways were immaculate and were constantly cleaned and maintained. There was some work being done on up-grading the terrace near the Sugar Reef bar near a the beach but it was quite unobtrusive. The pool, which runs the length of the resort down to the beach was wonderful for swimming and the design prevented congestion and crowding. Lots of foam mats were available for floating down the pool under the Dominican sun. The beach was good, with lots of cots in the sun and shade, bar service and a great barbeque. Still had to deal with the annoying resort practice of having to wake up before 8am to claim a preferred spot under a thatched umbrella (which we weren't always successful in securing) but there was also plenty of other shade on the beach and we never had a problem finding a comfortable spot. The ocean was pretty calm due to a close off-shore reef despite constant strong winds There was a problem with rocks in the water at the main beach but it was perfect in the bay just to the left of the water trampoline.The water was not crystal clear at the edge but there was no difficulty walking in past the sandy surf and it was great for swimming, floating or bobbing in the gentle waves. Also had some great long walks down the beach to the left of the resort.All the staff were exceptionally friendly and warm. Everyone made a point of greeting you with hola as you walked by. The wait staff in the restaurants were very attentive and tried hard to please, despite limited English. The entertainment team was fantastic and they worked hard, using their enthusiasm and Dominican charm to make the stay fun. We enjoyed the shows, the dance lessons and it was fun to practice our newly-learned merengue steps in the disco with these talented guys. 50-cent made a special effort to connect with my teenage daughter and that was great fun for her. All the staff work very hard, for long hours and for low pay. Tipping is not expected but much appreciated and we wish we had been better prepared with lots of $1 and $5 US bills, as it was hard to get change from the front desk.We went on one trip off the resort, the 'Outback Safari which gave us a view of the Dominican countryside and a glimpse into life outside the gates. Learned a lot from our very intelligent and knowledgeable guide. It was a fun day, with great boogy boarding at the end of the day. The only down-side of the vacation was the food. While it was plentiful and unlimited with great variety, the quality and flavour wasn't great. The wait at the the a la carte restaurants was often long and the meals disappointing. We had our best meal at the Bordeaux and our worst at the Mexican. It was impossible to get into the Japanese. Breakfasts at the main buffet restaurant were fine, although the size of the room made it very noisy and the decor could use some improvement. All in all, it was a great week away from the cold and snow and I'd definitely recommend Dreams Punta Cana.

<Content>This is the one! If you don't like this place you'd have to be crazy! My kids (4  10) say it best when asked, what was their favourite part of the vacation, and the answer is- Everything!Location is prime-set in a tropical jungle-no hotels beside you. The hotel itself is beautifully designed and the walk to the beach or your room is along a pathway of palms and gardens. The pool is a meandering marvel with loungers and covered huts along the way.The beach is picture perfect. Food was great and no reservations required. The kid's club was over-the-top fantastic-my kids had a blast. Special thanks to Marilyn and Clarabel. The service was outstanding (even though they don't expect it, please tip them, they work so hard and a few dollars goes a long way). You have to get a message at the spa - I was a marshmallow all day! Rooms are clean and comfortable and Solly always had a nice surprise for us when we returned to our room. The entertainment team has boundless energy - we haven't had that much fun or laughed that much in years.Thanks to Usher, 50 cent, Sephanie, Alberto, Melke, and Mickey Mouse! You'll find yourself saying hola a hundred times a day because the staff are so genuinely friendly and helpful. They really are the icing on the cake of this wonderful resort. Hello to Nelson at Hotel Beds - it was great spending time with you.Tours - Marinarium - Recommended - I've never snorkeled before (let alone, with sharks and stingrays) and I loved it. Not a great tour for small children as the boat ride back is a bit of a party ( O.K., a lot of a party!).Manati Park - Recommended - You actually got to swim with two dolphins for about 10-15 min. before the posed pictures - well worth the money. The other animals and shows were also good.All I can say about Dreams Punta Cana is that I researched the web for the perfect family vacation for four months, and I found it. My husband owes me, big time!!!

<Content>The Good, The Bad.... But No Ugly Here I was vacilating between 3 and 4 stars and decided on 4because it is PUNTA CANA. When traveling to the Dominican (4th time for me) you must realize it is a place where people try hard, the beaches are good, weather is perfect and food not the best. They are still a work in progress on the whole but their prices reflect that. So taking all that into consideration:Food: Better than other resorts. Breakfast buffet good. Not enough outside seating. Diners at the specialty restaurants are fair. Service always with a smile and ready to please. French best for romantic, got a good bottle of wine and appreciated how they tried. Lunch at the Seaside Grill always good. Never have a problem getting in anywhere as long as you dine before 7:00pm.Japanese, Chinese, French etc...I am from NY/NJ food is hard to beat. You won't starve and will always find something edible but forget gourmet.Rooms: Compared to the newer resorts small. Other resorts have all Jr. Suites (like Melia Caribe) at Dreams you need to upgrade. I did to building 6 which was located perfectly for me. Yes the third floor is best we stayed on the 2nd 6201 and loved the quiet, lani, and spacious room. Comfy bed, clean and newer. Turndown service and maid service was excxellent of course we always gave the girls a few dollars a day. Drinks: Excellent. Served top brands and always plentyfull. The beach service for drinks is outstanding again a few dollars goes a long way.Beach: Yes there are rocks in front of resort. Go left by the Turtle Trampoline and you will have great water and no rocks. Sand is fine and nice spacious areas, you can walk forever (yes you see garbage because this part of the island is still being developed and not cared for). Chairs are uncomfortable and need to be upgraded and many replaced. Get there before 10:00am if you want chairs as many people are rude and leave towels, never coming back so you don't know if there taken or not. This is where all resorts in Punta Cana need to work on. The resort has beach security patrol, their job should be to remove towels from unused chairs and if no one returns in an hour or so remove those towels. The plapas need to be redone (elevated too close to the ground). So yes the accomodations on the beach need updating. Grounds; Are maintained nicely, kiddie areas look fun, pool is long and winding with plenty of bars, seating and towels. There are nicer though. Again upgrades need to be done with cushions on chairs...but towels are pletyfull and they give them to you graciously.All in all a nice relaxing time. Would consider going back for the right price, however there is too much competition so I would try others...We did take the helecopter back to the airport to avoid that long bumpy ride and that is the only way to travel (if you can afford it) a mini tour is included!

<Content>Wonderful Resort Dreams is a wonderful resort, I don't see how some people rate it so poorly.Check-in was a breeze, I had called prior to reserve a 2nd floor room poolside, however it was not available unless I upgraded for $50/night - not worth it since you are in your room so little. We had a deluxe room which I found small and slightly outdated - this is my only criticism of the resort because everything else is perfect.The pool is amazing and always extremely clean. I was amazed at how long it was - it would take at least 15 minutes to walk/float from end to the other. Always plenty of floats to be found. I did have to wake up at 6:30 every morning to reserve our chairs though - this is not the case at the beach where you will always find some vacant ones.The beach is beautiful, the sand is soft and the ocean is warm. I would advise to go to the left of the boating equipment as the is no coral there.The food was great at the buffet, always lots of variety. The Japanese was good, Mexican okay, and French not so great.What we enjoyed the most was the staff - they are terrfic. Try to get involved in as many games as you can, some only take 15 minutes. Everytime you participate you win money that you can use at the nightly auctions to buy Rhum, Tsirts, hats, etc.They fantastic photograhers, had I known I would have planned for this. You can reserve a photographer and all you are committed to is to purchase 15 pictures at $10 each. This would be great to do family portraits on the beach. Would advise bringing white clothing for everybody. They had taken random pictures of us which you can also purchase for $10 each.Lastly, the kids club is phenomenal. They have a great facility with different activities planned throught the day and the pirate ship is up and running.

<Content>Too far to go This place was lovely and the staff was wonderful. The location is really far from the airport (1 hour) and although we're from NJ where drivers are crazy, they can't compare to the hell ride that we experienced. Mega pot holes during the last 1/2 hour, very poor housing for locals and lots of cow farms. We got there and the room wasn't ready on time, but unless the resort was full, they should have upgraded us. This is normal policy with other 4-star properties and I was surprised that it wasn't offered. The resort is large and you will end up walking a lot to get from point A to point B. There are a lot of food/drink options but this is not fine food. The best bet is the casual food (Surfside Grill) where salads and steaks, chicken and fish and chips were very good for lunch and dinner and the Japanese place (hibachi table) for dinner. We didn't wait at all and the service was excellent. Just bring long pants.World Cafe has the breakfast and you can't go wrong with that, but eggs cooked to order seemed to be the best bet. We got room service and it was OK. Fruit is excellent everywhere and is plentiful.Drinks are great everywhere and bartenders are really good. Tipping is appreciated but there are no hands out at all. The pool is really nice and you just float on a raft all day if you want. There were seperate areas for little kids and that was good too. We had a 16 year old daughter and I thought there would be more teens there. Not the case. Good activites during the day if you want to participate in that. I don't think there was much of a nightlife except slamming down drinks from what I saw.The beach is pretty, but ocean is super bad directly in front of the hotel (sharp rocks ankle deep) but I guess better to stay left as every other review says. It's clean right in front of the hotel, but if you're a beach walker, there's garbage on the empty lots all over. It looks really crappy and there's really nothing around.The rooms are nice, but tiny. Beds are hard. This kind of place is great if you are meeting another family or friends and if you have younger kids.Once the roads are fininshed, this place will be good for many, but I wouldn't go back to this Dreams location. I would stay at another Dreams, but Punta Cana wasn't my favorite destination.

<Content>Absolutely Fabulous! My husband and 3 children (9,6,  4) stayed at Dreams Feb 6 鈥?Feb 12th. We booked the Deluxe Family Suite but upon arrival we were upgraded to the Preferred Family Suite in Building 6. A very nice surprise. As noted in previous reviews, I do think your perspective on the resort depends on where your room is located. Along with our upgraded rooms we were given access to a Private Lounge Area. Vanessa, who manages the Lounge and Bernie the bartender were very welcoming and helpful in addressing our queries. The twice daily maid service was very nice and my children loved coming back to the room to see what arrangement the towels were in (swans, wedding cakes, bears, lizards 鈥?amazing). Room Service was also very quick 鈥?you will have to request a menu as they still did not have their new Guest Directories printed. The menu was very kid friendly, nachos, pizza, burgers, spaghetti etc.. A few times we ordered room service for the kids and then checked them into the Explorer鈥檚 Club for the evening. We would then have a nice relaxing meal knowing the kids were well looked after and having a terrific time.My children loved the Explorer鈥檚 Club. All the construction to the Explorer鈥檚 Club seemed to be complete and the kids had access to everything. The staff will give you a cell phone in case your child wants to be picked up. After I dropped off my children I would head to the beach or pool. It was bliss to be able to read, nap, stare at the sea and just relax. The ice-cream machine by the Barracuda Bar was a big hit with my children. It was self-serve and they usually put the cones out around 1pm. We ate most of the time in the World Caf茅. It suited our family as usually everyone could find something they liked and there was no wait. Bordeaux was also nice in large part to our waiter Rudy 鈥?you were fabulous, our wine glasses were never empty! The ride to the resort is as noted 鈥?very bumpy. It does make you appreciate your home and how we take smooth roads for granted. The towel situation is an adventure. You just have to go with the flow as there isn鈥檛 anything you can do about it. My husband and I took turns getting up early each morning staking our claim! (besides the towel, you should leave a book, t-shirt or some personal item).We also booked a full-day excursion with Outback Safari. We found it very educational and my children can still remember facts about the country that we learned from our guide. The resort was spread out and there was a fair amount of walking, but it was good exercise and who can complain when you have sunshine, warm breezes, and all the staff saying 鈥淗ola鈥?as you stroll along.The only area I felt could use some improvement was the evening front desk/reception staff. I really didn鈥檛 get the impression that they enjoyed their job and I wasn鈥檛 even at the desk to complain! I suppose they are the front line for all complaints and irritated guests. My moment with the night-time reception staff did not impact my view of the resort. I鈥檓 only mentioning in the hopes that management will read and hopefully address the morale. The staff that I encountered in all other areas seem to truly enjoy their job. Overall our time at Dreams was a great break from the winter and a fabulous place to take my family.

<Content>GRAND Please i hope that everyone can visit dreams in punta cana. I can not find one thing bad about it. The room, rests/bars, pool, lobby, and all things were so clean. I loved the food the best. the chicken was so wonderful and potatoes were grand too, it was almost like mom's. the deal my clients got was wonderful, i am a travel agent and i took them to see property, they loved it. i did not hear anything bad. when i got back to airport i heard lots of bad things about other hotels. Dreams is one of the best i have ever stayed in for all my vacations/business. They need to be 6 gold stars. food for everyone. thanks so much and let the staff know how grand they were. lee browning.

<Content>Dreams Punta Cana My wife and I travelled to Punta Cana Jan. 24th for 2 weeks. We travelled Skyservice from Winnipeg. A long flight.; The food was awful. Bring your own breakfast. It took 11/2 hrs. to get to Dreams.No special greetings on arrival. We were taken to our room (not what we had requested) in bldg. 9. The next day we were moved to bldg. 7, king bed, a large room, with a very hard mattress. They havn't heard of pillow-top mattresses. The beach is great. Lot's of palapas and loungers. The BBQ on the beach is small and simple, hot dogs, hamburgers, natchos and chicken. Not what you would expect from a 5* property. There are rocks in the water, so you have to swim in the lagoon to the left. The pool is large but people reserve their chair in the AM. Chairs become available about 4 PMThe grounds are beautiful, lots of bars with good service. The Ala Cartes are below North American standards. The mexican , the Chinese, Japanese and seafood are good. The Steakhose was awful. They don't know how to cook a steak. The French was very good. The Buffet was very average. The staff are freindly and want you to get involved in activities. Iberostar is a better resort

<Content>Dreams PC We stayed in Building 9 from 13th-20th. Enjoyed the beach and the pool (when the games were not being played). Building 9 should be only for families with kids due to its proximity to the kids pool and play area. Rooms were mediocre. Food was mediocre. Entertainment was OK. Staff, for the most part, were courteous and friendly but not particularly helpful with problems (another couple with us spent two days waiting for another room when their original had a leak in the bathroom ceiling). This resort rates more like a 3 or 4 Apple, not a 6 gold like it's advertised. One of the highlights was the beach barbecue - good food and it allowed you to stay at the beach all day.

<Content>Give them all clappy clappy I have not stopped bragging about what a great time we had. We were at Dreams for a week. It was magnificent. The staff was great.They made us( ,there were 6 of us.) feel right at home. The other 2 couples we were with had been there 2 other times.They convinced my husband and I that Dreams was much better than Mexico where we had been 10 yrs. ago.Well, they were 100%right. I would especially like to thank Julio for the great exercise classes he made it extra fun. Jose Banana for the great time at the bar. We loved listening to him sing and remembered our names every time.Willy started our day out at breakfast with a smile and a great cup of coffee. Willy was also there at dinner with the same smile and tequilla instead of coffee. Winston also was there at dinner making us feel at home. There were many many others that I'd like to thank for making our visit great. There was not one person that ever said a cross word. Thank You all very much . We are hoping to come back next year.

<Content>Not My Dream My boyfriend and I just returned from a six-night stay at Dreams, Punta Cana (Feb. 16-21) and although it was a nice escape from New England snow, after our trip to Aruba last year, we found the trip to be a bit disappointing. The hotel lobby is gorgeous and overlooks distant mountains that should be visible from more of the property. There are few shops, and the ones that are present are overpriced, especially for the Dominican Republic. There are no ATMs available and the front desk only could change money sporadically. There is also limited seating, especially when waiting for transport, when the lobby becomes crowded. Our room was not as impressive as the lobby. There was chipped furniture, moldy lamp shades, fraying towels, and not much room to maneuver. The maids kept the room clean but often did not replenish the refrigerator or the bathroom supplies unless asked. The bedding was damp, likely from the steam of the shower and humidity if the AC had been turned off before our arrival. The walls are also paper thin; we heard most of the conversations of our neighbors (and some other uncomfortable sounds) and the hallways and stairwells echoed loud children. The hallways of the buildings in spots are dark, and the tiled floors become extremely slippery when wet. Due to the ongoing construction, we also needed to plan alternate routes around caution tape when leaving the building.The pool was wonderfully clean and we could find private coves to swim, even during peak hours. The 鈥渢owel game鈥?is ridiculous, however. Guests wake up at 6 a.m. to mark their spots at the pool with the hotel鈥檚 blue towels. If you don鈥檛 get up by then, all the spots will be taken. Worse is that guests mark more than one location, and even move others鈥?marked chairs to take over a spot. Most people don鈥檛 even use the chairs they鈥檝e marked until mid-afternoon, so the space goes wasted. Many people also hoard the water rafts and use them as chair cushions. These small details become frustrating, and it was just too much work to create relaxation.All-inclusive here was a bit misleading since there were many amenities that in my opinion should not have been an extra charge. I felt nickel-and-dimed constantly. Any photographs taken by the professional photographers are $10 apiece, when a digital print can be purchased for 15 cents at home. They do not allow guests to take their own pictures with the animals they bring around to extort this money. I took the pictures for the experience, but did not buy the prints. Excursions, spa access and services, and a lobster dinner (which at the Bordeaux was worth it) all cost extra. We did not take any excursions because they are only run on certain days, and the Santo Domingo tour in which we were interested was a long 12 hours, which would have taken up the last day of our vacation, most of which would have consisted of driving on the potholed roads. The best part of the vacation was the staff 鈥?waiters, receptionists, and maintenance workers around the hotel. Everyone was extremely friendly (just say 鈥渉ola鈥?, helpful and willing to make our experience enjoyable. Some guests we talked with were frustrated with the language barrier, but since I speak Spanish fairly well, I had no problem communicating and receiving what I expected. The only lull in service was waiting for drinks and dinner. By the time I was served a frozen drink at the pool or beach, it had melted.The beach was the biggest disappointment. The trade winds cause sand to fly into the drinks, although the breeze is refreshing while sunbathing. On a purely sunny day, the water is beautiful and warm, but it was treacherous to navigate due to the rocks. Up to one鈥檚 ankles was the only safe spot to swim, and even there the water was stirred up with sand and seaweed.The vendors both on the beach and the hotel became annoying. We were accosted daily for horseback riding, to participate in games, and to buy merchandise. We were even insulted by a vendor in the central marketplace after deciding not to purchase a syrupy mamajuana that was thrust upon us in a shopping bag. This type of experience is not my definition of paradise. The food was decent at the Oceana, Seaside and Bordeaux but only during dinner hours. The World Caf茅鈥檚 food was always lukewarm at best. The mixers for drinks were horrible - stick with brand name alcohol. We got sick from all the food and spent most of our pool time going back to the room to the bathroom (not quite the romantic getaway). Dealing with this on vacation should not be the norm, and that is why I recommend another island 鈥?it will be worth the extra money.

<Content>Many broken Promises! Dreams Punta Cana was a big disappointment. I will never go back to the DR either, 5 people in my wedding party were sick for 3 days and could not even leave the room because of severe diarhea, and when we got back home, we realized that 3 luggages were ransaked at the DR airport, and they had stolen my bottle of perfume, an electric shaver, and some silver jewelry. The entire trip was a disaster.This is our unfortunate story: hopefully it will help warn others. My new husband and I stayed at Dreams Punta Cana along with 16 of our wedding guests the last week in January 2008. We booked our trip 6 months in advance to make sure all our guests would be accomodated, and to reserve certain things for the wedding day. Many promises were made, very few were actually kept. I thank God our actual wedding day went great, because that's what we will ultimately remember, because the rest of the week was spent arguing and listening to the staff blame eachother for all the problems.Some positives are that the resort is beautiful, the food was great, the wedding coordinator, the servers, the maids, and the entertainment staff were all great, THE FRONT DESK AND THE CONCIERGE WERE A NIGHTMARE, they were slow, extremely rude, and continually told us that its first come first serve! We RESERVED 6 monhs ago, people book in advance for a reason!!!Our wedding party consisted of several family members, singles, and couples. Not one request made was given.  - Everybody in the wedding party was also suppose to be in one building, yet they were all spread out from buildings 2-6.Checking in was hell. -People who wanted a king bed, received 2 doubles. And my single friends got king beds. - In my brother's room, the ceiling was leaking, (right above the fan!!!!) and his bed frame broke. -We, the newlyweds reserved a room on the 3rd floor, we got a damp room on the first floor! Nothing was right. It just baffles me that literally everything was the opposite of what it should have been. The rooms in the pictures look beautiful, well the reality is they are small, cramped and the lamp shades had mold all over them. It sickens me how they misrepresent everything on their website and in the travel books. Everyone was suppose to get a bottle of rum or wine, and a fruit plate in their room, only 1 room got it. We told the front desk 3 times during the week, and they continually said it would be delivered tomorrow, well tomorrow never came!!! No one got it. We are extremely disappointed in this resort, and the way the front desk and people in charge run things. They didn't seem to care at all, or even try to fix anything that was wrong. This resort advertises itself as a 4-5 star, it doesnt even come close.

<Content>Dreams is a lovely resort We visited Dreams the first week of February(3 - 10). The resort is quite similiar to the Majestic but with the vegetation being more developed allowing you privacy on your balcony.We had a deluxe room overlooking the pool. (building five) The rooms are adequate and clean but a bit on the small side (however we did not find it a problem as we are not in them very long). We did notice the buildings that contained the suites that it seemed all the suites were quite large with double balconies. We were offered an upgrade upon arrival (however we felt that it was not necessary and a bit costly $100/night). Many people have complained about the the half glass door in the shower, but that was not a problem (exactly the same style as the Bahia chain), however my problem was minor....I felt the tub was a bit to high off the floor and found that getting in and out was a bit hard (guess I will have to grow..LOL)The pool is lovely, very clean, and never feels full of people (with the exception of around the pool bar) it goes just about the entire length of the resort. They have a couple of special areas for the kids to play, along with many floaties available for your use. But I will say it is one of the worst resorts I have been to in regards to the towel game, however once again that did not bother us as we are always at the beach. I think this situation might be worse than previously as there is now no towel cards and guests are allowed as many towels as they want, therefore they can save seats at both the beach and pool.The beach is nice for its location as it is not on Bavaro beach. Tthere is coral in the water on the main part of the beach (not a problem if you had water shoes or were careful) but a bit to the left (by the boat rental booth)the swimming is absolutely amazing (nice sandy bottom). The food was also very good. The al la cartes do not require reservations which we found to be nice. We tried all the al la cartes (except the Oceana) and thorougly enjoyed them. The Bordeaux was my absolute favorite. The buffet as well was very good and you never had trouble getting a table even during peak times.The entertainment was also pretty good. We arrived on Superbowl Sunday and the resort put on a huge Superbowl party with the game on the big screen. It made you feel like you were at a football tailgate party. The shows as well were pretty entertaining, expecially the nights that the guests were involved.All the staff (bartenders, maids, gardeners, etc) are very friendly, helpful and quite fluent in English. Please take the time to speak with them. On my husbands birthday I left a note for our maid asking for a couple of balloons and when we came back from the beach at the end of the day, the room was completely decorated with balloons and flowers. What an awesome touch.There is some construction/upgrading going on still around the resort but did not find it to be bothersome at all. They are re-tiling the sidewalks in a few areas but it really is not inconvenient. There were also doing some replanting of some of their gardens. One night when we came home around 10 there was a very large crew of gardenders working on a garden in the middle of the pool. When we went by them the garden was completely empty and when we woke up we saw a gorgeous garden. Our room overlooked where they were working and we did not hear a thing all night long. It really is hard to find something wrong about this resort at all. The only negative we found is the drive to and from, it takes about 1 1/2 hours and the road after you pass the Majestic Colonial is very poor. I am sure once the rest of the road has been done it will be a much quicker ride.However, that being said it was a very nice 5 star resort.

<Content>We will be back again - very soon. My husband and myself recently stayed at the Hotel for almost 4 weeks. Having visitied the Dominican Republic on 7 previous occasions, we had had a good idea of the quality and standards the Dominican Republic had to offer. However, this Hotel exceeded all our previous visits. The Hotel is exceptionally clean and the maid service was reliable, consistent, friendly and EARLY. The food in the buffet dining room offered plenty of choice and was well presented. There were always tables available and no queuing required despite the Hotel being fully booked.The Entertainment Staff provide a varied daytime programme for people of all ages. They constantly have a smile and work hard to make your stay a memorable one. USHER and YAN were exceptionally professional and entertaining, and had a good command of the English language. The evening entertainment programme was varied and professionally executed by the Hotel's own entertainers and dancers.All the Hotel's bars served excellent quality branded drinks, and the bar staff were lively, entertaining and efficient.Security at the Hotel was exceptionally good, both on the beach and at the Hotel's entrance.The Reception and Concierge Staff were efficient, courteous and helpful .Our special thanks have to go to ORLANDO ELLIS, the Reception Manager for his exceptional service.The Hotel is well laid out with the swimming pool running the full length of the Hotel. There are plenty of pool towels.Some renovation of the gardens and walkways was taking place during our stay, but with the minimum of fuss and disruption.In all - an excellent holiday at an exceptional Hotel, and we would recommend it to anyone.

<Content>The Real Deal Think twice before booking. Check in was a nightmare. Rooms were not ready, reservations lost, honeymooners getting twinbeds and rooms smelled of cigarette smoke. People were getting room keys for already occupied rooms! Rooms were not cleaned until 6pm. We had to get up a 6am to put a towel on a chair. There were fights for spots. We could never get a spot at the beach. Young children swim with diapers in the pool with plastic pants over top. Food was not great. Staff are friendly and work hard. This is by no means a five star. I would rate it a low four star.

<Content>Travelers be Aware of Dreams Punta Cana Resourt I would like to share my experience about staying at Dreams Punta Cana Resort. When you pay about $1500 a person you expect a service in return that corresponds to this amount. In fact you get nothing even close. You planing to get away and relax but the most relaxed people at the resort were staff. My adventure started then when I opened a door to my room and found that someone have already occupies it. On my request to get a room I was promised, I was tolled that me, my business partner and her 6 years old daughter have to sleep in one bad. Another disappointment brought to me that fact that there is not going to be Internet in our apartment, in fact there was no Internet at the hotel at all. Even though it was advertised and when I called to the hotel from Toronto I was assured that Internet exists. Imagine for a moment that you run an Internet enterprise with all its client's emails, requests and accounts, you need to respond quickly if someone's credit card declines or your partner needs the monthly report tomorrow morning. Other than that the weather was awesome and the ocean was refreshing and relaxing but that had nothing to do with the hotel. My advise is - that you don't trust advertising, ask someone who's been there, someone who can tell you from their own experience what one particular hotel is like. As for me I will never jeopardize my vacation by going to Dreams Punta Cana hotel ever again.

<Content>Great Stay My husband, 3 year old daughter and I stayed at this hotel from December 9- December 9-15, 2007. It was still officially Sunscape the Beach, not Dreams for about another week. This was widely advertised so contrary to other posters, I was well aware of this change in name months prior to my departure. Also, it鈥檚 the same parent company, just a different brand. This was our first trip to the Dominican Republic but about our 15th to the Caribbean. We generally don't stay at all inclusives, we like to get out and about but wanted to do something like this for a change. We go to the Caribbean about twice a year and I travel extensively for work as well. For those in a hurry I will cut to the chase here and then give more details for those who would like to continue reading.Pros: Excellent staff. I can not say enough about how accommodating and hard working they are. I found no language barrier and had no issues with it and I have never studied Spanish.Very clean.Wonderful childrens programs. The Explorers Club is great- kids love it and it gives parents some free time.Beautiful and relaxing pool.Very good entertainment.Cons:Rooms on the small sizeFood in the specialty restaurants is OK, nothing exceptionalOne hour drive to the airport in Punta Cana.Resort layout is long and narrow so those who don鈥檛 like to walk won鈥檛 like it.Beach is ok, but not powder white sand like in other placesNow for the details. We stayed in room 3327 which means its in building #3 on the third floor. It was a standard toom. I liked being on the third floor because not only did I have a better view from my balcony towards the ocean, its quieter. The way the buildings are laid out, you walk down a center hall way to go through them so those rooms on the first floor have a lot of foot traffic going by them. There are no elevators, so if you don鈥檛 do stairs well, then request a lower floor. There is a lot of walking at this resort. The rooms are well appointed with robes, slippers, mini fridge, safe, coffee maker, line for hanging wet clothes, table and chairs on balcony, and desk. Everything worked fine. The room had two double beds which was fine for two adults and a toddler. I think if we had two kids or three adults it would have been a bit small. The maid service was always prompt and there is even a turndown in the evening complete with chocolate. My daughter enjoyed the animals made by the maid out of towels each day. Unlike other posters, our room was not in need of updating, it did not look dated.We ate at all of the restaurants except one which was closed for renovations. I think I enjoyed the World Caf茅 the best. It鈥檚 the buffet and is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I enjoyed it because there was always a wide variety to choose from and also always had something local as well like fried plantains. Although we never had a bad meal, the food was just average. I did enjoy the fresh fruit that was available during the day by the pool. They would slice it and put it on a skewer for you. I also enjoyed the fresh fruit smoothies made to order at breakfast and the fresh squeezed juices as well. The buffet also had a kids buffet which was shorter and had foods that cater more to kids鈥?tastes. The Explorers Club is free for kids 3 and up. I think the age requirement is strictly enforced as we had to show her passport on the first day to prove she was 3. You can get a pager if you鈥檇 like when you drop your child off. Kids also have to be signed in and out. They girls work very hard here and all of the kids had fun. They build sand castles, take them to lunch, and watch movies if its rainy. There is also a pool there with a huge pirate ship in it and a playground. In the evening about 7pm they take the kids to the stage in the main building and play games with them and dance on the stage. The kids love it and they are careful to include even the small ones. My child is only 3 so she did not always understand the rules of the games played (like musical chairs) and should have been out right away but the girls were careful not to make any of the kids feel left out. They included them all. I can not say enough about how much fun my daughter had. She still talks about it daily and no longer wants to go anywhere else on vacation.One of the days there it poured thanks to a late season sub tropical storm. I was very impressed with how the staff handled this as well. There were movies shown in the main building as well as a variety of indoor games that were very entertaining. I did not find any of the equipment to be old or broken and we did tennis, archery ( although there may not be an arrow missing as we managed to somehow lose one into the bales of hay), bocce, used the pool floats and pool towels, ping pong and used the radio controlled car. We also used the spa and fitness room which were more than adequate.I have never studied Spanish and I did not find a language barrier. In fact, I was impressed with how the staff could understand everyone as well as they did with English being a second language as there were guests from the US, Canada, UK, Germany, Italy, France, Holland and Russia while we were there. Yes, you need to speak a bit more slowly sometimes and not use slang but I never had an issue with not getting what I needed. Because of the rainy weather, we only took one day trip. This was horseback riding along the beach. I rode on the same horse as my daughter. It was a nice diversion and the horses were healthy.The beach could have been nicer, its not powder white but its still better than what we have at home. It was clean and there were servers to bring you drinks if you wanted.Entertainment- I鈥檓 not usually into entertainment and the shows when I鈥檓 on vacation but I did enjoy it at this resort. The staff is quite good, especially since some of the performers said their lines 3x in 3 different languages. They did hand out prizes to people who had won contests earlier in the day. You could do as much or as little as you wanted. My husband went to the casino a few nights and played the tables. He enjoyed it but the casino is a small Caribbean casino, probably not what most people are used to and the other players were not that competitive. Miscellaneous- We didn鈥檛 have transfers booked ahead of time. Its $60 each way by taxi. We did tip even so I don鈥檛 think most of the Europeans did. I tipped the maid about $3/day, I also tipped the bar tenders, the servers at the sit down restaurants and the girls at the Explorers Club. Would I stay here again? Probably not but only because I am the type of person who has to try a new place over one I鈥檝e been to already. I would stay at either a Sunscape or a Dreams again at another location.

<Content>Punta Cana Beach is PARADISE on Earth! My wife (32) and I (33) stayed from Sun Feb. 10th - Fri 15th. We are in the in between stage of our lives which I call beyond the 20鈥檚 stage and into the early 30鈥檚 where all day and night of drinking party days and relaxing recovering H2O days with quiet evenings are clashing. Our bodies can鈥檛 handle drinking and dancing at the disco every night while on vacation. By the third day we have to take a break and after that we coast the rest of the way :-) Our recent two trips in the last 12 months as experiences to compare have been to the Sheraton in Key West, FL across from Smather鈥檚 Beach and the brand new all-inclusive resort The Great Paranassus in Cancun, Mexico. Dreams resort in Punta Cana was by far the most amazing and better experience out of the three when comparing the beach (beautiful and natural), over all pool size (scenic layout), and amenities (adequate buffet, decent restaurants, free flowing top-shelf liquor, and hard working entertainment team). And if you like nature, you鈥檒l see plenty of it. We saw whales jumping on the horizon and peacocks, roosters, flamingos and parrots through-out the complex. The Dreams Punta Cana beach was a scenic layout of short and tall palm trees that serve as shade for people hiding from the sun like me during the hot times of the day, but plenty of sun spots as well for people like my wife. As soon as you leave the pool area onto the beach you get smacked with the most wonderful smell of food (cajun chicken thighs, burger, and hot dogs) being grilled on the beach every day at the beach food area. One can take long relaxing walks on firm, but powder soft sand while the waves splash at your feet with the most beautiful scenery up and down the beach lined with palm trees. There were plenty of chairs nicely spaced out on the beach so one does not have to be on top of each other. There is a beach bar about 50 yards from the sand, but if you are truly a beach bum (like we are) a waitress will come to you on the beach and take your drink order. There were activities on the beach, if you鈥檙e into that, like beach volleyball, shuffle board and merengue lessons. And if you鈥檙e not, it鈥檚 good people watching, especially the step aerobics at the beach bar where participants would often have a drink in hand. No need to bring beach towels, they have plenty.  The pool was a nice scenic and gigantic lay out with a very relaxing atmosphere. It twists and winds from one end of the resort to almost the beach. The chair availability situation is a nightmare. People seem to get up at sunrise and claim their chair(s) by putting towels on them even though they go half the day, it seems, without being used, because the person is probably lying on the beach. My advice if your thing is lying by the pool is to play the game as well and claim your territory bright  early. Lots of floats are available and again, a waitress can bring you a drink or you can stop by one of the many bars. The jacuzzis throughout the pool are not hot, but overall pool temperature was nice (not too cold or hot). Water volleyball and other games are often played for entertainment, but if you want a quiet spot, the pool is long and big enough, that鈥檚 not a problem. Kids won鈥檛 bother you either, as there are specific kid areas of the pool.The amenities such as the buffet, restaurants, and bars were good. The restaurants were decent. The Asian restaurant was my favorite meal experience if I had to choose a restaurant. The Mexican restaurant was my wife鈥檚 favorite. If you are a vegetarian minimal options are available (as with most all-inclusives). The buffet was adequate with the different options to get one through the week. The bars were GREAT. The bartenders make you any drink you want with all the liquor brands you desire, top-shelf included. You can bar hop throughout the day, as they start closing around 6:00 (from the beach bar, to the middle pool bar, to the plaza bar, to the theatre bar, to the lobby bar and finally the disco bar. And, if you like, you can hit the restaurant bars as well). The disco is very entertaining for late night dancing and it鈥檚 non-smoking. Although the entire lobby area allows smoking, it鈥檚 very breezy and open, so it鈥檚 not too bad. The entertainment staff works tirelessly ALL day and into the evening shows to entertain theirs hearts out, from dance competitions between couples, karaoke and broadway-type shows. You can earn 鈥渕oney鈥?for participating and buy something at the auctions they have, as well.The room was adequate and clean, but kind of outdated inside and small in comparison. We were in Building 4 room 4108, first floor facing the beautiful pool area. This is where our last two resort experiences mentioned at the beginning win out in comparison to the room situation. They do give chocolates and a schedule for the next day at turn-down service and is the only place we鈥檝e stayed that has two-a-day maid service. This being the busy time of the year in Punta Cana, I was concerned going into this experience from reading prior reviews about resort overbooking tactics. I don鈥檛 understand why when reviewing many resorts up and down Punta Cana, one of the most common complaints was travelers getting to the front desk from a long travel day to be told that the supposedly RESERVED and PAID for room was not available. DON鈥橳 let this happen to you. Call and/or Email resort customer service and get a written email that says they received your reservation via your travel company (expedia, travelocity, etc鈥?. We spoke to people that had this problem while we were there. Make sure you get a refund or some type of compensation if this happens to you. I hope my information helps and wish you all the best of times at Dreams Punta Cana. We would do it all over again in a heart beat and YES we would return to DREAMS in a second. Don鈥檛 forget to take $1 dollar bills and ask for a shot of MAMA JUANA :-) And take extra Pepto/Immodium, because a small bottle is $12 at the hotel pharmacy!

<Content>Wonderful We just returned on Friday, Feb. 15th. We had a fantastic time. The room was clean, and we found the staff very helpful. We enjoyed the buffet that was offered at the World Cafe. The food was good at the restaurants, but it took a much longer time. We went to every show event, and the entertainment was extremely good. What made our vacation so great was all the people we met from all over the world. We spent a great deal of our time at pool-side, sipping fruit drinks. We were, also, very happy with our pool activities' organizer, Vicky. She is the best kept secret at this resort...always happy and so much fun. We did not take any excursions, but we will the next visit. The weather was gorgeous. I can not think of one negative thing concerning Dreams. We will be back, for sure.

<Content>Great Time At The Dreams Punta Cana Dominican Republic We just returned from 10 days at the Dreams Punta Cana. We stayed in building # 1. We had a very nice suite with a magnificent view of the ocean and over looking the pool. The service was great. Winston our room service person was great. Whenever we needed something he was right there. Margarita our maid did a great job cleaning our room and making swans out of our towels. Juan our concierge called every morning to make sure everything was Satifactory. There were 7 restaurantsand the food was very good.Pool was very nice and the attandants were very friendly and right there with your next drink.Overall I would recommend this hotel. The beaches were clean great for our morning walk to burn off some of the Calories.The casino was nice but did leave our money there for someone else to win.Dan  Pam from Illinois

<Content>Excellent Entertainment Beautiful resort; great food; friendly  obliging staff; EXCELLENT ENTERTAINMENT! The reviewers are a Canadian couple who vacationed at Dreams for 10 days. The entertainment team hosted a wide variety of interesting activities, not all were physically challenging.Entertainment team who were of particular note were - Usher, Julio, Yan, William, Roberto, Joseph, Alex, Melkis, Stephanie, Vicki, Juan Jose (very talented dancer). This crew  others worked long hours, but with much enthusiasm for entertaining guests! Wide assortment of great food available in a number of dining rooms, varied hours  restaurants depending on time. All staff were very friendly  aimed to please. Bartender Pedro  others obviously enjoyed serving guests. Beautiful beach  well cared for resort grounds. The hotel room was lovely  when the patio door was open one could listen to the sound of the ocean:) All of this combined to make for a fabulous vacation - thanks Dreams!!

<Author>DreamsCameTrue
<Content>"Dreams" Came True Just returned from this resort on Feb 10 and had an absolute wonderful time. It was a mother daughter first vacation together and left us with great memories. We had not been to the Caribbean before so did not know what to expect. The 50 minute ride to the resort from the airport is an experience. Lots of pot holes in the road and dodging them made the ride extremely interesting. I don't think I would want to do the drive late at night. The hotel was lovely. The front desk was accomodating when we did not like the room we were first given. On the quiet side with no view. Did try to charge extra for another room but was persistent on not paying anything extra. Changed to a room with lovely view of pool and part ocean. Hard to see ocean with all the lovely palm trees needed for shade. The room was very clean but a little dated. I have stayed in worse in the North America. I would not want a room on the first floor because to get from building 5 to building 2 you had to walk thru the ground floor corridors of each building and it could be noisy at night for those who sleep early. Housekeepers did a great job. Note there are no face clothes in the bathrooms. The food was very good both at the World Cafe buffet and the individual eateries. Other reviews I read made me skeptical but I kept in mind this was not North America and it was going to be different. It met my standards just fine. The steaks at the Seaside Grill were delicious! The Japanese restaurant was entertaining and great variety but only has seatings for a set number of people at specific times so inquire first otherwise a long wait. The service at each restaurant was great. The fresh fruit stand was most refreshing on those hot days. Only had one bout of stomach discomfort. Took the Immodium Advance I brought and was fine. The pool was fantastic winding thru the resort and only three feet deep making it a water playground. You do have to get up early each morning about 7:30 to get a lounge chair. I would suggest not just placing your towel on it but put a book, t-shirt or bag on it as well so people know it belongs to someone. Now for the highlight of our vacation we give full credit to the resorts Entertainment Excellence Team, Alex, Yan, Usher, 50-Cent, Ricky, Roberto, Melkis, Julio, Paolo, Stephanie, Juan-Jose, Joseph, William, Edgar, Jose Tolentino, the female dancers etc. They work long days starting at the pool in the morning and afternoon with so many activities then at the theatre each evening performing and then dancing with guests at the disco. They have amazing energy and make everything so much fun. We spent a wonderful week with this team. They make everyone feel at home and make you want to participate. The week we were there it was windy and the water very wavy which was a bit disappointing. Going into the water you had to stay to the left of the watersport stand due to seaweed. The beach was great. If you turned left you could walk for miles - so peacful. A few locals trying to sell but you just say no gracias and they leave you alone. They should clean up the vacant areas beside the resort not too pleasing to the eye. Staff and guests continuously exchange a courteous greeting Hola making you feel at home. There is construction going on but it did not effect our vacation. They are trying to improve the resort so one has to be understanding of the situation. The horseback riding side trip was okay. A lot of the horses did not want to move too fast. The other trip was Saona Island where you drive for approx 2 hours (you get a chance to see the people and lifestyle). You take a catamaran to the island which I call paradise have a delicious lunch then speed boat back. It was a GREAT day. If you book your vacation thru a charter i.e. Sunwing make sure to book your side trips with your rep not other tour operators. Modesto from Sunwing was great and very informative. Biggest downfall was the horribly expensive telephone charges, do not call home, it's shocking. I wish someone would have warned me beforehand. Always haggle with vendors they are persistent or you will overpay. Tipping is appreciated. I brought a lot of U.S. one dollar bills. Remember to check your Sundial activity list each day that is left in the rooms so you don't miss out on any fun. I would go back to Dreams in a heartbeat. As women on a vacation alone in a different country we felt safe and at home there. If you do go to Dreams resort please say hi to the Entertainment Team (especially Mickey Mouse) for us ( Ashley and Marlene from Canada) we miss them!

<Author>dont-thomas-cook-it
<Content>Book with someone else, dont Thomas Cook it !! The resort and accomodation were excellent, we couldnt fault a thing apart from reception staff and a few rude barstaff but that wasn't going to spoil our holiday. 32 of us went to the Dreams hotel for my mums wedding, we all booked through Thomas Cook (appauling money grabbing company) and the Bride and Bidegroom booked through Signatue , as apparently Thomas Cook 'didnt do weddings', we all arrived at the hotel to find that 50% of our rooms were wrong and they were trying to make us pay (again) for an 'upgrade' to the rooms that we had already payed for. The wedding couple had payed extra for the honeymoon suite which had been double booked and it took them a week to get into their requested room. Thomas Cook reps were 'unable / unwilling' to do anything for us or the wedding couple and Signature didn't return any calls from the wedding couple, we had to sort it out ourselves. Eventually, when the rooms were sorted on the arrival day our holiday went down a storm with everyone, fantastic weather and accomodation (beware of the resident terantilla). The different restaraunts are all fantastic and very hard to chose between, none of us had one bad meal. Now that reps were a different story, totally useless, trying to get as much money from you as possible but not able to do their jobs correctly or give you the info that you needed, one rep, Nelson, from another holiday company however was excellent and all our trips, excursions were booked through him. Reps were very rude, hardly smiled and really didnt want to be there, when they were wich wasn not very often. Only other compaint / grumble would be the bar staff in the outside bar, very rude and ignorant but others were great. Entertainment for adults and kids was excellent and all other service staff were all very cheery, helpful, nothing was too much trouble for them, always smiling. Flights were absolutely appauling, Thomas cook cabin staff on outward journey were rude, unhelpful with the children, cabin was cramped for such a flight, looked more like a world war bomber than a holiday flight (food was appauling, make sure you are well fed prior to flying and take extras for the flight also).All in all, for the bargin price of 33,000 pounds sterling, a fantastic holiday and worth every penny......But book it with someone else though, DONT THOMAS COOK IT !!!

<Content>Beautiful Grounds - Rooms are Iffy I had many of the same experiences are recent reviewers during my stay at Sunscapes/Dreams (2/8/08 -2/13/08).My husband and I also had not known (along with our Travel Agent) that Sunscapes was now owned by Dreams. We discovered this when our taxi driver said, No, no, no, you are going to Dreams. Sunscape no more. Nice.Upon check-in, we are greeted with a fruity beverage (yay!) and we work with the check-in agent to secure our room. Our particular agent spoke English but I felt as if many times he did not understand what I was asking, and therefore, you couldn't tell if it was simply a language barrier or if he was being shifty. He tells us that we are in a garden view room and asked if it was our honeymoon (no). For $60 more a night, he can move us to an ocean room (no, we're fine). He then says that he will put us in the ocean room anyway with a king bed (why? To be nice?) and announces that tips would be fine. Yes, yes, I should have known better... but I figured that if this is a room that goes for $60 extra dollars/night, $15 is the least I can do.Well, we get all the way down to the beach (Building 1)... the nearest building to the lobby is Building 5, so it was quite a walk. We walk in and it's two double beds and the furniture doesn't fit in the room - like, the tv hutch is crammed in the corner, partially obscuring the bathroom door, the walls are scratched up and the entire room just looks very... Comfort Inn and not like any of the rooms we've stayed at on other resorts/cruises. I admit, I am a hotel snob... but this just seemed awfully average or adequate. On top of it, the extra lock on the door was ripped off. After debating with my husband about what to do (and feeling like an idiot for slipping the concierge a tip for this Great room!) we decided to call and complain about the broken lock/double beds, hoping that will lead to a switch. They send someone to fix the lock immediately, but why should anyone have to be in a room to begin with when a lock is broken? Long story short - we go back to the front desk, ask again to be moved, and our concierge taps around on the keyboard and finds a spare slip of paper and is like, OK, now you can go to room X in building 5). So we go there and open up the room. Unfortunately, it's a smoking room (we are not smokers) but there is a king bed, and while the decor of the place still screams Holiday Inn, it felt like a step up from the other room. We decide we'll stay here despite the smoky smell, because it was better than the other room. We decide to retrieve our luggage from the other room in building 1 rather than wait for the staff to. Huffing back to building 5 with all our bags, we try to get into our new room again and now - the keys won't work (whereas they worked 10 mins prior). I huff back to concierge alone and get ready to let my New Yorker self shine through. I ask what happened and he again taps on the computer and is like, OK, now you'll be in this room... I asked why I couldn't stay in the other room, you just put me there? He ignored my comment and was like, Your new room will be.... I made him promise that it would A) Have a king bed B) Be non-smoking C) The keys would work. He says yes and returns with the key. Lastly, he says Call me when you get back to the room. I asked why I needed to call him? So I can enter you into the computer? Why do you need to enter me into the computer when I get there, do it now. I'm right here. I didn't back down and he said ok. Again, maybe there was a language barrier but all the room switches, the calling when I get there so I can THEN be entered into the computer... just felt sketchy.It made me wind up feeling like we picked this sketchy place, where there's no guarantee that our keys are going to work or someone else isn't in our room since apparently, they're not entering them into the system. I was very worked up and unhappy.BUT THANKFULLY.... we went to one of the restaurants that night (overall, the food was very good for a resort. Artfully arranged, tasty, the staff was willing to provide you with as much as you'd like and the wait staff tried their best to be sociable and quick). The grounds are absolutely beautiful - lush landscaping, a pool that meanders from the lobby all the way down to the beach... and the restaurants were nicely decorated/themed.The resort did give the impression that it needs some modernizing updating with respect to the rooms. That wasour only complaint - the rooms were a tad tacky and while they were not dirty they didn't feel especially tidy. Sometimes stained or dusty lampshades, flat pillows, towels were not bleached so they looked a little drab, and overall look was just a little blah. But the pool area made up for our bad experiences. The beach was beautiful to see, however, the sand was not the bleached-white that we had in Mexico or other Caribbean places, and the waves were pretty rough/rocky areas in the water. We generally stayed mostly at the pool area.I hope that helps! While this wasn't the vacation from hell, I probably would entertain the thought of staying elsewhere if we ever visited the DR again.

<Content>not good Stayed at this resort with a large party for a wedding everyone was ill from the food the bars and entertainment was all shut by about 10pm and they were tidying up around you to get you out. We had a two week stay here and would have payed for a flight home early if we could we had a room on the ground floor facing the outside of the resort so we couldn't sit with the door open and had the curtain shut all the time to stop people looking in. I would not advise anyone to go here!

<Content>Nice anniversary trip to Dreams My husband and I took a 4 day/3 night trip to Dreams for our 10th anniversary. This was my first trip to the Carribean but my dh has been to Bahamas, Jamaica and also Mexico. Overall it was very nice. We booked an Apple Vacations package thru BJ's travel. First negative was the hour ride from the airport - apparently this is one of the furthest resorts. I will say though that it was very eye-opening to see the living conditions of the Dominicans - the poverty is very sad. We were a bit disappointed in the size of our room - it had a king size bed but that was about all that fit. I have never seen a King size room that small. There was no shower curtain so we had to throw a towel over dh's toiletries kit so it wouldn't get ruined! Room was spotless though. Pool was beautiful although we were disgusted with the fact that you had to get up early to claim a chair by the pool - we were away from our small children and the last thing we wanted to do was set our alarm! If you are an early riser this should not be an issue for you. The pool and grounds were absolutely beautiful. The swim-up bar was very fun. We were not wowed by the beach - it is on the Atlantic side. I grew up in NJ and we have vacationed up and down the east coast, this beach was no nicer than what we can get here. If you plan to go to the beach bring water shoes - we wished we had them. We took a full-day excursion to Saona Island which is on the Carribean side. It was AWESOME. It was another long bus ride but well worth it. True blue-green water, beautiful sand, you just had to be careful where you swam b/c of the rocks. We took a catamaran out (90min) while they played music and watered us with rum and cokes. On the island we had a beach bbq lunch, laid in the sun and swam, then took a speedboat back. It was extra $ but well worth it. Food-wise, we had some great hits and some awful misses. We ate at World Cafe for breakfast , lunch was on the beach and at SeaSide Grill and dinners were at Nimitsu, Bordeaux and Oceana. We also had dessert at El Patio which was awful. We found that any dish involving grouper was good. Others were dicey. We had no digestive problems at all - we only drank bottled water and it was fine. The staff was very accomodating, but language was an issue at times. DH speaks a bit of Spanish so that definitely came in very handy. Overall we had a very nice time, but if I was going back to PC I would try another resort for curiousity's sake. Rumour has it that Eden is the best on the island - we heard this from a couple of other Americans.

<Author>InTheKnowWestSussex
<Content>Its a gamble - you may not get a good holiday Firstly, let me say that where you stay in the resort will have an impact on your opinion of it. If you are lucky enough to have a room away from the renovations then you have a better chance of a good holiday. The problem is the building works move around the resort, how will you know you have a good room until you arrive, then its too late! So at the moment I would say stay away from Dreams until the resort is brought up to date. Don't gamble with you hard earned money!Thomson and Dreams did not offer me accurate info regarding the upgrade, if they had I would have changed my booking. Be warned. I too had a downgraded flight on the way back home, and no extras that were part of the package. Our rep was useless at the airport, she had no idea where to go or what to do. Thomsons you were rubbish!!!!STAFF:Generally staff were brilliant.They are the best thing about this resort. Entertainer Usher was great as was dancer Juan Jose, Oscar was a fab waiter!(Reception staff were not so good.) ENTERTAINMENT : Very good staff, fun, happy, full of energy. Best of any resort I have stayed in. Lots of activities in the day if you want to join in. Rainy days are no problem here. Evening shows were good compared to other hotels. Dave in the lobby bar each evening was fun in an adults only way. Do not go if you are easily offended.Movies in the Plaza were sometimes really good, BUT Dreams did not tell you in advance what was showing that day so you have to turn up and watch the tilte to find out! DRINKS WAITRESSES: Very good. Hard workers, friendly and helpful. MAIDS: Morning staff were not as good as the evening turn down lady. She was great, always topped up the fridge, left flowers and towel art, even music playing as we returned each evening. Tipped both ladies, but more to the evening maid. GROUNDS MAINTENANCE: polite, friendly - even the contractors laying the tiles etc. RESTAURANT STAFF: Generally good. Usually very polite, friendly and chatty, even with limited English on their part and Spanish on ours. They tried hard to offer an upmarket service despite sometimes limited resources and training. Always ask for a non smoking table if you are not a smoker!SPA: Saw some staff give free massages on the beach, but did not venture into the spa because of my upset tummy. Staff always looked clean and smart. Guests who had a massage on the beach seemed to really enjoy it. ACCOMMODATION: Our room was ok, basically I would rate this as average not luxury. A little worn around the edges, but good enough. Having the clock/radio to play my IPod music was a bonus. No guest or roomservice info at all in the room, this was a let down especially as we did not get the Sundial activities news letter for the first few days. The bathroom extractor fan did not work, the bath plug was too small so no bath option, no hand grips to get safely in and out of a high, very slippery bath onto a slippery tiled floor. The shower flooded the bathroom floor every time it was used. The toilet would not stop its noisy slow fill of the systern, which at night became an annoyance.Bathroom water is NOT safe to drink/clean teeth.The main area of the room was average. Clean enough but not sparkling. The two bedside lamps were badly marked with rust stains and the bed cover was also grubby, rugs were dirty and damaged, these could easily have been changed to improve the apearance of the room. I really did not like the plastic matress cover.Fridge is handy, filled most days with beer, coke, orange juice, water.In-room safe is free. Use it for ALL of your valuables.The TV has some english speaking channels, DVD player takes only USA region DVDs.In my humble opinion, swim out rooms are not worth the extra cost, access to the pool is poor unless you are fit and able to get in and out without steps. Also in ground floor rooms you get a fair amount of noise from passers-by walking from one block to the next.Jacuzzi rooms would be my prefered choice, much more fun for the extra cost. Get a high floor for more privacy and a better view!OTHER BUILDINGS: Sports bar area was fun, a little worn and the equipment was old but working. Electrical sockets are sometimes broken so be careful if your children like to poke around!Top lounge offers a great view especially on a clear day at sunset. Some furnishings were worn and a grubby. Lower lounge, was in need of new furnishings, very grubby.Entertainment area was good, clear view of stage, lots of comfortable seating. Shops, staff are friendly and not too pushy. Internet service was fast and reliable. Casino was fun, but as I'm not a smoker it was not a place I could spend any great amount of time. Disco was ok, type of music was an acquired taste. Best bar was outside French Restaurant, it had new seating/tables and a great view. FOOD: I will eat anything but found the food was generally disappointing. The World Cafe had the most honest food. Rarely did you get what you ordered as it was described on the menu in themed restaurants. The website and travel agents have built it up to be more than it is in reality. I got sick by about day 4. I found out that I was not the only one who suffered from tummy trouble. Be careful with hygeine, food and water. I thought other guest were being fussy asking for bottled water in restaurants, even sending opened bottles back so they could open their own. But who knows, maybe they didn't get sick?ROOM SERVICE: No info in the rooms which was a bit of a pain. After ringing round to get the correct number we placed our order. Quick service. Helpful, friendly staff. A fairly limited range of things to choose from - salads, burger, pizza.BEACH: This was generally clean infront of the resort. The sea was a bit rough at times. Sand was soft. Rocks are a problem in areas but if you stay to the left, close to the sports hut, the beach is good. BBQ at lunch was good but got a bit repetitive . Sea trampoline is for young children only, security will politely tell others to get off. Watching the sports guys land their boat is entertaining! You can often see shoals of fish in the sea, I also enjoyed watching a pelican diving into the sea and feeding on the fish just off shore. You can walk along the beach but you will get locals trying to sell you something. This can be a bit full on and gets wearing at times. If you go left on the beach you will pass a few beach houses, some are new and some are very old but interesting. Two locals sell art work, and there is access to a shopping center.POOL: Generally clean and well looked after. The lounger cushions were old/mouldy and need replacing. Steps into the pool did not always have their handrails, this limited me to where I could sit and still have access to the pool. Access to the pool area was a problem generally for me because of the ongoing construction between my room and the pool which either closed the linking paths or made it a bit dangerous to use. In the end I spent more time at the beach as it was easier to access.Fruit stall close by was really great! Fresh and juicy!Swim up bar is good, staff are very friendly. I did tip, a wet $1 is as good as a dry one!The usual lounger hogging is still happening, people are so sad! Water floats are fun, but again some guest stored them by their lounger all day.DRESS CODE: casual smart in the evening, casual beach in the day. No one really got dressed up super smart in the evenings. BUGS: surprisingly few furry creatures about, but mosquito found me quite regularly, ouch! Have to say I did see a rat on my very first evening, it was going into the outside water around world cafe, HOWEVER I would say that just one is good going for a large place like this in such a developing country.TIPPING:Hold a $1 in your hand at the bar and you will be served promptly. Try it and see!I tipped a $1 every round whilst watching the shows and at the beach as it guaranteed a good supply of drinks. A $1 every couple of rounds at the bar.Good service in restaurants got between $3 and $5. The three guys who sing at your table are very entertaining and will take requests, I tipped them $5 to $10.Maids were tipped $2-$5, most in the evening as this lady left flowers, set music playing and topped up the bar that the morning maid forgot to do. Great!Grounds staff are often forgotten, a $1 and a thank you are happily received. Buy a fresh coconut for a $1.Say Hola, take time to have a chat, be friendly, smile! These guys work long hours and generally are always happy to provide a good service. MAINTENANCE / UPGRADE TO DREAMS: The new planting of more shrubs / flowers was attractive. However, my experience was the construction work did impact negatively on my holiday. I could not use my patio area because our room was surrounded by construction work for almost two weeks. The connecting path from block 2, the rear path to the beach and the linking paths from our room to the pool were all being dug up, tiled, re-dug and re-retiled. It was very noisy (circular saw and digging) and dusty from early to late. As a result I had very limited access to other parts of the resort from my room. Had I been given accurate info upfront by my travel agent I would have requested a move to another resort. I wanted sun, sand, relaxation and not construction noise and mess! And for anyone who thinks it鈥檚 OK for hotels to do works during my holiday - it鈥檚 only OK if they tell me in advance and give me honest information! I was very much inconvenienced. TOURS: Lots on offer. However most involve a long journey because of the lack of good roads. I did not have chance to do any trips because of tummy troubles. I needed to be close to a bathroom. WEATHER: Changeable but good! It can rain at any time but usually only for a few minutes. It can be overcast but still lovely and warm. MARKETS: 3 times a week. After the first time I did not enjoy these. I bought jewelery but was always pressured to buy more which I did not want. I found the stall holders to be very pushy and in your face constantly, a pleasant no thank you did not always work. I ended up walking out of my way around the resort to avoid them. Also market stalls were allowed right next to the walkway/dome used for weddings. WEDDINGS: Lovely to watch, some were truly beautiful. I felt that the close proximity of market stalls and construction let down what could be a lovely wedding experience. Wedding parties on the beach were a bit intrusive for rooms in block 1 because of the noise.AIRPORT: too small to cope or offer good customer service. Crowded, manic, queues and more queues. Departure gates / seating areas are open to the runway and smell of aviation fuel, yuk!GOING BACK: Maybe, if in say a couple of years Dreams has managed to bring the luxury they currently boast to the resort.TIPS: Ground floor rooms get the noise of passing guests travelling from one block to the next. Get a top floor room if you can manage the stairs (no lifts). Avoid the rooms located next to the maid's cupboard as they are noisy. Rooms on the garden side of blocks 1 to 5 are in the shade all day. Maids are noisy, they arrive early and shout to each other along the block - be warned. Be careful with food to avoid an upset tummy, stick to bottled water. If you have mobility issues get a room in blocks 7 or 8 as you are half way to everything. Top floor rooms with spa bath on the balcony look fun! Ground floor rooms are not private enough to make full use of the spa bath . Take bug repelant or they will get you! lol At night, take time to look up into the sky, the stars are amazing because of low light polution here!Read the Dreams website through Caribbean eyes! Expect less than they say they can deliver.This resort in my opinion is not yet unlimited luxury as advertised!

<Content>Clappy clappy!! We Traveled to Dreams Punta Cana for our Wedding. There were 15 of us in Total aged between 3 and 58.We Flew Thomson Fly and th flight was good although on the way out we did not have seat back tvs. The in flight food and service was very good.The bus ride to the hotel was fine. Yes it is bumpy but not as bad as i was expecting. Maybe because we were in a large coach we did not feel it as much? It was an eye opener to see the typical Dominican houses. I found it very interesting and quite enjoyed the journey.On arrival at the hotel we were greeted with cold towels and cold juice drink as well as cookies which was a nice welcome. check in took a little while bus as we have 2 small children who were very tired our rep took us to the front of the line. We had booked a honeymoon suite and it was a very nice room in building 7 (one of the preferred club buildings). When we got to the room it was not set up for a family and we had to ring down and ask them to bring another bed and make up the sofa bed. It would have been nice if the room was ready for us but it was not really a problem.A few people in our party had problems with their rooms which were sorted out the next day and they were given free massages as compensation.The resort its self is stunning. The pool is breathtaking and the photos don't do it justice. It can be hard to get beds by the pool if you are not up early and people do hog the floats! The pool its self never seems crowded. you can always find somewhere for a quiet swim.The beach is also very nice. the rocks are not really a problem if you go further along the beach. The sea is rough here but it is fun playing in the waves. We could always find beds on the beach at any time of day.The resort is still doing some work as part of the Dreams upgrade but we did not find that this impacted on our stay at all.The food we found to be very good. The buffet on a morning is exceptional. There really is something for everyone. It s great to start the day with a Mimosa. We also ate here most lunch times and loved the toastie machine and nachos. We ate here on a few evenings and always found something we liked.The a la cartes were also good. We loved the French! and the Mexican was great to. We did not try the Oceana. Others in our party did and were not very impressed.the service at all the bars was good. the swim up bar was good fun. We tipped as they do work hard but i don't think this effects the service, it is always good. The staff here are amazing, a real asset to the hotel.They are always smiling and nothing is too much trouble. The entertainment team also work very hard and there is always something going on if you can drag yourself away form the pool. there are even activities in the pool for those who cant! We did some dancing lessons which were fun.The kids club was well ran and our son spent a couple of mornings there in our second week. There was lots going on to keep them amused but the staff do not speak very good English and i would not like to leave my son there all day.We spent a few nights in the disco and while it does smell a little musty it is not that bad and we had a good time there. We watched a couple of shows and they were also quite good. The sports bar did have a bad smell around it but you don't really notice it after mucho Rum!our Wedding was the highlight of the trip. It was amazing and i am so pleased we chose this resort. Everything was perfect and done to a very high standard. The reception meal we had was the best meal of the whole trip. The flowers were beautiful too. We chose not to use the resort photographers and went with a outside company based in Punta cana ,photosouvenir. They used to be based at this hotel but are now freelance. Our photos and DVD are stunning. We are so pleased with them and the service was very friendly and professional. I cant say enough about Fran the photographer i think our pictures speak for themselves.We did the Saaona Adventure and had a great day. I got to hold a giant star fish and standing in the natural pool in the ocean drinking a rum and coke was a great experience.Overall we had the most amazing trip I don't understand some of the bad reviews. I guess you could pick holes in the hotel if you want to but why would you. We though it was just about perfect. We will be back!

<Content>Easily worth the money We are just back from a weeks stay here, our first time in the Caribbean. To get to the point quickly, I cannot argue that this hotel and resort are worth what we paid - about 拢1200 for two including good flights from London, and overall it was a great holiday. We flew with Thomson, and other than terrible service from check in to landing, the planes were comfortable (33 inch seats), although we got an old plane with no seatback tv - on the way out it was for 'operational reasons', and wouldn't you know it was the same on the way back. In addition we had one round of bar service on the return flight, so buy lots of water when you can - the stuff on the plane is awful. The airport is very quaint and picturesque, although 5 flights landed at once so very busy - queues moved quickly though. The trip to the hotel was an experience, the roads are in a shocking state, and it was the longest hour of my life so far! Lobby of hotel is very impressive, and checked in by Maximo who was quick, friendly and efficient. We were in Building 5, two large doubles, reasonable comfort, fridge (stocked daily with water, Cokes and a couple of beers), air con and balcony. Not 5 star, but a good tourist 4 star. Bathroom was fine, decent size and hot water when required. We overlooked the pool, which is massive and very picturesque, although its only 3 foot deep for its entire length. Usual sunbed reservations during the night, towels appearing as if by magic. We were at the top end of the pool. away from bars and crowds. Waitress service for drinks on a 15-20 minute cycle. There are a number of choices to eat, we ate mostly in the World Cafe which is a buffet, pretty much always a good selection of mains and desserts, although service could be hit and miss - they were always friendly, but sporadic with repeat drinks and coffee. We tried the Grill for steak, which was OK - remember to take 'covered' shoes and trousers, I couldn't get into many restaurants with Birkenstocks or sandals. Its not haute cuisine, but for us it was good quality and a good selection - lots of fruit which was really fresh. Breakfasts were 'American', meaning pancakes, eggs any way you wanted and streaky bacon, but much more besides.The beach is very nice, but the water is murky and littered with sharp rocks, but there are plentiful sunbeds and shades, and a good bar which is the source of much daytime entertainment if thats your thing. Beach barbecue for lunch is basic but tasty.The bars were good, although the beer seems a bit soda-y, which I suppose works well for the volume drinker - good cocktails though! Hotel was populated mostly by Canadians, fairly light on Europeans which is no bad thing - they are as courteous and friendly as Americans but can drink more beer! As others have said, its quite enlightening to see just how materially well off we are compared to some of the locals, but in truth they seemed happier than us! Not many people left tips after meals, I can guarantee that $5/10 buys good service the next time you're in.No idea if the entertainment is worth seeing, in my experience it never is, so take your chance. In short, we had a great time, the resort is improving all the time, the weather was fantastic, service and comfort were good - I wouldn't hesitate to go back.

<Content>Preferred Club rooms not worth it. We stayed there End of Jan 2008. Check in. Not enough staff. We arrived with 2 other couples but it took over 20 minutes to get helped. We had originally booked standard rooms but decided to change to Preferred about 2 weeks before we traveled. Called and emailed ahead to do this but... Ask for Vanessa when you get there was the answer. Rooms. Nice furnishing but... The ceiling had moisture drops and the paint was peeling as a result off the AC blowing on it. Poor paint prep and work. Bathroom fan did not work. Because the rooms all have entries from a central hallway, there is a lot of noise that is transmitted into the room from ANYTHING that happens in the hallway. Be prepared for a constant 8 AM wakeup. On the last day there was a heavy rain in the early morning resulting in water all over the floor of the room. (1st floor). The bathtub may be a problem for some folks. The bottom of the tub is about 6 inches above the floor. Took a little getting used to. But without any kind of grab rail and tile floors, I suspect more than one person has slipped.Food. Needs help. Generally all of the restaurants served a variation of the same main ingredient. Although the tepanyaki restaurant was a nice surprise, expect to wait for that. The french restaurant was elegant but again the food was similar. Bring your own knife if you are going to eat meat. The knives there are butter knives that have been dulled. The buffett should have had more varieties of local flavor. If you like American you are fine. The Italian restaurant was a joke. I tried to get away from the same ingredient and tried to pizza with Bolognese. The sauce was actually chili. Never had bolognese with beans in it.Service. Slow to non-existent. At the pool or the beach expect to get your own. Inspite of an initial large tip at the start of the a couple of days, the return visit took forever. restaurant service was excellent in the French and Oriental ones but haphazard in the others. I suspect that most of the staff was new as most seemed poorly trained.Pool and Beach. The pool area is a little crowded. Not sure why. The beach was great and did not have problems with cut feet or.... Although I did not see any indications of raking or maintenance. The palapas at the beach need to be repaired. Many were only a couple of feet off of the sand. Otherwise it was very nice and relaxing.Entertainment. Very good dancing but very repetitive. I say boring.Other issues.All inlcusive did not include unlimited liquors or wine in the room, unless you called for a drink from room service. To get internet service you have to go to certain spots in the lobby. If you are club level that is free. Whoo. Very very slow. Not business user friendly.

<Content>Not too Impressed..... Went for a 1 week stay at the Dreams Punta Cana (formerly known as Sunscape the Beach Punta Cana) with my boyfriend. Must say that i've travelled to several All Inclusives over the years and was not too impressed by this one.I'm definitely not picky but for the price i paid, definitely did not get my money's worth.Ride From AirportThis is by far one of the most unpleasant rides i've ever taken. The roads are full of deep holes which are impossible to avoid.My boyfriend and i literally were close to being sick when we finally arrived at the hotel. The ride takes about 1 hour. Good luck.Check InCheck in was fairly quick but you needed to flag down a staff member or you'd be left standing there for a while.RoomsI had booked a Premium Room and paid extra but realized a couple of days into the stay, that all rooms were exactly the same except for the Honeymoon suites. I stayed in Building # 1 which is the closest to the Beach. The rooms were quite small and the bathrooms even smaller. There is no dresser to put your clothes in so be prepared to keep all you belongings in your luggage for the lenght of your stay.As soon as we arrived, noticed that the patio door wouldn't lock (actually... the lock fell off when we tried to open the door) so we immediately called the Concierge to repair it. They came with a stick which they stuck between the doors to avoid an outsider from opening it. The next day , the door was repaired.When we'd take a shower, the electricity to our room would suddenly shut off which made it quite interesting when taking a shower at night.Bed was comfortable and the TV worked fine so guess i can't complain too much.FoodThe food was amazing. From the open grill on the beach to the main buffet, I have absolutely no complaints regarding the food. The drinks were also very good.BeachSand is beautiful and kept very clean. Water is also very clean. The where huge waves during our stay but that didn't ruin the fun we had. What was really bothersome and the main reason why i wouldn't return (aside for the price we paid for this average hotel) was the rocks/corals in the water. We had read the reviews before leaving so thankfully we brought water shoes with us. You can't see through the water so at one point, no matter the direction you would walk in the water, you would step on corals which would literally cut your feet and or legs depending on the size of the coral. Many were seen walking on the beach with bandages and we all knew where that came from. Very unpleasant.The service at the beach are was great as there was always a staff member to come take your order. Tip : order a couple of drinks at a time because it takes around 30-45 minutes to get your order (if she doesn't forget to bring it).There were more than enough chairs on the beach for everyone.FaciltiyThe gym is great and the equipement is top notch.The property is still under renovation but that didn't bother us too much. However, the display and overal scenary do not represent a 4.5 or 5 star hotel. Very simple.EntertainmentAside from the Magic Show (which is amazing) the entertainment is ok and sometimes boring. Don't know if this was done purposely so people would go spend time in the casino but if that's the case , they should make it bigger as there was never enough chairs or machines .The entertainment Staff members are truly great and make the stay much more interesting.PlazaIf they recommend you to go shopping at the Plaza, i would think twice. It's located about 15 minutes off the resort. You can walk on the beach but then you need to cross on some sketchy path ways and meet intimadating villagers along the way. Not worth the trip as there are around 10 shops that sell exactly the same things.Overall, even though staff members go out of their way to make your stay as fun as possible, would NOT return to this hotel. Major improvements are needed. This is, in my opinion, a 3.5 Star Hotel.Places i've stayed in the past that would definitely recommend:Ocean Sand  Beach Gold Resort- Punta CanaBarcelo Maya- Riviera Maya-MexicoIberostar Hacienda Dominicus- Punta CanaIberostar Tucan/Quetzal- Riviera MayaPlaces i would not recommend:Dreams Punta CanaReef Club- Riviera MayaSol Club Cayo Coco- CubaHope this review helps .SoniaMontreal-Canada

<Content>Not My Dream On arrival we asked to have a room near our friends  were given a room half the hallway away. Our room was located in Bldg1 which is farthest from the main building and the buffet but close to the beach and pool. The room smelled like a musty basement, door trim looked as though it was kicked in and repaired with screws and the bathroom had wall repairs and was in need of work. We immediately complained to the front desk  were given a room next to our friends.These rooms are not the ones in the Dreams advertisement. The sidewalks were being tiled. The walkways surface levels change from where the new tile met the old walk. No warning signs and people tripped. No Lights on in the halls  walks at 6:30am. We used our cell phone light to see. The food was ok with our favorite being Japanese food. The staff were the highlight of the stay. Not much to do in the evening until the entertainment at 9:30pm. Avoid the Santa Domingo excursion. Four hours one way and not much to see there. I would wait for Dreams to finish remodeling.

<Content>Still a lot of work to be done to be rated as a 5 star. Just returned from Dreams Punta Cana Jan 26/08 to Feb 3/08. We travelled with our two children ages 17 months and 3 years.Transport to the hotel was 45 minutes although they told us on the shuttle it would be 1 hour 35 minutes. Check in was quick and easy. ROOMS: We booked a family room which was two deluxe rooms with a connecting door. We were very shocked by the conditions of the rooms. There are too many things to list but I will say that there were mosquitos everywhere, there was broken glass on the shower door which could have cut either of our girls, the tv was broken, there was mold on the lampshades and it appeared that whoever stayed there before had a fight and punched walls, threw things and broke the tv. We spoke with our rep the next morning and he assisted us in speaking with management. At first, management said the hotel was full and they would not switch our rooms. We got the impression that they felt we were being difficult and 'complainers'. We expressed our concerned and said that we would not stay another night in this room. They were not very receptive but after pressing the issue, they asked to see the rooms. There were four managers that came to see the room. Well, they apologized for the condition of the rooms, they told us they would shut them down immediately and they somehow, in the 'full' hotel, found us an ocean front imperial suite within two hours. The suite was very nice and spacious however it too was tired. It had its own private patio and yard area with private pool access and a jacuzzi on the deck. On our last day we requested a late check out and were given another room to move to. This room, was the nicest of them all and had clearly been given a facelift throughout, so we do know that there are 5 star quality rooms on the resort, but we didn鈥檛 see one until our last day. As for the rest, definitely 3 star until they are renovated.FOOD: The food at this resort was fantastic. The buffet at the World Cafe was always great and offered a wide variety. We also ate at the Japanese, Oceana and Bordeaux which we thought were fantastic. I had read numerous bad reports about Oceana and the seafood/fish but I have to say that we both ordered the beef tenderloin with shrimp it was awesome. We also enjoyed the grill at the beach and the buffet at the seaside grill. EXPLORER鈥橲 CLUB: The main reason we chose to go to this resort was because of all the wonderful things that we heard about the Explorer's Club. It is truly amazing. The staff were outstanding. They made an effort to ensure that your children had fun and enjoyed themselves. They knew our girls' names and always made a point of saying hola when they saw us. There were two play areas. One at the explorer's club and one by the beach. The beach one had a kiddies pool, sandbox and indoor play area. They also had a nursery with two cribs and provided a babysitting service for under 3 if you wanted to take the time to go for dinner or do an activity on the resort. We were all very impressed by the play equipment and centres themselves. The only disappointment was that the pirate ship was still being refurbished so my oldest daughter couldn't play on it. But to be honest she didn't know that it could be played on so she didn't miss that at all. This explorer's club alone is enough to go back to this resort. It really is wonderful and I can't say enough good things about it and their staff. It is also worth mentioning that they had a cell phone service where they would give you a cell phone and call you when your child wanted to be picked up.RESORT: Reports regarding the resort are all true. Lush gardens, beautiful pool, wildlife throughout. While we were there, they were constantly working to improve all aspects of the resort i.e. tiling the walkways and patios, refurbishing the fountains, landscaping etc. The work didn鈥檛 bother us much, but I do think that travellers should be made aware of the extensiveness of the renovations and should not have to pay 5 star prices to stay at a 3 star. They still have a lot of work to do to updgrade this resort and I would say it will take at least another 6 months to complete.SPA: Had 2 different types of massages (Swedish  Deep Tissue) but they were both the same. They were what I would say would be the equivalent of aromatherapy massages that you get here and were not completed by RMT鈥檚. Nonetheless, it was very relaxing and the spa was beautiful. I highly recommend it. MEDICAL: Unfortunately, we had to take our girls to see the doctor on the resort. I knew that the resort had 24 hour medical care but I didn鈥檛 realize that there is actually a doctor there 24 hours/day. She saw us straight away and could have also came to the room if need be. She was absolutely fantastic. She sent us to the private hospital in Punta Cana and I cannot say enough good things about the care we were provided with. Hats off to them!BEACH: Everything you read is true. The girls couldn鈥檛 play by the ocean because the waves were too strong. There weren鈥檛 any seashells to be found to pick. Sand was very soft and clean.In all, this resort has the potential to be a five star but does have a ways to go. We have travelled extensively and have stayed in other 5 star resorts so we can compare. I would go back to this resort only for the Explorer鈥檚 club and the wonderful time the girls had. If I was travelling just with my husband, we would definitely not return.

<Content>Disappointed/lots of smoking The resort grounds were beautiful and for the staff that spoke English, they were helpful. As far as kid-friendly goes...not for my kids. At 2 1/2 and 5 years old the only thing for them to do was swim. The pirate ship (*this was what really excited them*) at the Kids Club was being renovated and we could not use any of the Kids Club facilities ourselves. Plus the activities they did offer for the kids in the evening were very late (8:30-9:00). We never ate at any of the restaurants besides the buffet because my kids couldn't sit to wait for food service. The food we did have was good and fresh. Room service was a joke, there is no menu. You have to call room service directly and they tell you what is on the menu. It was very tough to get milk for my kids and snacks in between normal meal times. I finally learned to just take food from the buffet so I could give them a snack. The pool was beautiful but we could never get a chair or a float. People marked their chairs with towels and took floats back to their rooms at night. Really dispicable.Rooms were simple and very small. We had ants. The entire resort wreaked of cigarette smoke. If you don't like smoke, don't go here. We moved our room 2 times because the smell of smoke was so strong I couldn't stand it.All in all we were disappointed. Would we go back to Dreams???NOWAY.

<Content>Dreams Had its Good and bad I went to the Dreams Punta Cana - literally got back last night - when i got there i was exhausted from the LONGGGG ride from the airport. THEN when i got there, the front desk was in SHAMBLES!! they had no idea what was going on. It was like ok whats going on?!??! I was with my 83 year old grandmother who has trouble walking up many steps. Not only did they put 3 of us in the smallest room i have ever seen in the Caribean but they put us on the top floor with no elevators so my grandmother cant get up and down easily.Everything else was great tho - service with the staff WITHIN the hotel was wonderful, food was great, friendly people, fun activities, great entertainment team and shows. Really just overall wonderful. I would go back again if the ride wasnt so far and the front desk acted like they were there to help you. Went with a person who also works in a hotel and said she has never seen such bad behavior at the concierge. The beach however i will say is much nicer at the Bavaro beach where the Majestic is. There are dangerous rocks when you go in the water and yuou can easily get hurt, plus you cant see the bottom of the water until you are farther out, but you cant get farther out due to the dangerous rocks. BAvaro beach is very clear and nice and a shorter distance from the airportOne other bad thing: the internet cafe is only open a couple hours here and there a day and if you bring your laptop you have to deal with the ignorant front desk. You also have to call many times to get housekeeping to come to bring anythign to the room (towels, to clean etc etc...) Due to the ignorant front desk again since everything goes through them. ONe guy at the front desk Aris was VERY NASTY!!! very very very nasty. Most of them acted like they didnt want to help and didnt know what to do.

<Content>Just Returned Feb.1, 2008. Beautiful Resort We just returned from four nights at 鈥淒reams Punta Cana鈥?on Feb. 1, 2008.The resort is beautiful: manicured gardens throughout, a spectacular beach and a pool that runs the length of the facility. Everything was immaculate. There are flamingos, parrots, chickens, and fish in sculpted ponds. A great atmosphere for a relaxing vacation.I cannot praise the staff enough. Gracious and smiling they always made us feel welcome. While everyone spoke some English, communication could be a problem. To their credit they would find someone who could better translate when needed. The customer service was amazing. The employees did not appear stressed and were always happy to accommodate the guests. The activities staff was wonderful, even if a bit too familiar for my taste. Nothing inappropriate, but it seems their job included cozying up to the guests. All staff from the restaurants to the bars and beaches was truly wonderful. I travel often and this group went beyond all expectations.The food was only fair, but fine. I cannot recommend any of the specialty restaurants. We tried Oceania, Bordeaux and Italian. All were disappointing. The 鈥淲orld Caf茅鈥?buffet (something I never go to on cruises) was by and far the best choice. Fresh salads, fish, breads and breakfast smoothies were our favorites. The chicken at the beach grill and the fruit stand (mid-pool) were also very good. While not fine dining, there are plenty of options to satisfy almost anyone. The coffee with steamed milk (con leche) is addicting.The rooms are quite nice. The maze of buildings can be a bit confusing at first. We figured the extra walking helped work off the morning pastries. We were in building three, mid-resort. Maid service was good. We would return to find individual fresh flowers surrounding the sink and/or worked in towel sculptures. We left them a few dollars each day which was well deserved.I was pleased that there was NOT a rowdy bar scene. While some guests may have been serious drinkers, loud partiers seemed contained to a few outdoor bars. While I am not much of a drinker I did ask for extra alcohol when having a cocktail as they make very weak drinks. Bartenders were happy to oblige all requests.The entertainment was fine. This is not Vegas or Broadway but we never expected great theater. Enjoy it for what it is. The male dancers in drag were hilarious and all of the dancers were quite good. Jamaican Dave at the late night piano bar had us roaring with laughter as the guests took turns at the mike. Be aware his is definitely an adult only show and not for those easily offended. In all, a lovely break from reality. I could not do longer than 5-7 days as you stay within the resort unless you chose some excursions. While not 鈥渢ravel鈥? Dreams was a great winter escape.

<Content>Didn't want for anything I am so surprised that people could say anything bad about this resort! I have travelled to may all-inclusive resorts throughout the D.R. and Cuba, and this was by far the best!!! We travelled as a group of 4 ages 28-37.Where to begin....CHECK-IN: This was quick and easy. When we booked prior to departure, the regular rooms were full so we had to pay a bit more for a poolside room (which I highly recommend). Our friends who book before us were upgraded to a poolside room as well for no extra charge when we asked that our rooms be close to each other.BEACH: The beach was fantastic and beautiful. It is true that if you go a bit to the left of the rental area you will have a better experience, but overall the water was wavy and fun and a nice refreshing temperature. The chairs were not very comfortable, so we mostly parked ourselves by the pool for tanning, but would wander to the ocean periodically to take a dip. There is a BBQ daily on the beach which has hot dogs, burgers, nachos, pork chops, chicken, etc. which was convenient and enjoyable. We walked down the beach one day and travelled to the second vendor who had A LOT of artwork that was really neat! Be sure to haggle and be persistant with this guy, as he will go down in price (as most shopping in this country). But my friends and I were all satisfied with our purchases. Not everyone had intended to buy stuff on our outing, so the one guy (forget his name, but very kind) walked with us back to the peramitor of the hotel and waited while we got the cash. We also grabbed him some food, pop and beer which he greatly appreciated.ROOMS: Our room was fantastic. The alarm clock has a dock to connect your MP3 so you can listen to your own music without having to bring a ghetto blaster, which is what I used to do. There is also a DVD player in the room, so you can bring a DVD or two in case you want to relax or whatever, but you can also rent a movie in the internet cafe store. The shower water was consistantly hot... even for the 2 hours that I passed out in there (don't ask... too many shots of mamajuana the 2nd day of the trip). There was a telephone by the bed, and in the washroom. They have a half-decent hair dryer also. The bed was stiff, but I've found that consistantly on most vacations, but there was no shortage of pillows which I find helps compensate. There was also a couch with a little table which was neat. The mini-fridge in the room came stocked with bottles of coke, sprite, water, beer and an orange juice box. The fridge was restocked daily, and if you wanted for any more of the fridge items, you could easily find a housekeeping cart in the hallway to get extra, or just ask any of the staff in the housekeeping area. They gladly gave me anything extra that I requested. Also, each evening housekeeping would deliver a newsletter with all of the happenings for the following day, including the temperature and 2 chocolates. If you weren't in the room they would also turn down the sheets and turn on some soothing music on the alarm clock for your return which was kinda neat!FOOD: For anybody who has travelled to this country before, you will know that Dominican food is not the most flavourful, but I found this resort to be quite impressive. There were 7 restaurants, plus the buffet and the beach bbq. The atmosphere of the Chinese, Japanese and Mexican restaurants were most thematic and enjoyable. My favourite meal was the stir-fry at the buffet.... absolutely delicious because they had hot sauce and it made a delightful meal! It is true that there is not much seafood at this hotel, but there were some dishes at the buffet that incorporated shrimp, lobster and other items. I wonder if this was not a good area for seafood. I forget the guys name in the Chinese restaurant, but he was very accomodating... we had finished dinner at the Tapanyaki tables and when offered the 3 dessert choices a few people in our group asked if he had any cheesecake. He returned a while later with an entire cheesecake for our table that was topped with a cute little chocolate duck! It was fantastic!!!NIGHTLY ENTERTAINMENT: The shows at this hotel were of a good variety. Most places I've been they only had the entertainment team performing, but Dreams had one night karaoke, one night with a magician (who was quite impressive), 2 nights with outside performers/dancers and live bands. The shows were great! After the show you could either hit the casino, go to the disco or head up to the piano bar in the main lobby where they had karaoke with a piano player. The disco was fun and the music was mixed between latin and american. There were also a few nights where there were events in the disco that were pretty funny!DAYTIME ENTERTAINMENT: This place has the most exciting daytime entertainment I've ever experienced, I just wish I'd known the details before I got there as I wasn't privy to the ways to win until my third day! GET INVOLVED IN THE DAILY EVENTS!!! They have Dreams money at this resort which you can actually use to get things! Everything that you participate in, you get Money, Money which you can use in one of the auctions. They have 3 auctions a week where you can bid on things such as t-shirts and hats, bags, 25-minute massages, horseback riding excursions and more! So PARTICIPATE and you really can get stuff with that money. ALSO... if you participate in something where there can be a winner (or weiner, as it sounds with their accents), you can obtain a certificate. Once you have 5 certificates, you can be entered in a weekly draw to win an all-inclusive trip back to the resort! How amazing!!!! The guy that won in the week I was there was very happy with his prize... as I'm sure anyone would be. If you're not into participating, it's worth it to at least watch the Crazy Games that happen around 3:30 at the pool. They did hilarious things. The Dominican Sunset party is also something worth participating in!!!POOL: The pool is huge, as you will read anywhere! The floaties are at times hard to come across, as people will hold them for the entire day which my friends and I found irritating! Once you are able to get one, they're great to float around in. The pool is a bit cooler than other places I've been but I assume that's because of it's size and the fact that they're obviously not going to put a pool heater in a tropical place like this. The pool bar was always a good time. The bar that isn't in the pool had soft-serve ice cream (chocolate, vanilla AND twist), which I thoroughly enjoyed, and also they have a popcorn machine too!BARS: There are a lot of bars at this resort. What I found most impressive is that they have all the good brands. Schmirnoff, Baileys, Kaluha, and more... they also serve champagne and mamajuana. The one day that we got a little too hammered (passing out in the shower day), we had the bottle of mamajuana on the bar and were pouring ourselves shot after shot! For those of you who don't know what mamajuana is, it's an herbal concoction that is supposed to be a natural similarity to viagra! STAFF: The staff were all pleasant and helpful. We had one friend who decided to opt-out of our siesta the first day and ended up having a bit too much to drink. On our way to dinner, two security guys were assisting him back to our room... it was hilarious and they were definitely good sports in his inhebriation! There was maintenance being done on the walkways, but the workers were kind and did their best to stay out of the way and be respectful of the guests. I did not have one bad encounter with any staff.I'm not sure if I've missed anything, but feel free to contact me if you have any questions.I highly recommend this place to anybody and would definitely return without hesitation!!!

<Content>Absolutely Fantatstic- Holiday of a lifetime! Dreams Resort Punta Cana and the Dominican Republic as a whole offered my boyfriend and I the holiday of a lifetime! When we arrived at the airport, the atmosphere was extremely relaxed and the people were friendly and very happy.On arrival at the hotel, there were approx 25 other guests waiting. This was rectified by numerous staff manning the reception desk and we got served straight away and offered a refreshing welcome drink by a friendly member of staff. The reception staff were very helpful at all times throughout the fortnight.The rooms were immaculate, we had no problems at all. A lot of the time we did not use the safe and left credit cards, cash and mobile phones out on the table. WE DID NOT HAVE ANY ITEM STOLEN! The cleaning staff were friendly helpful and very honest!The food at the hotel was top notch and offered something for every palate. Nothing was too much trouble for the chefs or waiters/waitresses and drinks were constantly refreshed. We tried the Oceana, Sea Side restaurant, Mexican, World Cafe, Chinese and Italian restaurants, and we could not have faulted any of them.The pool and sunbathing area was fantastic and a lady constantly refreshed all bathers with frequent drinks and fresh fruit, which was very welcome in the hot sunshine! The entertainment at night was brilliant, and the dancers are a credit to the hotel. The hotel even catered for an American football game in the sports bar and provided big screens, food, and drink to keep the yapping Yankies happy, but still this was not good enough. We took a trip to Suona island and loved every minute of it. Our Rep at the hotel was the most helpful and friendly Rep (Sharon VIP Travel) ive ever encountered. She was very open and honest about all trips and was very approachable and knew everything about the island having lived there for 5 years.Overall the only thing I could say that slightly spoilt our holiday was the constantly loud, abnoxious, Americans/Canadians who took over the complex and constantly moaned about everything and belittled the other visitors. However we learnt to ignore them after a day or two and did not let them ruin what turned out to be our holiday of a lifetime.We would definitely go back, in the process of booking for next year to the same hotel. My boyfriend has been to the Dom Rep before and stayed in another 5* hotel and it did not compare at all the Dreams. We also spoke to a couple at the airport who stayed in another 5* hotel on the island and they did not have half of the perks that we enjoyed, they didnt even have room service. Dreams is 5* luxury and fulfills all expectations.

<Content>Will Never return to Dominican Republic CHECK-IN: It all started with her flight being changed to a stop over in Toronto instead of a direct flight from Ottawa to Punta Cana.We were suppose to be at the resort around 11:30 AM but because of the flight changes we only arrived at 3:00 PM to find out that her room wasn't ready. They told us to come back in 1/2 hour. We requested almost a year ago when we book this trip a room with King size bed/non-smoking. After waiting 2 hours, we finally got a room with a 2 double beds and smelt like some dead smokers fisherman's have been buried inside!!Went back to the front desk to find out that since it was late in the day (around 6:00 PM ) there was no other rooms was available. After some arguing and flashing of 20$ US they suddenly find a Junior suite they would let go at a 40% discount (490$ for a 7 days stay). That was it for the check-in.BEACH: Very nice if you don't like swimming in the ocean. There's some dangerous coral rocks beneath the water that you can't see because the waves are very big and there's always some floating sand covering your view of the ocean's bottom. Lost a toe nail to prove it. Stick to where the equipment rental area is. That's what most people did.FOOD: Most of the food was OK but not spectacular for a 5 star resort. Like other people said, there's lobster available at a 30$ USD surcharge. Both myself and my wife got sick. My wife is still sick. We were a group of 24 people and I would say that 60% of them got sick at least a day during her stay.CHECK-OUT: Again, since the her flight wasn't until 10:55 PM and we had a large group of people we asked to stay in 3 of the 12 rooms until 6:00 PM. Got the same crappy front desk story about the hotel being at 101% full....blah, blah, blah....flash the US dollars and got 4 of the 12 rooms at 60$ per room until 6:00 PM. WHY I WILL NEVER GO BACK: Once we made it to the Punta Cana airport, at the Sky Service airline baggage registration, we were told to that her luggage was 10KG overweight and we needed to pay an extra 100$. We were not overweight when leaving Ottawa airport and there was no way I brought back 10KG of rum, cigars and souvenirs. I asked to compare scales with Air Transat registration counter but got denied. She decided to reduce the extra weight to 8KG or 80$. I agreed to pay the extra weight. I gave my last 45$ US and ask that she put the balance on my VISA. Instead, she POCKETED the money and told me to keep it our little secret and not charge me for the balance. Every one in her group got overweight charges, some as high as 130$ of overweight surcharge and were told to pay cash. The VISA machine was broken and they were redirected to the cash machine in the lobby. This is money extortion and will never go back to that country.

<Content>Loved the Resort I would give this resort a definate thumbs up. If I had to rate it I would say a 4.5. I am withholding a half a point merely because it is posh and elegant however I know there are places out there that are absolutely over-the-top extravagant! The beach was amazing, just pure sand and azure water (although I would recommend sticking to the north end as the south end does have some coral ) The pool was the best I have ever seen as it went on forever however you have to get up early if you want a chair by the pool as everyone seems to throw towels on them first thing in the am before they go for breakfast! The buffet restaurant was the best I have seen. I tried some of the a la carte's and kept going back to the buffet. Service was great at all of the restaurants and the fact that you don't have to reserve for the a la carte's was a refreshing change. Another thing that differed from most all-inclusives was that they did not require you to wear wrist bands...nice!Each room has it's own safe where you program your own code however I was listening to one couple discussing that they had money stolen from their safe...we didn't encounter any problems like that. I heard them telling horror stories about every destination they had ever been to though, so I am wondering if they do not make their own problems with their constant complaining. However hearing this I would recommend that perhaps leaving valuable jewellery at home might be a thought. At no point did I ever feel threatened, even when off the resort, as we did wander into the local market area.The check in was a little slow however we arrived with approximately 40 others so I think they did fairly well under the circumstances. At no time during my stay did I ever pass the front desk and see such a large line again. We flew in with Air Canada and things went very smoothly at the airport , boarding the bus etc. No baggage lost or any ranting customers. I was most amazed at how happy everyone was. A wonderful holiday destination. I would go back to this resort in a heartbeat.

<Content>Worst Vacation Destination Ever!!!!! My girlfriend and I booked this trip online and paid lots of $ for it. This resort advertises itself as a Five star, but really deserves 2 stars on a really good day!! The staff were imcompetent and lazy and would not go out of their way to accomodate you. There were lots of pushy and arrogant vendors on the resort who would just not leave you alone. The food menu was very limited and extremely dissappointing. Their idea of a salad bar was chopped lettuce, tomatoes and cucumber and thats it!!! There were hardly any seafood on the menu which was really strange considering that D.R. is mainly surrounded by the ocean. Lazy fishermen too i guess.......During our stay, we were forced to change three rooms. Our problems included but not limited to: water leakage from ceiling, rusted shower heads, SPIDERS and bed bugs. Needless to say we just couldnt get comfortable and hardly slept in our rooms. While we were there we spoke to at least four couples who had exact same problems including one who had her wedding and engagement rings stolen from her room.I would NOT recommand this resort to anyone!!!!! Even to my worst enemy because nobody deserves to be ripped off like this.

<Content>I loved everything about Punta Cana Dreams resort and Spa This was my first time at Dreams Resort in Punta Cana and I loved every minute we were there. The resort staff, the bartenders the restaurant staffs everyone was great and did all they could to make sure it was the perfect vacation. our room was very clean the hairdryer was broke and they replaced it right away. The pool was spotless. and the ocean was beautiful. Meals were perfect we mostly ate in the world cafe. Oceana was very nice food was great. Seaside Bar And Grill also very good. The first time we went there we didn't realize it was a wedding we were told very graciously. Every Dominican person we came in contact with was great. the ride in was a eye opener it made me appricaite what we have in the USA even with all our political problems. Thank you very much for a wonderful vacation.Kim Rose

<Content>Lovely spot - family friendly We just returned from a 7-day holiday at Dreams Punta Cana. We went for the week of Jan 20th with our three year old child. I used this site a lot to research our trip, and overall the reviews listed here are pretty accurate. The weather was beautiful and it is a lovely, more remote spot. Lots of young families, extended families and couples.Pros:- Weather- The service was good - very friendly- The pool was great - they also had a wading pool which we used.- The beach - great sand, surf and a breeze that takes the edge off the hot sun. If you go in the water, be careful of rocks. We saw some people with bandaged feet. In the water, it can be hard to see the bottom and if you land too hard on a rock, you can cut your feet.- The kid's club - although our daughter, at 3 1/2 was a little young for it. It runs from 9:00 am to 10:00 pm - they will take your kids to the World Cafe for meals. We put her in for the mornings. If your kid can't swim, make sure you bring a life jacket/floaties with you.- World cafe - food generally good, fresh and they have a solid kid's buffet (you will notice lots of adults picking from the kid's buffet!)- We were satisfied with our room, although I had requested a king size, we got two doubles which worked out fine. Walls are thin, so you can hear your neighbors - annoying for the light sleeper.- Nightly entertainment was amusing -Everything was pretty accessible - we did not bother to bring a stroller- The landscaping - beautiful. Flamingos, parrots, roosters, turtles and koi!Cons:- We flew skysservice - our flight time was changed to an earlier time and if we hadn't double-checked we would have missed our flight out.- Pirates ship and Kid's club pool closed due to construction. they opened the pool on the day we left.- The road to the resort is indeed bad, as stated in other reviews. It was fine going out, but I felt pretty nauseous on the way back.- Mild construction - lots of tiling going on- our a la carte dining experiences were poor - italian (food was mediocre - world cafe is better), mexican (stale nachos, burnt quesadilla) and seafood grill (terrible, slow service)- confusion at the punta cana airport on departure (they list the check-in time instead of departure time on the signs)- We all got some diarrhea - our daughter had the hardest time.- The whole towel thing. At least at the end of the day most of the chairs are clear but it starts up again early the next morning.My only regret - I didn't try the spa. Overall, we had a good time and came back feeling refreshed and relaxed.

<Content>Amazing clean rooms Top notch place to stay, plenty of things to do on or off resort. Very,very friendly service by all who work there. Clean sseemed to be a top priority. Great family resort if you are taking children. The world cafe was our place of dining for the whole trip as travel agent didn,t advise us of the dress code for the restaraunts, The men were prepared with pants and golf shirtsand closed shoes, but the women did not bring pant suits, dresses or skirts. It was OK though because we enjoyed the service and food at the cafe. Would probably go again.

<Content>Not "Dreams" For Sure Stayed at Dreams for 3 nights only (thanks god).I have to mention that some people had fun at this resort.This is far from 6 apples,5 star or Deluxe plus rating,You can get better room in 2 year old Holiday Inn Express hotel in Jackson,California (populataion maybe 3000) than rooms in Dreams. We had to upgrade standard room to honeymoon suite because that room was terrible,small and weared down. - Service just OK,the only good service was bell boys (Angel and co) - Orlando mngr front desk was helpful too- Food terrible in most a la carte restaurant Oceana,Grill,Mexican The only place with some good food was World cafe-No elevators in buildings,not really good for disabled and infants-be ready to play towel games  empty chairs with towels on it whole dayPunta Cana ,we stayed 4 nights @ Majestic,was big ,big dissapointment.Majestic had better rooms,pool and beach,but food was even worse,and that was rated #1 when we booked it in November.I wonder what it looks like to stay at #52. There is no point to read these reviews you unfortunately have to experience it for yourself,that is the only way. We have tried Punta Cana FIRST,LAST AND NEVER AGAINGood luck Mel

<Content>We loved it! We just returned and had an absolutely great time! We were there for 5 days/ 4 nights from January 21 to 25th..Now with any stay there will be little problems/complaints so of course there were a few, but they were all minor and I would expect the same types of things would happen anywhere we stayed... I honestly thought to myself when I got down there, What resort did those people stay at who put this place down?Yes, they are still in a bit of transition from Sunscape over to Dreams.. so there are a few issues, like no guest services or room service book to look at because we were told new ones were being printed up... and yes, they are still fixing a few of the walkways, but the impact on our vacation was zero... except having to step left or right to avoid them.ROOMS: We upgraded to a Jr. Suite and loved it... we've never upgraded before, so I have nothing to compare to, but this was certainly the nicest room we've ever stayed in at a resort, and we've been to the Carribbean at All inclusives 8 times. The only thing I wished at times was that there was some way to separate the two rooms for a little privacy. Also, when we got there we discovered that the couches do NOT fold out into sleeper sofas like we had read in the reviews.. so realized the first night as we tried to put our son to sleep that there was nowhere for him to sleep!!! I made a phone call and within 3 minutes a guy showed up with a fold up bed for him... voila! Problem fixed! PREFERRED CLUB: Wow, since we upgraded to the Jr. suite, that got us access to the preferred club! They are currently building a place for it (Since it's a Dreams signature), so for now, they have it in one of the honeymoon suites. We had a great time there... met a few great people, and were treated like royalty! They have little muchies and top shelf liquor and they like to keep it flowing, as their only job is to keep you happy.FOOD: We thought it was excellent! There are so many choices. The last day at breakfast I was seriously trying to think of any type of breakfast food that they didn't have there, and I couldn't! They have omelette stations, pancake stations, cereals, breads and pastries, fresh fruits, yogurt and even a woman who made fruit smoothies! Also, we absolutely loved the station where you could make your own mimosa with a pitcher of OJ and endless bottles of champagne... wow! As for other meals, we did the buffet twice and did the Mexican and Seaside Grill restaurant and they were both wonderful... it was so nice not to have to make reservations like at other resorts we've been to and the service was great... and so was the food. Sure there's plenty of food I don't like, but there was also plenty of food I did, and since everyone's tastes are different, they have to try to please all.BEACHES: Spectacular of course! The ocean IS rocky, but here's the thing.. the rocks are NOT on the beach, they are about 20 feet out in the ocean... if you are just wading in the water to about knee high you'll be fine, but if you want to go out deeper than that, make sure you wear aqua socks or some type of shoe and you'll be all set.. otherwise you could cut your feet as I saw several people do. The water is nice and warm.. the waves are bigger than I expected, but that ended up being a very fun thing for our son who loved to play in the waves. After reading reviews, we brought bug spray but didn't end up using it as all we saw was a random bug or two.POOL: The only thing that was frustrating was that it was hard to get a chair if you didn't grab one early in the morning... (unlike at the beach where we usually had no trouble). We don't particularly like to get up too early in the morning, so this presented a problem... but after a day or two, we discovered that the pool side chairs would start opening up (just a little) around 3pm.. so we did the beach near the ocean in the morning and then would switch to the pool around 3 or 3:30... when we did this, we always found a couple chairs open here and there and there was plenty of sunshine left in the day to enjoy the pool for the second half of the day, so I hope this little trick helps anyone else out... (You can send your thank you cards in the mail)EXPLORER'S CLUB: Our son did the club one day and really liked it, but it did EXHAUST him! He was so tired that he couldn't go to the night session... but he did have a blast.To wrap up, we had a great time and wish we had stayed an extra day or two.. we would certainly consider going back again in a heartbeat... but next time, we're going to make sure we get a nonstop flight!

<Content>the hotel I every one who's going in vacantion to Punta Cana when you book your trip make sure the name of the hotel is the wright one because we almost are 50 person who's was supposed to go at the SUNSCAPE THE BEACH (DREAM) and the person who book the reservation (internet or agency) at this hotel found that it was over book and they ship us a the sunscape punta cana and the owner of the hotel sunscape the beach is the same owner of the sunscape punta cana so the thing is that hotel it's not more than a 3 *** the t.v was not fonctional the water in the shower was change cold and hot constatly the safe we add to pay and to found out it was not working at all and one key was opening more then 1 safe , the bed was like a banana ,the room was so humid that even the bed cover was humid , no information about what to do and what was free and what we af to pay and the canadien money they don't whant it's $?%*@ for them to have a service we add to whait the day afther , no welcome gift and what it frustrat it us is in this thing is they use the picture of the hotel sunscape the beach to sales the sunscape punta cana so in the middle of the week we meet a guy who's his mother she's a agent travel and like she said she never see a good price like that for one week all includ between 2,300$ and 3,000$ for a 5 ***** so she said to he son book it ... so she did the reservation and bingo there is come the catch so we just whant to advise you that make sure that you going at the right hotel and have what you paid for

<Content>Dreams Punta Cana Just the girls' vacation: The grounds are beautifully landscaped for fabulous pictures anywhere. Goldfish ponds, gorgeous parrots, flamingos, chickens/roosters, ducks, peacocks roaming freely as well as the indigenous lizards  hermit crabs. The staff keeps you moving with plenty to do by the pool or at the beach: games, dancing lessons, aerobics, theatre, movies and small but adequate casino. Or just relax on the beach or by the lazy river pool which is steps away from your room no matter what building you're in as it follows the entire length of the buildings down to the beach swim-up bar. There are shops below the lobby (on the expensive side but T-shirt prices are reasonable). The rooms are clean but not much different than a Holiday Inn. But who spends much time in the room other than to change, sleep  shower. We had a suite with a jacuzzi on our balcony which I used once just because it was there. I enjoyed the food at all of the restaurants. Some people had complaints about one thing or another but I found them to be trivial. You will eat  drink well. The only drawback was the hour drive to get there  to the many excursions. This cuts into your precious vacation time. The road is narrow with numerous  enourmous potholes. But I was so impressed with the courtesy of all drivers helping each other to pass or get by. No one gets angry or has road rage. We could learn a lesson from them. Exciting for all ages are the Zip  Para -sailing; the Outback Safari is informative, educational  adventurous for all. The shopping excursion was disappointing, definitely not enough time for shopping 30 minutes at the Mall. 45 minutes at the little haggle shops (we could have spent hours there). Rafael at the Apple desk was extremely helpful, considerate  protective. The staff was polite, friendly  very willing to please  at times when communication was difficult it led to comical charade episodes. Make the best of it, relax  enjoy. I hope Marian, the waitress at the Baracuda bar by the pool gets promoted from a trainee. She was always on the ball  kept our drinks coming non-stop  Wilson the bartender made sure our drinks were grande. Oscar was entertaining during breakfast with his wild monkey milk story and Franklin was attentive at both breakfast  dinner. Elias, bartender in the Mexican restaurant, created his own delicious drink named after himself. And the strolling singers will sing almost any song you request, we did Hotel California and it was a hit with everybody singing along. We were there for 10 days  it was the first vacation I hated to leave. It was all great. Please, let management know that the staff living in the quarters across the street need their own Pool. They deserve it!!

<Content>Will eventually be a "Dream" I just returned from a week at Dream Punta Cana, this was my 3rd time in Punta Cana. Each other time we stayed at the Riu Palace Punta Cana, which is a gorgeous resort. This time around we went for a wedding. Resort- Is beautiful, it is covered with palm trees, and has one of the largests pools i have even seen. The pool travels throughout the resorts, which is good because the only really loud part is closer to the beach by the pool bar. So you can party or escape to a more quiet part of the pool. They are still renovating the property, so you will see men working in the yard all over the place. However they are doing it to better the resort, and dont get in the way for the most part. Rooms- Are nice, we had a four poster king size bed. Beds are hard, but confortable. Washrooms have bathtub with shower, but its kinda strange because they dont have shower curtains, its a glass window that doesnt cover the entire bath. So water gets all over the floor. Again, not a huge deal. Food- The buffet was ok, we only went twice. This resort had MANY a la carte restaurants! First come first serve basis! which is nice, we didn't have to wait for anything! Make sure you go to the Japanese! its the best of all of them! French was no bad, but not good, and Mexican  Italian were also just ok! They have 24 hour room service if you miss a meal, or want to eat in your room! Its great, and very convenient! Service-Was either really good or really bad. I noticed that the bar served men first, and you got better service if you had cash in your hand everytime. If you gave them a $5, they DID NOT remember you the next time around. You had to pay for service each time. Which was terrible. Piano Bar- They have this guy come in on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday night, he is hilarious! Adults only entertainment, and so worth putting the kids to bed! dont miss him! Wedding- We had a perfect day, and the wedding coordinator was excellent! They set the beach up for the ceremony, and the terrace up for the reception. Food was ok, but cold, I don't think they were equipped for a party the size of our (90 people) a few people got sick from the food. Could have been bad seafood, or too much to drink... Drinks at this resort are great, they have mixture, and premium alcohol. The resort was over booked, and half way through the week they were asking people to move to another resort to make room for the new group coming in. They had also run out of towels at one point, Front desk told me I would have to wait until after 9 to get clean towels. (Maybe if they didn't waste 2 towels in each room making towel art...)BEWARE of Terantulas! We seen a few, try to request your room is not on the ground floor, 2 people from our group found them in their rooms! Beach here is really nice, the sand is soft, and the water is warm. This resort has a long way to come before they can live up to the new Dream Reputation. We had a nice time, I would not return here, or recommend this resort.

<Content>Not a 5 star Hotel We stayed at the Hotel Last week. Weather was good a slight cool breeze and the water was chilly. We up graded on orbitz to a Deluxe room , But when we arrived at the hotel we were told that ALL the rooms were Deluxe, so No upgrade was offered. We were RIPPED OFF. Also the Beach is nice but it is Green not Blue. One big problem is that the beach in front of the hotel is all rocks, you have to go either to the left or to the right to go swimming, good thing I didn鈥檛 bring the kids. I also saw a guy that cut his foot from the rocks in the ocean. The hotel is still under renovation they are tiling all the walk ways and planting new gardens. It didn鈥檛 bother me but who wants to see a 5 crews mixing cement. Also on our way out we were talking to a couple that were complain about their room. They said that whole trip the ceiling was leaking water every day, and you know what they did nothing for Him, he was so pissed. We spoke to a lot of people who said that they were their for the price. For the price is was good, but still not a 5 start hotel.

<Content>Stop over at Dreams Punta Cana Traveller from the UK.Just got back from Punta Cana today 25th Jan 08.Had originally booked with Gran Bahia Principe in Punta Cana but got Bumped for our first night there. (Bumping is where the hotels over book and you get transfered to another), so spent one night in Dreams whilst waiting for our room at Gran Bahia. On arrival the Bell Boys were exceptionaly helpful and so were the reception staff. They upgraded us to a Honeymoon suite for the night which was beautiful. Lounge area with seating, balcony with Jacuzzi, four poster beds, plasma screen TV, seperate dressing room, lovely shower and toilet facilities. Whilst some work was going on at the hotel, in the grounds (creating new pathways and the like) we did not experience any noise. The buffet restaurant had a great selection of food which was all cooked nicely. The beach was clean. Compared to Gran Bahia Principe, Dreams Punta Cana is not a large resort, we did not however mind this, it was smaller but we found it much more friendly and relaxed. Again we only stayed one night but found what we did experience in this short time very good.

<Content>Beautiful Weather, Average Resort We just returned from out honeymoon at Dreams in Punta Cana. First, I should say I am not a seasoned traveler so I don't have a lot to compare the resort to. The resort is going under a facelift as sidewalks, paths and other things are being upgraded since Dreams purchased the resort. The weather was great and the beach was wonderful. Other reviews said it was rocky but I did not see this problem. Plenty of chairs and people coming to ask you for drinks while you stayed on the beach. A few topless females but not many.It blew pretty hard while we were there so we didn't spend more than 3 days on the beach out of our six. The other time was spend poolside, when it wasn't raining, which it did everyday at least a little. Lots of chairs, cushions should be replaced, but not enough floats in the pool area. Although the pool was great and was one of the highlights. The room was nice and I would say to get one that faces the pool area so you know what's going on. Always had hot water and clean towels. The maid service and room service were fine. But expect to wait at least 40 minutes on room service if you order food. All the reviews said the food was average and I couldn't agree more. The buffet was okay with the breakfast being the best meal. I thought the rolls and bread were outstanding. Get the made-to-order omlet's. We ate at the Mexican one night and it was decent. The seafood grill was poor with the fish being cold and nothing special. Although the view and atmosphere was great. We ate at the Seaside grill the last night and had a well cooked steak, grisley from being grass fed beef, but good taste and the salad bar was very good. This was by far the best food we had on the stay. But overall don't expect anything great and they have a long way to go to upgrade. Service was outstanding and everybody I met and dealt with were very friendly and worked very hard for any tips I left. I was shocked at the amount of young children and infants at the resort. This is definately a FAMILY atmosphere resort. Lots of strollers and children running around. The grounds are being upgraded and the resort has a look of being out of date and in need of a major sprucing up. Several people stated that the Iburostar is the place to stay. We had a wonderful time resting and relaxing. It is a 45 minute drive from the airport and you are kinda in the middle of nowhere so have a plan of what you want to do. Not like you just run into town and shop.  After being there I'd say we won't go back to this resort, but we will go back to Punta Cana.

<Content>Rats, poor beach - dont do the Horseback Riding stayed at dreams for a week. based on previous reviews expexted a much better class of a hotel. the food was okay, However, the place is inandated with rodents, especially the buffet area (naturally). I saw rats twice near the restaurant. Got a massage and a scrub in the spa. The spa itself is nice, althought small but the services are less than average and pricey. not recommended.PLEASE READ ON IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING HORSEBACK RIDING IN DR: please understand, the horses are malnourished and mistreated. we went horseback riding in puerta plata and wereappauled by the conditions the animals were kept in! No Water, fresh cuts, exposing the flesh on the bodies, sweaty under inappropriate saddles, etc. the list goes on. Please do not patronize this activity there! The resort itself is not great, it's huge and if you don't want to carry a beach bag with you and fight for best spots at the pool/ocean, consider an alternative.

<Content>Excellent Stay, well worth it. The Airport: Arrival- Is a bit confusing, be sure to get your entrance cards, $10 per person at the desk in the center of the customs area, then get into line. Or have someone in your party hold your spot while another goes to get the tickets, they are required for entry. Once you get past customs, the bag 鈥渉andlers鈥?with try to grab your bags from you to take them the extra 15 feet to the reservation check in desks (ours was Apple). Be firm if you do not want the help as they will expect a tip for carrying the bags. The ride to the resort is about an hour and quite rough. Depending on the driver, it can be quite scary at some points, if you get carsick easily, be prepared.Departure- The same for the bag handlers, they will grab the bags out of the vehicle, fighting each other to get a bag just so they can get that tip. Once again, stand firm and take the bags yourself. There is a quick customs check that you must get into first, so your bags can get the USDA sticker, than you can get in line for check-in. Don鈥檛 buy one of the palm tree made hats on the beach from the vendors, they confiscate it at the airport and won鈥檛 let them through customs. Check-in:We arrived to a 鈥淲elcome Home鈥?and cold towels (unfortunately no drinks for us)Out bags were ticketed and we were told to check in and get our room number than bring back the stubs and the bags would be brought to the room. Check in was very quick, and seemed scripted鈥?our bags arrived to our room about 5 minutes after we did.The Resort:It is quite nice actually. After driving through some of the worst parts of the DR to get there I was pleasantly surprised. They are still working on some renovations, mostly they were reworking the pathways, in about two more weeks they should be complete I would guess. The pool was always clean and quite large. Once you get your bearings, or follow the provided map, it鈥檚 pretty easy to figure out where to go. Chairs by the pool get snatched up very early in the morning. There is plenty of chairs at the beach however if you get out there before 10 or so. The beach is cleaned daily. Watch for rocks if you go in the water directly in front of the resort, they are sharp! Hint: If you go to the right of the resort around the point and down a few hundred feet, there is some incredible beach( it is not cleaned since it is not part of the resort) but if you can look past that the water there has very little if any rocks and some good waves if you are looking to have some fun! The forecast before we went always said a chance of rain, and there was always a brief shower, but it didn鈥檛 last long. The skies were usually clear in the morning, and then partly cloudy in the afternoon.The Room:Our room was cleaned twice daily, towels always restocked, nightly turndown service, sometimes with towel art and flowers. There was always a sheet left in the room, outlining the next day鈥檚 activities. We were in building 2 and had a great view of the pool, pool bar and a bit of the ocean. (2216) The Food:Being an AI, I was expecting some less than average food. The buffet was pretty much the same for breakfast and lunch, but the food was good, and the freshly made orange juice was amazing! The other restaurants were quite good too. Himitsu, Bordeaux, Seaside, El Patio鈥ll had some very well made dishes. No complaints here.All in all, if you are on the fence about this resort, the good definitely outweigh any bad here. The staff is quite friendly and does remember your name if you make an effort to be friendly to them. We tipped here and there if the service warranted it.

<Content>Dreams PC - Jan 6-13, 2008 for our Wedding! Dreams Punta Cana ReviewJanuary 6 鈥?13, 2008We recently traveled to Dreams Punta Cana with 13 family members and friends for our wedding on January 11, 2008. We flew on US Airways from Chicago O'Hare to Charlotte, NC then to Punta Cana. Our arrival at the Punta Cana airport went very quickly. The plane that landed before us had already cleared customs before we got into the terminal 鈥?we all purchased our tourists cards (again having US cash in exact dollar amounts makes this go quickly!) We went thru customs and turned our cards in again about 50 feet from where we originally purchased them. We then proceeded to pick up our luggage and head four our ride to the resort. Since there were so many of us and so much luggage, mostly mine I will admit. We did use the assistance of the 'bell boys'. It really makes it so much easier to get to your bus as you're adjusting to the heat 鈥?and it's worth the small (five to ten dollar) tip we gave to them per family/couple! After loading all of our luggage into the trailer attached to the bus 鈥?our driver departed! We were on our way to Dreams. Some of the roadway is much nicer than I remembered 鈥?I guess it's the completed part of the new highway 鈥?however the old roads seem to be much worse than I remember. The pot holes have seemingly doubled or tripled in size! Oh well 鈥?just remember to go to the bathroom before you leave the airport! After about an hour 鈥?we were at our destination. We did have to travel rather slowly on some roads due to the excessive amounts of water in the potholes from the recent rain. Upon disembarking from the bus trip 鈥?we were greeted with cool fruit drinks and directed to the front desk. Upon checking in, everyone's rooms were immediately ready 鈥?except ours. We helped our wedding guests find their rooms and by the time we swung back by the lobby our room was ready. We did book a honeymoon suite 鈥?and were upgraded to a preferred club honeymoon suite 鈥?specifically Suite 6212 鈥?which was fabulous. Words can not do this room justice. They even have a 32 inch LCD flat screen TV in the rooms! The walk-in closet and dual sink vanity was fabulous. Oh and I love the mirrors. Great mirrors for make up, plucking eyebrow's, trying on clothes, etc! Originally, we wanted to downgrade to a swimout 鈥?but upon seeing the room we couldn't do it! It was also nice to have the extra room for entertaining our guests and as a central meeting spot (and for my excess luggage!) We immediately unpacked and put together our welcome bags for each couple. Then as our family and friends stopped by we handed the bags out! It worked out quite well! Each welcome pack consisted of a canvas tote bag, sunscreen, tropical smelling body lotion, Imodium AD, Pepto-Bismol, and a personal gift for each person! The first night we all met at the World Caf茅 for dinner 鈥?all the food was delicious! I especially enjoyed the stewed goat 鈥?which, quite frankly, I was scared to try! Also, the fresh Mahi-Mahi was delicious! We then proceeded to the lobby to watch a little of the show but found we were tired from the travel so we retired to our rooms early! The next morning we again all met and enjoyed breakfast at the World Caf茅 and everyone found the omelet bar to be their favorite (again, except me 鈥?I dislike eggs of any kind!) But I definitely found plenty of choices 鈥?various breads/pastries, French Toast, waffles, pancakes, plenty of bacon and sausage and many fruits. Of course, I also found my favorite 鈥?the smoothie bar! I can't get enough of the banana smoothies! And their coffee! It's so much stronger than here in the US but not overpowering! Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday we spent the days lounging around the pool and the beach. On Monday, a gardener came over to us while we were in the pool and cut open a coconut for us - showed us how to drink the coconut milk and eat the coconut - boy what a wonderful treat!! We never tried a restaurant for lunch. We either ordered a late room service breakfast or ate at the grill on the beach. The choices there were great too 鈥?hotdogs, hamburgers, pork chops and grilled chicken! I loved the burgers and pork chops 鈥?Ian found himself eating the chicken every meal! We did hear a few complaints that there wasn't lunch meat at the grill at the beach 鈥?this did not bother us! The World Caf茅 was open for lunch every day as was either Oceana or Sea Side Grill 鈥?but we never felt like getting out of our suits 鈥?or even covering our suits up to venture inside to eat! On Monday, we found Grisel and she said we'd get a letter in our room about setting up a meeting for the wedding plans. We didn't ever receive the letter - so we found her again on Tuesday and she gave us a copy of the letter to meet with Julianna on Wednesday at 11a.m. Our full wedding review will be under the wedding section. One thing I'll say is - if you're nervous about the actual ceremony (which honestly, I don't think anyone needs to be) set up your meeting with the wedding coordinator before departing on your trip via email. I think this would have saved a little stress on myself. It also would have made planning excursions earlier in the week more of a possiblity instead of not knowing when we'd be meeting with her. Also, if I were to do it again, I think we would have had the wedding earlier in the week and not waiting so long after arriving. In hindsight, I'd rather have gotten it out of the way right away - but really this wasn't that big of a deal either!!The shows were wonderful 鈥?of course 鈥?don't expect them to be comparable to Vegas 鈥?but they sure do a great job! The entertainment staff is so talented. They really also kept our group involved if they wanted to be 鈥?near the pool or the beach! The two 18 year old boys on the trip loved the entertainment staff and participating in games! We especially enjoyed the karaoke night and the musical tribute shows - they were a riot! Also, the piano player in the Rendevous bar was fabulous - although, this show is definitely rated for adults only. It could get a little risque at night. Monday evening we ate at El Patio. The meal was fabulous 鈥?everything anyone ordered turned out great! The appetizers were delicious too 鈥?especially those darn chips and dips they put out for the first part of the meal! And of course, I have a significant sweet tooth and convinced everyone in our party to make room for the Tres Leches Cake 鈥?and it was sure a hit!! Even better than I remembered from our previous trips! Our servers were fantastic! Our drinks were constantly filled before they ran out and we continually had fresh chips, salsa, gaucamole and cheese throughout the meal! Also, the musician trio sang La Bamba to our table during the meal! It was fabulous! Tuesday evening we ate at Seaside Grill. The meal was also good. We found more variety here than at Oceana which was primarily seafood (and a few members of our group weren't seafood fans!) I had the Ribeye 鈥?it had a great flavor but I will admit it was quite tough. More tough than I personally enjoy, but still good! Some people in our group really didn't dislike the toughness, perhaps it was just my steak that was on the tough side. The desserts here are also fabulous 鈥?we loved the dessert bar at the Seaside Grill. Their was one dessert which we have no clue what it was 鈥?that was the best!! It definitely didn't look appetizing but tasted magnificent! It was along the lines of a pie with a flamed meringue on top! The service here did leave something to be desired. Yes, everything was filled fairly quickly and we had everything we asked for - but quite honestly, the server was very reserved and did not seem to be glad to see us. Actually, this was the only staff member that did not appear to be happy about his job while we were there. This of course is not that big of a deal, we all have bad days at work! The musical trio did serenade us again here - this time a much more romantic Dominican song as our family informed them we were there for our wedding! Wednesday evening we ate at Bordeaux 鈥?I had the grouper with strawberry sauce 鈥?and it was delicious. Ian had the lamb chops and he said they were good but definitely not his favorite food of the trip. He found them to be tougher than he'd normally enjoy. The dessert 鈥?again of course 鈥?the dessert was wonderful! Our server was an adorable young woman who did a fabulous job and consistantly went out of her way for us! After dinner we realized it was pouring rain, so we sat at the bar outside Bordeaux and enjoyed a few drinks before the rain let up. We did meet the bartender there 鈥?who quickly became on of our favorites. We taught him how to make Grasshoppers. He wanted to know what it was called in Spanish 鈥?and this took us quite a while to determine but with the help of a picture drawn by one of our wedding guests and some impressions done by us and some Argentinean guests seated near by 鈥?we determined this would be called a Satamonte. Which them became our theme word for the rest of the week. This was perhaps one of my favorite nights all week. Part of our group did the sunset horseback ride with Diego on Wednesday afternoon. They did get caught in a short rain shower but said it really added to their experience and it was actually refreshing! Four others in our group did the 4-wheel ride which is sold around around the resort property (much like the horseback ride trip). They said it was also the trip of a lifetime. They were covered head to toe in mud and Misty and Rob's 2 sons (18 years old) had the best time. They too did get caught in the rain but overall said it was a wonderful trip. The rain just added to the fun in the mud! They would reccommend bringing a garbage bag to put these clothes in after the trip - they were just filthy! Thursday six of our wedding guests went on a trip from Apple Vacations to Santo Domingo. They all said it was quite an experience. Personally, Ian and I did not want to spend three hours in a vehicle each way on a beautiful Dominican day! They loved the trip. Came back with some great souviners and gifts. They also had lunch at the Hard Rock Cafe but thought it was only okay. Instead, us and another couple there for our wedding booked a parasailing excursion from the water sports booth by the beach. This was quite the adventure. We were told to be in the lobby at 12: 30p.m. and we would be picked up a few minutes later - actually a few minutes became 1:15p.m. but as we well know it's Dominican Time! We were then taken in a minivan on a 45 minute ride to a resort in Bavaro. From the watersports center on the beach at the resort in Bavaro we were loaded into a boat. Mind you this boat was a maximum of 25 feet long and simply a fiberglass hull with molded seats. It was powered by a 60HP Johnson outboard. We loaded eight people not counting the driver into this boat and headed to another boat further away from shore. This was a bumpy ride and we did get soaked. If you do this excursion, I'd recommend keeping your camera in a water resistant bag and taking towels! Upon arriving at the other boat, we pulled up next to it. The driver hung onto the side of the other vessel and we climbed into the parasailing boat as others climbed into our boat. The climbing from one boat to another was definitely interesting and a little physical! We then took seats around the bow of the parasailing boat and watched a couple go up in the air! The parasailing was $100 per couple and your parasailed tandem. The little taxi boat picked people up from our boat as soon as their parasailed and then dropped new people off for their turn. The operators put a harness on you and with very little instruction get you situation to go up in the air! I was quite nervous before taking off - but quickly realized it was the most enjoyable experiences I've ever had. You slowly float up into the air, I was expecting jerky movements but it really was almost like flying. We could see for miles around us. Including over a number of Bavaro resorts and the ship that has sunk off the beach there! WOW - What a site! It was the most relaxing and peaceful experience. Perfect for Ian and myself. As peacefully as we had gone up in the air we came back down to the boat. We then disembarked from the boat and were loaded into the taxi boat again and back to the beach we went. We returned to Dreams at about 4: 45p.m. This definitely was an experience of a lifetime. Thursday night, Ian, myself, and our friends Misty and Pat (yes, my two best friends are both named Misty and both came on the trip with us) went to the World Cafe for dinner. Again, an excellent meal with a lot of variety! There were again a variety of breads, pasta dishes, vegetable dishes and meat dishes - both American-Style and more authentic local style! Friday, the morning of the wedding - we decided to do the Zip-Line excursion from Apple Vacations. The cost was $89 per person. This trip does book up rather quickly and we did have to book it a few days in advance! Eight of us did this trip. We were picked up in an open air truck and were driven up to the mountains. On the way up the mountain, we did experience a little catastrophe! While approaching a curve that did have a 'sharp curve' sign on the side of the road, about twenty feet in front of us - we saw a gasoline truck taking the corner way to fast - the truck proceeded to jack-knife and began to roll. It almost took out a house in the process but skidded to a stop just in time. Our driver did a fantastic job avoiding the accident. At one point, we could have stuck our hand out and touched the truck! As we got passed the accident - the tanker started spewing gasoline like a fountain and it was creating a stream down the road. It looked like something you'd see at Universal Studios or in a movie. At first our driver was going to stop - as we had a paramedica and doctor on board - but then he decided to take off as the gasoline started to reach our truck. Any spark or excessive heat could have ignited a massive explosion. For the rest of the ride, after seeing this tragic accident, we were all on edge. We all hung on for dear life - but really had more feer for the ride than the zip line. We then proceeded to go up a steep rugged terrain to get to the zip line location. This was very nervewracking after the accident we had witnessed. When we arrive at the zip line - we did find out the driver of the semi did make it out alive - which helped us all to relax. The zip line has 10 zip lines spread through 11 platforms. The range from 65 meters in length to 250 meters in length. To be honest, I panicked for the first four, but caught back up on the 5th zip line. After completing the longest 6 zip lines - I wish I had done the first four! It too was a once in a lifetime experience. I would reccomend it to anyone. And for myself, if I had be the last to go, I would have done much better than one of the first. Having someone say it's not as bad as it looks, or just do it -- doesn't help the situation. If you're scared your scared! But really, you're so securely in there - and the instructions for this excursion our FABULOUS!! I would definitely do this excursion again - and really I think anyone can do it - as long as you can overcome any of your own fears. It isn't too physically demanding and is completely rewarding! Upon completing the zip lines - we were given wonderful chocolate, fruit, coffee, soda and water! We then boarded the truck for the trip back to the resort. It is about a 45 minute ride to the location of the zip lines. The ride is on pretty smooth roads other than the trip up the mountain. On the way back, we were able to see them 'cleaning' up the accident. It's amazing, people were standing around near a gasoline spill trying to collect gasoline for their vehicles. Here in the US that roadway would have been closed for hours upon hours! We did make it back to the resort by 1p.m. (We left the resort at 8:45a.m.) We then grabbed a quick lunch in the World Cafe and I headed to my hair appointment for the wedding. The wedding was at 4p.m. and everything worked out perfectly. (Details are in our review in the wedding section!) We didn't hire the photographer from the resort - and I think our pictures turned out beautifully - which I also should have up to share now that weekend is approaching! We did not have a private reception (again details are in our review in the wedding section) and it turned out fabulous! After the wedding  reception we got back to our room - and it was decorated beautifully - a honeymooner banner on the door, candles and flowers leading up to our bed, a sheet-art wedding dress drapped over the bed with beautiful flowers everywhere. Then Ian's parents had brought a talking monkey and a card for us which Grisel had placed on our bed. And MM's with our name and wedding date in dishes next to the bed! It was the most beautiful thing ever!! (Also, as I was getting ready for the wedding in our suite, room service brought a huge fruit basket and champagne!) We actually changed and went up to watch the show - but first everyone came over to see how beautiful our room was! After the show we headed to bed - my hair had a million bobby pins in it that I wanted to take out before going to sleep! Overall, our wedding day was fabulous! I'd do it over again in a heartbeat! What a way to have a perfect wedding! Saturday morning we were treated to a HUGE champagne breakfast in bed which consisted of fresh fruit, pastries, cereal, milk, orange juice, crossaints, toast, two orders of eggs, bacon, sausage, fresh coffee and tea and of course champagne! I don't know how any two people could eat all the food we had been brought! So instead of keeping it for ourselves, we called our family and they came over to enjoy a breakfast in our room! The remainder of Saturday we spent lounging around the beach and the pool. One of our friends, Pat, went deep sea fishing - he left the resort at 6:30am (1 hour ride in the car each way) and was back by 2p.m. This trip was also booked from the water sports center  was $90 per person. He caught a baracudda which he was allowed to bring back to the resort with him. He took it down to the grill on the beach and the chef's down there cooked it for him! He did have to sign a waiver with the concierge that said if he got sick from a fish obtained from somewhere else than the resort - he would not hold Dreams liable. Whcih was completely understandable! The baracudda was the best tasting fish I had ever eaten in my life! It was FANASTIC. The chef's cooked it with lime, salt, garlic and onions and grilled it! Oh my gosh! I'd eat it again in a heart beat! Then at 5:30 we all met in our room to watch the Packer v. Seahawks game. Grisel and the concierge of the perferred club building arranged for us to have extra bottled beer, champagne and extra soda with a surplus of room service delivered to our suite so we could have a private viewing of the game! It was scheduled to be played in the Sports Bar/Desires Disco, but quite frankly - here is my biggest complaint of the trip - the disco/sports bar stinks. It has a horrible moldy or bad body odor smell! It was awful. Other guests were complaining of this too! In previous visits - they have shown football games on the beach, etc. But this year the games were shown in the Sports Bar. Quite honestly, the smell was so bad, we couldn't stand it! I really would like to see the resort do something about this. I know closed areas can get muggy smelling - but this was much more than a little odor! In our previous years, the disco has been a happenin' spot at night and this year it was dead most of the time. People would walk out because they couldn't handle the smell! We fully enjoyed the disco in previous trips - but could not enjoy it this year because of the smell. And certainly, we didn't let this stop us from enjoying the trip - but it was a disappointment (really my only disappointment all week). Overall, this wasn't a big deal - but perhaps its something the resort can work on improving!! We all enjoyed the game, then went back to the theatre to watch the tribute show! Again the entertainment crew did a fabulous job! I'm never disappointed in their efforts! As most of the guys in our group drank a little much during the Packers victory - we needed to go to bed early! And we wanted to wake up and enjoy our last morning at the resort before we departed. Again, we went back to our room - our night maid had done the room beautifully for turndown service, fresh flowers sprinkled over the bed, and the candles relit! It was fabulous! Sunday morning we woke up to another beautiful day in the Dominican Republic. We packed our bags and called the concierge to have them picked up! We then went to breakfast and walked around the resort taking last minute pictures. Of course we had to stop at a bar - Ian needed a beer and I needed a Wilson's Special (only made by Wilson at the Barracuda's Bar!) I reccommend anyone find Wilson and ask him for one! I had been looking forward to one for over a year - and of course they were better than I remembered. Check-Out was smooth and painless. We then borded the bus back to the airport. It was about a 50-55 minute ride to the airport. We then shopped in duty free and grabbed pizza for lunch! Our plane departed at 3:15p.m. and soon after we were out of the Dominican Republic on our way to frigid Wisconsin! Overall, we would rate our trip an A+. The only complaints, if you can call them that, we had were: 1) the smell of the disco 2) they were working on our roof every day we were there - there would usually be a faint pounding starting at 9a.m. every day (again this is something that we hardly noticed, and when we did - we understood that this work needs to get completed sometime) and 3) they room service menus and the books with resort information were not in the rooms yet (again, this is something sooooo minor but it would have been nice for new visitors to Dreams!) The staff, the grounds, the room, the buildings, the pool, the drinks, etc were fabulous! I can't say enough about the service we received. Nearly everyone who walked past or we encountered said at least hi if not much more! It was a great trip - and a memorable wedding! We just can't wait to go back again for our 4th trip!

<Content>A Magnificent Resort for all Ages I just returned from a week at the Dreams Resort, which was originally, Sunscape on the Beach, when I stayed there last year. Had a fantastic time last year, and an even better time this year. Very impressed with the service provided by all staff members, especially the hard-working cheerful Entertainment/Sports staff. I am an active senior who was traveling alone and was overwhelmed by the friendliness of the staff members and the guests. For those traveling with young children or teens, the resort has a super staff that provides all types of fun/learning activities all day and most of the evening. The children and teens are kept occupied away from the adult guests.  The activities provided for adults make it possible to never leave the resort, although it is very easy to make arrangements for side tours. Horse-back riding is also an added plus. The many restaurants provide a variety of menus and there is no need to make reservations at the restaurants. There were no lines at any of the meals. Didn't have a chance to try the Spa, although everyone raved about it. I can't wait to return next year!

<Content>Would wait to stay there. This was our third year traveling to D.R. Our kids are getting older and we wanted to find a more child friendly place. Our travel agent suggested this resort. She mentioned that it had been upgraded from Sunscapes to Dreams. We found that the upgrading was still in progress. The child friendly resort was not very stroller friendly. We had to carry the stroller over bridges, ripped up concrete tiles among other terrains. The children's club called the Explorer's Club was under repair. The fence was easily climbed on or crawled under by the children. The very cool pirate ship could not be used because they were doing work on it. This was a huge tease to the children. They have a no adult policy where a parent can not even enter to check out the surroundings. I had to insist on speaking to a supervisor before allowing my children to enter a place without my seeing it first. Night life was boring. Service at the restaurants was great. The food was very good. The beach was beautiful. The beach BBQ was not that great. The rooms are small. The pool was very good for small children with plenty of space for all. It was easy to find a quiet spot if you wanted one. Overall, we did enjoy our stay there. We only wish we had been told that the resort had just changed hands and we should wait a few months to go. I think it will be a great place once all the renovations are complete and they've worked out all the kinks. For an all-inclusive resort. it was worth the money spent.

<Content>Good to stay with kids under 10 It's perfect place to stay with kids under 10-11. Pool is clean and long enough to give room to everyone. You need to be sure that you leave your towel there before 9-30 though...Food was good and service in restaurant was OK. Don't forget to give some tips. Canadian dollar doesn't work. People are not pleased to get them as a tip and you cannot pay by CND in hotel store.Ocean was good too and beach is clean and well organized. Here comes big disappointment as I cut my feet with see rocks in a first day. There are some very unnoticeable notes saying be careful with rocks in water, but they are useless. So you need to be careful...Entertainment team worked hard to make crowd happy during day and every evening.My overall impression was very good.My score is 4+, (not counting underwater rocks experience)

<Content>Loved our stay at Dreams Returned from Dreams Punta Cana last night. Was our anniversary  enjoyed every minute of our stay. Was at Punta Cana 3 years ago  stayed at the melia caribe tropical  enjoyed our stay there also but, enjoyed this one more. First of all I had been reading all the reviews from trip advisor until our trip  was very concerned about the negative reviews. Yes the ride from the airport is a little long but, nothing to be concerned about. Enjoyed looking at the countryside  taking in the sites from the towns we went through. Arrived at Dreams with a cold towel the minute we got off the bus  a refreshing fruit drink. Check in was a breeze  our luggage almost beat us to our rooms. Family members went with us  we had requested adjoining rooms  to be as close to the ocean as possible (building 6)  both requests we're honored. Food at the buffet,  specialty restaurants we're very good. Ate at all of them  had no problems getting into any of them. All-inclusives are all pretty much the same but, Dreams is the best we've eaten at. Waiters, bartenders  just about anyone we ran into was helpful  professional. Air conditioner was not working when we arrived  we called  was repaired by the time we got back from breakfast. Yes, there was some updating going on but, never an inconvience. Pretty much finished by half way through our trip. This resort is so nice to families with children. We had our 1 year old grandchild with us  everywhere we went the staff made all over him. Never had a problem at the pool getting a lounge though we put our towels out on our way to breakfast each day. Never a problem at the beach. Took a side trip to Saona Island. Definitely a highlight of our trip. Had a wonderful time  definitely will go back.

<Content>'Good resort overall' We visited Punta Cana 6 years ago when you had to fly to La Romana if you were staying at Punta cana. Thankfully they have now completed the new Punta Cana airport and I'd honestly say it's the best caribbean airport I have been to! It's literally a breeze going through this airport and because it's relatively open the passage of air through the place goes a long way to keeping you cool whilst awaiting baggage. unfortunately, as with all caribbean destinations Punta Cana has the pushy porters who will try to snatch your luggage once you clear immigration and baggage. If you allow them to take your luggage be prepared to tip them even if it's only ten yards to your bus. However, if your more than capable of taking it yourself hold on tight and do so, they won't like you for it but tough! The same applies when you depart so be prepared.Bus ride to dreams is at least 1hr 20mins and on pretty bad roads. They are building the new road but it's nowhere near complete.Once you arrive at Dreams your luggage will be taken care of whilst you complete check in. The speed of this will depend on how many people arrive simultaneously, but for us it was no more than ten minutes or so.If you wish to upgrade I'd recommend that you do it whilst checking in. We got a 40% discount at the desk.RoomsThe room was of a decent standard although not very large. We did upgrade to the kingsize bed which was much better than us having two smaller doubles. We had a ground floor Swim-out room which basically means there is a verge of grass between your patio door and the pool.Mini bar was restocked daily, towels were always changed and the maid would call until she got you out and could tidy the room. If you don't wish to be disturbed make sure you place the no maid card in your room or they will be knocking constantly!Grounds, beach and pool areaThe grounds are well kept and lush and there are always people tending to them. there will be some ongoing work for a little while during the transition from sunscape to dreams. However, we did'nt find any of this intrusive. The pool is beautiful and stretches from the lobby to the beach. During busy times like Christmas it can be tough to get a bed round the pool if your not up early enough. It's a little annoying when you see so many beds reserved for the whole day and nobody is ever on them. We did see a few arguments over what beds belonged to who which was a little childish but fun to watch!The beach is nice but be careful with the undertow at the waters edge. Also stay to the left if swimming to avoid the rocks!Spa/GymI had 3 massages at the spa which were excellent and not overly priced, and even though the hotel was busy I always managed a same day appointment.The gym was of good standard and quite large although they could do with a few more pieces of equipment and some heavier weights. (I am being picky on this point as I go to the gym 5 days a week at home and lift heavy) I'm sure most people will find it sufficient.FoodI have to say this is the best choice of food I have had on 3 trips to the Dominican. The buffet is repetetive but there is a large choice. However there is a large choice of other restaurants to eat at and we ate at all but the Mexican and Italian due to bad reports from people. You can have lobster at $15 per lb which being English I found cheap. The lobster was fantastic! During the day you can get chicken wings, pork chops, burger and hot dogs etc from the beach grill.For KidsWe don't have kids but there were plenty there. The pool is very suitable being only 3ft deep throughout and the kids entertainment area was one of the best I've seen at any resort. All the kids seemed to be enjoying themselves from what I could tell!EntertainmentThe entertainment team did nightly shows in the ampitheatre and they were very poor to be honest. Most of the entertainment staff were friendly but a few had very high opinions of themselves. I'd also warn fathers with teenage daughters to keep a close eye on what's going on as some of these guys are like vultures!There are plenty of bars to choose from and the lobby does not allow kids in the evening. They have a Jamaican guy on the piano called Dave most nights and he's very funny but also very adult with some of his songs so be careful if your easily offended. There is also a small casino and a small nightclub which are open until around 3am.Fellow travellersYou will find many nationalities, British, American, Canadian, German, Swedish etc which makes for a good mix. You will however find a few teenaagers who are not used to alcohol being served and therefore staggering all over the place and acting like idiots. Nothing different to anywhere else!OverallI'd say this is a good resort. There is nothing to do in the immediate vacinity so it's better if you just want to go somewhere to chill out and have everything you need at hand.Take plenty of small bills for tips as the odd tip will greatly increase your level of service around the resort.We didn't suffer with any upset stomachs but if you do please remember your eating different cuisine, consuming large amounts of alcohol and are in a different climate. these three things can easily induce an upset stomach.TAKE MOSQUITO REPELLANT!!!This is a very rural area with lots of water around which makes for perfect mozzi hunting ground. Get some good stuff from home and save yourself the suffering!I'd recommend this hotel for families and couples who want a relaxing holiday. It's not for young singles looking for plenty of action!

<Content>Needs more work to achieve 4-Star rating Just returned from a two-week stay at Dreams (formerly Sunscape) Punta Cana.Rooms are excellent - provided you get one you booked  avoid rooms which have connecting doors - you could have noisy neighbours. Seemed to be on-going issues with Room card-keys not working -  an eccentricity whereby they are 'printed' upside-down  backwards - but you are not told this when issued initially. Hey Dreams - save everyone some time  either print them correctly or let people knowPool is excellent, with ample loungers - also beachside. Great drinks service available poolside  at the swim-up bar.Beach is similarly well served with loungers - beware of rocks when swimming - stick to the area in front  to the north of the watersports boating area. Walk north for miles along the beach - wear shoes if heading south.Staff friendly  helpful with some minor language barrier issues. Sometimes restaurant service somewhat slow but in the main fine.Entertainment staff deserve honourable mention - tireless good humour  fun. They could do with a broader range of music!!!Food is adequate - special mention to the Japanese restaurant at lobby level - excellent. Dreams restaurant is ok - if somewhat over-rated. Others ok - I would describe as good truck-stop - but then you can't do it all when catering to large groups of people. Breakfast is excellent  is the one to set you up for the day.There are lots of bars to hang-out, but could possibly do with a late bar (other than casino) - all are closed by midnight (then again maybe thats a good idea)There is a well-staffed concierge desk - but it is effectively useless (akin to a headless chicken). My experience was borne out by comments from other guests also.Room service is just about adequate, but beware as you can get a glass of wine - but not a bottle  delivery is rather slow. Bring lots of small denomination dollars for tipping etc as there is no facility to access cash once in the resort - there is a local ATM in the nearest village which dispenses Pesos - but Dreams really operates in dollars.The casino is good fun  is quite relaxed.The invasion of traders once or twice a week is a bit much - given the mass-produced schlock they are selling  certainly if tempted do a bit of haggling - typically discount 50-70%Travel outside the resort can involve nerve-racking journeys on pot-hole strewn roads, but its worth venturing out to experience local living.There are on-going ground improvements - re-tiling pathways  re-doing the (as yet un-manicured) gardens. Overall enjoyed our stay, but would not rate it as 4+ star just yet. If Dreams put effective management in place  give the place a good shake up then its all there for the making.

<Content>Great Resort My wife, 2 boys 10-8  parents went over x-mas. We booked in Aug with little research on the resort or the DR. I was somewhat worried after reading some reviews, however I have learned to avoid Tripadvisor since you just can't please everybody.We had a great time and would go back in a minute. The resort is huge, secluded and very nice with upgrades in process. Food was good, plenty of selection, plenty of bars with waitresses on the beach bring you drinks. The wait staff is very friendly and polite. Nobody got sick and they stock plenty of beverages in your mini fridge in the room.Beach was great, not rocky at all. Plenty of tikis and chairs, with a nice breeze. Really nice to walk around 2 miles to the north, the resort is secluded and not stacked with others. The pool is huge, plenty of floats, unbrellas and chairs. They also have a huge inflatable iceberg for kids to climb. There is also a nice req area with tennis courts, pool/ping pong tables and b-ball hoops.The entertainment was fun, not Vegas but they work really hard, all of the employees bust their bee-hinds all day. Tipping is not needed, however bring some singles since they work really hard. They had a good x-mas show and even had Santa fly into the beach on a chopper and ride a horsedrawn carriage on the beach to give all the kids a gift.Kids Club looked nice and they seem to take very good care of the kids. We don't send our kids to it since the purpose is a family vacation, not daycare. One guy had a hell'ion of a kid who slipped and needed stiches and he was going to try to sue, sad, especially after seeing the way his kid acted he should have been deported.We've been to Beaches Negril  Turks and I'd take Dreams over them, plus it's several thousand cheaper. We both speak Spanish, however the employees speak good English  French to accomodate anyone.By the way, PC airport is very easy and nice, no problems at all. you do have to buy a $10 entry card, but no problem getting in or out.Once again, this was a great time and the resort is only getting better with Dreams taking over. Hope this helps since this resort should meet 90% of everyone's needs for a great vacation.

<Content>Was the Perfect Trip This resort and all of their staff are absolute DREAMS. My family (2 kids - 7 and 9 years old) and my husband and me went there for Christmas holidays. The rooms, food, entertainment and beach was all beautiful. We will definitly go again! The entertainment staff including Merikus, 50 Cent and Alexander made our days eventful and fun! My kids looked forward to seeing what they had in store everyday.We had a slight mix up at the end of our trip when we were about to leave and the desk girl Jeanette was so professional and helpful and the problem of our taxi was resolved very quickly.I would recommend this resort to all young and old, with families or without.

<Content>Sunscape the Beach.... NOT 6 Apples Well we were told it was a 6 Golden Apple. It was a nice place but certaintly not a 6 Golden Apple. The food was average. We ate at all of the resturants (that were open) The Japanese one was the best. The Chinese was awful! We ate at the Oceana the second night we were there. It was ok, we ate there again on our last night and it was terrible. The shrimp was over cooked and the service was lack-luster. For an all-inclusive it was fair, but I have to say the worst thing was the entertainment.... there was none. We went with our 2 children 21 and 24. There was nothing for them to do. The disco smelled musty and no one was in there.. The beach was very nice, but very rockie....We loved the weather it was perfect. This resort has a long way to go before I would say it was 4 red apple.

<Content>totally loved it!!!!! The resort is beautiful! The pool area and beach are wonderful! The entertainment team and dancers are awesome and the daily entertainment, including the shows, were amazing and a lot of fun. We thought it was almost perfect, and whatever wasn't perfect was compensated by the visible efforts and the friendliness of the entire staff. My family and I would really like to go there again!!

<Content>loved the entertainment group We were at Dreams Dec 21-28 and had a great time. There is plenty to do if you want to keep busy. We got our rooms shortly after we arrived at the hotel, the bellboys are very nice especially Henry. The rooms were nice and clean. The food was good at all the restaurants, if you have the late night munchies you can get pizza at the world cafe. The Adult Restaurant had a nice atmosphere and good food. In the main lobby some nights there is a piano man and he is funny but R rated. During the day there is a boat on the walkway to the beach with the fruit lady, you can get fresh fruit, it is very good.The pool is nice it goes through the resort and if you like the shade there is plenty at the pool. The beach was very nice and the water warm. The drinks were good at all the bars.We were in building 8 and that is a good location to be in.The entertainment staff was great, we had fun with Fifty Cent , Usher and Alexander. There are many activitins you can take part in and games to play. The staff at the restaurants were all very nice as well.All in all we had a fun vacation at Dreams, they are also doing some renovations at this time, that did not really get in the way.

<Content>Clappe, Clappe This was our 1st visit to Dom Rep. Stayed at Dreams from 12/15 to 12/22. It was wonderful. Service: The service was great.Everyone at the resort was freindly and greeted you always with a Hola and a smile. They truly wanted to make sure your stay was truly the best. The rooms were clean , in the evenings when we returned the beds were turned down and soft music was playing. Pool: was enormous and it was easy to find a peaceful area because of the size and design.Plenty of floats to go around for those who just wanted to relax and enjoy the sun. Food: We found to be very good. Lots of variety and many restuarants to choose from. No we did not get sick.Entertainment: I want to say a special thank you to Juan , he made our vacation the most enjoyable. He greeted us every moring with a hug and a smile and would seek us out for his activities for the day. He made a great impression and we still say clappe, clappe. The show were always fun and the dancing was incredible. We only miss one because we were watching Monday Night Football on the beach. But we enjoyed all of them . Others from the entertainment team which also made our stay fun was Julio, 50 Cent,  Usher we did not get to know them until the last few days of our stay.My favorite bartender was Pedro at the Manatees Bar , he made my Bithday awesome. We went out on two day trips , the Outback Safari was one. Danny Boy was our tour guide. He was awesome too. All in all, a beautiful resort, beautiful people, beautiful country, we had a fantastic time and would recommend to anyone. We both left saying that we would come back without a doubt.Thank you to the staff at Dreans for making our vacation most memorable.Dan  LindaWest Chicago, IL

<Content>In Transition We went to Dreams on December 20 for 8 nights to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary. We booked a honeymoon suite. The facility was still Sunscape when we checked in but was officially Dreams two days later.As other reviews indicate, the hotel is a good hour from the airport, so factor that in. Many of the roads have potholes as deep as the Grand Canyon and as large as Rhode Island (OK, I'm stretching it), so take your Dramamine if you are squeamish.The van drove up a long, impressive driveway, and a porter in a pith helmet (I swear) came up with cold washcloths and said welcome home. I think this is their signature greeting. Anyway, our bags and the check-in were handled without incident, and this porter, Henry, was quite exceptional.There are 9 residential buildings, sort of laid out like chevrons \ / to maximize the views. Our suite was in building 9, closest to the main building, farthest from the Ocean (this resort is on the Atlantic). We were a bit unhappy about that but as the week wore on; we found it to be a good thing. The suite was on the outside of the chevron, meaning that we faced toward the ocean, away from the property. This was a big advantage because it was much quieter, although there was a service road for employees running along the side.While we were there, they were doing a lot of masonry work, which will definitely improve the appearance of the place, but was a bit inconvenient for us. There is a lovely pool that meanders through the facility. You can't swim from one end to the other because there is a dam of sorts in the middle - I never found out why. The pool is all tiled, uniformly 3 feet deep, and immaculate. There are plenty of lounge chairs, both along the pool and on the beach. The beach was beautiful, with soft sand. I found it well maintained from end to end, and am surprised that there are reviews that call it rocky. Perhaps as part of the transition they repaired this.There were plenty of activities during the day, although they weren't always well organized. There is the Explorer's Club, a kind of day camp/day care center for kids, and separate activities for teens. At night there were always shows in the Theater at 9:30PM, usually with loud recorded music and choreographed dancing, less frequently with live music. There is a postage stamp sized casino. The dealers tend to the amateurish, but are as likely to make a mistake in your favor as one against you.Our Honeymoon Suite consisted of two rooms. You walked into a living area with a couch, loveseat, coffee table, and armoire with a TV. There was a large (not walk-in) closet with an iron and ironing board stowed. There is a mini-bar area that is stocked with beer, Coke, Diet Coke, and Sprite as well as bottled water. The bottled water is a local brand which has a bit of a chlorine taste that disappears as you got used to it. It wouldn't sell very well in the US, but it is literally eau de vie here, where the tap water is contaminated and unsafe.The bedroom, which was similar to other rooms we saw, had a king-size canopy bed. The mattress was VERY firm. There was no cover for the canopy so the ceiling fan could do its thing (there was also a fan in the Living Room). There was another armoire with another TV. The TV channels were plentiful and included all US networks, but the network outlets were, inexplicably, Denver. The bedroom opened to the dressing area which contained two sinks, plenty of amenities (soaps, shampoos, toothbrush, shaving, etc). The dressing area had a large walk-in closet on one side (if you can't find a home for your stuff here, you brought too much). The other side of the dressing room had a door to the lavatory which consisted of a commode and a walk-in shower. This was a European style shower, with a transitional space outside the water flow. The pressure was excellent, and the shower was a hand-held one that was mounted on an adjustable rod. The living room had a sliding door that opened to a veranda. I would say our veranda was over 20 feet long. The regular verandas were about half that. The veranda had a plastic table and two plastic chairs. There was a large Jacuzzi on the far end. We used this a lot and it was great. It only took about 20 minutes to fill.In general, the room was lovely but there were minor issues, like a rusty closet rod, chipped paint, and a couple of warped ceiling tiles that prevented this place from being a 5-star facility. Maybe the transition includes planned repairs that will improve it.Now for the food. The default was the World Cafe, a huge buffet with a wide variety of foods. There was an Italian place within the World Cafe, kind of a pizza and pasta place. Also in the main building were Himatsu, part Teppenyaki, part Chinese, and The Patio, a Mexican restaurant adjacent to the World Cafe.In another building by the ocean, there were 3 restaurants. On the second floor was Bordeaux (formerly Dreams), an adults-only continental style restaurant. On the ground level were Oceana, with a seafood emphasis and The Seaside Grill, with a meat emphasis. None of the prepared food was particularly good. Some of it was ok; a lot was overcooked and/or oversauced. Seafood and shrimp in particular, seemed to get better treatment than meat and fowl. The Chinese food was actually bizarre and made me pine for La Choy! There were no actual Asian employees (that I could see) in the Asian restaurant. On the upside, the fruit was wonderful, some of the seafood dishes were quite good, and there was plenty to eat. Only the World was open for 3 meals. The Seaside Grill was also open for lunch. There was a daily lunch barbeque on the beach, and all the others were dinner only.We are unlikely to return to this place, mainly because of the hassle of traveling here from the Southwestern US, but the weather and the service were wonderful, and it is a really lovely place. Because of the spread-out nature, plus a lack of elevators, I would not recommend it to anybody with major physical disabilities, although they do accommodate such.

<Content>Dreams The Truth After watching the ranking slip I was somewhat nervous about what we would experience. My wife and our 3 kids (ages 16,13,and 6) stayed from 12/24 -12/31. There are always minor things to complain about but overall we loved the resort. We ate at every restaurant and found something to enjoy each night. The service was always friendly and the food reasonably good. We were amazed that despite being the busiest week of the year we had no problem getting into any restaurant we wanted including the Japanese tepanyake restaurant ( we always went by 7 PM). The lounges at the pool filled with towels very early but we always found a wonderful spot at the beach which had plenty of chairs and then we would move to the pool in the afternoon. I saw people out cleaning the resort all thru the day and our 2 rooms although somewhat small were clean and quite comfortable. My daughter loved the fresh doughnuts each morning and the fresh fruit smoothies made from any fruit you wanted. They were redoing the walkways during our stay and this was the only true complaint we had. It was incredibly dangerous as they had big gaps in the walkway and large holes that were easy to trip on. We have traveled extensively and I can honestly say we were very pleasantly surprised with our stay at Dreams. I'm not a big drinker but I never had to wait more than a minute at any bar to get a drink and we didn't get 1 bug bite the entire trip. My 6 year old had an upset stomach for 1 day but otherwise we had no stomach problems at all. I realize that people can have something go terribly wrong that can ruin their trip but I'm otherwise not sure what family wouldn't love this resort. The food was not Ritz Carlton quality but either are the prices. My 2 teenagers enjoyed the sports area and spent every night playing basketball, foosball, tennis and pingpong. My wife had a massage at the Spa which she loved. I enjoyed lounging on the beach reading and playing tennis with my boys. My daughter loved spending a few hours each day with new friends she met and the wonderful women that worked at the explorers club so what's not to love about this place?

<Content>Loved It As a family of four (kids aged 12  4) we stayed at The Sunscape Beach / Dreams from 15 Dec 2007 - 22 Dec 2007 and I have to say that it was quite simply the best vacation we have ever had. We have a family policy of not going back to the same place twice so we can experience new things but we are already planning to go back in the future! Here is a breakdown of our trip.Transportation/Arrival: The ride from the airport to the resort took just over an hour. I had seen many reviews about the state of the roads but to be honest they really weren't that bad. I have experienced much worse in other countries. It was nice to see some of the countryside and to view real Dominican living. Its all part the experience of being in another country. Accomodation: Upon our arrival they wanted to up-sell us to a Deluxe Suite for $50 per night. We declined. We were staying in the Supersaver room which suited our needs perfectly. The room was clean and we had everything we needed. We had a ground-floor suite with a patio in Building 3. This was perfectly situated halfway between the Main building with all the restaurants, and the beach area. We couldn't have picked better ourselves.Service: All I can say is that the service that we received was TRULY WONDERFUL. Everyone would greet us with a friendly Hola wherever we went and the staff would go about their work with a smile on their face. No matter how beautiful a resort looks it's the staff that really do make a difference. I would like to give a special mention to the following people. Odalis, who works in the World Cafe, really made a great connection with our family. So warm, so friendly and so welcoming. She was one of our favourite members of staff. Juan, who is part of the entertainment team and facilitated the poolside games and competitions. You have made a last impression on us. We still say Clappe, Clappe and Sorry to this very day. Hernandez, otherwise know as Omelette Guy to us, working in the World Cafe making omelettes each day for my breakfast. He is a good guy. I would also like to mention the ladies working at the Explorers Club, Claribel, Marilin  Dislenia. They truly do amazing job. We dropped of our two kids (aged 4  12) and they came back saying they had a good time. Food: We found the food to be very good. No complaints on that front. So much to choose from, you really are spoilt for choice whether it be breakfast, lunch or dinner. Custom-made omelettes and sweet fresh fruit for breakfast, bbq-ed hamburgers, chicken and pork on the beach for lunch and dinner at one of the many a-la-carte restaurants. My favourite was the Himitsu Japanese restaurant. Superb interior and delicious food. I highly recommend it. Casino: Various slot machines and tables available for late night entertainment. I made a $20.00 visit every night and actually left 90.00 ahead!Activities: There would be numerous games pool-side during the day. Ranging from table-tennis to croquet, they were fun and there was no pressure to play. The great thing about participating in the games is that you would get rewarded with Sunscape Beach Dollars which you could then use to buy items in an auction that happens every other night in the main theatre before that particular nights entertainment. This I thought was a great idea.Beach/Pool: The pool was amazing. Never-ending, ever-winding pool. Its so big that its never crowded and not to deep as so kids can use it safely.Overall: Since we have got back I have been telling people that I felt like we were treated like rockstars, the service was that good. Its truly a beautiful place and I would fully recommend anyone, especially with kids to go there.

<Content>AMAZING WEDDING AND PHOTOGRAPHER We stayed at Sunscape the Beach before the official change to Dreams from Dec 1 - Dec 8. We were married there and brought 50 guests along with us. Check in went well for everyone in our group besides our own. Our honeymoon suite was not ready and did not have an ocean view due to the unknown construction of the buildings closest to the ocean. We were eventually relocated to a honeymoon suite in Building 9 which was closest to the lobby and had a distant ocean view. Building 9 was also closes to the wedding gazebo which actually worked out well the day of the wedding. FOOD - was good favorite restaurant was Mexican and the lunch buffet at the oceana is very good. POOL - was wonderful plenty of floats to go around. The beach was nice but the week we were there it was a bit too wavy, to the left side of the beach it is much calmer and not rocky.BEST BAR - was next to the Wedding Gazebo we were there nightly especially to see the BEST BARTENDER EVER - JOSE LUIS, Jose was very friendly and welcoming, we requested him to bartend at our wedding and he was great!CONSTRUCTION - was fully underway during our stay. On the walkways throughout the resort tile was being laid in a very haphazardous way, which made it difficult to walk through the length of the resort especially at night when not well lit. They could have gone about this construction in a much better way for it made walking dangerous. We were assured that the construction would in no way be noticeable throughout our trip..that was a bit of an understatement. THE WEDDING - went flawlessly we had a perfect day. Our wedding coordinator Juliana did a great job making sure everything was the way we wanted it. We had the wedding at the Gazebo and the reception on the terrace in the lobby beyond the Himitsu Restaurant (this was our second choice Dreams terrace was of course under construction). The terrace was decorated beautifully. The food was excellent. The DJ was awfull he refused to play the music we had brought and requested and continued to go with his own selection after multiple complaints.PHOTOGRAPHER - the day befor our wedding we were notified that the resort relaced their existing photo company, PHOTO SOUVENIR with another company. We had heard great things about PHOTO SOUVENIR and had requested Fran as our photographer. Juliana was able to still get Fran to come and do our wedding photos, THANK GOD because he is an excellent photographer he knows the Dreams property inside and out because he has been doing weddings there for years. He was actually acting as wedding coordinator half the time because he knows the process here so well. We couldn't have gotten through the day without him. I highly recommend using him as your photographer and not the photographer affiliated with this resort as they are new and do not know the best pic spots. Their website is [-]or email at [-]they had a great package deal.Get Fran as your photographer and Francois is the videographer, they are a great team!!!

<Content>Great place - planning our return already. This was our 4th visit to DomRep and the best so far despite the unexpected from late hurricane Olga which really only us affect us for 2 days. However, the entertainment still continued indoors.Facilities of the hotels were fabulous, best of all were the pool and explorer's club for children.Pool was enormous and it was easy to find a peaceful area because of it's size and design - best ever.Explorer's club was THE best ever. The team do a fantastic job from morning till night. They have their own pirate ship and pool to play on situated within a confine which only kids and the 'team' are allowed. This was the first time our daughter went to a club from day one till the last.The entertainment team did a great job including getting you involved in games and activities during the day to participating in shows in the evening. The dancing was very at a professional level, but we thought the shows were a bit dated and in need of some change. Despite all the activities available, at no time did we feel pressured to get involved, however, the team's enthusiasm makes you at times.Negative points:1) Rooms a bit dated but these are now being renovated. In fact works had now started on blocks 6,7,8  9 which did bother us at times2) Extensive work was being done on re-tiling walk ways. Gardens were also being re-planted.The works were being done followed the recent changes from Sunscape to Dreams ownership. Our agent Thomsons told us before traveling of the ownership change, however, at no point were we made aware of the work. In fact our experience with Thomsons was poor and their rep. told us nothing of the hotel when we arrived.Overall our stay at Sunscape (Dreams) was great and we look forward to going back after all the work is complete. The improvements will make a improvement on apperance but we still thought everything about the hotel from design and service was exceptional.We would like to thank especially Aris on reception for his help and also Marilyn and Claribel from the Explorer's Club for the dedication and hard work.

<Content>The real review of Sunscape the Beach/Dreams Ok here it comes the real review. My husband and I and 2 other couples arrived in Punta Cana Friday only for a long weekend.We were there to celebrate my 40th birthday.Weather - beautiful, beautiful, beautiful - the forcast called for raim yes it rained every day for about 3 minutes. Ride to the airport - you just have the laugh the whole way, there are NO rules on the road - your driver just passes everyone and they pass you. Lots of people on mopeds with 3 people riding on them. You will appreciate your home when you get back looking at what some people live in. Lots of cows, chickens and Donkeys on the side of the road - also police on side some of the roads with machine guns!Beach - Very windy when we were there but that is what we have here in Rhode Island at the beaches. Very rocky unless you go to the left. Water was blue/green very pretty.Pool - Awesome - but there were all these people who were getting up at 5:00 am to leave their towels on the beds/cabanas on the sides of the pool, very rude to just leave there things there and then not use them until the afternoon . Water was very warm and clean. There were plenty of sun chairs and rafts.Room - we had a deluxe room but were upgraded when we got there to a swim out room - we were in room 3110 - beautiful. Clean, big enough etc...We had so many flowers outside with palm trees and parrots, butterflies, tiny salamanders,and hummingbirds right outside our room. I did see a tarantula in the walkway near another building.Staff - fabulous everyone wanted to accomodate you.Shows - Lousy but what do you expect it is not vegas! Almost not worth going to.Food - lousy - the only think I found good was breakfast. I was the only one out of 6 of us that got food posioning, I was so, so sick for about 2 hours. Then fine. I would be careful what you eat, chicken was gross, food on the beach at lunch was GROSS.This is the only think I can say bad was the food really was gross.Horseback riding - we all went horseback riding at sunset - the van ride over was funny they had 11 people squished in a van made for 7. We just made the best of it laughing all the way, The ride was abou 10 minutes away then then put us all on horses - NO instructions no helmets nothing. I was the only one who had ever ridden before so I found it funny when all my friends were screaming because the horses were running!I was almost peeing my pants it was so funny - the ride was 75 minutes we piad $65 us for 2 people. The ride takes you on some back roads and then onto the beach. The guys who took us were great - after you get back they try to sell you a bottle of rum with your picture on it - we just said we had no money.Another thing we did was have couples massages on the beach with Fernando and Mercades - they were beyond fabulous. So relaxing all you hear is the ocean. If you are a prude don't have it done because you are naked and they do massage you almost everwhere! It was the best really!Overall our trip was great I would go back in a minute - we are thinking about taking the kids with us next year because the kids camp looked like so much fun! enjoy if you go!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Content>Not as expected... It was our honeymoon...we were told we had our own part of the pool attached to the room. Our honeymoon suite didn't mean for honeymooners. All it meant was it was on the lower level with no concrete between you and the pool. The room was DIRTY and had many ants. It took 3 requests to clean the bedsheets. They told us they were, but they just folded the sheet over. The cig burns let us know they were the same sheets. The 3rd and final time, they found them in the hallway! They finally got the point! It just wasn't what we were expecting...The food was pretty good, there were 7 places to choose from. Dress code (no shorts or bermuda) is required at 3 of them, not including the breakfast buffet. You could go for dinner and literally order 3 meals per person. If you wanted to sample things.The pool was big, but crowded especially with children. Punta Cana is a great place to visit. It is still being heavily developed. We won't go back for a while, but we will eventually return. Take cash because the front desk only had cash on check in day. I would recommend tipping with cash 1 or 2 bucks here and there even though it is all included. Your service is much better and they will come pool side to serve you more often.

<Content>Not a top notch resort I just got back from Sunscape The Beach (now Dreams) this evening. I booked my trip through Apple Vacations and I have to say the resort does not deserve a six golden apple rating. At best it is a 5 apple resort.The Good:The beach is great - soft powdery sand, clean beach, no seaweed, plenty of chairs and space.Restaurants are pretty good. The buffet is weak, but the a la carte restaurants are much better.The Bad:The hotel rooms are tired. They are in need of renovation. The rooms seem like they are pretty old and have seen better days.

<Content>Good Hotel We stayed at Sunscape the Beach Nov 15th for 2 weeks, we booked this hotel in January and was looking forward to it for nearly a year!When we arived we were given a drink while we waited to be served at check in, this was quick and easy and were given directions to our room.Our room was lovely, in the 5th block, over looking the pool and with a king size bed and a bath which we requested as my boyfriend has bad back we cant have a shower! The porter bought our bags up but we had to wait an hour for these,Although we had loved this room we had to change rooms on the 19th November because this room was inter connecting and a couple from America next door were having a massive argument next door and it really scared us, the front desk were not helpful about this and kept just saying to come back if it happened again but about the 4th time when we said it was getting worse, the changed us and we were given the 3rd block ground floor so we can walk out onto the swimming pool. The only thing was there were no light bulbs, the tap had fallen off the sink, balcony door was locked and the shower wouldn't work! We get this fixed but the safe kept not locking we got this looked at 5 times but in the end we just had to put up with this!The swimming pool was really nice very big, once we changed rooms we just got two sunbeds and put them outside our room so this was very handy.The restaurant was nice we only tried the world cafe, chinese and sea side grill. The chinese we didn't like, the sea side grill was nice but most days we went to buffet as this was just easier, most days the food was lovely.The entertainment was good but they don't really cater for people going away for two weeks as it was all repeated on a weekly basis, we went to the disco twice but it wasn't anything special, See Dave from Jamaica he is really funny we only made it three times as we were so jet lag we were in bed by 11 most nights!!The only thing that let it down was the service in the resturant we would ask for drink and hardly ever get them this was asking about 6 times and in the morning would give my boyfriend and then we would ask for milk and they never bought it!!Do the monster truck safari, this was really good, we also did the saona adventure was was good but i was sea sick!!!Over all we really enjoyed the hotel it was really warm but also rained most days just the service of the staff could have been better and made sure the room we changed to was up to scratch before they told us to move!Also if you go to the upper lobby at night were bite spray as i kept getting bitten an then went there towards the end of holiday we went up there and got very badly bitten, 54 times one leg, 50 other leg and one of breast - got infected, the next day was so shocked to see these and then they started looking like blisters.We really enjoyed it here and would go back. x

<Author>Cancun2003
<Content>Definitly not a 6 golden apple resort! We went to our travel agent and decided to book a trip for November of this year. Usually we go to Cancun every year the first week of January for 8 days, but were unable to go this January. That is why we decided to go in November.Our travel agent informed us that there was a 6 golden apple square deal for a good price. She told us that we would be going to 1 of 4 hotels in Punta Cana. We figured that a 6 golden apple is the best you can get, so we decided to go that route.When arriving at the airport our apple representative informed us that we would be going to the sunscape Beach now called Dreams. First of all, it was one hour and 5 minutes of a very miserable ride to the hotel. The streets have holes in them at least 2 feet deep. By the time I got to the hotel I was car sick or should i say bus sick. They are working on a new road, but will not be done for a couple of years yet from what we were told.Upon arrival at the hotel we were greeted with a welcome drink and a cookie which was very nice. From first glance pulling up on the very short driveway to the hotel, I was disappointed. I travel very often, and to me this just did not look like a 6 golden apple hotel. Upon check in, we were given a room with 2 double beds. We requested a king size bed. We were there for our wedding anniversary, and they had no record of this. This is apparently our travel agents fault. The hotel did switch our room for us.When entering the room, it was nothing spectacular. It was your average hotle room (about a 4 star) I would say. When looking around the room we noticed ants all over the top of the mini bar and the bathroom sink. We requested someone come and spray, which they did, but we battled these ants the entire 8 days. Since it rained for 7 of the 8 days, we had plenty of time to watch television. The only problem was that the satellite did not come in many of the days, so we had limited stations to find something on. When we did go down to the beach, the sand was dirty and needed cleaning up, and the water was filthy. I am not sure if the water was so dirty due to the storm there a couple of weeks earlier, but we were very disappointed.The restaurnats and the entertainment at the hotel definitly was a 6 golden apple. We just felt that the entire hotle should be as good as the restaurants and entertainment. Many of the nights we would come back to our room after the evening turn down service, and we were either missing soap, washclothes, some towels, or even the sheet that they leave in your room for the next days activities and entertainment.After talking to many people at the hotel, they felt the same way as we did. This is definitly not a 6 golden apple resort. The general feeling was that it was at best a 4-5 regular red apple. Now that the hotel has changed names to Dreams, it is still being advertised as a 6 golden apple. I noticed the price has gone up, and is very very expensive for what you get. I wish someone would have told me this before I went. I would have picked another hotel. One person said Cancun blowns this place out. I totally agree. There you have white sand, and blue ocean. That is what you want to see on vacation, along with the hotel quality that you pay for.One last comment, we booked a trip to go horseback riding for one morning, and after waiting for one half hour, we went to the desk where we booked it, and found out that they never came to pick us up. We mentioned to the hotel manager (Marco) who is a wonderful and exceptional hotel manager, and he called Ruben who was in charge of the people who booked the trip, and we were given a complimentary horseback riding trip. All in all, I would not go back here again, In august of 2003, I stayed at the sunscape Casa DelMar in La Romona, which was only a 4 apple, it it was spectacular! The hotel was beautiful, the ocean was blue, and the sand was white. I think that maybe it is time that Apple Vacation re-rate the hotels. People work long and hard to go on vacation and spend this kind of money. I think they should get what they have paid for.Lastly, upon check out they give you a book to fill out regarding your stay. Many of the people from the entertainment team were standing there watching what we were righting, and even telling us there names to put down on the form. I think that this should be private, and no one should be looking at what you write, especially employees of the hotel. I could probally go on and on, but I think that you have the picture. It was not a terrible hotel, but does need to be re-rated at the least, and many issues need to be worked on.Thank You.Janet Thompson

<Content>Not what I had hoped My friend and I went to Sunscape the Beach for another friend's wedding. We were really looking forward to getting away. Unfortunately it was like National Lampoons Vacation. One thing after another went wrong. First they told us it would take 30-40 minutes to get to the resort from the hotel. It was an hour and 15 minutes. After a quick check-in it took HOURS to get our luggage from the front. Every time we called to check on it they said it was on its way--a total lie since we finally went to the front and it was still sitting there. We should have just taken it ourselves in the first place. We missed a whole day of sun waiting for our bathing suits. The waitstaff is downright rude. The food is DISGUSTING! Absolutely everything tastes like grease. On the second night we both got violently sick. Our room was small and dirty. There were ants in the room and the bathroom. Half empty water bottles were left in our fridge from the previous guests. The ceiling fan was almost falling out of the ceiling. The beach is nice if you can stomach the fat old topless women and hairy old men in speedos. The drinks were plentiful and well-made but that just meant lots of puking drunk people stumbling around. There is no ATM so it is close to impossible to get money. The only saving grace was that the wedding was beautiful and we had a great time. I would never recommend this place to anyone and I would definitely never go back.

<Content>Beware leaving resort We stayed at Sunscape November 16-23 and had a lovely time within the resort. We should have stayed inside the gates. My friends and I were told at our welcome orientation on the evening that we arrived that if we wanted to go shopping, there was a little market a five minute walk from the resort. We were assured it was very safe. We were mugged on the way back from the shops. My friend was pushed to the ground and her wallet stolen. If you go to this resort, only go on tours offered by the resort. Do not go walking off to the market down the road to the right. We were not hurt but it was very scary and it kind of ruined the mood of the rest of our trip.

<Content>Sunscapes The Beach was quite good I found the amenities and service for this hotel to be quite good. The pools were absolutely wonderful, and the rooms were as great as any Dreams hotel. The staff was excellent in every way, and my wife and I very muched enjoyed the nightly on-site entertainment and shows. However, I was disappointed by the selection of alcoholic drinks: There simply weren't many internationally recognizable brands available. The food was nothing special either. Also, the beach in Uvero Alto does not stack up to those in other parts of the Caribbean such as Mexico's Yucatan or the Bahamas. Overall, I enjoyed the experience and I'd rate my stay at this hotel as somewhere between average to slightly above average.

<Content>Great Kids Club  The hotel was very nice and lots of activities for kids! Our kids never liked kids clubs but loved all of the teachers, meeting the other kids, eating meals there (they begged us to eat at the kids corner) and go to the mini disco each night. The hotel also had great shows every evening which the kids loved. Bring bug repellent for the mosquitos. Not sure if it was seasonal or all year round. The staff were all very nice.Enjoy your stay.

<Content>Good Affordable Resort My wife and I were looking for a new place and an affordable price to celebrate our 10th anniversary and Punta Cana seemed to be the place. We have done the all-inclusive route in Mexico 3 times and have had mixed results, but none being bad. I would say Sunset the Beach (Dreams) would rate favorable to all but Ibero Star in Riviera Maya. That has been our high watermark, Anyway,positives:-ridiculously nice staff...read that they were luke warm but found that they all seemed to be excited to serve, smiles everywhere but the casino-beautiful layout...a very cool pool concept with its long snaking river-like tiled pool we were always able to find a spot to relax and have a few drinks-good, not great food...breakfast leaves something to be desired (though I love the made-to-order omelets) and lunch needed more variety, dinner was the exception...we tried the Italian place and were not that impressed,but were blown away by the beach-side seafood joint, very good, again wait staff was exceptionally helpful and eager to please *loved that while you ate dinner they turned your sheets down in your room and left romantic music on*-great bars with top shelf booze...many all-inclusives stock crummy rail alcohal, I was drinking Stoli's all weekend...NICE! Again, the bartenders understood double shot drinks-very nice beach with waitresses taking drinks as you sunned yourself, plenty of seating and beautiful scenery-the room cleaning service was spectacular...as you got back from the beach, pool, bar for your midday nap, you were greeted with a spotless room, clothes folded, fresh towels, restocked fridge and coffee...not normally a slob, but we didn't pick up a thing...no problem, the cleaning staff took care of everything...wow!negatives:-the pool got no deeper than 3 feet...kind of a bummer but not something to worry too much about-the bars closed too early...the outdoor one in the middle of the walkway/courtyard closed at 11 or 12??? The others closed at different times on different nights...this was a major bummer as one bartender, Jose Louis, was so good that I hated to leave so early-the ocean was rough...we like waves but the waves often brushed off the sand and left jagged rocks...no warning before you stepped on something sharp...made swimming impossible-the casino was tiny...not a gambler so we stayed 15 minutes in there, but it felt like a sardine can, probably lost themselves some of my money had I not felt so clostrephopic-again, the food was not that great...you know with the all-inclusive deal that the food will not blow you away, but the breakfast was NOT good and the lunch lacked variety

<Content>Just OK We (myself, my husband and 2 our children) have just returned from a week at the Sunscape the Beach Punta Cana resort. We were there from November 16 to November 23. That was our 4th trip to Dominican Republic. Every time we stayed at the different resort including Iberostart Bavaro, Iberostar Hacienda Dominicus and Melia Caribe Tropical. By the comparison with those resorts I can put Sunscape the Beach at the last position. Not that the resort was bad, but if you take combination of location, grounds, room condition and food at each of the above resorts, Sunscape the Beach is definitely below them all. First of all if there are more than 2 of you - you can not fit into STANSARD room - it is very small. We traveled with 2 kids - a girl and a boy - and of course I needed 2 separate beds for them, but I found out at the check-in time that no additional bed can be put in the standard room because of it's size. So we had to upgrade to family/honeymoon suit (another $500). Our new room was OK. We had 2 more families in our group and saw their rooms as well and all I can say is - all the rooms at the resort are in need of upgrade. The beach was very good. Even though the resort is on the ocean side, the beach in front of the hotel is protected by the coral reef, so even on the windy days we could swim in the ocean and there were no huge waves. There are no rocks in the water if you swim on the left part of the beach. The water was very warm - warmer then in the pool. There was a lot of fish swimming with us. We fed it bead crumbs and it jumped out of the water to pick it.The pool is huge, but not deep - just 3 feet in all areas. There is no zero-depth area for small kids and elder people to go into the pool. Everyone has to jump or take steps.The food was just as everywhere else in Dominican resorts.We ate mostly at the buffet, because in the a-la carte restaurants you have to wait too long for your order and the waiting is not for our kids.The entertainment team is realy great. I can honestly say that they are better here than in other places we stayed before. All people in our group participated in activities ( we never did it before in other places). The team is very friendly and fun. The shows at night were also great.The casino is like any other resort casino - small, but has a little of everything - black jack, pocker, rulette, machines. I even won $50 playing .25c machines.Nobody got sick!To total my thoughts I can say that this hotel was OK for the money we paid, but I would not return back. Next time we are going to Iberostar.

<Content>NOT a 6 golden apple... My husband and I stayed at Sunscape the Beach the week of November 14-21 prior to the transition to Dreams. We purchased the 6 golden apple square deal on the apple website in which Sunscape was one of four possible hotels. We later learned that all who purchase the 6 golden apple deals for Punta Cana all end up at the Sunscape. We were a bit disappointed but arrived at the resort with an open mind and determined to have a good vacation. This task become increasingly difficult when we arrived at our room. We were told by the front desk clerk that we had been upgraded to a premium room. (If this was a premium room, I would hate to see a standard room). The room was VERY small, crowded but worst of all, unkept. The lampshades were rusty, the grout in the shower was moldy and the whole feel of the room was simply unclean. The bed was hard as a rock and resulted in my husband suffering from back pain the entire vacation. We have stayed in several other 6 apple resorts including; Excellence Punta Cana, Secrets Riviera Maya, Moon Palace Riviera Maya, The Royal Playa Del Carmen to name a few. This resort ranked at the bottom of the list and did not compare to the others. The common areas of the hotel were well kept and the food was alright. Our favorite dinner was at Dreams - we had steak and lobster (ala cart). We really enjoyed having the daily beach barbeque. This allowed us ample time on the beach without having to get dressed to go in for lunch. The nightly entertainment was enjoyable and the spa was great. Overall, we would NOT return to this resort and would do extensive research before booking a future trip to a Sunscape or a Dreams resort.

<Content>Best holiday ever! Sunscape the Beach is like a palace and we had a great holiday. The staff could not be more helpful and friendly. We stayed for 1 week in November and wished we had booked for 2. The flight from Scotland (10 hours) was well worth the wait. The weather was brilliant, we didn't see a single raindrop the whole holiday. We ate in every hotel in the restaurant, Himitsu was defiantely my favourite but we didn't have a mean in any of the restaurants that we didn't enjoy and certainly had no stomach upsets like some of the other reviews say!We went on a trip to swim with Nurse Sharks and Stingrays, I would definately recommend this trip to anyone reading this. We will definately be returning to this hotel, I've been looking at deals for it ever since we returned and we willprobably return within 6 months.

<Content>Brilliant! After a lot of research we chose STB for our honeymoon location and I have to say it was the best decision we ever made.Our first night wasn't so good though. When we arrived the locals were striking on the roads so we couldn't get to our resort and had to stay in the Riu (can't remember which one and don't realy want to either - terrible) The next day we were picked up by our transfer rep and brought to the resort. What a treat from the first place we stayed!!! Greeted by cold towels and fruit juice - nice!!We upgraded to a honeymoon suite so we had to wait a while for the room to be prepared. This suited us as we got a chance to look around. Very pleased with our room, well worth the money!!The resort itself is fantastic. There is so much room to walk about and everybody has plenty of space to feel completely relaxed. The pool was great but we spent most of the time on the beach as it was cooler down there.The food was varied and great. We tried everything bar the Oceana and Japanese places. Great steaks in the Sea Side Grill, Fajitas in El Patio are the best I've ever had. Breakfast in the World Cafe is everything you could want. So much to choose from, fruit, omlettes, freshly cooked doughnts!!! Wasn't too good for evening meals though.My only complaint of the who holiday was the maid servicee. On the first day we filled out a card to specify what time the room should be serviced at (we ticked 10.30 - 11) but it was never cleaned until the afternoon.The vendors can be quite annoying, especially the ones approaching you throughout the day for quad biking or horeseback riding etc. They have an answer for every excuse you give them!We booked two excursions with Apple Vacations. The Outback Safari was great because ou get to see the culture and beautiful scenery on the Island. The Saona island trip is also well worth the money.Advice: Bring whatever medication you might need with you as it is quite expensive to buy in the resort ($20) Don't show any interest in the vendors merchandise if you have no interest in buying it, they will just bug you until you buy smething.The evening entertainment wasn't the best, like watching a school talent show. We went to the casino every night instead and lost a load or money on the slot machines. Good fn though.All in all if you book this resort you will have a great time, especially if you want to relax. We're going back for our 5th anniversary and I can't wait!!!

<Content>Good Time Let me start by saying we had a fabulous time at Sunscape which is now Dreams. We booked ours through a travel agent and GoGo. Check in- very easy and simple. We got off the bus to cold towels and when we went to the desk, we were offered cold juice. They take your luggage to your room for you and ours did not take long at all maybe 15 minutes.Room- We were in building 9 and loved our location. We loved our room also. We had a honeymoon suite which i recommend because it was gorgeous clean and did not have any funky smells.Bugs- we didnt have any trouble with bugs at allFood- Our food was great everywhere we went our favorites were Dreams and Sea Side Grille. I didnt care for Oceana, they put on a great presentation of food and it looked good , but im not a seafood person.Beach- not like Bavaro but the area around you is nicer and you are secluded and thats what we liked. We experienced rocks the first day but that was it. We laid to the left of the resort every other day and it was fun,All and all we had a great vacation....the shows were kind of tacky but who cares your surrounded by bars....just get a drink and relax and be a little less judgemental. note- go see dave international in the lobby he was hilarious. great weather great food good people...what else can u ask for.

<Content>Beware for now! This resort will become Dreams in December but is currently Sunscape in November. So I was there as Sunscape and the resort has really let themselves drop the ball until the new owners take over. Don't get me wrong, the resort was very nice, but has many problems to resolve. We went with our 2 boys who are 6 and 3.Problems:In our room the A/C worked when it felt like it. The fan in the bathroom was dead. The ceiling fan had no chain so you could not turn it on. None of these was a real big deal to us, but they are not the biggest problems. The book you will find in the room that describes the resort is very wrong. Not one restaurant had the proper time or dress code listed. Not a big deal since you do receive a daily sheet, but it was a big deal since that sheet was also very wrong. You would see things like pants required and no children, but get there and see shorts and lots of kids. Also go to the restaurant to find out what time it is opening that day to avoid lines. Don't go by the schedule! The event times listed are also wrong. If you really want to do something, that day ask someone for the proper time and place. If not, you will either have the wrong place or time.Enjoyed:The resort is clean and very nice. The pool down the middle of the resort is great for everyone including kids. It is about 3.5' deep throughout the pool. The beach is also beautiful and soft. The ocean water was warmer than the pool! The people are also very nice and helpful if you are nice to them. (Be nice to get what you want. They don't always want a tip.) The kids club was enjoyed by both our kids. The staff there was very good with the boys. They really don't want 3 year olds, but they will take them. We gave them a few bucks to be nice since they took our 3 year old.We went to relax and relax we did. The problems were many, but minor enough to not destroy the vacation. If you like to take long walks, avoid the Dominican Republic. The resorts don't want you to leave their grounds for safety reasons. I didn't mention the food since it was ok, but not great or bad.Dreams is a good chain and I hope they bring this resort back to a top resort.

<Content>Not Good...... Unless You Like Spiders, Wall Cracks, Lip Singers NOT GOOD UNLESS YOU LIKE SPIDERS, CRACKS, LIP SINGERS!!! My wife and I are experienced travelers and booked our trip through Apple Vacations. It was called a square deal...so we did not know what resort we would be staying at until we arrived at the airport. We where guaranteed that we would have a Certified 6 Golden Apple resort. However once we reached Sunscape The Beach we realized that Certified 6 Golden Apple obviously didnt mean what the travel agent and Apple Vacations said it means. Our room was on the first floor with a walk out to the very nice pool. Whats wrong with that you ask? The door didn't close properly and had half inch gaps on the sides and even larger gaps for all of the insects you could think of to walk in our suppossed Certified 6 Golden Apple room. We thought we could prevent this with bug spray 100% DEET! and towels stuffed in the door when we were gone....Not so much. Not one night went by that we didnt have to kill at least 3 spiders and even more misquitos. Malaria anyone?? Good thing we were already on preventative malaria meds!! Since this was suppossed to be our honeymoon we spent sometime trying to be romantic....too bad the large CRACK in our ceiling, and what appeared to be some sort of bugs nest on our ceiling ruined the mood. The garden spider we found in our bed didn't help matters much either on day 3!! Their satelite tv kept on going out and asking us to Pay Now for service every 30 minutes. ......WHY WOULD YOU BE WATCHING TV YOU ASK?? Well after the sub par dinner experience every night they had a themed show that involved lip singers, bad dancing and a horrible magic show. David Copperfield with a mullet anyone? The point is there was nothing to do after dark, the disco smelled like a port-a-potty and unless you where trying to work on your ping pong skills into the wee hours of the next morning, your only other option was to go outside and get harrassed by the vendors all selling the same turtle figures and cheap paintings. The good news was that the entertainment staff, and overall all of the staff where very friendly! During the day was a good time because the pool was VERY NICE. The ocean was nice to look at but due to rough waters and a rocky shoreline you couldnt walk out more than 10 feet. ........In summary; if you enjoy laying in the sun and resorts that make you feel like you got dropped off at 6th grade camp.....followed by the feeling of 'when are my parents coming to pick me up so I can get out of this prison....THEN go to Sunscape The Beach Punta Cana......If you are looking for a romantic getaway, or a real carribian vacation then DONT go here. I recommend St. Martin, St. Thomas, and Sandals Resorts.....Happy booking folks! Oh and did I mention this hotel is becoming Dreams Resort in December of 2k7!!??

<Content>Very Nice  My family and I stayed from 11/18 to 11/24 and had a great time. Just as most reviews have stated, the grounds are beautiful and the staff was amazing. We had 2 ajoining rooms in building 4 with a pool view one for my husband and I and one for our 2 teen daughters. This place is gorgious and everyone is so friendly. We flew out of Ohare (chicago). Going through Punta Cana Internation went a lot quicker then I had anticipated. The poverty was not quite as bad as I had expected, Jamica is much worse in my opinion. Our check in was quick and easy too. The big disapointment for me was the food. I do think it was just me because my family thought everything was fine, I just couldnt get used to there way of taste. Although, the Asian and the Dreams where very good. And finally, the beach, it's beautiful but it's not the caribian sea it's the atlantic and it shows. But, thats ok we still had an absolutley wonderful time.

<Content>not the same hotel Stayed in this hotel in 2005  2006 both fantastic . That is why we came back again . It is now looking tired and in need of repair . Gone are the fluffy white towels now worn and grey . We stayed in block 3 this time rooms now in need of a revamp stairs and corridors the same . The pathways between the blocks now becomming pitted and cracked and the gardens on that side of the complex are not maintained like they used to be . Then there was the main problem the Mosquitoes which took more blood than Dracula . No attempt was made to contain this menace the room were never spayed once in our two week stay and neither were the grounds If this hotel is going to be upgraded a lot of work needs to be done . Very disapointed this time  The Bread Man Bolton England

<Content>Great time, but not the best location Our family (2 kids 4 and 7) stayed there from Nov 12 to Nov 18.We've previously stayed in all inclusives in Puerto Plata (DR) and Playa del Carmen (Mexico).We decided to split our vacation between the 2 top-rated hotels for families in Punta Cana: the Sunscape and the Gran Bahia Principe.For the price you pay for a stay in these all-inclusive hotels you can't get everything, so each resort makes a few trade-offs.For the Sunscape the biggest tradeoff is its location, it's on the beach of Uvero Alto, which is about 20 minutes north of the famous Bavaro beach and definitely not as nice. The sand is a shade darker than the white of Bavaro and there are sharp rocks in the water. In Bavaro the beach is so nice you have 15 hotels next to each other. Almost no stretch is available for development.In Uvera Alto (where the Sunscape is) there are very few other hotels nearby. I guess the real estate is not as appealing.The second trade-off is in rooms. They were very small and very old-looking. The paint was pealing, the shower grout needed refreshing.We were on the second floor and had a leak on the ceiling. We had to switch rooms. The new room was similar but with the (permanent) hair drier broken. We got a new (portable) one from the front desk.Note that I hadn't upgraded for a better room or ocean view room which seemed nicer from the comments I read.I certainly hope they redo all the rooms before the Dreams conversion, although they will still be small in the end.For what this hotel lacks in rooms and beach quality they certainly make up in service and grounds.First the most important for families is the kids club (Explorer Club). It's awesome. They will entertain your kids 3-12 from 9am to 10pm! Note that the late hours will be needed if you plan to go to the Dreams (gourmet) or Himitsu (Japanese) restaurant which don't allow kids. They have a great play area just for kids and the best entertainment program I've seen.The grounds are beautiful with the pool snaking between the buildings. The size of the property is just right. The Gran Bahia is 3 times as big in comparison and gets crowded.Even though the Sunscape is much smaller than the mega resorts of Bavaro beach the staff is about the same in size so you get more personal attention and the service in restaurants is better.I enjoyed the buffet food more at the Sunscape, especially the chocolate croissants for breakfast and the smoked salmon and ham for dinner.For those who don't like the buffets Sunscape is unique in not requiring reservations for A la carte restaurants. Dreams was definitely worth it. The japanese was ok. Oceana (seafood) was good.Most resorts allow you only 2 or 3 per week.None of us got sick there.The resort caters more to Americans (and Canadians) than other resorst in Punta Cana.In the end I had a great time for what I paid and I definitely want to try other Sunscapes/Dreams in Mexico next time.

<Content>Family Vacation to Sunscape/Dreams Punta Cana 11/12/07 to 11/19/07 For those of you who expect ritz carlton standards will be disappointed. For those of you who live in the real world - you can have a fantastic vacation at Dreams Punta Cana. The service was outstanding - very personable and genuine, though language was a barrier in some cases, these people do their best to make sure you enjoy yourself. The food, though not at a gourmet level, it was good. The Seaside grill at dinner was the only disappointment - we didn't eat dinner at the buffet so we can not comment on that. The other restaurants all managed to impress with their service and the food was good (Oceana seafood was okay). The grounds were fantastic; there were palm trees, flamingos, parrots, little lizards, and lots of greenery. The beach was beautiful, chairs were more than ample; the only drawback being that the south end of the beach had a lot of rocks as you walk out into the water - the north end had no rock problem. The rooms were clean and well kept - we had no problem with the room. For those WITH KIDS - the explorers club was OUTSTANDING. It was open from 9:00am until 5pm and then again from 6pm until 10pm. They had activities planned every day every 30 minutes - movies, beach volleyball, crafts, an ice cream party, dancing and games on stage some evenings, etc. There were a lot of kids in the program and we didn't hear anything but great comments. Every day our kids asked when they would get to go to the explorers club.The sailing was fantastic, the rough waters really make it interesting in a small hobie cat if you get out far enough - be careful and make sure to hold on. The bars were all over the place and there was almost always a bar open. BE SURE TO ASK FOR ALCOHOL IN YOUR MIXED DRINKS if you want it - they offer a non alcoholic versions and will not assume you want alcohol - better safe than sorry I guess? The entertainment at night was as it is defined - entertaining. And the entertainment in the day was good too - there were activities planned throughout the day that you could participate in if you chose - spanish lessons, cocktail games, water balloon fights, volleyball, archery competitions, frisbee, etc. PS - talk the vendors down considerably in price on everything. They will rip you off. PPS - bring bug repellent for the evenings if you plan to be outside. We needed it twice on our trip for mosquitos.

<Content>I already miss the sunscape My husband and I went to the suncape for our two year anniversary and I could not have imagined a more enjoyable trip. I must admit after reading the majority of the reviews on trip advisor prior to leaving, I was very nervous. Once we arrived I realized that I had absolutely nothing to worry about. It does take about an hour to get back and fourth to the airport ( unless your driver is Rudy, he got us there in about 40 minutes ) but it gives you a chance to see the different culture and how lucky we have it here in the U.S. Once we arrived at the hotel we were greeted with juice and a cold towel, check in and check out was a breeze.Our room was great, even better than we expected. We got the junior suite which had a Jacuzzi on the balcony. I was very happy with our choice, we had a couple days of rain in which the Jacuzzi came in very handy. The staff is wonderful there, I don't think there was even a time that I passed one of the staff members and they did not greet you with a smile and say hola. Very pleasant and happy to help you with anything. There is always something to do to keep you entertained. Pillow fighting, shuffleboard contest, Volleyball, etc. Even if you didn't want to participate it was fun to just watch. The shows at night were fun to watch, ( even participated in a couple, on vacation, why not??) The food was good, cant complain. We didn't get sick at all, even drank the water. Dreams was our favorite but the Japanese was a lot of fun and entertaining. World Cafe had a huge wonderful selection so you cant go wrong there. My husband and I had dinner on the beach on our anniversary evening and it was by far worth the extra. Strongly recommend it. I was a little concerned about the language barrier since I speak no Spanish. I had absolutely nothing to worry about there either. When I ordered drinks at the bars had no trouble communicating what I wanted and the drinks were great. Leon at the barracuda bar was hilarious ( he says that his goal is to get people drunk ) and I'm sure that he has reached that goal several times.The spa was wonderful as well, we got a couples hot stone massage and it was by far the best massage I've experienced. The casino was a lot of fun as well. There is a sports bar there with all kinds of different activities, tennis, pool, racquetball, you name it and its there. There was football to watch on the TV. The only thing I can say that got old was the venders there. They can be very pushy, but you just learn to say no thanks and keep on walking if you are not interested. They are just trying to make a living but again it did get very old.I would definitely go back in a heartbeat. I was very sad to leave. We were there from 11/9-11/16/07 and it just flew by.

<Content>Fun Family Vacation Just returned a week ago from Sunscape (which is becoming a Dreams hotel). The highlight of our stay was the employees - everyone was uniformly friendly and helpful, and were particularly fond of our two kids, aged 9 and almost 8. The resort itself was beautiful - great meandering pool, magnificent beach, and super spa. Magnificent lobby. Rooms were nice - I don't know why people on this site complained. Very well organized excursion desks, transportation to/from airport.The kids spent most of their time playing on the inflatable iceberg in the pool. Swim up bar was fun, as were periodic water volleyball, beach volleyball. Water was nice and warm but a bit rough in the ocean - kids definitely need adult supervision and hand holding - even the adults got knocked over by the waves once in awhile. Sand at the beach was soft, chairs comfy with thatched roof shades. Massages, steam room, sauna, showers and waterfall jacuzzi in the spa were great ! The food was only fair:Japanese hibachi: The best of the group but only three rooms, so you have to get there early (before 7AM).Chinese: 2nd best - some good dishes, some fair. A bit noisy due to the activities in the adjacent Japanese area. Also have to get there early.Italian: Pretty good (adjacent to the buffet area).Buffet: Fine for breakfast and lunch, decent for dinner.Oceana seafood: Not good. Everything tasted like it had been frozen, then overcooked.Dreams(?): Adults only - didn't get to try it out. Mexican: Never tried it, based on reviews from this site. Others who did, said it wasn't good.Nightly shows were hit-and-miss but the performers did try hard and the kids enjoyed them. The couples competition was hysterical (balloon popping, unique filling of cup with water, etc.). I don't want to sound snobby, but some of the guests were a bit loud, some not in very good shape, a few dressed slobbily for dinner. I guess that comes will all inclusives. Some were nasty at the Japanese restaurant due to the wait. We took one excursion, a half day snorkeling. One hour bus ride, then catamaran to a coral reef (pretty nice) and second stop at an enclosure housing nurse sharks and rays. This was awesome. Totally safe and exciting. Three female dancers on board were quite attractive and entertaining, between snorkeling stops and on the way back to shore. A nice diversion. Music was way too loud, though. Do they think the tourists are all deaf, or want to become deaf on their vacation?The island is terribly poor, lots of people living in tin shacks. Sad to see, but hopefully vacationing there puts some money into the economy via salaries of the employees.If you meet up with the right people, like we did (two other families from NJ), or if you just want to relax, you'll have a great time! The place is very nice and upgrading it to a Dreams (and eventually a higher price point, I expect) should make it even better.

<Content>Loved it My first trip to Dominican Republic and definately not my last!!The hotel was so clean - all day everyday you just saw people cleaning and looking after the gardens. The pool was amazing and cleaned all the time aswell. The staff were the most friendliest I have ever encountered on holiday ever.We arrived late in the evening and ordered room service, which was lovely. However our balcony door didn't lock, the shower was broken and we had an ice machine outside our bedroom, which was obviously not well!! so made loads of noise. The next morning we went to reception to tell them this and the receptionist said he could fix the shower and the door, but not the ice machine and immediately offered to re-locate us - but we would have to wait a couple of hours - which we agreed to. We went back to the room one hour later and the balcony door and the shower had been fixed (even though we were moving) I was impressed.The rest of the stay was excellent - my only bug bear was the floats in the pool - the rule is when you have finished leave them for other people to use, which is what we did. However, there were loads of people each morning gathering them up and putting them under their sunbeds and not using them for hours!! ( we even witnessed people taking them up to their room of a night and hiding them under towels on their sunbeds!!) a new supervisor of the entertainment team had started whilst we were there and went around the pool removing any floats that people had hidden and throwing them into the pool - whenever I felt like laying on a float - I just walked up to people and asked could I please use your float l which was always answered with a yes- although hesitantly, cause they weren't their floats.Fernando came around the pool everyday giving massages - which was brilliant - and the SPA was excellent.Dave - the Jamaician who played in the upstairs lobby piano bar was soooooooo funny he definatly made our holiday (although not advertised enough in the hotel) you have to be very broad minded as it is for adults only (he is brilliant)The rooms, the staff, the cleanliness, the hotel overall was definately 5 star - but the food was 3 star - the japenese, chinese and mexican were not as their name suggested! The japenese, chinese or mexican, but were all edible but notas their name suggested - Dreams was excellent the World Cafe had something on offer for everybody but because it was so big it was like a school canteen .All in all a great place - but they need to work on the food.
