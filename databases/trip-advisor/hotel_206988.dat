<Content>Great city hotel Hotel was chosen as the base for a business trip to a North Madrid location offering excellent connections with public transport.Booking the room via an international hotel reservation website, I was positively surprised about the special attention given already at the registration, including a personal welcome letter by the manager. Registration was very friendly and efficient. The room was specially calm (back yard, 7th floor) although the hotel location was already a quiet place for a city location as it is off the big roads at a large square with much green area and resting facilities.The room was luxuriously furnished, compactly spaced but rather convient with an excellent bed. Public spaces were very warmly arranged and invited to a longer stay. Breakfast buffet was excellent, especially and but not only in comparison with normal Spanish standards.Distance to metro is very short (less than 5 min by foot). The part of the town is very inviting with many small bistros and short walking distances to the very city at Plaza de Espana.In summary, the hotel offers perfect value for money for any business trip and potentially for touristic stays (as far as can be judged from a 1 night stay).

<Content>A good place to sleep, but spend the day elsewhere The Conde Duque obviously tries to come across as a quite fancy place to stay. There is no denying that it has some nice touches, and it is quite proper and tidy, everything is in good repair and works as expected (well, it was the cool season, so I wouldn't know about the AC). Really nothing much to complain about. Yet the absence of any ugly spots combined with an elegant lobby and fine stationery is not quite enough to make the luxury class. The neighbourhood is quite decent, but not very interesting. On the other hand, it is only a twenty-minute walk to some more attractive parts of town, and metro stations are found within five minutes from the hotel. The rooms are well kept and quiet but not very spacious or especially pretty. The desk was small and most of it was occupied by the TV set. There was no easy-chair for comfortable reading or watching TV, so unless you get a bigger and better room than I had, be prepared to spend all your time either lying on the bed or sitting at the desk. Not quite my idea of a comfortable stay. Some rooms offer a very limited view from the window, others may be better. The staff is not very fluent in English. Routine matters such as checking in and out present no problem, but the staff can not answer more complicated questions in English. There is Internet connection, but only for a fee and through a peculiar TV interface (yes, the television set is involved somehow). And whatever you do, do NOT use the fancy cast-iron letter box in the lobby to mail anything important. Despite assurances from the staff that this was a good option, it seems from the date stamp that it took over two weeks before the letter was handed over to the postal service for delivery - I suspect that this letter box is emptied very infrequently.But by and large, it is a reasonably good place to stay, as long as one does not expect anything out of the ordinary and spends most of the time doing other things elsewhere.

<Content>great hotel I stayed at this hotel for a short city break with a friend. The hotel was wonderful, clean, friendly and professional. We were treated at reception with freindliness and efficiency, our room was clean and spacious. A shame it wasn't overlooking the plaza but you cannot have everything. We had drinks at the bar and a snack one evening which was served with friendliness and professionalism. One of the waitresses was extremely helpful and courtious. I would recommend staying here if visiting Madrid, it is slightly out of the centre but only about 15 minutes walk into the centre. We walked from the hotel to the Prado Museum and back again so it could not be too far, especially with a few coffee stops and a lunch stop inbetween.

<Content>Enjoyed my stay at Conde Duque I spent three nights in room #503 (nice view facing a park) at this hotel recently and enjoyed every bit of my stay. It is located in a very peaceful residential area of Madrid. But at the same time very central. Plaza Espana is just about 10 minutes walk from where one can catch hop-on hop-off buses. Metro is just a few meters away. I liked the service at reception, at the restaurant while having breakfast which was included in room tariff. I liked the cleanliness of the room and the bathroom. There was no problem at all with room air conditioner as outside temperature during my stay was averaging between 12C to 15C. I would recommend this hotel to those who would like stay right in the heart of Madrid but away from the crowd. I would repeat my stay on my next trip to Madrid.

<Content>small but nice rooms and friendly staff I stayed at the Gran Hotel Conde Duque for 1 night. I was traveling alone, and got a single room. The room is small but very comfortable. I love how the curtains shut completely so it is very dark inside the room even when it's daylight outside. I am sensitive to light, so this is important to me. The room was clean; the ensuite bathroom was well-stocked with goodies and very comfortable as well. They had large and very nice towels which is a nice bonus. Everything about this hotel is thoughtful and quietly elegant in an old world way.The staff was courteous and helpful. I decided to try the breakfast buffet, which was 13 euros. A bit on the expensive side, but that was also a great experience. They had great over-easy eggs with runny yolks, different types of sausages, cheese, salami, ham, bread, and fruits. I had a great time and thought that the hotel was a good value.

<Content>Great Hotel Arrived at the Hotel quiet late, check in was smooth and friendly, staff spoke good English.Room was fairly standard hotel affair, very clean and functional. For those who like a bit of TV when away the only English channel is BBC World.The hotel is located on a quiet Plaza with several bars around it offering tapas. We used one which had a car above the door way, it just opposite the hotel and up about 40m. The bar is quiet and and staff are good, nice place to have a quiet drink and some nibbles.You can easily get to the hotel from the airport by using the Madrid Metro System and navigating to San Bernardo Metro station about 100m from the hotel. The Metro is very cheap 2Euro per person from the airport, which taxis and buses cannot get near! The Metro is clean, safe and very easy to navigate.Breakfast in the hotel is buffet style with plenty to suit everyone with very friendly helpful staff.What other reviewers say about the A/C is correct rooms do tend to be hot, not sure if the management switch the A/C on at certain times of the year?All in all 5 out of 5 for Hotel Conde Duque I would stay here again.

<Content>was very nice except for no air conditioning I decided to stay at the Conde Duque because of the other Trip Advisor traveler reviews. My friend and I had a nice room however it overlooked the street by the park which at night unfortunately you can hear people talking, other cars, etc because it echoes off the adjacent buildings.The main problem is that they do not have the air conditioning turnedon in May. The thermostat only allows you air circulation that is notcool air. We kept the window open and it was quite noisy.We changed our room to an inside room for the remainder of the stay and had to keep the windows open for some cool air. There happened to be helicopters flying above the building for a good part of the next night and you had a choice of no cool air or helicopter sounds.The location is close to the Metro in a dull sleepy part of Madrid that seems like a more residental area than an area full of noisy tourists. If you don't mind sleeping with open windows or in a warm room, it was just fine.Nice lobby, helpful staff. We had breakfast around the corner in the local bars since the hotel buffet was very expensive and not includedin our room rate.

<Content>Quiet location  Very conveniently placed at approx. 5 minutes on foot from San Bernardo metro. Staff helpful and friendly.Room very hot (even in May on rainy days) and although there was a thermostat in the room, even on a minimum setting it made very little difference.When we made our reservation we specified a quiet room on a non-smoking floor which we were duly given - however, the view sucked! Have to say though, it was very quiet.

<Content>Great Hotel Great hotel in a quiet location. We stayed there because it was close to our daughter's apt and was recommended by Trip Advisor. We had a nice size room with a good bath and a great king size bed. The breakfast was included in our rate and it was excellent, one of the best we had on our trip. We highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Charming hotel, personable and friendly staff This is my second stay at the Conde Duque hotel. It is located away from the hustle and bustle of Madrid center, but only a few metro stops to the main center. There is a metro stop a few minutes away. The hotel is charming, the staff are friendly/helpful and the rooms are clean, quiet and excellent for leisure or travel. This is my choice when I visit Madrid. I like to stay in a place where you are not a number but treated as an individual.

<Content>Just fine. If you're in need of a comfortable mid-priced place in Madrid, this one is just fine. A good looking hotel on an open square (which is a rarity in central Madrid). It's not near the main historic part, but it's in a pleasant enough area - which I didn't explore properly as I was only there on business for one night.The reception staff were perfectly friendly and appreciated my crude Spanish.The room was good, not fantastic, just good. Spacious and tidy with a large firm bed, which I like.I paid EUR135 through an agent, which is why it gets average rating. Not cheap, but fair value.Found an EXCELLENT restaurant nearby; Zarracin. Top Spanish food.Value 3/5Staff 4/5Location 3/5Room/comfort 4/53 overall.

<Content>Very Good Hotel I have now stayed in the Conde Duque for 9 nights on 2 trips to Madrid.Short form review: for future stays in Madrid, I will gladly return to the Conde Duque and will be welcomed by name by all the staff.This is a small, european hotel.It doesn't try to compete with the Marriotts of the world. As such, it's not the place to host large parties or conferences.However, if you enjoy personal service in nice (but small) accomodations, it is an excellent choice.Americans need to rethink their room size when in Europe and especially in Madrid.I had adequate space in my rooms, but two travelers with 2 suitcases each would be cramped.Not impossible, but tight.Since I speak Spanish fluently, my stays have been very comfortable.The staff does speak English at least at a basic level, but prefer to communicate in Espanol when possible.The rooms are comfortable for one traveler and really have all the amenities you need or could expect.But if you expect US sized rooms here, you will be disappointed.The Conde Duque has a very nice breakfast buffet available in the hotel.No one could possibly leave breakfast hungry or dissatisified, unless you plan on Mimosas and Eggs Benedict.Personal attention is the watchword of the Conde Duque. It sits adjacent to a park and is not located exactly on one of the main streets of Madrid.In this way, it's close to the action, but not part of the Centro.I like it's location...certainly within a 10-15 minute cab ride to about anywhere of consequence in Madrid.About 30 minutes to Barrajas for planes.There is something that the Conde Duque brings to the party that we miss in the US.If you need asistance...guidance...a cab...a good restaurant recommendation...or whatever, their experienced staff happily provides it.No, it doesn't have an inside heated pool or jacuazzi...but, really, who cares?It is just a very nice hotel for traveler where the staff goes out of their way to make your stay a very enjoyable one.

<Content>Great hotel in good location We have just returned from 7 nights in this hotel and would happily recommend it. Our room was well equipped, very comfortable and clean. Not the usual bland hotel decor. We found staff were very friendly, efficient and helpful and we felt very welcome throughout the whole stay. Our room, on 5th floor, overlooked the square. The metro is handy for getting around and a 7 day travel card allowed us unlimited travel. Only downside was the many steps inside some metro stations, especially coming out of San Bernardo, nearest metro for the hotel. Anyone who cannot carry their case up thirty to forty steps to street level should take taxi from airport. We took taxi back at a cost of 23 euros, booked by the hotel. Buffet breakfast is wonderful. I am vegetarian, my husband is not, which can cause problems in some countries. However, we were both happy with restaurants in Madrid. The Restaurante Corregidor in Plaza Mayor is good and the waitress on the first night there told me about a vegetarian restaurant a short distance away. She also taught me how to say vegetarian properly in Spanish which was a huge help and was good at suggesting dishes which could be made vegetarian. We ended up eating in both several times. The Yerbabuena Restaurante, Calle Bordadores, near Plaza Mayor, serves wonderful vegetarian food, best I have ever had in a restaurant. They have menus with descriptions in English. Even my husband was keen to go there although he has warned me that it doesn't mean he is now vegetarian. You can also get falafel and salad further down Plaza Mayor but seating there is limited to a few stools. Be aware that when bread is brought to your table at the start of a meal, it is not included and a small charge is added to your bill. In Yerbabuena, the bread roll comes with delicious dips. There is also a good pizza restaurant in the square near the hotel.

<Content>Quiet, Lovely Location We spent 6 nights at the Conde Duque and enjoyed ourselves very much. If you want a place that has all the American conveniences and associated blandness, this is not the place for you. If you want european charm and actually to feel like you are in a foreign land, this place is perfect. The rooms are small but I upgraded as a single person to staying in a double room. My traveling companion felt the single was fine for her needs. Twin beds were in both (double room had 2 plus a small sitting area)Pros: nice decor, quiet residential, safe neighborhood with kids and dogs playing, 1.5 blocks from metro and bus, small cafes and shops nearby, clean rooms, stocked bathroom and minibar, nice breakfast, friendly, professional staff, internet connection if bring laptop, safes in roomCons: small rooms, tight bathrooms, can sometimes hear into other rooms or outside, minimal english spoken, small tvs with few english channels--this could be a pro if trying to escape!), no wireless internet and barely usable television internet.Overall, we felt the pros far outweighed the cons and had a grand time. We would come back and recommend it to others as well. It was near perfect for our needs.

<Content>Great location Stayed in Sept 06 for 3 nights. From the airport its easy to get to on the metro on line 8 then line 4 the hotel is a few minutes walk from the san bernardo metro station. The hotel was in a lovely quite location, the breakfast had a vast selection with great hours 7 to 11 weekdays and 7 to 12 weekends. There were cold meats, pastries, toast, cereals, cooked bacon eggs and saugage. The only down side was the check in, the guy hardly even spoke to us, when we went in we passed him the paperwork and he blanked us completely, a lady they can over who he must have been dealing with before and he continued with her without a work to us - we thought this extremely rude and were worried if staying here was a mistake however the rest of the stay was great we would recommend this hotel.Clean rooms and public areas there is a bar by the salon du te however there is also a nice irish pub if you turn left out of the entrance a few minutes up road.

<Content>Horrible place I arrived at 2 a.m due to flight problems. Unfriendly and unpersonal check in, no service at all. The worst thing, bed linen and room was stinking of perfume ( Loewe room spray), impossible to sleep. They spray this every day! There were service works going on from early morning right in front of my door, but worse: you hear every door of your floor banging when it closes. Worse than a 2 star motel. Breakfast was nothing special for what it cost. Room was clean but small. Entrance hall and lobby dark and unpersonal. I guess for 2 people they don麓t turn the lights on. This is the worst Hotel I stayed in Madrid so far.

<Content>Terrible AC, unhelpful staff, remote location The hotel has terrible AC, and does nothing to help with it, including offering to re-set the thermostat (whole hotel is on one, not room-by-room), or to offer fans. Unwelcoming attitude by staff, and also a very remote location only accessible to major sights by subway. We changed hotels after one night, and were much happier.

<Content>Brilliant!!!!!!!! Sorry that I didn't write straight away - its just I'm booking another holiday and it reminded me how useful Trip Advisor was when we were looking for a hotel in Madrid.We spent four nights in this fanastic hotel (early May time) it was a hen night (no bearing on the type of hotel) 9 women of varying ages 23-53, I think I speak for us all in recommending this hotel. Its set in a lovely quiet area, round the corner from El Corte Ingles shopping centre, its set slightly out of the hustle and bustle but its a gentle 15 minute walk to the Palace, cafes and bars all the way there so its no big deal. The staff were really helpful, they recommended the most gorgeous restaurant I have ever been to (been all around the world). La Casa Benigna - lovely lovely lovely! All the rooms were a decent size, very clean and good air conditioning! try and get a room facing the park area. The breakfasts were delicious lots of choice. I would not hesitate in recommending this hotel, its more luxurious then you would think for the price. Enjoy!

<Content>Great hotel in good location I booked through Venere and got a great deal for two rooms. We picked this hotel mainly because my friend is a very light sleeper and it turns out that we have made the right choice. Both rooms (one TW and one SGL) are very quiet and are clean and decent. Our rate does not include breakfast and it costs EUR12.5 pp so we did not try. The location, 5 minutes on foot from metro San Bernardo, is perfect both for sightseeing and shopping. I have stayed in a number of hotels in Madrid (incl the Palace) and I think Conde Duque remains a very attractive choice.

<Content>Simply Superb Having booked my 25yr old son into the Conde Duque for fortnightly business visits since February, I joined him for a 4 day break from 5 June 2006. My son has expensive tastes, is not a traditionalist and always likes to be 'cutting edge'; as his PA, I have booked him into many hotels around Europe and when in Madrid this is his favourite hotel. Normally he favours modern Intercontinental type hotels but due to the quality, value for money, location and atmosphere the Conde Duque meets all his expectations admirably. I had known the efficiency and helpfulness of the Commercial Dept through emails exchanged with Paloma (Commercial Director) and was looking forward to meeting her and her staff. I was not disappointed - the genuine warmth, courtesy and helpfulness was so refreshing.The hotel is elegant and exudes that essential Spanish traditionalist air without being old-fashioned - an oasis of calm coolness after the heat and activity out and about Madrid. Everything about the hotel is just right, facilities, cleanliness, comfort and superb staff.The location is superb being set in a delightful leafy Plaza where families met and children safely played - in the evening after an excellent dinner, at the adjoining restaurant, it was a delight to amble around the Plaza feeling completely safe and without risk of roudy drunks disturbing the environment. At the Conde Duque you are based in an attractive 'local' area close to the centre of the city - although there are some excellent hotels in the Sol and Plaza Mayor areas they suffer the disadvantage of being too 'touristy'. For my money I'd rather enjoy feeling like a 'local' and avoiding the noise and problems in the tourist haunts.Whether travelling from the Airport or getting around the city, the Metro is 'the way' to travel. The San Bernardo station (Line 4) is approximately 400yds from the hotel, just around the corner. A metro ride from the airport to hotel costs Euro1 per person and involves one simple change of line (Line 8 travelling 2 stops to Mar de Cristal, to connect with Line 4 and then 16 stops to San Bernardo) - it couldn't be easier or cheaper and the trains are immaculate. Getting any metro train costs the same Euro1 however many (internal) line changes you make to your exit destination - why bother taking more expensive taxi rides!I loved Madrid and the Conde Duque played a very large part in my happy memories of my visit - I almost didn't want to right this review as it's one of those 'gems' of a place you want to keep all to yourself ! - however it was through reading earlier TA reviews of the Conde Duque that led us to enjoy it's delights in the first place. Try it - you'll enjoy it too.

<Content>Excellent Hotel We stayed at the Hotel Conde Duque for 4 nights from 28 April 2006 and we could not fault it. The hotel was situated in a quiet plaza about a 10 minute walk away from the Gran Via. The hotel staff, particularly on the reception desk were extremely friendly and helpful, in fact nothing was too much trouble for them. We shared a triple room which was spacious, well furnished and spotless with a good sized bathroom and importantly there was no noise, something we would definately have experienced on the Gran Via. The buffet breakfast was good and certainly kept us going until lunchtime. In addition the public areas were nicely furnished and comfortable and a good afternoon tea was served there. If you didn't want to venture too far in the evening, there were a few restaurants just a few yards away. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Nice hotel, great service I stayed one night at the Conde Duque (I was supposed to stay seven nights, but needed to go back earlier to Peru), after spending five nights at the Gran Melia Fenix. Unlike the Fenix (which is a most renowned and sophisticated hotel), the personal service at the Conde Duque is outstanding (at the Melia, an urgent fax I was expecting was lost, and none of the messages left to me at the reception were ever delivered!) The plaza in front of the hotel is a nice and peaceful spot (well, at least on a Sunday), and the metro station is only one block and a half away. Breakfast is not as good as other reviewers have commented; in fact, I would not recommend it. I agree with other opinions about the lack of noise insulation: you can hear everything happening on the room next door! Aside from this, the hotel is cute, rooms and bathroom are adequate and comfortable (and I got a back room), and as I said, personal service is honestly kind and unusually warm. I would definitively stay there again; fortunately I am not a light sleeper!

<Content>Great hotel, great location and good value We spent a lovely weekend at the hotel set in this quiet oasis in the middle of Madrid. Good value, nicely finished rooms and good quality public areas. Not only were the breakfasts good with lots of choice to suit all tastes, but we also would recommend that you do not miss the the afternoon tea in the bar - something we did not expect in down-town Madrid.All of the staff that we met were friendly and could not do enough to make our stay enjoyable.

<Content>Great staff! We loved this hotel and would stay there again. Originally, we planned to travel throughout central Spain, traveling from city to city via train, but we liked this hotel so much we returned to Madrid and used it as our base, taking day trips to cities such as Avila, Toledo, Segovia, etc. The hotel's location is great. A metro stop--the San Bernardo-- is two blocks away and a short ride to all the major sights in Madrid. But what makes this hotel extra special is the staff. Their recommendations for restaurants, concerts, etc were excellent. I got sick with a bad cold during the last few days of my trip and they located a doctor for me (who made housecalls!) and did not charge me a fee.

<Content>Fabulous, wonderful, helpful, made my trip I know it's a little late for me to be writing a review, since I stayed there so long ago. But I just loved this hotel. The staff was so incredibly helpful, I just feel like I owe them a little something. First, the price is amazing - we booked through site59. Second, the hotel is situated in a nice little plaza and our room overlooked the plaza. It was nice to wake up to birds and children playing instead of sirens and motorcycles. Third, the breakfast was good and they offered a lot of different choices, which is a welcome sight if you are an American not used to the Spanish breakfast of nothing and coffee. Our room was fabulous - clean, polished wood floors, nice beds with clean linens, tv, fabulous large bathroom, an in room stereo system, and beautiful french doors that overlooked the plaza. But the kudos really go to the staff. The second day there, I had my purse stolen while I was at the Julia Tours bus station waiting to board a tour bus to Toledo. The people at Julia tours were less than helpful, telling me these sort of things happen and there is not much you can do. They gave me the address of the local police station and refused to refund my money for the tour. I finally found the police station, but that did no good as no one spoke english. So, I returned to my hotel defeated, feeling betrayed by a city I loved so much just hours earlier. And that is when the staff at the Conde Duque stepped in and saved my trip. They called the police for me and found someone who spoke english and I was able to file the report over the phone. They also helped me call my credit card companies to report my cards stolen. They gave my 70 year old grandmother, who called while I wasn't there, instructions on how to wire money to the nearest Western Union. They called Julia Tours and told them that they would most certainly be refunding my money -- and they did. They really renewed my hope and made the rest of my trip enjoyable. They also searched the hotel and found me the morning of my departure to give me a phone message -- they certainly didn't have to do this. And, I left a painting I had bought in the hotel room and they actually sent it to me in the U.S. and paid for the postage themselves. I loved the concierge so much that I had my picture taken with him. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Great Stay at the Conde Duque We stayed for two nights at the Hotel Conde Duque in January and loved it! The rooms were clean and adequte size (especially for European rooms which are normally much smaller than American), and when we asked for a small change (one bed vs. two) it was taken care of immediately. The front desk staff was extremely helpful and gave us good restaurant and clubs to go to (check out Joy Eslava for a fun night of dancing). The bathroom was marble and spacious. Overall, we had a wonderful stay and would definitely go back.

<Content>Pleasant stay at the Conde Duque I stayed at the Conde Duque for two nights in December 2004. The service was unfailingly kind, and the double room was attractively decorated and very clean although small. Upon arrival, I mentioned my luggage had been lost, and the clerk called immediately to see about it. He followed up the next morning. My dinner reservation was also made for the following night. The breakfast buffet was better and more varied than at the expensive hotel where I stayed my last night in Spain. My only complaint was the small rooms. However, the pleasant decor and warm service made up for that. I would stay there again.
