<Content>BIG and ROOMY! The Westin was very nice. The staff greeted us and was nice and helpful. They took the extra step; which we do not experience very often. The room was very roomy and CLEAN!!! We had a nice view of the city. [-] They have wonderful beds!

<Content>Lots of little problems The guest room wasn't well equpped. There were no pens, no room service menu, no map of the meeting rooms, the TV didn't have an on-screen meeting guide as most convention hotels do, and the TV picture was distorted.Service in the main restaurant/coffee shop was slow. The bar and grill, McNelly's, was supposed to open at 4 PM on Sunday but didn't. I didn't hang around to find out why.Finally, the guest services book says that there is a regular Supershuttle to DFW; there isn't.

<Content>Cannot describe how bad my experience was!!! I was there for a Convention with my Religious organization, and everything since day one was crazy. Starting with receptionists being rude and not wanting to give us the Special event price of $79.00. Instead they wanted to charge $119.00. The Hotel sponsor to be a 4 star and i think is maybe 2 star, the food was nasty, the bathrooms were ehhhh, the halls were dirty, room service didn't clean the room one of the days and i had to called the receptionist to send someone to get me towels. Gladly we spoke to our board and we're having our next years convention at a better hotel. Why does Westin doesn't bother to fix this issues being one of the best hotels in the U.S.

<Content>Great Stay at Westin Park Central Dallas We got a great deal on the Westin Park Central Dallas through Priceline for $65 a night. Self-parking the attached garage is $12 per night.The room was very clean. It looked like it had recently been redone. It had a widescreen HD LCD, but all of the channels were in SD. We have a Sleep Number bed at home so we usually hate the beds when we travel. We were presently surprised to get a good nights sleep from their Heavenly Bed. The bed was firmer than what we are used to but seemed to have a high number of coils.I had a problem with the Heavenly Shower. The Heavenly Shower has 2 massaging shower heads instead of the normal 1. The problem is my wife liked it so much, I am going to have to put one in at home. I have a feeling this in going to be a costly problem.We were a little hungry after checking in, so went down to the restaurant to have some appetizers and drinks. The menu in the restaurant is very limited. They had 5 or 6 appetizer, none of which were traditional. They were all over $10 each. We ended up order from their deserts a small brownie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream for $9 each. We would have done better walking to the Jack in the Box around the corner.Service throughout the hotel was top notch. The bellhop, James, was very friendly and very helpful. The front desk staff was very cheerful. Smiling employees greeted us as we passed in the hallways. The restaurant staff were friendly. It is obvious that the staff has been instructed on how to provide great service.

<Content>Just OK This hotel is in the middle of nowhere. If you're looking for business it may be ok but not for seeing the town. Hotel was clean, rooms were fine. Restaurant was way overpriced, $14.00 dollars for a cheeseburger!Hotel runs a shuttle to a few thing but only in a 5 mile radius so be prepared to catch a train or taxi.

<Content>Consisently reliable stays in Dallas I have to preface my review by noting that I only stay here on business and not for a vacation. The location makes it convenient but hardly an area to go out and explore. The Westin is rated as a 4 star class hotel. Many reviews have questioned that. You have to know what the stars mean as it relates to hotel classification. It does not signify levels of superiority of service. It merely is the travel industry's way of saying that this hotel has lots of amenities like meeting rooms, conference areas, full service restaurant, etc. I have been a number of 2 star hotels that have better service than 4 star hotels, it just depends.That being said it does offer a better stay than lots of similar priced hotels in Dallas. I have stayed at a bunch in the North Dallas area and the Westin is my favorite. Better beds and room designs than Courtyards, Marriotts, Hiltons, and the like in this area. I particularly like the bed, dual shower head, overall room design and cleanliness since most floors have been updated or are going through this process. I know they have had problems with the elevators and that can be frustrating but they supposedly overhauled them all. It took several visits for me to notice a difference but now I do, they are much better.I have never eaten here so cannot rate the food or service and do recall prices being steep. No different than many city hotels. I do like the exercise room which has a good number of machines and is much more spacious than other chains.I also like the valet parking since I have no idea where the self park is. Yes it is expensive but worth it if coming and going on business. I also like the rooms they have. I have had one that offered a treadmill in the room and another with a stationary bike in the room. Prices overall are pretty reasonable compared to the $140 a night at a Courtyard in Dallas, if you get a good corporate rate. Even at regular price it compares favorably for me to a lot of the full service 4 star hotels around town.

<Content>Great beds and Margaritas Stayed for two nights.. Hotel felt almost deserted when arriving on a Saturday afternoon.Very good rate for a first class hotel (105 $ per night). Free parking in parking garage adjacent to hotel. Wireless internet access @ 9.95 $ per day that was never charged to my bill :-)Unremarkable breakfast buffee 20 $. Nice pub/bar serving decent food and great Margaritas.Fantastic beds. Good heating/AC. Nice and clean room with flatscreen TV.Few guests for such a large hotel. Quiet (!) location only 200 yards from Dallas High Five Interchange (I635/Dallas North Central Expressway).Benihana Japanese style restaurant within walking distance otherwise nothing but office buildings in the immediate neighborhood.Embassy Suites Park Central is nearby across I-635. Somewhat run-down and more expensive but offers free breakfast and daily manager's reception. Always busier but also a noisier location.

<Content>Great place to stay! We got a great value from Hotwire and stayed at this facility for 2 nights. The facility is very very clean and their staff is extremely friendly and professional. Our room was great. I absolutely love those heavenly beds...you really feel that you are sleeping on the clouds. Our bathroom was very clean and updated. We had plently of clean towels and also a bath robe was provided. Room is equipped with an LCD television, and a safe. The lighting in the room is great. Internet service is available. Unfortunately, the reception for wireless access is suboptimal (maybe b/c we were on the 15th floor). However, ethernet works great. They have very clean fast elevators. We did not eat at their facility during our stay, but they do have a couple of restaurants on site. They also have an onsite gym, which seemed very nice, but we did not use it. My only complaint was that the heater was not very efficient and kind of loud.

<Content>Nice Hotel Very nice, comfortable, clean, recently renovated. Nice rooms, halls, elevators. Parking $10.00, breakfast buffett $20.00 ... glad we got the good rate we did with Hotwire !!Management says Westin leases the parking property, therefore they must charge for the parking, so I suggested they comp hotel guests with breakfast, but at $20.00 per person for breakfast that would be a losing proposition.We were on the 10th floor. All elevators were very nice, the hall was newly carpeted, and our room was very nice. Nice linens. No vending machines, which surprised us, as we wanted a soda, and had to go to the gift shop to get it.Starbucks coffee in the room, and if you want more, just dial 0 ... good !USA Today and Wall Street Journal free ... good deal !All in all, a very nice experience.

<Content>Where did they get their stars? First of all, let me start by saying that I'm not one of those picky, has to be high end travellers. That said, this hotel was horrible. When we got to the hotel the doormen did not greet us, nor did they offer to help with our luggage. After we checked in, it took 10 minutes for us to get an elevator. Both of these things I chalked up to it being very cold outside and children playing on the elevators.However, once we got to our room, it was all downhill. The first of three rooms we tried had a large stain on the ottoman, pubic hair in the sink, a ring around the tub, full trash cans, and a used bar of soap still in the tub. I called the front desk and we were moved to a room next door. The guy that moved us didn't stay around long enough for us to look over the room. (In a 4-star hotel I should not have to!) In any case, the second room was worse. There was vomit covering the toilet, blood (or at least that's what I prefer to think it was) stains on the walls, and sticky stuff on the night stand. Once again, I called the front desk. They came up with the head of housekeeping to inspect the rooms. Once they realized that I was not kidding (why would I kid about that!), they moved us to the third room. This room was by far better, but was by no means clean. The next morning, I tried to get a coffee stain out of my shirt with one of the stained towels that they placed in our room, thinking that maybe it had been washed but the stain hadn't come out. It apparrently had been washed, however, they forgot to rinse it. The bleach from the towel got onto my shirt and ruined it. After I complained to a manager, they told me that housekeeping was having a hard time keeping up due to the holidays. The manager apologized and offered me $50 to spend at the hotel and a free breakfast. I accepted the apology, but did not receive the breakfast coupons under the door as I was supposed to. When I went to the front desk to ask about them, they had no record of those or the $50 in the system. They once again apologized and are supposed to send a coupon for an upgraded room for two nights and breakfast coupons. We'll see if that happens...

<Content>Exceeded expectations I visited the Westin Park Central on business recently. I was given a very nice room with a good view. Comfortable bed, decent internet access, free parking (across the street), and nice staff made for a pleasant visit. The free breakfast (for Starwood members) was the icing on the cake. I'd choose this hotel again (if I'm ever forced to return to Dallas).

<Content>Needs upgrade This hotel is not deserving of the Westin brand. The hotel elevators are so slow and out of sync. In fact, it was so bad the staff had us use the service elevators! The room was decent and clean however, the bathroom was a different story. First, the heavenly showerhead was nowhere to be seen. Second, the floor of both the shower and bathroom had foreign hairs. On a positive note, I was there for a business meeting and the food served at the event was absolutely GREAT. I have been to quite a few business meetings and have never had food this good. They really excelled in this area. However, this property would not be my first choice.

<Content>I stay her often I stay at this hotel when I go down to Dallas. I'm down there roughly 10 times/year and my company has a preferred rate.The two biggest negative issues with the hotel are the elevators and the rooms.The elevators seem to have been undergoing an upgrade for the past 6 months, but not getting any better.The rooms are just okay (save for the fantastic Heavenly bed), with the outdated 23 television kind of embarrassing for a property such as this. It's about time to get the flat panel televisions, HD programming and newer, more modern, furniture, as some of the other Westins already have.The gym, however, is fantastic for a hotel.Overall, I stay there mostly for the Starwood points and the convenience for my meetings in Dallas

<Content>Good hotel...bad food Stayed at this hotel for a three days in late April. I was impressed by the location. Very close to North Dallas and Plano and also convenient to uptown/downtown area. The rooms were good and clean, the lobby is very nice and clean, staff is friendly and attentive. However the food at this hotel is BAD! Had breakfast and was not impressed at all, it was not of the same quality as other Westins I have stayed at. About a year ago I had stayed at this hotel and they served a much better breakfast buffet. (Fresh bagels and breakfast pastries were superb) Had dinner there only once and was not impressed

<Content>Don't let the negative reviews scare you! I too was booked here for a conference and was concerned about the negative reviews I read. However, don't let them scare you off. This is a very nice facility with extremely attentive staff. My room was spotless and very well appointed; the public areas of the hotel are also very nice, and the food from the sports bar and the main restaurant was excellent. The equipment in the fitness center is also of very good quality.The only note of caution I would offer: this is a good conference hotel, but it is essentially located in a business park. If you are looking for a hotel that's convenient to Dallas attractions, this isn't it -- unless you have a car and don't mind contending with the traffic.

<Content>Nice for a conference I recently returned from a conference held at this hotel. I was worried reading some of the other reviews before I departed for the trip, but I returned with a positive impression. My room and bathroom was clean. The bed and pillows were quite comfortable. The bathroom was nice with its extended shower curtain as well as dual head shower fixture. I did not bring my laptop on this trip, so I cannot comment on the ease/cost of internet use. The food served at the conference was one of the best treats. I did not have a bad meal during my stay. Thank you to the considerate, friendly staff I encountered!

<Content>Why Bother Even Opening on Weekends? The room was good, not great, just good. We paid extra for a corner room which gave us a few extra feet of space and an off viewing angle on the TV. Feel free to pull the sofa and coffee table into the area between the bed and the TV. Bedding was good but really no better than any of the other improved bedding packages at other hotels. Better than at my house though.Hamsters on wheels would power the elevators faster. This is definetly a business man's, expense account hotel. Hotel has a small, relatively understocked bar in the lobby with laughable entertainment (12 TV's?). Of course the bar was closed for most of the day on the weekend as was the overpriced restaurant. This is the most boring hotel in the history of boring hotels.There may have been three employees present during my Saturday afternoon at this hotel. Luckily there are places driving distance away (you will need a car, this is Dallas after all). Although it is 7-8 minutes from the Galleria and located at a major North Dallas intersection, you feel like you are in a business park with no actual businesses. Traffic does not even go by this place it is so dead. I was too bored to even read.Room service was completly out-of-line on prices. There were amenities but you have to pay for each and every one of them. This hotel adheres to the religion of the more we charge the less you get, They really want you to pay more attention to the great bed and less attention to the incidental charges and poor service. I still cannot comprehend their need to charge for parking on weekdays let alone weekends. I would bet that they are losing their shirts on the internet and phone charges. Bring your Aircards, cellphones, and Blackberrys and give it to the man in charge of this place. This will probably be my last trip to a Westin. At least Marriott and Hilton will throw you a bone every now and then.

<Content>Glad I Paid Half Price Room was hot and smelled like stale smoke. If you like brown you will love the decor which is very brown, with brown mottled wallpaper and brown mottled carpet and brown mottled drapes. Got here at 7 PM on a Sunday and the restaurant was closed due to lack of business. Had a room service hamburger that cost $25 + tip. It cost $10 to hook up to the internet. They also charge $10 for parking. Been here three hours now and it might be cool enough to go bed in an hour or two. Glad I paid 1/2 price. Have stayed in many Comfort Inns and/or Marriott budget jobs that beat this. However, the bed does feel comfy.

<Content>Typical Business Hotel ~ Nothing Fantastic but Quite Adequate I just visited the lovely city of Dallas for the first time this past week. We were there for a conference going on at the Westin Park Central, so we stayed there for the convenience. We were assigned room 613 initially, and after trooping up to the sixth floor with bags in hand we discovered that there WAS no room 613. After a return trip to the lobby we discovered that the first desk person has assigned us a room number that doesn't exist in any hotel. After that, we had a nice stay. The hotel bartender was very personable, as was the staff in general. The conference facilities were just fine. The valet, considering that we were charged a fee each night we stayed, was understaffed. It took a long time to receive your car once you gave your ticket stub to the valet, and if you'd called down for it in advance, that really didn't lessen the wait time at all. Overall, a good place to stay but nothing of note that spoke of phenomenal service or venue.

<Content>Eh The lobby was beautiful. Having to pay $10 (per day) for parking was rathering annoying. The room left much to be desired. The carpet was stained and the room smelled musky. The bathroom was a step up from Motel 6. The shower head might have been heavenly but the shower STALL was small and cramped. Additionally the water tempature changed several times in the course of a five minute shower - freezing then scalding. The beds were comfortable but I wouldn't go as far as heavenly. The down blanket and pillows WERE very nice but the sheets weren't very soft and smelled strongly of bleach. There was nothing special about our room or our stay. I expected much more for the price. We wouldn't recomment this hotel or stay here again.Food was VERY over priced - $18 for a breakfast that really wasn't greatl. Pool was nice but crowded. Fitness room wasn't exactly as described - machines were decent but creaky and the room was very warm.

<Content>Great stay at the Westin Park Central Our stay at the Westin Park Central in Dallas was very enoyable, especially since we got a very good rate through Priceline. The hotel is conveniently located to Northpark and other great shopping and is easy to access from Loop 635 and Interstate 75. The lobby was really pretty and the staff was friendly and helpful. They even knocked on our door about 30 minutes after we checked in to see if everything was allright and to see if we needed anything. The rooms were large and very nice and the heavenly bed was very comfortable. The only complaint I would have is the fact that you had to pay to park and the hallways could use a good vacuuming (which was O.K. considering the good rate we got). I would certainly stay there again especially if I got another good rate. The breakfast in the dining room was good, but a bit pricey. We really enjoyed our stay.

<Content>The motel 6 of Westin Chain Stayed here 2 nights because of proximity to my client at Park Central and LBJ. Can't go wrong with Starwood property right? WRONG. Front desk clerk was knowledgable and efficient, not bad. The room was a nice size and well appointed. The tub was the same one found at motel 6 (small and cramped) nothing to write home about and flooded the floor, as for the plumbing, its noisy and poorly designed. While I showered it ran hot and cold unexpectedly. The room was dirty with stains on the furniture and sheets and sand or sugar on the desk chair. I didn't taste it. I had the sheets changed. The wireless phone near the bed was not working. The elevators were so outrageously slow, I opted for the freight elevator and complained about this to the front desk and security personnel I met in the kitchen. To sum up, find another hotel. I got it thru priceline at a greatly reduced price, I would not pay what they ask on the name brand sites, and won't go back well maybe for a 50$/day rack rate I would.

<Content>Incompetent Management Trust me....stay at the Westin Dallas Galleria...it is only 2 or 3 miles away and the management there cares if you are happy or not. This place is not terrible, just lacking class. The management and front desk staff have some sort of superiorority complex that I cannot quite figure out...it is very un-Starwood and very un-Texas......BTW...the service express promise is a total joke.

<Content>Nickeled and Dimed Ordered a Non Smoking room online and then wasn't given one. Employee said that effective Jan.1 no smoking in Westin. No apology or anything from staff. Dogs should not be allowed in this hotel to bark non stop while owners leave hotel. 1 day of internet access is really 8 hours, so it ends up costing you $30 a day. Parking too expensive and they only took checks or cash, so I had to go back in a pay a $3.25 fee at their ATM to pay for parking.

<Content>Solid Hotel Choice I stay at this hotel regularly and it's a nice hotel, especially for business travelers. The rooms are tasteful and well appointed. The beds are very comfortable and the staff really does try to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. The gym is a welcome change from most hotels... the equipment is actually decent and each aerobic machine has a TV built into it. The food is average, but on par with other hotels in this class/price range. If you plan on working much during your stay, you might request a room on the preferred guest floor as the task chairs are much more comfortable than in the rest of the hotel. Oh, and I've never seen many teenagers at this hotel, contrary to the review of another person on here. The hotel primarily draws business travelers.

<Content>Wonderful Value The staff is very friendly and eager to please the guests. The fitness center (Reebok) is well above average in cleanliness and equipment. I ordered the sesame tuna rare- it was delicious!My room was big, clean and well appointed. Do not be dissuaded by the location: this is an excellent hotel.Oh yeah, did I mentioned the sumptous heavenly bed and shower? They were, well, heavenly!

<Content>Tons Of Teens My husband called and booked a weekend romantic package. When we got there they were friendly but we went up to the room and I looked out the window and there were 30 buses full of teenagers. We couldn't leave our room. When we did we couldnt' get an elevator because all the teens in them. Then a teen even ran into me running down the hall. This isn't the hotels fault but they KNEW we were wanting a romatic weekend and they KNEW thousands of teens wouldn't be. They could have told my husband when he booked or when we checked in what was going on and let us see if we wanted to stay or not. We could hear them in our room slamming the doors and screaming! We were so upset we left after being there a couple hours.

<Content>Nice overall This is a nice property. I was on the Starwood floor so maybe the rooms are upgraded...not sure. Bathroom amenities excellent. Decent sized room. Hotel is right off the interstate. Front desk friendly, if not exceptional. Had a question of the bell staff and it was answered promptly. Irish pub is good but WAY overpriced. Cool bartender. Overall a good place to stay if you're looking for a little extra in your room.

<Content>Good Value I got to stay here for free, so I cant complain. The hotel was a good value overall. I am a starwood preferred member, so we were put in that floor. Nice rooms, but althought the room was posted as a non/smoking room, the room smelled somewhat smokie, but not bad. I was just staying for one night so I didnt ask to be changed. Overall, an ok value for the price.

<Content>Heavenly stay My stay at the Westin Park Central truly was Heavenly. I can't remember a better nights sleep away from home. The room was clean, service was okay, but I can't get over how comfortable the bed was! And you must have a glass of the fresh squeezed orange juice in the morning. If you are looking for a good nights sleep and to wake refreshed, this is your stop.
