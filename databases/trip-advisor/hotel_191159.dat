<Content>Great end to a Honeymoon The hotel was beautiful and the staff made our last couple of days on our honeymoon absolutely perfect. The location was perfect and it was easy to walk to most of the places we wanted to see. We had an amazing view overlooking the river as well as the Duomo. The size of the room and the luxurious bathroom was a nice welcome after so many small places we stayed at during our visit.

<Content>Really lovely hotel We stayed at this hotel as it was one offered by our conference. We were extremely pleased with it - much higher than the usual standard of conference hotels. The location is good - only a short walk to the centre of Florence.We arrived early, but the concierge found a room for us. We had booked a river view and this was well worth while. The view at sunset is particularly beautiful. We loved our room, which was a good size, panelled and had a canopy bed that was extremely comfortable. The bathroom was very nice too, attractively fitted and always with masses of towels, although ideally, we would have liked a separate shower and bath.We were pleased that we were able to have breakfast in our room at no extra cost - this was a very nice touch.But the hotel restaurant was also lovely. The food was delicious and the service excellent. There are also many really good restaurants very nearby, in all price ranges. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Good hotel. We stayed in one of the rooms on the top floor that overlooks the Arno river, beautifully decorated with the most comfortable bed and linens! The concierge was excellent and every staff was courteous. Breakfast was good with a wide selection of eggs, fruits, ham, cheese, pastries etc. Negative: bathroom malfunction, the soap holder in the bath tub is near to coming off (quite dangerous as you need to support yourself when rising from the tub) and the internet connection is absurdly expensive (8 euros for 15 minutes) a hotel of this standard must include a free wi-fi setting in each of the rooms! Would I stay here again? Probably not, for there seems to be a lot of other choices in Florence...

<Content>The Grand Hotel - Hotel Par Excellence!!! My wife  I stayed at this beautiful Firenze hotel Aug 26-29, 2008.The reception was very warm and professional and the room we stayed in on the 2nd floor had a spectacular view of ponte vecchio and the river. The concierge and the staff were all friendly and aim to please. This is a grand hotel with an old world charm, you can tell (or feel) very much that tradition and excellence is written everywhere in the way the accommodations are designed as well as the way we were served at their restaurants, spoken to and treated. We had a double room embellished in florentine art  tradition complete with high ceiling and decorated walls. The canopy over the bed reminds one of royaltyTip: The breakfast buffet (which was included in our pkg) can be enjoyed inside your room at no additional charge.We will certainly stay at this hotel again!

<Content>Absolutely amazing hotel stay This hotel was by far our favorite one in Italy. We had an AMAZING room overlooking the Arno. It was plush and decorated like a bedroom in a castle with frescoes on the walls and a huge canopy bed fit for a king and queen. It was huge and the bed was so comfortable. The staff at the front desk was always smiling and ready to help. We used the concierge numerous times and they always steered us in the right direction from restaurant choices to a private driver/guide to Siena and different wineries and another guide to give us a private three hour tour of Florence. Their own restaurant had a fabulous breakfast buffet and they were so willing to make our meal enjoyable. The outside patio restaurant had an amazing sandwich and good cocktails. Overall, one word....amazing.

<Content>The Beautiful Grand-Florence This hotel is absolutely beautiful, and located right across the street from the river with all the gorgeous bridges. It is very conveniently located. We walked to every major site in the city. The Winter Garden Lobby is truly spectacular with it's stained glass ceiling arched corridors with marble columns and piped in music. It's perfect for a night cap before turning in for the evening. There are only a couple of negative things about this hotel. First, the person who checks you in walks you to your room does nothing else and expects a tip, then comes your luggage and he needs to be tipped. Only 2 people are allowed/room. We took our daughter for her senior trip and we had to rent another entire room because they didn't allow rollaway beds even though our room was huge. The other thing that was irritating was that irons were not allowed in these 5-star rooms. You had to send your pants out to be pressed at a fee of 8.50 Euro. But get ready, everything in Europe is outrageous. We were grossly dissappointed in the food all over Italy. We thought we were going to have some phenominal Italian food. Instead we starved! The food was flavorless, minimal in portion, and outrageously expensive. We have a family friend who is doing a study abroad program in Florence and he has lost 15 pounds and can hardly wait for a good meal back home. Once we got to Rome we finally found a Hard Rock Cafe and ate there every day. The only decent meal we had in all of Italy was in Florence at the La Giostra. It's run by real live Austrian royalty and even though it wasn't as flavorful as us Texans prefer, it was very good

<Content>Lovely room, great service, fine location We booked the hotel at the last minute and got an expensive (420 Euro) room that was VERY large and plush, but with no view--it was on a small courtyard or large frescoed lightshaft, depending on your point of view. While I would have preferred a room on the Arno River, which is next to the hotel, this was very comfortable and blissfully quiet. Florence is relatively small, so it is easy to walk places, and the train station is an easy 10 minute walk away. The ground floor hotel restaurant is quite good. We had a delicious prix fixe lunch there for a reasonable price. The breakfast is rediculously expensive, but it IS a luxury hotel. It was 50 Euros for two people for the continental breakfast. It would have been 39 Euros each for the hot breakfast, including omlettes and french toast made to order. The concierge and front desk were helpful and solicitous, as you would expect at this level of hotel. They were also able to book us (for a surcharge) for a visit to the Academia (which had long lines when we arrived). Tickets to the Pitti Palace (which we had no trouble getting by simply walking up) and the Uffizi (much more difficult to get) were also available. I'd suggest booking the Academia and Uffizi before arriving at the hotel, particularly in busy months.

<Content>Good Choice for florence Stayed here three nights as part of a tour of Italy and found it to be a fairly nice, elaborate haven in the hectic city of Florence. After walking the city's narrow streets, it was relaxing to return to this hotel percehd along the Arno and facing a square. My main squeeze and I were fortunate to be assigned a massive suite that overlooked the Arno and was blessed with nice paneling, canopy bed, and ornate furnishings. Bathrooms were small, but functional. I'm not a big fan of stately old European hotels which often are raggedy and lack amenities. They assume that the traveler will spend his time in the piazzas and streets of the cities and not hang out in their rooms. Which is valid, but at night you have to come inside and I like to read before I go to sleep, but the lighting in the rooms is dim. Bathrooms are small and eccentric. But all in all, this is probably one of the best places to stay in Florence, so I don't want to overdo my criticisms. By the way, the food was great as were the dining rooms.

<Content>Nice Hotel, Right on The Arno I stayed here in the hot summer of 2006. It was a very nice hotel and close to a majority of everything. The rooms were among the biggest I've stayed in through my stay in Italy. I spent 3 nights here. The rooms were very opulent with huge canopy beds. The staff was very friendly, especially the Conceirge. They reccomended a few night clubs which were a lot of fun such as Mecano and Central Park. They also reccomended a place for dinner called Pandemonio which was so incredible we went back every night. Typical environment with a mama and the best food! It had a very pretty view of the river. It was also close to my favorite, Harry's Bar so it was nice to grab an afternoon snack right there. It is located in a tiny square with the westin across the square. I would definetly reccomend this hotel to travelers through Florence.

<Content>Best Hotel in Europe! This is one of the best hotels I've stayed with, and by far the best in Europe. No wonder it got world's best service from TA members!I stayed at the Grand for 4 nights in Feb 2008 with my wife. We were upgraded from a standard room to premier room, which was very nice and has that wonderfull... err my english is not helping me, will you have to look at the pictures of previuos reviewer! Staff are really friendly with geniune warmth and attention to detail. Andrea the barman is a really wonderful guy and one guest wrote on the guest log book that he is the best barman in the world. I agree.Location is in a quite piazze opposite the Westin Excelsior on the Arno River. 10 - 15 min walk to all attractions and 5 min from train station.

<Content>Beautiful views of the Arno River Fantastic location beside the Arno River. Ensure to ask for a room with a view. The square outside at the weekends has a market and you are only ever 10-15 minutes walk to all the sites.The hotel is dressed head to toe in traditional furnishings and drapes. The staff were very helpful and helped with making reservations for restaurants. The hotel does not have any fancy bar or restaurant to write a glowing report about - there is a cafe and restuarant but to be honest we ate and drank out. Would be good to come back to fantastic bar and sip a glass of champagne.Florence is an amazing city and a great location to go to in the winter - not as many tourists and we didn't queue for anything.We flew into Pisa and took the bus then a taxi to the hotel. Others I know took the train which is just as easy.Overall a great stay.

<Content>Excellent Old World Splendour We stayed there for a short winter break and had an excellent stay. They upgraded us (family with 9-year old) to a Junior Suite which worked out fine. We could see the duomo from our window.Comfortable room, well maintained. Friendly staff. Good price.Excellent included breakfast, which is unusual for an Italian hotel, but get a capuccino/espresso rather than the coffee in a pot.It's slightly out of the centre, being close to the train station, but not more than a few minutes walk from all the sights.

<Content>A truly Grand hotel The Grand Hotel Florence truly is a grand hotel as others have noted. My wife and I stayed here for 8 nights in Oct., 2007 and thoroughly enjoyed our stay.The room was large and elegantly appointed. The bath was huge, the dressing area and entry hall a decided plus. Neither noise nor light were a problem - sleeping on the fantastic canopied bed was really a dream.Breakfasts in the wonderful winter garden were outstanding and the entire staff - bellmen, doormen, housekeeping, reception and the wonderful concierge desk - were not only helpful and cheerful, but seemed to constantly try to find ways to increase our enjoyment of our stay. The location is so perfect that the only time we needed a ride was to and from the airport - all of the museums and attractions of Florence are within a short walking distance, loads of fine restaurants (ristorente, trattorias, osterias, pizzarias, pasticceruas, etc.) all with a few minutes stroll, yet never a crowd on the piazza Ognascenti in front of the hotel.One of my finest hotel stays of the past 50 years!

<Content>A Real Gem This was the first leg of our first trip to Italy. The Grand was an absolute beauty. Our room was huge, our bath almost as big as room. Staff was extremely helpful and friendly. Concierge did everything they could to make our stay wonderful. Location directly on the Arno River was great, within walking distance to everything. The only downside is that any extras (water, soda, room service, etc.) is extremely pricey. Still I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Loved the luxurious little extras We arrived at the Grand as the second leg of our honeymoon and were immediately told we had been given an upgraded room (upgraded to a suite) and in the suite we found rose petals had been placed on our bed and a bottle of champagne had been brought to our room. Similar nice touches abounded. The room was very nice and spacious, featuring three balconies and Arno views. The hotel is conveniently located a short walk (5 mins.) from most of the happenings in Florence proper. We found the concierge able to helpful in securing museum tickets (although with a significant surchage) and restaurant reservations (with solid recommendations). We used Starwood points to pay for the breakfast buffet. There's not much negative to say about the hotel -- it's an obvious reach to note that the TV is too small given the size of the bedroom. Highly recommended.

<Content>Mislead and deceived Stayed here because I recalled a remarkable stay about ten years ago...also, I had amassed an enormous amount of starwood points and was happy to be able to use them for this stay....After all, the euro-dollar exchange rate makes all things E.U. seem incredibly expensive and this hotel adds to the problem by not delivering in any area which is commensurate with its promises and declarations.1. I called and emailed many times to ensure that I got a room in the original wing with an Arno view with a balcony. I did not leave anything to chance...I even paid for the room from the night before to ensure that it was ready when I arrived and it had not been given away to someone else. I paid an enormous surcharge on top of the starwood points for this particular room When I arrived I was told all the rooms in the empire wing were blocked in contemplation of a renovation that was not to begin until two weeks after my departure.The Empire rooms were, in fact, in use; and the renovations started before I left the hotel, well ahead of the August 3rd date which they claimed renovations would begin.I had checked ahead about the renovations also, because I did not want to stay at a hotel that was just beginning a renovation because it would suggest the hotel was not in its best form.The renovations, I was told, was not to address the rooms or public areas, but merely a three week period during which the elevator cabs would be replaced.Suffice to say, our room was very dusty and musty; the hall carpets were badly stained and I did not appreciate a balcony that had a depth of 10. The room was enormous and depressing, the view of the arno faced a huge wall of grafitti scrawl (which I know is not the fault of the hotel). But I resent that i was lied to about the renovaitons and the rooms. I loved the room i had enjoyed in the empire building in the past.,..with a real balcony. I did not appreciate that the elevators and breakfast room went under construction three weeks ahead of schedule..with hammering and banging and closed corridors and general inefficiency.Worst of all, the concierge were shocking; they treated me unfairly and with a shameless greed unmatched by anything I have ever encountered anywhere.Florence is beautiful, the Grand is lovely...just dont lie to the customer...dont promise rooms and views and renovation schedules and deliver something else which materially interferes with the experience. Even if I had paid neither money nor points I still would have felt cheated.I have contacted Starwood Platinum Concierge and Platinum as well as the general manager of the Grand and have had no response to date....I am still waiting.I recently spent forty days in a large suite at the St Regis in New York and it was lovely...we actually lived there due to a flood in our apt.) and I had a great time at the Gritti,,,,but the Grand was a real let-down,,,,the management should not humiliate guests with their lies

<Content>Nice Experience My wife and in laws stayed in the Grand Hotel in Florence for 4 nights in June 2007. Overall, a very nice experience. The Grand is located right on the Arno river and upon check-in we were provided nice rooms overlooking the river. The rooms are nice size, especially by European standards. The service was good and the morning breakfast was very nice. The only negatives we can offer are some rather snippy people at the concierge desk, especially the head man, Paulo, who seems to be having a bad day each day. The patio outside on the front of the hotel is a nice place to have a drink, although it is very over priced ( which was not a surprise) . Nice, central location, close to everything. We probably would go back to this hotel.

<Content>Grand stay at the Grand When we arrived here by taxi from the airport, a hotel employee was able to take our luggage from the taxi. Upon our check-in, we were greeted by a very friendly employee, who spoke excellent English. The employee then took us up to our room, which was amazing. It had a nice, big bed and the two rollway beds we requested. Some very nice wallpaper also caught my eye. Restroom was very nice, with two sinks, and a shower/bathtub along with a spare shower. The internet at the hotel was also pretty good speed, though during the time we were using the computer, there was a party going on, and sound from the party seemed to seep into the room.Breakfast at the Grand was also delicious, with various pastries, juices, meats, and so on. It did add $100 ($25 x 4 people) per day to our bill, so eat up like you were dying. The concierge at the hotel was very helpful in taking our room key when we went out into Florence, helping us find out the train schedule from Florence to Venice, and helping us snag a taxi to the train station.Check-out was a breeze.

<Content>Luxury in Florence We normally do not stay at this caliber of hotel but we had Starwood points so one night was free. We were travelling with our family of 5 so we had 2 rooms. The rooms are huge. We had views of Arno. One room had floor to ceiling french doors  a small balcony. Decor is elegant without being fussy. Location is great. Concierge very helpful in securing museum  train tickets, calling a taxi etc. Service is excellent. After 2 very full days of sightseeing, it was pure luxury to go back to the hotel  have a drink while looking at the Arno  the city.

<Content>Best Hotel in Florence Our experience could not have been better. The hotel itself is a 5 Star wonder with exquisite rooms and the best service imaginable. The concierge, Ciro, was perfection personified. He gave us excellent suggestions for our off the beaten path treks and dining experiences. Both the in-house restaurant and bar facilities were fantastic and all the staff were prompt, courteous and seemed genuinely concerned our time there was as enjoyable as possible. I have recommended this hotel to friends and family and will definately return to stay again.

<Content>Truly Grand!!! This hotel is five star all the way. The hotel room we had was incredibly comfortable, elegant and spacious. The housekeeping staff was impeccable and invisible at the same time! The concierge arranged for tourguides, rental cars and made fantastic suggestions for dinner (don't miss Buca Mario!).All in all, I didn't want to leave the Grand in Florence!!!!

<Content>Our most wonderful experience For the better part of two weeks, The Grand Hotel was, quite literally, our home away from home. Without exception, the staff was professional, courteous and efficient, yet personable, amicable and warm. A smile and a pleasant salutation greeted us whenever we walked the common areas of the hotel. They seemed to take a genuine interest in our well-being.The rooms were exquisite, beyond anything I had ever experienced - from frescoed walls to canopied beds. If our future travel plans include Europe, Florence will be one of our destinations and The Grand Hotel will, once again, be our respite from the rigors of vacation travel.

<Content>Incredible hotel, absolutely superb customer service Short answer: Incredible hotel, absolutely superb customer service, one of the best I have every stayed at anywhere in the world.We stayed there in April 2007, two adults and a 10 year old child. For our Italy trip, with stops in various cities, I priced hotels through various means, including consolidators like Expedia and Travelocity, certain smaller booking websites, and correspondence with the hotels directly (either by e-mail or telephone). In this particular case I found the best deal at the Grand Hotel Florence by booking through the Five Star Alliance Hotels.I had also e-mailed the hotel that this was a special trip for my 10 year old daughter鈥檚 birthday, and requested that they assign us a nice room. When we arrived, before we had even finished registering, then entire front desk and concierge staff popped up to wish my daughter a happy birthday. For my daughter鈥檚 birthday, the hotel had upgraded us to a magnificent room at no extra charge --- a huge room, with two sets of French doors and twin balconies overlooking the Arno River, canopied bed, gilded mirrors, chandeliers, ornately painted and decorated coffered ceiling, gigantic bathroom. There were a few gifts from the hotel waiting for my daughter in the room. When we came down later for lunch, they presented her with a marbleized travel journal, and the next day gave her a chocolate Easter egg the size of an American football (much to the chagrin of my health-conscious wife!). Our room also contained, in addition to the standard sets of bathrobes and slippers, a child-sized bathrobe and slippers! I have never seen that at any other hotel, anywhere.Interestingly enough, when we went to the Galleria dell'Accademia to see Michelangelo鈥檚 鈥淒avid,鈥?I met an American executive from the Starwood hotel group, which owns the Grand Hotel Florence. He told me that Starwood was aggressively enhancing their customer relations and options for families and children, largely in response to the many customers who said, in effect, 鈥淚 don鈥檛 care about me, just treat my kid right.鈥?br/>When we arrived in our rental car, I asked the doorman to park it for me in the nearest garage, about 2 blocks away. He advised me that if I parked it myself I could save the additional $30 per day that the hotel would have to charge me in VAT. I much appreciated that tip.The restaurant is small, but the food is excellent. Room service was superb. Very good exercise room, as well.The desk clerk always called us by name and went out of his way to ask to help. Many hotels treat customers like honored guests. The Grand Hotel Florence treated us like old and valued friends of the family.

<Content>far from everything but the Arno river I stayed at the Grand because we are Starwood Gold members, I could have stayed across the courtyard at the Excelsior but the website made the Grand look more luxe. Well.... I guess the website could not communicate the mold and mildew growing in the carpets in the hallway between the bedroom and the bathroom of the suite I was staying in. I didn't notice it at first when the bellman showed us the room but later that evening it smelled of a nasty gym lockerroom. We were on the top floor over looking the Arno - the room was decorated in the high florentine tradition gold and red, tassles everywhere, canopy bed- very FLorence. The view was lovely and the size of the room was enormous by european standards. As we have five in our family we are always forced by italian law to get 2 rooms- so we also had the adjoining suite, same exact huge room with large bathroom but done in blues and gold. Besides the awful smell the only other bad thing about this hotel and it's sister hotel , the Excelsior is the location - Piazza Ogni is FAR away from everything, especially when you have younger children who don't want to walk. The Piazza is really an open concrete square which at first I thought was a parking lot, that is what is looks like - that is what separates you from the Excelsior. I will stay closer in towards the Duomo, etc next time probably at the Savoy.

<Content>The Grand is Grand The Grand is a beautiful hotel right on the river. We were fortunate to be upgraded to a balcony room overlooking the river. It was a beautiful, good sized room with a small foyer and a separate little side room for luggage. If you are renting a car, Europcar is just around the corner. When we checked out, we walked the 100 yards or so to Europcar and drove to Siena.

<Content>Hotel feeling its age We decided to stay at the Grand Hotel Florence, since it was ranked as one of the top hotels in Florence. We stayed 5 nights, and there were highs and lows to our stay.The hotel is located along the Arno River, with a very nice location across the square from the Westin Excelsior Florence. There is close shopping and some great restaurants in the area. The best thing about the hotel is almost every night on the terrace alongside the square they have a wonderful singing duo that performs. It echos throught the square, and just sets a great atmosphere with the Arno right there.Here is the deal, we had two rooms. One in the light newer area of the hotel (the front part), and one in the dark castle like area (the back part). What a difference...the front part of the hotel has smaller rooms that have been renovation, while the back part of the hotel has larger rooms that have not been renovated. It is also very expensive to stay here, and seeing the difference in the rooms really made me question the cost of staying here.Florence is my favorite city, and I think I would stay at the Savoy the next time I am in town.Now, the staff, especially the Concierge is very friendly. With a little renovation this hotel could be one of the best in Italy.

<Content>Beautiful and expensive My husband and I stayed at the Grand Hotel in Florence for 3 nights. This hotel is very well located and within easy walking distance to most of Florence's attractions. We had a beautiful room with a lovely view of the river. The bathroom was immaculate and the bed and the linens were great. The hallways are a little tired (stained carpet, scuffed walls) but the room made up for that. We had only one problem with the staff and that was at breakfast one day when they ignored us but other than that the staff members at this hotel were helpful and friendly. I would return to this hotel and recommend it to others, although it is pricey.

<Content>Wonderful hotel The staff was friendly and helpful. My daughter is a runner, so it was great to be right on the Arno River, where she could safely run along the river and across the bridges to the other side. The breakfast buffet was extensive and delicious--we esp. loved the variety of fresh fruit--and the buffet room was lovely. Our room had beautiful murals painted on the walls. The room and bathroom were very large.

<Content>A not so Grand Hotel We booked into the hotel way in advance. We were given a small dark room with the king bed almost wall to wall.We were paying a rate for a 5 star hotel and expected a much larger room. The hallways need refurbishing.The staff was stiff maybe because of the heat.We left after one night and stayed at a lovely hotel with simular amenities, a much larger room over looking the Arno River, free internet access, a very helpful staff, at 25% less cost.We have stayed at many 5 star hotels and felt the Grand Hotel was gave little value for a expensive hotel.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel We stayed at the Grand Hotel for 4 nights. We arrived by car and found it relatively easy to find. We were lucky enough to be upgraded to a Junior Suite so had a room overlooking the Arno River. The room are very comfortable and spacious. The Hotel is lovely, very friendly staff, great food and a handy location. Just a short stroll to Ponte Vecchio. We would definately stay here again.

<Content>Loved it The hotel is beautiful and the location is right on the Arno River. The view of the river is wonderful and within walking distance to many of the sites. Everything was perfect from the rooms to the service. Out of all the other places in Florence, I would recommend this one. I've stayed in other hotels in Florence and this one is much more grand.

<Content>Grand Hotel Florence -- the perfect place to stay in Florence We just returned from a long weekend at The Grand in Florence. We sandwiched a weekend in Florence around a week in Rome where we stayed at their sister hotel, The Westin Excelsior Rome. The Grand is part of the Westin's Luxury Collection of hotels. A beautiful old hotel in the grand hotel tradition. Extremely well maintained. Rooms are large, spacious, well furnished. Bedding and bath are to die for. Our room (#214) looked out on The Arno and had two balconies -- one in the bedroom and one in the bathroom.This was our second time back to The Grand, and we intend to return again.Staff and service is excellent. Food and service in their new bar/restaurant in the front lobby were also excellent, but the restaurant is a bit too modern for the rest of the hotel. Breakfast, which was included with our package, was good but not as good as The Excelsior in Rome.We stayed at The Grand as part of the Westin's Luxury Collection's Welcome to Italy program -- you must stayed at least seven nights in total in any of their Luxury Collection hotels in Italy. The hotels came at an all inclusive rate of $489 per night. At first this may seem high, but when you consider the price is in dollars (not euros) and includes all taxes, service charges and breakfast, it is actually very reasonable for the level of service and quality of the hotels you are staying at. This was our second time in two years that we utilized the Welcome to Italy plan. In addition to The Grand we stayed at the Excelsior in Rome, this time, and previously at The St. Regis Grand in Rome and The Regina-Europa in Venice.Location is everything, and you won't find a better spot in Florence to stay. Right on the River Arno, and easy walking to all sights and restaurants.Be sure to dine at Trattoria Pandemonio, just across the river on Via del Leone. We have dined there three times now (twice this trip), and will plan future trips to Italy to include a stop in Florence and diner with Mamma at Pandemonio. If you are going to Florence, The Grand is the place to stay.

<Content>Outstanding Room This was the second Starwood hotel this trip that we used Starpoints for. We stayed five nights and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. We had a marvelous upgraded huge room that, although rather baroque in decor, was very comfortable. We had a view of the Arno. The room was very quiet. There was a large walk in closet and exceedingly well-appointed bathroom. Everything was sumptuous. The concierge was extremely helpful and useful for recommending restaurants. And one of the porters saved us quite a bit of money by pointing out that the car we rented had more damage than was accurately shown on the rental form, which we subsequently had adjusted.The negatives were minor and did not mar the experience. First, the location was not as central as I would have liked. Second, the public areas of the hotel are rather uninspired. This latter point did not really affect us, but it is nice to enter a place that has some life to it.In any case. this was a great place to stay.

<Content>Gorgeous This was our 2nd visit to the Grand Hotel and it was fantastic once again. The staff are brilliant. We were travelling with kids so we had interconnecting rooms. So much space and beautifully furnished. The restaurant food is excellent quality and great choices and there is also a special menu for kids. This is how a hotel should be run!We would definately stay there again.
