<Content>A Royal Stay At Royal Park The view from our room was just magnificent. There were the usual buildings typical of HK set against a backdrop of green rolling hills (or low mountains?) and a lake. This hotel is located in a sort of mega complex. It's connected to New Town Plaza, an upscale mall (stores and restaurants were mid to high end), which is also connected to the Sha Tin MTR station. So when you get off the station, you walk through the mall to get to the hotel. It's very convenient, you don't even have to step outside. It's 15 mins. away from Tsim Sha Tsui via MTR. The location is perfect if you want to sleep away from the busier TST area but still have easy access to it. There is also a bus stop right outside the hotel where you can catch the airport bus (and others). We got upgraded to the executive floor at no extra charge so I think maybe our room was a little bit better than the typical standard rooms. The room/bathroom was big, bright, beautiful and perfectly clean. The decor/style is modern with a touch of Asian aesthetics, just enough to make it non-generic. It didn't have any unpleasant smell even though it was a smoking room. The bed was soft and comfy. There was a big LCD TV with cable and both wi-fi and broadband internet was available in the room although I don't know if it's free since we didn't bring a laptop. My husband did use the internet in their business center for a fee (I think HKD40 for half an hour). The staff were friendly and helpful and check in/check out was a breeze. We also found a small playground called Snoopy's World in an outdoor area between the hotel and the mall. My son had fun playing there. It was small but it had a cute water ride, a playground and a diner. It's very photo-friendly because it's decorated with Snoopy and cartoony stuff. Compared to other HK hotels, the price is awesome for all the things Royal Park has to offer. No wonder it's rated as one of HK's top hotels on TripAdvisor. It's definitely on top of my personal list. LOVED IT!

<Content>Great location for shopping The hotel is conviniently located next to the malls and MTR station. There is a MTR line from East Tsim Sai Tsui to Sha Tin MTR. It only take about three minutes to walk, thru the mall, from Sha Tin MTR to the hotel.The room is standard western 5-star hotel, but I thought the breakfast was lack of variety and the food were tasteless. The third floor is connected to the mall where there are lots of food stalls; but they are lack of seating tables. Be prepare to order the food to go and eat them in your room.The location of the lifts and lobby is akward since there is a staircase between them; which makes carrying lots of suitcase and children a bit of a hassle. But, besides that, the hotel is great and I am considering to stay in the hotel in the future.

<Content>out of city center, but decent i had a difficult time figuring out how to get to this hotel. but that is more an issue with the system at the airport - than the hotel itself. this is a really nice hotel. the concierge desk people were very good. and the rooms are good. during my stay the first two nigths were great. but on the third night, the night before my big presentation the next day - a couple with a screaming baby moved in next door! so i just sucked it up and went to do my presentation. when i returned i politely inquired to the front desk if i could change rooms... but i wanted a comparable room (wouldn't mind an upgrade for the trouble of packing a day early essentially). so front desk said okay. then i was taken to my new room -- smaller and further from elevator! in addition, the new room had two burned out lamps and lacked a bathrobe. i don't usually use the latter, so no big deal, but you get my point that they don't pay attention to details. so i told front desk i was not happy. they just said whatever and offered to give me the original room back! so basically, i was inconvenienced, and when i politely addressed the issue = i was downgraded (at same price). they insisted the smaller room had a better view?!?! so, i guess i would describe them as a 3 star in four star clothing. in a pinch, good place = because new town plaza is attached; so you can pretty much get anything you want from there, and the MTR has a station in the plaza. also, bus A41 goes right to the front of the hotel. and at the time i stayed there is was a HK$21 trip = good value. the other thing, my original room faced the apartment complex and i got free wifi. when i was put in my new romm, poof, no wifi. and the price for getting the internet is HK$100 a day.

<Content>Fantastic- 4-5 star level service, great value This hotel is up to the standards of any four star property in Asia (which is several steps above the equiviliant in the US or Europe). I frequently travel in the region, usually at high-end luxury properties. If there are two things I value most in any hotel, its uniqueness and flexibility. I hate generic chains, and this hotel is anything but. Its pure class, without being generic- little decorative touches make all the difference. The location is not central (although there is a metro only a 10 min indoor - through a mall- walk from your room), but I was here for a conference at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and the location was perfect. Took only 25 min door to door, including the university shuttle bus. I stayed on the executive floor, which was definitely worth the relatively small upgrade price. Free breakfast in a private executive room, with at most 2-3 other people was a welcome respite from the chaos of the restaurant downstairs filled with mainlanders. Was also a nice place to wind down in the evening, with snacks that mitigated my need for dinner at all. The food was excellent, the fruit perfectly ripe (often wanna-be luxury hotels will hug the letter, not the spirit of luxury in things like this- providing fruit, but not checking the quality, etc). Fruit in my room. Drinks free from the minibar and available in the executive lounge across the hall all day/night. Free internet included. Great views.This hotel excels in the details. Fabrics are rich and interesting, everything works perfectly, service is thoughtful but not intrusive.Biggest fluffiest pillows I have ever had! Tasteful and unique decor.Only downsides- the airport shuttle, although included in the price of my room, comes infrequently, and they lost my reservation on the way here. Just grab a cab- cheap and quick, especially after a long flight. The hot water was variable from the shower, which had a tendency to go from cool to scalding every 5 min or so, but was manageable once you got used to the tap. Room service food was not very good, but thats to be expected, even in the nicest places in Asia.One of the best values I have seen- US$160 for the executive room, with tax included. Book from the hotel or the website- its much cheaper.

<Content>Almost Perfect The Royal Park Hotel is a fantastic hotel that aspires to be up there with some of the best in the world, a fantastic entrance with space imposing mirrors marble flooring and golden framed doorways...An eclectic range of restaurants to from the traditional Chinese/Dim-Sum to a more European restaurant which also doubles as the fantastic buffet breakfast facility and a Japanese Teppanyaki eatery.Staff were attentive and welcoming and spoke excellent English, tea coffee at breakfast was always refilled quickly and efficiently and we never had to wait for a table either at Lunch or Dinner in the hotel.Room itself was a tiny bit on the small side to be perfectly honest, this is my only gripe with the hotel and the only point holding it back from a full 5 stars....maybe the room would have been a sufficient/spacious size for two but for three was just the wrong side of comfortable...but only slightly, it really wasn't that much of a worry.Amenties in room were fantastic, with every need almost being catered for from the dressing gowns in the bathroom to the mini-bar and the big LCD TV, beds were also very good too and room was well decorated throughout, with a special mention going to the spacious Shower/Bath/Toilet facility.On paper the hotel seems like it isn't in a fantastic location, but we found it to be near perfect...it's not right in the centre of HK so you don't have the noise pollution, smog etc. to contend with but its not far outside the main central area that you feel you're missing out...with Central station being a mere 10 minute MTR hop away.Another quick mention about the location if you love shopping, you'll love the location as it's practically right on top of a shopping centre!!Great experience throughout here, and would come back again as i found HK and this hotel very nice indeed.

<Content>Very Nice 4 Star Hotel This is a very nice 4+Star Hotel. It is located about a 15-20 minute subway (MRT) ride from downtown Kowloon in the suburbs, which is really nice in terms of getting away from the noise and crowds. The hotel is connected to a few shopping centers with food courts and supermarkets. The subway (MRT) station is a 10 minutes walk thru one of the shopping centers. Hotel also has a shuttle service to downtown area. Ask for a room overlooking the river. There is a very nice walking/jogging area along the river. Rooms very nice and well appointed. Internet available in room, but I found it to be slow. I complained and they took the charge off (cost is by the minute, to US $12 max for 24 hours). Staff tries to be very accomodating. I paid about US $125/night

<Content>Excellent Hotel We stayed one night in this hotel on a stopover in Hong Kong and we liked it very much. The room (we booked a standard one but I think they gave us an upgrade) was the best we've ever had in a hotel, large, well-equipped and clean. It had a very pleasant river view over the park next door, where scores of people came to do their morning exercises. The staff were very helpful. We didn't use any of the other hotel facilities, but I expect they were good.The only downside is that the area, Sha Tin, is pretty remote - perhaps 10 miles - from the centre of Kowloon on the East coast of the New Territories.. It's not on any of the normal tourist maps. However, it's modern and the park and the river are very pretty. The shopping malls next to the hotel are pretty comprehensive, the MTR and bus stations are very close, and there's an hourly shuttle into Kowloon. The A41 bus from the airport costs around $25, takes about 40 minutes and stops outside the door.We stayed in a hotel on the main island on our return stopover, and although we liked that too, we had fond memories of the peace of Sha Tin.

<Content>Fine hotel, location far from central Overall, we thought his hotel to be pretty good - the staff were friendly and helpful, our room was fine though not overly spacious - the only issue for us was the hotel's location. It is a long way from what might be called the centre of Hong Kong. In our ignorance we first used taxis to get downtown. They were very expensive, so it's important to check out the alternatives. Others told us that the hotel bus was unreliable and our best journey was by train - the ticket cost 16 Dollars for the 2 of us, compared to 300 for the taxi! There is also a huge new shopping mall immediately next door to the Park Royal which is nice and convenient and that's where the train stops too.Overall, we thought the hotel was better than Hong Kong itself, which - by an large - did not impress us. We summed it up as millions of people crowded into countless high rise apartment blocks that totally over filled the very small land area available. So not great!

<Content>Fabulous rooms Recently refurbished for the Olympic equestrian teams the rooms are modern, spacious and comfortable with all the amenities you'd expect. We stayed on the Executive Floor with private check in/out and lounge/business facilities where the service was wonderful. Nothing was too much trouble. Breakfast offered a wide selection of international cuisine and the Chinese Restaurant was the best we ate for our entire time in Hong Kong. The Newtown Plaza shopping centre is located next door which is one of the biggest in Hong Kong and also accommodates an MTR station so getting around was easy. I cannot recommend this hotel enough as long as you don't mind staying out of the city.

<Content>Excellent hotel! We have just returned from a six night stay at the Royal Park Hotel in Shatin, Hong Kong. We booked it following reading reviews on Tripadvisor and were not disappointed. The hotel is 20 minutes outside of Hong Kong itself but travel into Kowloon is easy. There is an excellent shuttle bus from the hotel (free if you book an Executive Room package) and it runs on the hour and returns from Kowloon on the half hour. The train system is also very convenient even if it does involve a little bit of walking and the excellent Octopus Card which you can purchase at the information desk at airport arrivals makes travel a breeze. The hotel is very easy to get to from the airport. Just exit down the ramp in the middle of arrivals and at the bottom, turn right to the bus park (make sure you don't go left to the tour coaches). The card costs 150 HK dollars including 50 dollars for the card (refundable) and100 HK dollars credit. Once you go down the ramp to the exit and turn right look for bus A41, get off at the third stop, the one after the bus terminal in Shatin Mall. The driver doesn't give change so the Octopus card is your best bet and the bus stops right outside the hotel itself. 150 HK dollars covered all our travel including the star ferry, buses and trains and we didn't need to use a taxi other than from the hotel to the airport for our return which cost 320 HK dollars as our flight was early before first airport bus at 5.30am.Anyway, back to the hotel. Even though they say it is their 20th Anniversary you would never know it as it is modern, stylish, immaculately kept and very welcoming. If you can, get an Executive room package as the extra you pay is well worth it. The Executive rooms are normally on the 16th floor,and request one with a river view. All the extras make it great value as access to the Executive Lounge gives free internet access, free breakfast, access throughout the day for soft drinks and free alcoholic drinks and canapes between 6pm and 8pm. It also includes free travel on the shuttle bus and other benefits. The biggest disappointment was the hotel food. Breakfast was quite extensive but of only fair quality and we tried dinner in both the 2+2 restaurant and their Chinese Restaurant, both of which were disappointing. In fairness, when I raised my concern it was dealt with efficiently and promptly. If staying for six nights it is best to look at their extended stay package as it is a great deal even if you check out a day earlier than the package deal. Check their website carefully to see the various packages available. The staff, almost without exception were charming and helpful. We only came across one surly person all week and he was from the Concierge team. The hotel Leisure Centre looked good even though we didn't use it and all in all, we were glad we booked a hotel outside of the cente itself as it was great value for money and allowed us to escape the throbbing life of Kowloon and Hong Kong City.Amongst the many things we enjoyed were a visit to the Peak and a visit to the 10,000 Buddahs Temple in Shatin. The temple is only a 5 -10 minute walk from the hotel but beware the 500 steps you have to climb but it is worth it when you get to the top! Head for Pai Tau Village just next to the Shatin bus teminal outside the Mall and you will see the signposts for the Temple. Another great day or half day trip is to Sai Kung, a charming fishing village just a 45 minute bus ride from the hotel. We took the 299 bus from Shatin to Sai Kung and used our Octopus Cards. There are loads of great seafood restaurants round the harbour in Sai Kung. Our frustration was we had breakfast and arrived at lunchtime and therefore weren't hungry but we couldn't resist a plate of prawns in garlic with a bottle of wine. The buses run till quite late so it is possible to make an evening of it, well worth a try. We also enjoyed going to Aberdeen. Several buses go there but we took the 75 from the main Central Exchange. There is a free ferry transfer to Jumbo, allegedly the world's largest floating restaurant. We had a few beers on board overlooking the marina with some seafood samplers as canapes. This was inexpensive and a good experience. People have criticised the food on Jumbo but for a few picks it was reasonable and fun. We did find it difficult locating good restaurants but that was our fault rather than Hong Kong as people say the food is great. We found a bustling food area on Knutsford Terrace near Jordan Road. where we had a good meal. It is also worth visiting the night marketynear Jordan Road where there are loads of food outlets with many people eating in the open air, we decided to give it a miss however even though it did look authentic. One food experience we didn't do and now regret is having dinner on The Terrace at the Peninsula Hotel. Their buffet dinner is about 拢45 a head but looked stunning. If you are not stayng at the Peninsula or having dinner there, at least go into the lobby for a glass of wine. At 拢12 a glass it is not cheap but the experience transports you back to a bygone age - try it!!Another thing worth doing is to go for a walk in the park next to the hotel at 7.15am in the morning. The early morning warmth is intoxicating as you sit and watch hundreds of people doing exercises to music using fans, swords etc - a charming experience which you wouldn't get if you stayed in the city itself!!It was a long 12 hour trek from London to Hong Kong for six nights but well worth the experience. We travelled on Air New Zealand and the airline was excellent, on time, good planes and very good service and food. Would we go to Hong Kong again and repeat the experience? There is no doubt about it and we would also make the Royal Park our base.

<Content>Great hotel at great rates! We booked a longstay package via the hotel website, at a great rate. The Royal Park is officially listed as a 3 star hotel, but I think that has to be reviewed: I would say it is a potential 4 to 5 star hotel.Location is outside citycenter. Hongkong has different citycenters and this hotel is conveniently located inside one of the biggest malls in HK. So no loss there as far as shopping is concerned. Downtown HK is very close by using the MTR, it takes app. 10 minutes to get there. The MTR is a very efficient and cheap means of transport as well as the intricate system of busses (doubledecker, green and red busses). Buy an Octopus card for easy travelling on all public transport.The rooms in the Royal Park were very spacious, clean and with a contemporary interior. We didn't use the breakfast or dining facilities as there were enough restaurants in the surrounding area of Sha Tin.A definite find in HK!

<Content>Wonderful location away from downtown Kowloon Sha Tin is a great location on the edge of the New Territories. The hotel looks out over the Pearl River and it's a short walk to the riverside park. Walking along the river is a wonderful respite from Hong Kong's busy city streets. The room is large and comfortable. Breakfast in the Executive room is spartan, so the buffet restaurant is a better deal, although the selection is still not great. The hotel is located next to two large shopping centres and the MTR. It only takes a 10-15 minutes by train to Kowloon, so if you don't want to stay in the downtown area, this is a good choice.

<Content>Bad experience when i reach the hotel, i was told to be brought up to 16th floor to check in as i'm staying executive. the receptionist called a guy to bring me up because u need the keycard to use the lift. so then we went into the lift together, he pressed 16 and 9. no idea why, he walked out of the 9th floor to continue his work i think. he did not say anything and left, so i asked, 'is this the floor i suppose to be?' he pointed at the 16th floor and left. i reached the executive floor and got lost. nobody anywhere. i wandered for 10mins to find the hidden lounge for checking in. i stayed for 2 nights, twice during breakfast, nobody greeted me, asked me if i wanted coffee or tea, i can see and hear the executive receptionist and butler talking and laughing non stop because they were right in front of my table. i was the only one having breakfast btw. since nobody seems to bother, i just do watever i want, so after breakfast i used the internet in the exec. lounge, i saw minimised blogs of the butler. cos his pics are everywhere. the mini bar in the room is really deceiving. there're only 2 cans or beer and soft drinks, thats all. being executive package, i get free mini bar consumptions and free topping up. it was not topped up at all. i also remembered when i checked in, i asked if i can use credit card for deposit and pay cash when checking out, they said yes, but when i check out, they said sorry, credit card had already been charged. i wrote in to tell them wat i had gone through but to get an email in a non apologic way saying they are sorry giving such bad experience but such experience doesnt mean overall performances for olyimpic chosen hotel. i will only go again for the price, i stayed twice and non were good in any services.

<Content>Great hotel and staff We chose to stay in the Executive suite, it was very nice and worth paying the extra money. You have acces to the exec lounge where you can go for breakfast and have snacks and drinks all day. We also spent most nights in the exec lounge having cocktails and food, which was certainly a nice way to finish the day. It is very private and quiet in there and the staff make you feel special. We certainly would reccommend this hotel and pay the extra to have the exec floor because it is all included in the room rate. And the hotel shuttle to down town is included. The only thing which we thought was a bit misleading was the free mini bar, as it only has two cool drinks and two beers in it. But i guess if you can access free drinks all day in the exec loung it didn't matter.The staff were all wonderful and the room was great.Location is a bit away from the city but public transport/shopping centres are so close it does not matter. Being away fron the city was nice as we got a little tired of 'copy watch!!! ect

<Content>Five shiny stars for Royal Park We had a great stay at the Royal Park. It is so conveniently located right next to a shopping mall and access to the MTR transit system (which is the only way to get around Hong Kong).The Hotel is clean and well kept and all service staff is very helpful and accomodating. The swimming pool area is very pleasant with an indoor/outdoor situation.The only complaints would be that they dont put a top sheet on the beds. Just a bottom sheet and a feather duvet with a sheet like cover that they change every day. Also, the windows dont open, so no outside air, but some people dont care about that so not too big of a deal.We tried to explain the concept of another sheet to the maid who nodded and smiled, but never seemed to get it. Communication breakdown.We were at this hotel for 10 days and would DEFINITELY go back .

<Content>Great Hotel  I have stayed here for 7 consecutive nights. The price is great since I am on their long stay packing..which costed me NETT HK$5200 (inclusive of all taxes) for corporate rate! The standard room is big and comes with a two seater couch too..very modern design throughout the whole hotel, they have just recently refurnished..so it is FANTASTIC. The location is abit off since I am here for business but the hotel shuttle compensate this all, it takes about 20mins from the hotel to Tsim Sha Tsui MTR, and from there u can take mtr to hong kong island in less than 5mins. there are many great malls around here, if u are here for holidays, shopping here is great, variety of international and local brands, many restaurants just a stone throw away from the hotel, and they all connected to the hotel by overhead covered bridgesThe healthclub is fantastic, I used the gym every night and hardly anyone there.. the pool is big enough, it stretches from indoor to outdoor and of the right temperature.I didn't use the laundry service in the hotel, i went across to Hilton mall laundry shop, that charged HK$30 for 7pounds load of clothes, collection within 3 hours. Its the Wing Shing Dry Cleaning at Shop 2A, level one, hilton plaza (3mins walk from hotel), tel[--](if you need the conceiger to assist you)

<Content>Gr8 Hotel in Sha Tin We decided to stay at this hotel for just under 2 weeks as a way to see the rest of HK, and for the price it was absolutely great! The hotel is situated in the Northern Territories, and if you plan on staying in HK for more than just a few days, this is an ideal way to see the city, as it has great transport links, which are pretty cheap and efficient. The hotel is situated right next to the huge Sha Tin mall, which has all the usual Western brand names, as well as a wide variety of Western chain restaurants, and some very good Chinese restaurants, all of which are open fairly late.There is currently construction work next to the hotel for a new cinema, but we could not hear any of the noise from the 8th floor, although they had sent us a note saying that the water supply to the rooms will be cut off for a few hours, but this did not really affect us. We did make use of the bar on a number of occassions, and drinks were not too expensive...we did not make use of the restaurants, but the prices seemed much higher than eating in some of the nearby restaurants.As suggested by other reviews, the A41 double decker bus services runs every 15-20 mins between Sha Tin and the airport and only costs 20HKD per person (use exact change), taking 40 mins or so, and this works out much cheaper than using a taxi. We also made regular use of the hourly shuttle service offered by the hotel to Kowloon (which takes 15-20 mins - dropping you off outside the Peninsula hotel) for only 15HKD. If you want to be more flexible try using the very good train service, which is only 3-5 mins walk from the hotel.The park situated behind the river is also very clean and peaceful, and we used it regularly for peaceful walks in the morning and evenings. The heritage museum is also 10 mins walk and is a good way to spend a few hours. We also decided to see the 10,000 Buddhas temple, which again is 10 mins walk, and although it is on a steep hill, there are a number of escalators which take you right to the top for good views of the area.All in all, we would recommend this hotel to anyone that wants to have a nice peaceful stay, away from the hustle bustle of central HK, but at the same time see the city in an effective and efficient way.

<Content>Excellent Value After our disappointment with the Royal Plaza in Kowloon, we spent our last night in Hong Kong at the Royal Park which is in Sha Tin. Wasn't expecting much for the cheap price we paid, but boy were we wrong. This hotel is top notch! Modern, clean line decor throughout the hotel. Rooms were spacious and linens were soft and quite comfy. Hotel provides an hourly shuttle bus to Tsim Sha Tsui (didn't take it but nice to know it is available) and is connected to a shopping mall with train station connections. Although further away from TST and many of the tourisity attractions, it was nice to be away from the hustle and bustle of Kowloon. Staff are very friendly and helpful.

<Content>Incredible hotel This has got to rank among the best hotels that I have ever been in. Courteous service, convenient location (next to many shopping malls, the A41 route to/from the airport, and a short walk from a train station), and impeccably clean.I was on the 13th floor and didn't smell a whiff of smoke. The view out my window was quite nice however.The pool looked lovely.The only downside: The HK$100 charge for internet feels like being nickle/dimed, but this kind of thing seems to happen at all nice hotels.The area restaurants also seem to close about 30min - 1 hour ahead of their posted times so be careful if you are really jetlagged.

<Content>4 star in the Suburbs This is a great hotel to stay at, if you plan to see all of Hong Kong and not just the Kowloon and Hong Kong Island. It is1/2 way to Lo Wu, the border with Shenzhen, China. I stay at this hotel often, as I'm working in Sheung Shui or Shenzhen. It's about a 20minute ride to the border, and 20-30 minute ride to Tsim Sha Tsui; which can be quite tiring if you plan to spend evenings downtown. I'd rank this as a 4 star hotel on the US/Euro scale of hotels. The rooms are large, and the staff is very friendly. As with most hotels in HK there is a mall next door - which is where the KCR train station is as well; about a 5 minute walk through the mall. The rooms are nicer and cheaper then all the hotels I've stayed in in Kowloon.

<Content>Great Hotel Amazing hotel in an amazing city!Sha Tin is a perfect location as it puts you away from the crowds and noise of city centre but at the same time you can be there in 10 minutes thanks to the KCR. Bus from the airport stops right in front of the door, and the hotel is connected with 4 shopping centres!Hotel itself is a steal at that price, rooms are clean although you would have to upgrade to have a nice view (which we havent done)Service was great and facilities as well.The only thing: do not eat breakfast there: you will be ripped off blind for the stuff you eat - you can get something in the mall across the street for few times cheaper!I would love to go back to Hong Kong and if I do I will be booking with Royal Park once again!

<Content>Nice, Convenient hotel- Superb staff Thank goodness for trip advisor. First, we arrived at the HK airport. Following the advice of other travelers, we did a few things. First, we exchanged our money at the ATM and saved. Then, we took the A41 shuttle bus to the Royal Park ($20 HKDpp) and saved. It is true; A41 drops you directly in front of the hotel. We paid about $125 USD per night for a superior room on the 13th floor (the only non-smoking floor) . The rooms were a nice size, with lush king bed (so comfy), heavenly pillows, an average sized bathroom with tub/shower, a work desk, and a chaise nestled in the corner. The internet was not free, $100 HKD a day. Calls to china were $50 HKD with additional charges per minute.The staff was the best: helpful, attentive, courteous, professional, did I say helpful. We asked them how to get everywhere and they showed us detail by detail. The conceirge is excellent with good English.The hotel which is conveniently attached to a huge mall with several American stores: BCBG, Calvin Klein, Lacoste, French Connection, Armani Xchange, etc. Also, it is attached to the train stations: KCR, MTR, and other local trains. The railway system is excellent and easy to follow.
