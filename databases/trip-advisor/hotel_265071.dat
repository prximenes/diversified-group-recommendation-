<Content>Pictures great! Room is so-so The best thing about this hotel is how it pictures! Here is the good and the bad.The good:The breakfast was great. Good hot eggs and decent selection to get you through 2-3 days. We stayed there 3 days and I never had a complaint about the food. i wish they had better coffee, but at least there was hot stuff!The internet was nice. It was free with the room so I was happy to catch up, check email, and plan out a few things without being charged by the minute.The Staff was super nice. The woman at the front desk was EXTREMELY helpful and courteous. She was very smiley and patiently asked all of our questions. Thank goodness for her! THe rest of the staff was great too, never had a complaint. Everyone was pretty nice.The bad:The room wasn't all that great. The shower was TINY and there was an AC leak in our room. There was no view and there was a constant musty smell.. kind of gross. My wife says she felt itchy all night.... could have been her sensitive skinLocation. Even though it is conveniently located near the rail, you really have to walk a bit to get to any of the destinations. I thought it would be convenient, but I would have rather stayed closer to all the action. My legs were done for after 3 days. Bleh.

<Content>OK Hotel We stayed at the Hotel Delle Nazioni for 2 nights with the family. We had 2 rooms and both rooms were very spacious, clean and had stunning views. Our rooms were on the 5th floor and they appeared to have been renovated recently. The rooms were very basic but provided enough space and comfort. The hotel is right across from the train station. I read some reviews here on TA that the area around the train station is undesirable and unsafe. We travelled with our kids and did not feel unsafe at all. We would come home late in the evening and we felt totally safe. It is walking distance to a lot of the attractions in Florence. This is an average hotel perfect for those who just need a nice and clean room to sleep and shower. The breakast is adequate but nothing to write home about. The front desk people can use a little training in customer service. They were not bad, but they can be more accomodating to their guests. Overall, we had a nice stay and do not mind staying here again.

<Content>Convenient comfortable and clean Just across the road from the train station, 5-10 minutes walk from the Duomo, and just round the corner from the bus station. Very convenient if you are on the Terravision bus. Lots of work going on outside laying tram lines, but the hotel is well insulated and the work only goes on in the daytime. Rooms are clean and comfortable; clean white sheets and towels every day. Great choice for breakfast. Only bad point was no shower screen which meant water splashed everywhere and caused some mould on bathroom wall. Free use of internet in reception area a bonus. Would book again.

<Content>Pretty decent, maybe overpriced This was a decent hotel, and we were very grateful for their free internet and 5 pcs to choose from since I had forgotten to pack my recharger. The breakfast was also quite good, well cooked scrambled eggs and an okay selection of other things. During our stay, there was a ton of construction going on at their front facing street, wish I had known sooner. The bathroom left much to be desired, simple things like an effective shower door and towel racks or hooks. Would I stay there again? Maybe, but I'd definitely look around first.

<Content>Excellent location It is right across the road from Santa Novelli train station  withing 10 minutes walk to all the major attractions.We had a 1st floor room which was VERY clean  very large. The only downside was that the street noise was very audible from the room which was very noisy.The staff were ok, but not very welcoming.They have six interent terminals for free use, which is an added bonus.I would recommend this hotel to everyone.

<Content>Great location-ok room We booked this hotel as part of a build your own trip through Gate 1 travel. This hotel had a fantastic location-VERY close to the main bus station and easy to walk to. We arrived early and our room was not ready, so they locked up our luggage in a storage room so it would be safe while we went sightseeing. The room is OK. Very spacious, very Ikea furnished, very NOT cozy. Plain walls, plain furniture, small TV. This was fine for us, since we werent there to hang out in the room. However we had the shower. It was about 2 by 2 feet and had this weird folding accordion plastic door type of thing which when opened swished water all over the bathroom floor. For the one night we were there, we dealt with it. They have free internet in their internet lounge and I believe free wi-fi in the rooms. They have an OK breakfast and a bar, but I didnt see anyone ordering or serving drinks. This is my second vacation booked with Gate 1 and we always find we get the best deals through them. If I had this trip to do over again I would have booked one of their organized tours rather than doing a build your own. Theyre very responsive and send lots of information with your travel documents. Always check out Gate 1 deals before you book anything!

<Content>Very good for the price Hotel was easy to find and right beside the train station. We were able to book in earlier than the minimum check in time. Room was a good size. The A/C worked but we were unable to open the window blinds so we couldnt see the view. Bathroom was clean but we were unable to close the shower door so the bathroom partically flooded each time we used the shower. The free inernet cafe was a bonus. The staff were very friendly and helped us with everything we asked.

<Content>Great Experience Florence was the second leg of our two week honeymoon, and we stayed for two nights at this hotel. The staff was very helpful and friendly when we checked in, and we were given a room on the top floor (fifth for Europeans, sixth for Americans). We had a porch and the view was great. You can see it in the pictures already posted, but to our left were the mountains (don't look down because all you see is the train station). To our right was il Duomo and downtown Florence. The porch had a great breeze and we spent part of both nights on the porch relaxing.The hotel decor is very bare, with hardwood floors and very little decoration in the rooms. That was not a negative for us. My wife, a light sleeper, fell in love with the foam mattress and slept wonderfully, but unfortunately I did not sleep quite as well. The television in the room worked, we had good desk space, and the climate control was excellent. The bathroom was a good size and everything worked as well as it should have. One person had posted about being close to the station but not being able to hear any noise. That is very accurate, except for once we never heard any station noises even though the hotel is right next door to the train station. We had no such luck however with our roommates next door on the final day, who were loud by nature and we could hear through the walls.The staff, as I mentioned, was very friendly and helpful with our questions. The breakfast is good and has a variety of food and juice. It was a great way to start a day of sightseeing.I would recommend this hotel, the location and value are excellent. This is more of a 4 star hotel than a 3 star hotel.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel, Fractional Price! Fantastic, Central hotel for the price that we paid. 3 star facilities for the price of a 1 star hotel! The best hotel we stayed in on our 7 week trip across europe!Pros:-------- Central location, spitting distance to train station- Awesome clean spacious room with colour tv, balcony, airconditioning and massive double bed.- Massive bathroom with bidet!- Excellent full hot buffet breakfast- FREE internet on computer terminals in lobby that actually worked!- Whisper quiet room (mostly - when the local council is not ripping up the road right outside your room!!!)- Friendly, helpful reception and staffCons:--------- Leaky airconditioning system....drip...drip....drip...- flimsy shower curtain- Mold on walls (small patch near aircon unit)

<Content>Bad Hotel Bad hotel,, horrible!We arrived last friday (june the 20th), and Florence was boiling for the weather, very hot and humid.In our room the air conditioned didn't work, was broken, we didn't sleep. the day after someone repaired the apparatus but the air was not cool. We paied 450,00 鈧?for 4 night to have a room in a kind of basement flat and not so clean.Breakfast was not so good with sub-bran product. We calculate that we can go in a 4 star hotel (ex Ambasciatori next to ours) at the same price.The advantages: internet free and the closeness to the central station.I want to suggest a tipical Tuscan restaurant, very good also for the price Ristorante Fagioli - 50122 Firenze (FI) - 47/R, CORSO DEI TINTORI - tel: + 39 055 244285. Closure: August, Saturday and Sunday.

<Content>Fantastic views!!! We received a complimentary room upgrade to a superior room. I would book that room again if ever I was in Florence! It is on the 6th floor and has a huge balcony area. It has views over the rooftops of the city - the Duomo and other buildings in the city and the hills in the distance. It is across the road from the railway station and a short walk from the cenral city and Duomo.Fantastic room, great staff working hard to ensure you enjoy your stay.

<Content>Great stay for the money! During a tightly booked trip through Italy (Venice-Florence-Rome), the Hotel Delle Nazioni was a great respite. I was wary of the 2陆 star rating, but was pleasantly surprised. We were booked into a large 2 bed room with balcony. AC worked greated, and room was quiet.Breakfast buffet was fantastic, and the free Internet access in the upper lobby was an added plus. Front desk staff was helpful and friendly. It's just a short walk to the Santa Maria Novella Train Station, so, it's convenient to all Florence has to offer.

<Content>Good Internet Hotel We stayed in a double room for four nights:Positives:- Good location, across the road from the central train station therefore easy to arrive and depart and also easy for day trip to other parts of Tuscany. Also walkable distance to the Duomo and all the other main tourist attractions.- Free internet available for hotel customers. There are a number of computers in the hotel lounge available for use as well as wireless internet in your hotel room.- Staff friendly.- Good shower.Negatives:- Skip the breakfast and sleep in. The utensils were dirty. Milk was warm. Bread was stale. Best thing to eat is anything packaged and not likely to be handled by the kitchen. This is a 1 star breakfast. Overall, was just very unhygenic.Overall, I would recommend this hotel for the location and internet. The room cost EUR 100 per night and was decent.

<Content>Should ne upgraded to a 4 star + I recently stayed 3 nights in this hotel with my mother and have to say we couldn't have picked a better hotel. I have stayed in many a four star hotel in Italy but none compare to this hotel. The staff were fantastic always on hand to offer friendly advice from where to go on day trips to which Restaurant to eat in. We stayed in room 501 which had a fantastic view and a good size balcony. I am planning to go back to Florence in September and would definately stay in the same hotel and with a bit of luck the same room.

<Content>Excellent place to stay at a budget price I had previously stayed in a single room last October at this hotel and was comfortable - rating the room at reasonable for the price. I took my wife with me on my next trip and booked a double room at budget rates. When arriving at the Hotel Delle Nazioni we were surprised to be given an upgraded double room with complimentary drinks, balcony view, fresh fruit, welcome pack, etc.The room was excellent and surpassed all our expectations, making our short 4-day visit to Florence one not to be forgotten. I wished we had booked a longer stay as we both enjoyed the place so very much.The room service, the desk staff and restaurant staff were all as pleasant and as helpful as I have found anywhere. The free internet service was also very helpful, allowing me to communicate, trouble free with my contacts in the UK.I manage a Hotel and Conference Centre in the UK therefore feel that I can review this Hotel with some authority.Top marks for the Delle Nazioni Hotel.

<Content>great hotel recommended Just returned from a 5 day stay in Florence and couldn't have asked for a better hotel. 5 mins from train station, friendly staff,good sized room,fresh towels three times a day and even better we had a room with a balcony with superb views over Florence.Bathroom was also good size with shower and bath. Breakfast although nothing special was more than adequate. Although our room was on the main street you couldn't here any noise from the street below.Free internet access is also available to guestsAll the main sites were well within walking distanceI would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a great hotel at a reasonable costs.Thanks to all the staff for a wonderful stay.Mille grazie

<Content>A fabulous base for seeing all that Tuscany has to offer Firstly the hotel is conveniently located near the station (so no trekking bags too far through the city!). The rooms were of a good size and in good condition. There is also free internet access at the hotel which was a bonus. The staff were very friendly and helpful, offering us good information whenever we asked.There are plenty of restaurants around the hotel or lovely squares in Florence for later in the evening too.You only need to walk for 5 - 10 minutes and you are there at the main sites such as the cathedral. We found this hotel had a lovely atmosphere and would recommend it to anyone staying in Florence

<Content>Good base, clean and new but possible school groups This hotel has been recently refurbished and is clean and comfortable. It's a 5 min walk to the train/bus station and about 15-20 mins to the Duomo. There is a small supermarket across the road and some restaurants virtually next door. My room was by the main road so it was fairly noisy and we struggled with getting the air con to work. The only other downside was there was different groups of school kids staying throughout our stay. Unfortunately, some were extremely noisy at night. Breakfast was basic but tasty and it was nice to get scrambled egg instead of just the usual cold continental breakfast.

<Content>Very Happy with stay Hotel was clean and comfortable. It had a great location near the train station and tourist sites in Florence. We stayed on the top floor and had our own balcony overlooking the train station. From there we could see the hills and beautiful countryside around Florence. Staff was courteous and breakfast is similar to most you get at hotels in Italy. Only downside was spotty internet access. Some days it was very fast, others somewhat slow. It was a nice touch to have free internet though so I won't complain too much.

<Content>A pleasant stay A very pleasant stay in a great location, we stayed at the hotel for 2 nights in a double room. The room was very basic but comfortable with everything you need for a short stay (after all you only sleep in the room - bed was comfortable)Hotel is right next to the train station and a pleasant walk to all of the major attractions. We flew into Pisa and got the bus from Pisa to Florence which stopped outside of train station then going back to Pisa we jumped on the train.Florence is lovely and we would defintatly go back and even consider staying in this hotel. Hotel staff very friendly and the breakfast had a good selection and there was free internet access.

<Content>Perfect location My boyfriend and I stayed at the Delle Nazioni hotel for 3 nights and it was a great choice! The hotel is right by the station in Florence so it made going on little day trips very easy. The staff was extremely helpful with anything we needed. We were able to check out later with no problems. The breakfast was much more than was expected with eggs, meats, cheese, rolls, brioches, cereal, coffee machines, juice machines, and much more. We were lucky enough to have a quiet room with a balcony that overlooked the city so it was perfect. The walk to the Duomo is about 10 or 15 minutes but there is much to see on the way there. I would recommend this hotel to anyone going to Florence.

<Content>A great place and extemely helpful and friendly staff Booked through lastminute.com and chose this hotel after reading the reviews on this site. I found the hotel to be great value for money. My room had wireless internet (although it did crash one night) which I found extremely useful. The room was comfortable, the breakfast good.More importantly, even though lastminute.com cancelled my room before I arrived (I'm assured it's not a common occurrence and I'll probably use them again), the hotel reception staff were fantastic and extremely helpful and patient in my struggles in trying to sort it out. On this basis alone, I would give the hotel full marks, but as I said above, great value for money too. Right next to the station, it's very convenient for getting around the region (for trains and tour buses) and the city itself. If I ever get another opportunity to visit the beautiful city of Florence, I will probably stay here again. Can't say more than that!

<Content>Great staff We booked this hotel purely because it was located handy for the town centre.What a pleasant surprise to stay in such a warm, welcoming, well run establishment.It is located on the block next to the one where the bus station is. This is where you get off the bus from the airport. In fact, you pass the hotel on your way in from the airport...We we apparently chosen for a free upgrade. This may have been a bit bogus, but was welcome all the same. The room was spotless, with cable TV, a kitchenette, a table and 4 chairs as well as a couch that probably folded into a bed.The staff were most helpful, friendly and accomodating. The self-serve buffet style breakfast was perfectly adequate. It was scary to watch the american teenage visitors playing how much can you cram on your plate - then leave behind.I will definitely recomend the Delle Nazioni to friends, and others.

<Content>You Get What You Pay For We stayed for 5 nights 18th/23rd Feb 2008/Room 411Rooms are tired but very clean, staff very welcoming, especially front of house. Giovanni Mariella and front of house team first class, nothing was an issue. Well Done.Well placed for access to all tourist sites, amenities and the excellent transport serices available at your hotel door step. At 拢60 POUNDS PER NIGHT its good value including a continental style buffet. When you consider charges levied by some hotels in the area its ideal for tourists, as you should be out most of the day enjoying all that Florence has to offer.They are currently digging up this area of Florence to site Trams but do not let this put you off. We would go back.A  I Smith, Ayrshire, Scotland

<Content>Friendly Staff and Good Position It was out of season when we stayed at the Delle Nazioni but the cool weather was truly offset by the warmth of the staff. Nothing appeared too much trouble. The hotel is situated near to the main rail station which is very convenient as we had flown to Pisa and then journeyed to Florence by train.(a very simple exercise) All the main tourist sites are within reasonable walking distance from the hotel. The hotel is clean and comfortable and provides free internet access. Breakfast was buffet style and perfectly adequate and catered for all tastes. Our room was clean and the bathroom spotless. We slept soundly on a very comfortable bed. The reception was efficient and the staff extremely helpful. We had no problem with language as all the staff we encountered spoke English. All in all an excellent tourist hotel and one we would be happy to stay at again.

<Content>Good for the price I got this room for 75$ for 3 nights in hotels.com and since it was next to the station, it was good buy for me so that I can travel to the rest of the tuscany with the train and bus. The hotel served this purpose very well.Rooms are big, decently updated. Nothing great but does its work nicely. The room at the front was very noisy due to the Train station being so close. We picked this room so that we can look at the dome, but changed the next day due to the noise. The front desk did this without any grim face.The lift is very slow and small, took the stairs most of the time.The breakfast is good given the price of the room. Hot Meat and Cheese was good.If you want to visit Sienna or San Gimigano, the bus leaves from the next door.The other part of the city is a decent 20 mnt walk, but it was a nice walk.We had our dinner at the Leo, which was referred to us by the hotel lobby. Very very good food and cheap but clean. Should try this if you are in budget.The Front desk provided us with tickets to the Accademia to see the David. Please make sure you have the tickets for this and Uffizi, else you are wasting one full day just standing in the line. You wont beleive how long they can be.

<Content>Pretty decent stay at the "Hotel delle Nazioni". Would go back! My husband and I stayed a couple of nights at this hotel during a visit to Florence in January 2008. The hotel is in a great location for travellers as it is only a few minutes walk from the central train station and bus station and is within walking distance of all the city attractions.The hotel was lovely and clean and the photographs on it's website are a good reflection of how it actually is. We booked a basic double room and were very pleased with the size, space and presentation of the room which had a large double bed and a cozy and spacious shower room which was extremely clean, too. There we had also lots of choice on TV, internet access and very attentive service at both the front desk and in the rooms, The reception staff were bright and friendly and they helped us also find everything we needed, they even directed us to a good restaurant where we ate the best steaks we had since we came to Italy. Everytime breakfast was excellent... Because of a vast choice on offer.We still enjoyed our stay here.Very happy overall with the choice of hotel and would gladly stay here again.

<Content>Experience was worthwhile! A group of friends and I stayed at the hotel for a week. Not only is Florence beautiful, but our hotel experience was awesome as well. We saved money on transportation because it was right near the train station and in walking distance from the major sites to see. The hotel staff was friendly; I got to pratice my Italian and they their English. It was a nice exchange. The rooms were clean and the service was above average. If you're looking for a no headache vacation in Florence, try this hotel!

<Content>Great stay! We stopped for 3 nights at the Delle Nazioni Hotel in Florence and let me tell you that I had great weekend there. The location of the hotel is just perfect: close to the train station and at the same time close to all the sites that I wanted to visit. Our room (215) was clean, breakfast was excellent and the staff very friendly and helpful, they actually spoke very good English! We could spend the evenings in a most pleasant way at the bar or in the lounge of the hotel where we met nice interesting people from all over the world.I really enjoyed my stay there and I will come back with my family and friends. I think it is a great hotel and I recommend it to anyone!

<Content>Fab Florence We arrived here on the 21st January for a short stay (5days 4 nights) When we booked our rooms on line through ryanair we were very lucky to get 4night for the price of 3. The hotel is central to everywhere you could possible want to go to in Florence. For example the Train station is opposite we went to Pisa for the day and this only cost 10.50 euro return (well worth it). The Dumo is just 10 min walk away and the rest of the sights are within 30 min walking time. It is well worth the walk as you see lots of sights.The hotel was very clean and the staff make you very welcome.Nothing is too much trouble for the staff you only have to ask. The maid comes in twice a day and turns your bed down, she also leaves a chocolate for your pleasure. Breakfast is included in the price and there is plently of choice. In fact after breakfast you do not need anything to eat until very late afternoon. Very good value for money and hope to return to the same hotel in the near future.

<Content>no smoking at delle nazioni This hotel is clean and handy for the station. The rooms however are very, very basic and do not feel welcoming. Only one english channel on TV ( not too much of a problem but on some very cold days it would have been handy to spend a little more time indoors ). We were moved from our first room to a slightly better room as we had a few problems in first room..No hot water, t'v did not work. If you smoke do not stay here....there are no smoking rooms AT ALL as we found out to our cost ( even though we reqested smoking when we booked we were not informed until we arrived that the whole place is non smoking )...if it was summer it would not be a problem but it was freezing and we had to go outside for a quick puff....as smokers this is not conducive to a relaxing break !!...breakfast is just adequate ( horrible dried up scrambled eggs...but hey they don't have to be eaten ). Staff are okay and quite friendly apart from one guy who checked us in..he was unhelpful and unfriendly. There is some building work being carried out but the noise is not intrusive.

<Content>Terrific location and value! I was pleasantly surprised recently at my stay at this hotel. I arrived Dec.1 for 3 nights. I was in a quiet room on the 4th flr. , #410. The hotel is conveniently located a few steps from the train station and close to all the major attractions and shopping. This hotel is priced well. The buffet breakfast is terrific. The breakfast room is bright and cheerful and the hotel is pleasantly decorated.I found the staff to be wonderful. Helpful with directions and accurate in answering all my questions.It was a great experience and I look forward to returning soon.

<Content>I have to do this I stayed for 3 nights in November, 2007. I really wanted to like this place. In fact, I did. That is what makes this review difficult but I feel that I must be accurate to let fellow travelers know about my experience. What I liked: Within a block of the Florence train station so very convenient. Has two elevators. Has wireless internet in the rooms (although I couldn't get it to work on my laptop for some reason). Also has 5 computers in the lobby area which are available for guests free of charge. Has a wonderful hot and cold breakfast in the mornings. I had a single room (twin bed) and it was small but still had sufficient room. Bathroom was average size. Had 3 English tv stations if that matters to you. Within walking distance of all the sites. In fact, rooms facing the station will have great views of the duomo dome. Staff were friendly and helpful. Has a storage area for bags if you need to check out and leave your bags for awhile. The negative: The hair dryer was old in my room and didn't work very well. Walls are thin so if you get loud neighbors you might want to have some ear plugs with. Rooms were a little dated but nothing too bad. Again...I did really like this place. Until the day after I checked out and bed bug bites started showing up all over my body. While I was in the room, I killed a bug. At the time, I didn't think a lot of it because bugs occasionally get into hotel rooms. However, a day after vacating the property, I started developing bumps on my arms, legs and back. Initially, I thought I might be having an allergic reaction to something at the property I was then staying at (although I wasn't aware to be allergic to anything); however, the next day the bumps started turning into welts and looked like insect bites. Not understanding what was going on since the extent of insect bites in my life have been the mosquito and occasional bumble bee, I started doing some internet research. I was completely distressed upon seeing a photo of a bed bug that looked exactly like the bug I had killed in the room at this hotel. My bites were also consistent in looks with bed bug bites (which typically take a couple days to appear). Afterwards, I also read about other signs of bed bugs which at the time I had missed. Having never experienced something like this in my life given the amount of traveling I have done, I did not know the signs to look for in regard to bed bugs and suspect others will not. I spent the last two days of my vacation, the long flight home and some days at home uncomfortable, covered in calomine lotion, and otherwise looking hideous from the over 150 bites I counted on my body. I did email the hotel about what had occurred and requested they take action. I did receive a response from them. They stated that they took my email seriously and would do everything possible to solve the problem as soon as possible. I hope that mine was an isolated problem. If it weren't for my bites, I would have rated this property a 4.

<Content>Great find in a great city This is a great budget hotel, a 2 min walk from the main train station F.S.M.N. When you come off the train, exit the station at the right hand exit. If you walk down a few steps and look to your right you will see the hotel signs. We had a triple room which had 4 beds and a table and chairs. The bathroom only had a shower, which was fine for us and the room and bathroom were cleaned every day. The hotel is on a main road, so if noise bothers you, ask for a room at the back of the hotel or take ear plugs. The breakfast selection was limited to cereals, toast, ham, cheese, scrambled eggs and pastries but all very tasty. All of the major attractions are within walking distance from the hotel. They will give you a great map when you check in. The hotel recommended a great restaurant within a 5 min walk and Za Za on Piazza del Mercato Centrale, 26r is well worth a visit. For those who love chocolate try Hemmingway, a cool little cafe/bar at Piazza Piattellina 9r. It's worth taking the no 7 local bus to Fiesole, a beautiful village in the hills (only 25 mins on the bus). The bus stops are located on the main road leading to the Duomo. Buy your tickets at a newspaper stand before you board. Florence is a lovely city, and I would recommend visiting it out with the peak summer season.

<Content>Would stay here again Travelled here in mid October of 2007 and was pleasently surprised by the hotel and the size of our room. Upon check in we received an upgrade to a kitchen suite and a High speed Internet PC in our room. This is a budget hotel so there were a few things that were far from perfect, our shower didn鈥檛 drain very well, and we our room faced the street thus we could hear the street noise. Those were the only complaints we had. The staff was very helpful at arranging tours, and giving us directions. All of the satff spoke good English.

<Content>Modern and clean The reason we pick this hotel was because it is near to the train station. My friend and I were on a short europe tour and train is our main mode of transportation. What we did'nt know was, there are 2 main train station in Florence. We took a train from Rome and the train stop at this particular station which was not the station we expected the train would stop at. Therefore we have to take a bus to the correct train station because we only know to get to the hotel from the right station. The hotel itself is located as part of a row of shop lots, just like most of the hotels nearby. I would think the hotel has gone through a major renovation or it might be a totally new hotel. Everything look so new and clean. We got ourself a standard twin bed room. Spacious, clean and modern. Even the bathroom is spacious. Towel, shampoo and soaps are provided. Oh ya, shower cap too.The staff is ok. Not too friendly but not too ignorence either. About the free internet, yeah, it is free. Just ask the front desk staff for the username and password and you are set to go. The last time we were there, they have 6 computers located at the lobby area near the breakfast room. There was not too many people when we were there, so we can were able to use the internet for as long as we want. it will automatically log off once the 15minutes or was it 30minutes (cant really remember) period over. but u can log on again using the same username and password. I think it is fair enough so, that others may be able to use it too rather than the facilities being abuse by some guests.Like most hotels, they too have a luggage room in the lobby area. Just in case your train/flight is later than the checking out hour. Check out as normal and you may leave your luggage in that room and continue sight seeing. The front desk staff has the key to the luggage room.The famous Duomo dome is within walking distance. It took us 10minutes to get there. I'm not so sure of other mode of transportation to get there but I'm sure there should be an alternative than just walking. We saw a lot of buses though. It is nice to walk when there are lots of shops along the way.

<Content>great hotel This hotel was just perfect for our one night stay in Florence.Right next to the train station, which is super convenient. We were able to even make a quick trip to Pisa after we checked in since we were so close to the station. Only 10-20 minutes walk to the Duomo and museums too, so we were able to see everything we wanted and more in just 1.5 days (including Pisa). Free internet use, with 5 computers provided. We loved this as we could contact our family easily!Excellent breakfast in the morning, with hot and cold items.Friendly staff, who spoke excellent English.Our room was big (I think it was one of the family rooms) and the bathroom was nice too - but only a shower, no bath (not a big deal, but just made it a little harder to bathe our baby). Quiet too.Provided a lovely little crib/playpen for our baby, with nice clean bedding for it too. Our bed was a little uncomfortable, on one side anyway. It was 2 single beds pushed together (very common in Europe), and one of them was very squeaky.We arrived early and they made every effort to get our room ready for us right away. If it had not been ready they were going to store our luggage for us (which they did when we checked out, so that we could tour the city some more before catching our train).Would definitely stay here again.

<Author>Hipoint
<Content>Fair We stayed at Hotel Delle Nazioni as part of our honeymoon. We left with a sensation that we could have found a better place for a little more money.We arrived via the Eurostar and were able to find the hotel easily as it is just west of the train station. Check-in was fairly straight-forward although you had to carry your own bags up the initial staircase before getting into the small elevators. Getting to our room (#404), we had to navigate thru some very small hallways. The room itself is quite snug but livable. The queen-size bed took up much of the room. The room was a bit dark and aged like the hallways...a contrast from the hotel lobby. The AC Unit was quite powerful and unlike some people's prior experience where the hotel shut it off at night, we did not have that problem. The TV is small but does have CNN in English. No mini-bar is provided. The bathroom was quite out-dated (1960's?) and probably the biggest turn-off for us. It is small, dark, and not air-conditioned. There is no place to really place anything without it falling onto the ground. The shower is a curtained-off corner which barely can fit one person (I'm 5'6, 145#). The floor is guaranteed to be saturated with water after any shower. Worse, there was no place to hang a towel.On a more positive note, the location is prime as it is next to the train station and also within walking distance of most places. The internet cafe has 5 computers although you must get a login and password each time from the front desk to use. Wi-Fi is not advertised as available in the rooms (only in the cafe). The breakfast was above average offering breads/cereal/ham and juices.If not for the old cramped humid bathroom, I would probably rate this hotel higher. I have been told that some of the rooms/bathrooms may have been renovated and I would recommend requesting one of these rooms at the front desk when checking in.

<Content>Room needed a makeover My husband and I stayed in this hotel for 4 nights in August 2007 and to be honest I was a little disappointed with our room.The bathroom was small and dark and was out dated. The bathroom definately needed to be renovated. The shower screen was useless and meant that the bathroom flooded when you had a shower.There was no refridgerator in the room.The room was in need of a new bedspread and a paint job.The good points for the hotel were that there was free internet access in the lobby at all times which was great.The breakfast room was large and bright and clean. The breakfast food was nice and fresh with both hot and cold options.I would not stay in this hotel again until the rooms were freshened up.

<Content>Great value and location! Ideally located within walking distance to the train station and bus terminal. A short walk will put you at the steps of the Santa Maria Novella and the Duomo. You are in the heart of Florence but away from the crowds.A modern yet chic interior will surprise you thru out the lobby and dining area.The buffett breakfast was excellent, with a variety of breakfast foods.The staff is courteous and very helpful and will make every attempt to insure your stay in Florence is an enjoyable one.

<Content>Great Location This hotel was in a great location especially if you needed the train station. Everything within Florence that we wanted to see, was in walking distance of the hotel. The staff were always friendly during our stay. The breakfast was well worth having. If you do have the breakfast, try and sit outside on the terrace for more of an italian feeling to the morning.The room was basic (as we expected for the price) but clean. The carpet was stained however we were never really in the room other than to sleep, so this did not bother us one bit.The air conditioning was there all the time if we needed it, which was fab, as otherwise it might have been a tad warm.The area where the hotel is located is ok, but there was nothing really to see around it, so walking was always needed. We stayed on the second floor over looking the train station, however the noise never really became an issue, and the views were good from our window... If you can get a higher floor, then try, as i would expect the views to keep on getting better.

<Content>great location,average hotel The hotel is sutuated in a perfect locaation, just across the street in the central train station.The area generally safe but during night time one must be carefoul, thats why the hotel door is closed and to enter you must ring the bell.The hotel personell is very polite and ready to respond to every question. They help us to arrange a fantastic restaurant for dinner in Fiesole. But i must say that one night they let us wait about 15 minutes because they had only 1 person on duty and it was busy....Breakfast is normal.The rooms are clean , with central a/c wich is functioning only after 15/06 so if you go in Florence in a hot May as whe did you are in trouble.In general is a good hotel but for short - buisness trips

<Author>Traveling_with_son
<Content>Only one issue, but a big one I agree with previous reviews that the breakfast was wonderful (lots of selections, very nice eating area, etc.) Also, the hotel is VERY convenient, particularly for day trips. Really, we only had one problem, but it was a BIG problem.We had a room at the end of a hall. In the middle of the night, we would wake up in unbearable heat. Now, I use a blanket in the summer because I am always cold, so if I say that it was hot, I mean Tuscany hot. Our window opened out onto a flat roof, so if we opened our window someone could just walk into our room. We didn't care. We would turn out all of our lights and open the window. We said something to the people at the front desk about being hot, but they just smiled at us. After this went on for a few nights, we went to the front desk and insisted that they do something. Come to find out THEY TURN OFF THE AIR CONDITIONER AT NIGHT! The air conditioner is programmed to turn off between midnight and 6 a.m. Are they kidding? It was July in Florence! We practically begged them to do something. The staff agreed to override the system for our last night, but told us that they would turn it back off if any guests complained about being cold. To their credit, it stayed on all night and it was the only night I got a decent night sleep at their hotel.Our room was very nice, it was clean, the hotel was convenience and the woman that worked at the front desk during the day was very helpful. However, the best service in the world means nothing to me if I can't sleep at a hotel.

<Content>Delle Nazioni not great While this hotel was close to the train station and therefore easily accesible, it had very dirty rooms. First, the good...they provided a decent breakfast in a clean area that also had a small patio you could sit at, they also have a small (5 computers) internet cafe that is free of charge, and the hotel staff were very friendly and informative. Now, for the bad...the room that we were provided was a very small room stuck in the corner of some small hallway. It looked out over a what could only be compared to an elevator shaft. The room had water marks on the ceiling, mold in the shower, and the carpets were filthy. The bathroom provides a shower, but it is only a drain in the corner of the room with a curtain around it, very small and no where to put your shampoo, soap, etc...The room smelled musty and mildewy (my clean clothes still smelled of the room when I returned to the states). The linens were clean, but smelled of vinegar. I did notice there seemed to be a section of the hotel that was towards the front that appeared to have nicer hallway carpet and rooms, but what we were provided did not live up to the 3.5 rating this hotel recieved. Would not stay here again.

<Content>On the way down... way down First the good. It's only 500 feet from the train station. Nice lobby, nice breakfast room and decent selection of foods for the same. And that's where it ends.We had three rooms in this hotel for our large family. All smelled musty and moldy. The Air conditioning could not cool the rooms nor get the dampness out of the air. The carpets in all rooms were FILTHY. You actually blackened the soles of your feet walking barefoot on them. The bed covers were pilled, coming apart at the seems and sticky to the touch. The walls clearly have not been painted in years. There were rat holes (yes, rat holes) in the bathroom tile. While we did not see the vermin, the souvenirs they left behind were evidence enough. The beds do not have abox spring, but rather wooden slats that are broken and missing. Two of us in different rooms had a bed colapse as they slept. The staff was indifferent to the complaints, in particular this skinny bald guy with glasses, who was downright rude. They call themselves 3 stars, but this is clearly a no star hotel.

<Content>Friendly staff, clean hotel My sister and I stayed here in March for 3 nights. Upon arrival the room was not ready yet, but the staff was very helpful and gave us a place to store our luggage and a map of Florence so that we could explore while we waited for our room. Once we checked in, we were very happy with the room. It was clean and spacious. A bonus was the internet access that the hotel had. And the breakfast was more than sufficient. Being close to the train station made travel easy, and even though you aren't in the middle of everything, you are only a five minute walk to most of the sites. Would definitely stay here again!

<Content>Good Hotel Close to the Train Station This was a nice hotel with comfortable rooms. It鈥檚 great for accessing the Internet because they have an Internet caf茅 right there. The room is just ok and has the basics. All of the staff were really nice to us. The location is ok if you want to stay near the train station so that you can jump on buses and get around the city with ease. The breakfast was also very basic. Overall it鈥檚 a good place to stay if you are just looking for a quiet stay without a lot of extras.

<Content>Great City Hotel Just returned from a tour of Italy and stayed 1 night at the Delle Nazione in Florence, I was apprehensive before arriving as with most cities its a minefield trying to find a decent hotel without paying the earth, I wanted something fairly nice as we were in Florence just for 1 night for my husbands 40th Birthday. I did email the hotel beforehand to request a nice room and I was plesantly suprised by the hotel, it was contemporary, clean, great location directly opposite the train and main bus station and great location for walking to all the main sights. The staff were all really nice and hospitable and recommended us to a great local restaurant for a fantastic meal in the evening. We were lucky to get a suite with a balcony which was a huge room, the bathroom was a little dated but overall a nice room. My only gripe would be that the air con didnt work so I opened the window and boy was it noisy from about 5am but hey your in a city!!! The hotel has several computers with free internet usage which is a great service. We were driving so needed a hotel with a garage or parking, this has an underground garage next door to the hotel which is owned independantly but I didnt think that 17euros was bad for 24hours parking in a city. Breakfast was plentiful with fruit, cereals, croissants, toast, ham, jams, ect. Overall a lovely city hotel and I wouldnt hesitate to reccommend or stay there again myself.

<Content>Better than a North American Holiday Inn I stayed at this hotel during May 2007 for 3 nights for a vacation in Italy which included, Venice, Florence and Rome. This hotel is great! Reasonably priced,clean and centrally located. If your riding the train through Italy this place is great as it is right beside the train station in Florence. It also allowed us to walk to all major tourist attractions without being exhausted. The internet is great as finding internet on the streets is sometimes exhausting. The breakfast is standard and a good start to the day. The only criticism I have for this hotel is that the room upon entry will smell like toilet. I noticed this all throughout europe in hotels and bed and breakfasts. I think its just the way it is. It goes away quickly and is not all that bad. I have confirmed with other friends who have visited Italy and that smell seems to be prevalent in all hotels in Italy. The rooms are large, bed is comfortable and for those people who have commented that its a seedy area. I totally disagree.. We felt totally comfortable and did not feel unsafe at all. The hotel is also great for touring to Pisa and what not as the tours depart from the train station, which may allow you to sleep in longer. I noticed that some rooms are made to share a bathroom, not sure how those are. We got a standard room with private bathroom. It was spacious and very comfortable. The hotel staff is very friendly and always professional. Would recommend this hotel to families and to solo travellers and couples. It really suits anyone and we enjoyed our stay. I forgot to mention that the room has a programmeable safe for your passports and valuables (free of charge) so you don't have to carry them with you everywhere. It is comparable (if not better) than a north american holiday inn.

<Content>Just one problem We stayed here 7th - 10th May and were very happy with our choice of Hotel. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. We were given, when checking in, an invaluable map of Florence and list of all the Museum opening times and costs and the staff were more than happy to book any visits for us.The room was basic but more than adequate and the housekeeping was very good. Towels and bed linen were spotless.Breakfast was excellent with a huge choice available.The location was excellent being so near the station. Alll of the sights were easy to get to on foot.The only thing we had a problem with was our mis-handled luggage that was couriered to the hotel from the airport, although delivered to the hotel at about 10PM was not put in our room until after 10AM the following day which was very inconvenient.

<Content>Love this hotel! My favourite budget hotel in Europe by far--would stay here again! About $140 CAD/nite.This hotel not only offers free internet (a little internet cafe), but they had the best free continental breakfast (great coffee/cappucinno/hot chocolate machine), and is only half a block away from the Central Train Station.Florence is a must see and this is the way to do it. Never needed to take a single bus--it's a walker's paradise. Beautiful and romantic!! Lots of places to eat from this simple pasta place to pricier restaurants.HUGE open flea market in town centre--worth walking through for the great deals.

<Content>Couldn't find a better location Stayed in Florence for 3 weeks in September, couldn't have asked for a better location to stay. Staff were friendly, helpful and understanding my elderly mother's needs.We used Florence as a jumping off point to do day trips to various places in Tuscany. It was nice to have the use of kitchenette whenever we didn't feel like dining out. The breakfast supplied daily was a good start to the day. Rooms were clean and comfortable.Don't be influenced by some negative reviews in the English Language Travel Guides that warn of this bad area near the train station. My mother and I were very comfortable walking the area in the evening after dinner. Like any large city you have to be careful at night no matter where you are.I heartily recommend this hotel to anyone, and do so to anyone I know travelling to Florence.

<Content>Close to the station The hotel is VERY close to the central station (across the road in fact). There is free internet access, rooms are comfortable. Bathroom is slightly wethered! Lovely walk to Duomo and Florence is a great base city for travel to SIena, Pisa and Bologna. Close to a few restaurants and there is a laundromat around the corner!

I especially liked the free computers connected to the internet. The desk staff was helpful, especially Giovanni. The breakfast area was clean, large and kept well stocked.

<Content>Great location, ok room stayed here for two nights, was generally quite happy with what I got. the location is what sells this hotel, literally 50m from the train and bus/coach station, which was good as were were doing a lot of train travelling. The room was fairly standard, in the information we recieved from the website we booked through, it said that while some of the bathrooms had been renovated, some hadn't, and unfortunately we had one which hadn't been.the lights in there were a bit dim, the shower screen was a little flimsy - it had a kind of youth hostel feel to it, but it was clean and provided everything we needed from it - although if you are expecting a luxurious bath it might not be for you, although i can't speak for the upgraded bathrooms. The toilet flush had a knack to it before it worked - it needed to be pressed about 10 times in rapid succession to work, but work it did.the only other complaint i could have is that it's not the quietest - noise from the corridors and from the rooms next door and above are heard quite easily, although the beds are comfortable and we slept well. the breakfast was plentiful and set us up for the day. all in all, it's an ok hotel - it won't ruin your holiday and it makes it very easy for getting to and from the airport and other rail destinations. Also, the staff are very friendly and helpful. For the money it is excellent value. When you're in Florence there's so much more to do than spend time in your room!

<Content>Loved Delle Nazioni Hotel Stayed 3 nights, found the location to be excellent, right around the corner from the bus station and accross the street from the train station and an easy walk to all the sights Florence has to offer.The desk staff was very helpful in suggestiong dinner reservations and an English Speaking movie theatre. The morning breakfast is simple and delightful and in the evening you can enjoy a cocktail at the hotel'slounge. The hotel's decor is modern,crisp and clean. The hotel offers up to date technologies including wireless access and a free internet lounge.The friendly housekeeping staff did a wonderful job keeping the room spotlessly cleaned. I found everything to be in working order.Overall a great value when travelling to Florence.

<Content>read review there are only 3 good things about this hotel : 1. FREE Internet, 2. A block away from the Train Station, 3. the Staff.besides those listed. everything was terrible. there was water leak damage on the ceilings (gross), and if there was no ceiling (yes i said NO celing, like the bathroom) they had this metal board (like thin metal planks) looking thing that they try to pass off as a celing. it was very distrubing because dust or black stuff from the ceiling of the bathroom would repeatedly fall to the floor. this thing they try to pass off as a celiing was scary because it feels like when you're in the bathroom, you're being watched because theres holes/spaces between these metal boards and all you see it darkness. ALSO they use bleach as if it was water. the smell of the bathroom was the smell of bleach as if someone was taking a shower with bleach. it was horrible. i could barely brush my teeth, because i wanted to vomit from the smell of bleach. and if they had to use that much bleach to clean the bathroom, i'm scared to find out why they use it so much. (my friends can attest to all these statements because they also these in their room, so it was not only my room) literally i stayed away from the bathroom, unless i HAD to use it. the windows in our room were practically pointless because if you opened the window, EVERYONE on the street can see you. as if you were a mannequin modeling in front of the window. there was no carpet, and the room just did not feel comfortable. i would definately look for another hotel. from my observation the hotels very near to the train station, did not seem inviting. Try to book a hotel blocks away from the train station if possible

<Content>Superb Stay @ Delle Nazioni Ask for room 428 or 4th floor overlooking Florence...unrestricted views ...and the sun streams into the room after 1.30pm! We stayed 6 nights, the staff were always patient, friendly and helpful and gave correct instructions for trains/buses to attractions. The cold breakfast and drinks were plentiful and + there was hot scrambled eggs! Internet was available on 2 screens + Wi-Fi. The hotel was clean  tidy  well run. Its central location to trains and Bus station is excellent but brings with it, a lot of hangers on arround the station and a reluctantance, on our part to stay out late at night.Excelent supermarket diagonally opposite the hotel near the station for small food items  a Tobaco shop for bus tickets etc.20 yds from the hotel. Finally a zebra crossing is not a zebra crossing to the Italians.. they take no prisoners...look right and left 4 times and then run, clutching your Norwich Union Travel policy, as fast as you can! We would certainly go back there again!Jon  Maureen

<Content>Overall good hotel The hotel is located extremely close to the train station which was very convenient for us, and is very accessible to all other major sites in the city.The room was adequate, howevery we did not like the bathroom door which was a very thin sliding door that had a gap in it, and therefore would not close well. Try to avoid room 314. Also the walls between the rooms seem to be very thin, since we could hear conversations from the next room.Breakfast was good, and so was the free internet access, and staff were helful.The hotel is very good value for money and we would recommend it for those on a budget.We did try 'il portale' restaurant a few metres away from the hotel after the many reviews on this site. However, we were quite disappointed with the quality of the food and the service was terrible. There are many nicer restaurants than il portale. I wouldn't recommend it, try trattoria ZaZA or Buco del Orafo instead, which are not as close but worth the walk.

<Content>Shabby and stinky rooms I stayed in this hotel in November 2006. We booked two rooms. The first room that they gave us was extremely stinky. Apparently there was a problem with the bathroom's flush and they did not notice it... After 5 minutes they recognized the issue and gave us another room on a higher floor. In the new room it was possible to breath, but they could not get rid of the smoke's smell this time. We were just too tired to complain again.I would never stay in this hotel again. Good points: friendly staff, located behind the station (good for us as we were travelling by train). Free internet in the lobby.Bad points: old, dirty, stinky rooms. They have too little personeel to clean the tables during breakfast, which makes the dirty impression of the hotel even worse.

<Content>Just about OK This was our 2nd stop in Italy  we booked all our stays after reading reviews on Tripadvisor.Plaza in Mestre/Venice  Domus Aventia in Rome turned out to be very good choices  met our expectations.This one is functional, but not great. Reasonable value for money. The bed linen needs to be replaced certainly.Positives are location (right next to Firenze SMN)  free internet (but watch out: others users fiddle with settings and the keyboard needs to be reset).

<Content>Exceptional Service...but a ??? We just returned from a two night stay at this quaint yet modern-styled hotel. Upon arrival and throughout our stay the staff were friendly and helpful. Our room was cozy (apartment) and clean. I loved the wall-mounted TV we could watch while lounging in bed, and the patio we could access (though it was too cold to sit out). The walls are very thin, as we heard our neighbors up to all kinds of things! However, no issue with traffic noise. I would definitely recommend this hotel to any friend or family travelling to Florence.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel I booked three nights here at Hotel Delle Nazioni, Florence for three nights in first part of December, 2006.I drove a rental car picked at Pisa airport, and used TomTom to navigate to the hotel,right across from the lateral flank of the train station.There is no hotel parking, but there is a paid garage next door.One day costed 21 Euro, no in and out privilege. I ended up leaving the car there for three days.There is a Il Portale pizzeria next door too, and the Florentine Steaks and Seafood soup are wonderful.Yes, I booked the upgraded room, and it is huge by usual italian standard.The hotel is ultra clean throughout, and it is close to any Marriott Courtside or Residence Inn standard.The breakfast is adequate, but convenient.Definitely a winner for the money.

<Content>Great Location, Great Room Across the street from train station. Hotel did not have reservation when checked-in 11/13 booked (KING) through travelocity, but told no problem at check-in; it was a one night stay (Monday). Upgraded to large suite (?), w/kitchenette, and two other double size beds, flat panel 19 TV, nice bathroom, towel warmer, bidet, small shower, bathroom amenities. Great breakfast and free internet access. Nice hotel! Friendly service.

<Content>Great hotel I've stayed here 3 times and every time it was great. The room was spacious and the hotel is across the road from the train station. If you're travelling by train, this is definitely the hotel for you. There are also international calling booths across the road at the train station and a post office to send souveniers to your family and friends, just across the road.Breakfast was great and there is free internet.

<Content>Good central location. Just across the road from the main station. It's in a great location just a two minute walk from the S. M. Novella Railway Station. Be carefull of the traffic when crossing the road. 10 minute walk to the Duomo.Arrived at about 2.30p.m. and given a pleasant reception by the staff who allocated us to our room quickly. The room seemed quite small, rather scruffy and overlooked an internal yard. Given that I had booked a Superior room I asked for a confirmation of the room standard. I was offered an alternative room (411) which was better and a further option to view an apartment the following day which we ultimately agreed to. Throughout the staff were very pleasant.Daily maid service was very good with sheets and towels refreshed daily.Breakfast was very pleasant; typical Continental with breads, cheeses and meats.Overall I am a bit disappointed with the decorative standards we found in the Hotel bedrooms rooms, I guess it must have been a long season, I cannot fault the staff though.Some good local restaurants nearby, notably IL Portale Trattoria about 50 yds away (joint kitchens with a more expensive but good restaurant around the corner), and Pastarito about 100. Both very good value.

<Content>Fair value Stayed for 7 nights. The position of the hotel was great and very central. Our room was a good sized double with an additional single bed. Bathroom something of a disappointment. A bath was present with a shower over bath arrangement with a wall fixing at hip height and no shower screen or curtain. Breakfast as some other reviews state was breakfast. Very uninspiring for Italy with no fresh fruit and sugary fruit drink aka fruit juice. The staff were polite and helpful and the Internet access useful if not 100% operative. Bedroom was quiet considering the position of the hotel. On one night when the temperature had cooled we tried to turn on some heat and failed. Reception told us it was against Italian law for hotels to provide heating before Nov 1st!!No restaurant in hotel but Il Portale Trattoria 2 doors away was excellent. (You may need to call in and book a few hours earlier)Overall, an adequate hotel which needs some freshening up, but quite good value at the price paid.

<Content>Only for the Internet We booked this Hotel for 2 nights at the end of our Italian journey. It was by far the worst hotel we stayed at in Italy. I had read other travellers remarks on tripadvisor.com and knew that this hotel was a 3 star standard, however we did not enjoy our stay at all.Being a family of four, we were in a self-service apartment type room on the first floor and the noise from the street was so loud that we did not sleep either night we were there. Also, because we were on the 1st floor, we had to drag all our four suitcases up several flights of staircases as the lift does not service this floor. My daughter slept on a fold out bed that was uncomfortable and bearly above the floor. They were renovating the room next door and on the first morning, the hot water was only luke warm.The breakfast offered is fine, but it is better to get there early rather than late, as we went there around 9.30am and there was no juice and we had to wait for bowls and plates to be returned from the kitchen before we could eat.The location near the train station and free internet are the best things about this hotel however I'm glad our stay was brief. The cost was 180euros per night and for a little more, I'd stay at a better hotel as they were plenty of hotels in this location.

<Content>Great Value at the Delle Nazioni, Florence Great location. The hotel is right next to the train station and is so handy if arriving or leaving by the Terrevision Bus.It is a 3 star Hotel and offers a safe, clean and friendly stay.We were upgraded to a small apartment with free internet. This was very clean and more than adequate for a two night stay.The major attractions are all within a 5/10 minute walk.The breakfast is very basic and slightly disappointing but we weren't in Florence for the hotels breakfast!!!All in all.... Great value for a central hotel!A must is the Ponte Vecchio in the evening for a meal and of course some Chianti!!!!

<Content>Lovely hotel and kind efficient staff. We stayed at this hotel in July and booked two rooms. We found it to be extremely good value. It is close to the train and bus station which is handy for arriving and leaving as well as picking up the city sight-seeing tours, plus only a ten minute walk from the Duomo - Forence is a walking city. Our rooms were quite roomy and cleaned each day as well as having our sheets changed during our three day stay. The whole hotel is air conditioned and our bedrooms were a cool oasis from the hot summer heat. Despite being a busy road we heard no noise due to the double glazing and shutters however, I did enjoy being able to open the window and watch the world go by in the morning. The breakfast is more than a continental with a lot of options . Our son got good value out of the free internet access , not available in a lot of hotels, with six terminals for the use of the guests. My final commendations are reserved for the staff who very always very accommodating and helpful with our many queries and they assisted us in locating and booking a nice restaurant (ZA-ZA). I would also recommend the restaurant opposite the train station entrance, lovely linen table cloths and really good cheap pasta meals. If, when, I return to Florence (to see David next time) I hope to be able to stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Good hotel - Train Station right across the street (noisy)- 20 minutes walking to attractions- Room for double bed (2 joint twin beds) is not small- Safety box inside the room/closet- Weird shower (no boundaries - just curtains), no place to hold soap and shampoo)- Door is thin (can hear people outside loud and clear)- Internet access behind the lobby- Good breakfast - ample and variety, but no fruit

<Content>Not to picky but.... This was by far the worst hotel on our trip. For one as advertised on their website, there is no parking. We didn't have a car, but another customer booked a room with them solely for this reason. Two, no air conditioning in the room. Yes the lobby and bar is air conditioned, but our room was not. We were there in the midst of a heat wave throughout the country, and woke up at 3:00 A.M. soaked in sweat and had to lay wet towels on us to cool off. As well the windows didn't open to let in fresh air. Everyone else seems to rave about this hotel, lucky for them, but I will definitely not recommend this hotel to anyone I know. I was there for the evening of June 27, 2006 - maybe this was a bad night for them. The internet was nice except unreliable. Most of the sites I tried to access were unavailable. I guess you get what you pay for. We paid with taxes, etc. $110 us dollars for the night. That was the least expensive of all our hotels.

<Content>A gem (almost) at reasonable price The Della Nazione has a marvelous location. It is right next to the Stazione as well as the bus depot. When you arrive in Florence, the hotel is a five minute walk and easily identifiable by its sign. When leaving(or traveling on to Venice,Pisa, etc., it couldn't be more convenient. Also, the bus station which has local buses to Siena, etc. is half a block away. Although station areas often have seedy characters around, the Della Nazione and walk routes had none. Also, I was aware of no noise from buses or trains until I left the hotel.All of Florence is within easy walking distance.There is a marvelous restaurant two doors away from the hotel. We ate there every night. A mixture of locals and travelers from the Della Nazione all agreed it was delicious, varied, and quite reasonably priced. In fact, it is the most reasonable Florentine steak in Florence.The staff at the hotel is pleasant and helpful. The breakfast is breakfast. The rooms are clean and comfortable. The only concern is the bathroom which are small. The shower takes getting used to. When there are substantial rains, an odor exudes from the drain in the bathroom. However, if you put a towel over it, the problem is solved. Also, on request, I was given a deodorizing air spray which more than satisfied my most meticulous wife.My personal opinion is that you cannot do better than the Della Nazione unless you wish luxury (and to pay for it).

<Content>Great Location, Free Internet Access! This hotel was located basically across the street from the train station in Florence which made it extremely convenient for us as we were arriving by train. We were pleasantly surprised by the hotel's updated decor (seemed to have been recently renovated) and the rooms were a clean, albeit a bit spartan. Our room was quite large and faced the side of the hotel, which made it extremely quiet. The room had air condition (thank goodness, since it was insanely hot outside), which I guess can be a rarity in the area. A few major positives for me were the free breakfast which was included as well as free Internet access (both wireless and workstations were provide) - we have stayed at quite a few hotels in Europe and Internet access is defintly hard to come by (especially free access), which made this big plus. All in all, a great hotel which was very conveniently located in the heart of Florence.

<Content>It surprised us!! Close to the train station, it was an easy walk for us, we're in our 70s, with our luggage (we travel light). The front desk staff was most accomodating in assigning our room and we found it quite adequate. Warm, the air conditioning worked well. We had a room on the street side, but the windows kept the noise to a minimum - no problem sleeping. The bar area was very pleasant. Service was good. The food - breakfast - was excellent. Questions we asked were quickly and pleasantly answered. And we liked having a laundromat just two blocks away!

<Content>Excellent Value For Money We have just returned from this hotel. Literally only four days ago. The location is excellent. We arrived at Pisa airport and took an extremely cheap (return fare) bus to Florence Railway/Bus Station, walked for about 3 minutes and we were there! The staff were helpful, the rooms were very clean, the bed was changed three times during our four night stay, the shower was good. The breakfast was good. No bad comment to make at all. We were on the main road and there was no noise at all (we stayed for a Saturday evening). There are excellent restaurants on the same side of the road as the hotel. Excellent value for money we found.It was very pleasing to be able to take a very short walk to the bus station and book a sightseeing bus. Again, excellent service and value for money and we would rate this as not to be missedYou could do a lot worse than stay at this hotel. Florence is beautiful. You will love it!

<Content>it was lovely this hotel is opposite the main train station, literally a 2 min walk. from the outside it doesn't look all that but as soon as you enter its a complete different story. its very modern and neat. staff were very friendly, they knew exactly what they were doing and provided a very good and efficient service. the rooms were spacious and bright, the bathroom was a little small though. breakfast was good also. the internal decor throughout was very nice.its a good base to explore florence, we walked everywhere as everthing was so close by and walkable, there was no need for taxis or buses. having the station opposite was very useful for day trips - we went to Pisa and Siena which we would definitely reccommend to others.all in all, this hotel was lovely and i would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Loved our room and loved Florence!!! Loved our room...we had a view! Pretty quiet, considering that Florence is a busy place. Breakfast was good,. Hotel is SO convenient, and there is even a nice restaurant (really good mussels) a few doors down. And a grocery store is practically across the street.Never used public transit...Florence is so easy to get around in. We loved this hotel and hope to one day return to it and our beautiful Florence again!

<Content>i will never forget Me and my friend booked the hotel at last minute, I honestly did not expect the hotel to be this good. Starting from the crew, lobby, location (very closed to the Duomo and two blocks from train station) , breakfast, bar....was great!!!!! our room had one queen and one twin bed and xt space for a large dinning table. The bathroom was large and clean, free internet service that was super convinient (we found it really coplicated to find cybercafes in europe) , plus xt computers in the lobby. I will totally come back to this hotel, and i'm refering it to all my friends!!! They really made us feel comfortable!*you can see pics of the hotel and rooms from the web site, what you see is what you get. good luck!!!

<Content>Great location This is a good 3 star hotel which as previous reviewers have said is in a fantastic location for the station, and buses to Siena, San Gimignano etc - and not far away at all from the sights in Florence. The staff were helpful and the the hotel has a large and spacious breakfast room.The free internet terminals in the bar area were very useful for researching train times etc.My only negative comment would be that its location at the centre of all the transport networks means that it is not a quiet place to stay. If that's an issue for you you'll need some earplugs!

<Content>Happy with Our Stay We booked this hotel through hotwire.com for $106 USF per night and when the transaction was completed and hotel name was revealed I checked here to see what we were getting. I might have paid more attention to the Aug 13 '05 review with the tip to exit right from the station. We exited left and lugged 5 pieces of luggage around the square for about 20 minutes before locating the hotel.Our guidebook said that Florence was a big draw for pickpockets and rail way stations everywhere seem to be the centre of it. Still, we didn't feel really uncomfortable in the area.I can't add much to what's already been said. The staff is friendly, English-speaking, and quite helpful. One desk clerk cheerfully made a reservation for us to the Accademia, right in the middle of the morning checkout rush. We enjoyed the free breakfast. It had everything we required as non-gourmet people.The free internet set-up is nice too. In other places we were expected to pay big bucks for access.The place was a little dark and slightly dingy. We saw the carpet stains too. I'd forgotten about the shower being small . It was, but at the time it wasn't a big deal.So, in summary, very nice staff, free internet, complimentary breakfast, convenient location, slightly dingy, maybe a little over-priced? I'd stay there again if I could get the same pricing.

<Content>Great Location-Lovely Staff I stayed at this hotel 2 nights while visitng europe and had a great exprienece. It is located one block away from the artesia and eurostar trains, and in walking distance from the Duomo and Uffizi gallery. We did not have to use tranportation at all since everything was in walking distance. The rooms were pretty spacious for europe, and very clean. The staff there was awesome!! The catered to our every need and we did not need a phone card because they allowed us to place calls from the receptionist area. The internet is also located in the lobby of the hotel and is free for everyone. Since I am a student that was extremely convenient. The contiental breakfast was pretty good and offered a variety of foods. Don't be discouraged by the exterior, its a good hotel and I would stay there again.

<Content>great value hotel Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in Feb. The location is a great plus for transpotation around the tuscany area and trains to other parts of italy. The 2 min. walk to the train station with connected small supermarket was very convienent for short trips to surrounding Pisa  Lucca. Accross the street from here is also access to the SITA bus terminal for excursions to Sienna  San Gimignano (a must!!) There are very good restaurants in close proximity to the hotel and just a pleasant short walk to the center of town  museums.The rooms were large for italian standard and adequately furnished. Bathrooms were a bit crowded and the shower temp. was unregulated. The air temp in the room was cold trough-out our rainy stay.The breakfast was very good with a nice selection of food and differnent types of coffee. The 6 terminals with free internet access in the lobby were helpful, and an added bonus for checking train  bus schedules.  The locked luggage storage room gave us a better sense of security leaving our bags for the day versus the hall closet available in most hotels.Value for the money was excellent!!!

<Content>Very Convenient- Nice Hotel The Hotel Delle Nazioni was a very nice hotel. If there is one word that I would use to describe this hotel it would be convenient. The location is convenient, the free internet is convenient, the breakfast is convenient, etc. The staff was also polite and helpful. On our tour we met some ladies traveling on the same tour as us, and we ended up hanging out in the small bar area near the internet computers. The bar had complimentary snacks, a wonderful bartender that made us drinks, but also let us bring in our own food, and drinks. This was a nice place to relax and hang out if you weren't ready to retire to your room.The modern decor is not my personal preference, but everything was very clean and well taken care of.There were 2 negatives about the Hotel Delle Nazioni. The first, which I see has been mentioned by others, is the bathroom. There is no place to lay out your stuff (toothpaste, toothbrush, hairspray, etc.), and the shower was quite terrible. It took us about 20 minutes to get hot water, the water pressure was very weak, and it is true there is not a real shower. There are just 2 cheap shower curtains tied up around the shower space, and I struggles with the shower curtains blowing in and clinging to my skin.The second negative, is that I never encountered any bell staff. When you enter the hotel, you have to walk up 2 separate set of steps. We had a lot of luggage, and we struggled with it. There was always a lady that seemed to be floating and helping guests in the lobby, but no one there to help with bags and luggage. I also never noticed bell carts. In fact once we checked out of the hotel and we were leaving, I fell down the stairs because of the struggle I was having with all of my luggage.Overall, this was a very nice hotel, and would stay again- but would love it if they remodeled their bathrooms, and also hired some bell staff.

<Content>Location Location Location Fantastic hotel - Got dropped off by the Terrorvision bus @ the station, crossed the road and checked in. Could not have been any easy!Hotel was lovely and clean. Room and bathroom were big enough for the 2 of us. We were in an appartment which has a kitchen, dining room area, balcony and a computer - great with the free internet for planning our next day's itinary! Breakfast was good, a selection of cereals, bread rolls and cakes as well as fruit juices, coffees and teas.Did not use public transport once! Santa Maria de la Novella was at the end of the road the hotel was on, and the Duomo, Ponte Vechio etc. not too far to walk. Recommendations to eat - Bella Donna on Via de Bella Donna, also Via Nazional has some good restaurants.We will be back

<Content>Great location Great location in Florence, right outside the railway station (this doesn't cause any problems noise wise) and Santa Maria Novella church.Clean, modern hotel, helpful staff and reliable internet facilities. A 10 min walk to the Duomo and the centre of Florence. If you want to spend lots of time in your hotel room then this probably isn't the place for you but if you want to be out and about all day with somewhere nice to rest your head at night, this place is ideal. I'd stay again.

<Content>Better than expected Having had this hotel recommended by a friend, I was slightly put off when I read some negative reviews of it on this site. The Delle Nazioni turned out to be better than I expected. The hotel was fully refurbished inside with friendly English speaking staff. The room was basic, but modern and clean. The bathroom was again clean, however quite basic, with no shower holder. Breakfast was simple but perfectly edible. The only drawback was the area being close to the train station and busy road. At night there were many youths hanging around this area, however we did not encounter any problems and felt safe.

<Content>Good experience! My daughter and I stayed at the Delle Nazioni for five days booked through -----. We were more than happy with our stay. The hotel is very conveniently located as you can walk to just about anywhere in Florence. Upon arrival by train we were able to locate the hotel by following directions from a prior posting. We were in room 426 and it was better than we expected. We had a balcony that had a nice view of the hills above Florence and it was nice to be able to leave the door open during the night. Be sure and keep the curtains closed cause we did get a couple of mosquitoes in the room. The bathroom was very clean with the shower curtain around the floor drain which we found worked just fine for us. All the linen was changed daily and the room was very clean. The continental buffet was very good and they had two coffee machines that you could make your own cup of coffee, expresso, capucchino, etc. The buffet included various breakfast rolls, eggs, sliced ham  cheese, cereals, yogurts, etc. We did not feel the least bit uncomfortable with the people on the streets around the hotel. You must remember that this is a large city and you should't expect it to be like your hometown! The 24 hr internet access was great!

<Content>Good for Price Loved the location (close to the termini), had internet for free in the lobby. The room was a decent size. My biggest problem was the bathroom. It was oddly arranged with the toilet close to the shower and a large person would have some problems with the spacing. We stayed there for 70 euro a night for 2 nights. But we also stayed at Hotel Ambasciatori for one night and though it was about 20 euro more it was a LOT nicer. So if you are willing to pay more I would recommend that hotel.

<Content>some problems I was immediatly turned off by the stained, dirty looking carpet. It was very warm even though it was in Nov. We opened the windows but the mosquitos swarmed in. The shower was a hole in the floor in the corner of the bathroom with a shower curtain. The beds were clean, at least I think they were. When the carpet is so dirty it makes you wonder. There were clean towels (they were like tablecloths but did the job) each day  the breakfast was good but please fix that carpet!

<Content>Safer than expected Having read some reviews of this hotel we, as pensioners, were rather apprehensive about tales of dodgy characters and threatening transients in the vicinity of the hotel. However we have just returned from 6 days at the Della Natione and at no time did we feel unsafe or threatened, we also found the Duomo to be a 7 minute walk away not 15 and we are in our 60's.The hotel was comfortable, we had a quiet room which was cleaned regularly together with the bathroom and although the breakfast was continental it was more than adequate with supplies of foods being constantly replenished.The staff were friendly and helpful and pre-booked tickets for us when required.

<Content>Pleasant Stay For it's its price and classification, this hotel is above average. Nice and big rooms. Near Stazione, SMN which is a big plus. Near shopping center, the Duomo. Breakfast is good with lots of selection. Internet access is free.Will definitely recommend this hotel to budget traveler. Staff are friendly and speaks English.

<Content>Disappointing My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights in July 2005. We chose it because we were travelling in and out of Florence by train, and for that reason it was a good choice.Tip: if you arrive by train, make sure you leave the station by the exit on the right as you come off the platform. We took the left hand exit and had a long walk around the outside of the station trying to find the hotel. If you leave by the right hand exit you only need to cross the street and turn right and the hotel is on your left.We were happy with the 20 minute walk from the hotel into the town centre. It was good to have time to walk off all that pasta!The hotel itself was a bit disappointing. The reception staff were friendly and helpful enough, and the free internet access was a bonus. The buffet breakfast was OK. Acceptable enough for a 3 star hotel.Our room however was not a place we wanted to spend much time at all. But then who wants to spend a lot of time inside in Florence?The decor and furniture in the room was drab and unappealing. The window was very high. The A/C wasn't strong enough and there was no way of controlling it.The bathroom was horrible. The shower was right on top of the toilet, and there was no option other than to have the shower curtain all over your knees while you were sitting on the loo, and I'm only 5'1!There was a horrible smell coming from the drains. We complained and it did improve slightly but was still noticeable. The towels were basically sheets. I had read about that on Trip Advisor before we left and so brought a towel from home along. Unfortunately the maid took it away with the other towels when they cleaned the room! We told reception and they did make an effort to find it, but as all the laundry goes to a comercial laundrette I didn't get it back. So, bring your own towels but make sure they are DARK colours so that they obviously don't belong to the hotel!This hotel is OK if you are on a budget and want to be close to the station. Other than that, there's not much going for it. There are plenty of hotels in that area, so if I were you I would check out reviews for them.

<Content>Very very very poor. I chose this hotel as it was close to the station and we were catching a train to rome after 3 nights, please just get a taxi to a hotel further away its worth it!!!The area and streets around the hotel are full of seedy characters all day and night everyday, Im a 22 yr old male and am pretty confident but we still felt unsafe. My girlfriend hated it so much she didnt want to walk around at night near the hotel.Rooms: Very average, bland and dirty basically. the bathroom was terrible just terrible, the carpet was badly stained. I coulnt sleep at night due to the excessive traffic noise driving past the station and hotel.Service: Was very average and not welcoming at all, I wish I had spent just a little bit more and booked somewhere nicer. You only live once!Oh well..... I will never return to this hotel and strongly advise others to just look around first.

<Content>Just OK Well, I guess everyone has a different angle. I am not even sure from the past reviews this is the same hotel we stayed at for 3 nights!As far as I am concerned, the best thing that this hotel has going for it is price and the free Internet access. We booked via an online travel agency and had a very good deal.I didn't find the location to be that desirable. Yes, it is across from the train station, which means getting to the hotel is a snap if you can manage to avoid being hit by motorcyclists and buses. However, this area is fill with cheap shops, and less than desirable crowd. The main attractions are at least a 20 minute walk and while it doesn't seem like a lot, after a whole day sightseeing and walking on narrow, rough cobblestones streets and dodging traffic it's a pain.So I would only recommend this hotel for those who intends to do a whirlwind tour of Florence en route to Venice/Rome via trains, on a budget and would like to stay in touch electronically for free.Room - we have a fairly big sized room with bland but OK furnishing. The carpet was a bit dirty and worn out (other hotels we stayed in Italy tend to have hardwood or marble floors, which is more practical in terms of cleaning). The safe worked, the bath towels are big and fluffy. The hand towels resembled kitchen towels in the US. The A/C doesn't work well. It seems we have no control over the temperature nor volume output. A call to the front desk promised help but no relief. The bathroom was good sized, but the water pressure was low and took a long time for the bathtub to be filled.Breakfast was in a large common area above the reception area. The drinks were dispensed out of a machine (son loved the hot chocolate there for strange reasons). There were the typical hard, rough rolls, croissants, yogurt, some choices of cereal, and a cheese and cold cut tray. Plenty of seating. You have to go to the front desk to get the username/password for the Internet login. Works pretty well and it's nice for sending quick notes and checking up on the news back home. Will I stay there again? Probably not. I am convinced after 3 weeks in Italy that anywhere around the Termini in any city is to be avoided. There are plenty of nice BB around major attractions that can be had for a reasonable price, and being in a hotel doesn't guarantee good service nor a good room over BB. Delle Nazioni was hands down the worse place we stayed at out of the 5 lodgings over 3 weeks.

<Content>mixed feelings 1. The hotel location is right next to the train station and about 10 - 15 minutes walk from the more interesting areas of Florence. The train station area is very busy, very noisy, dirty and there are also quite a few of sketchy people... 2. The hotel lobby and entrance etc... looks pretty good, you also get free internet and receptionists seem sympathetic. Newly renovated I beleive.3. Rooms: Except for the washrooms, the rooms were clean and of good size. However, washroom had a bad odor, no shower separation on the floor (picture the washroom and shower sharing the same floor). The towels to dry yourselves can be used as a table cloth for your dining room...also towels smell of vinegar so do the sheets you sleep on.4. Overall impressions: I beleive this hotel would be for someone young, on a budget. Not good for familys, couples etc... in my opinion.

<Content>Very Nice Hotel, Helpful Staff This hotel was very easy to find, just over the road from the main train station of Florence.Once arrive checking in was quick and the lady at reception spoke excellent English. We had a room on the top floor and had our own balcony, which gave great views of the skyline of Florence, and the view was even better at night when all the buildings were lit up.The hotel was clean and well presented, and the people on reception were always glad to help, when we arrived they gave us a map of Florence that turned into our bible. This map had all the major locations and roads and it was small enough not to make you look too much like a tourist. The breakfast was ok, not much choice but it gave you something to eat before the start of your own day in Florence.One of the downsides to the hotel, which has made me select above average, is that the hotel is on a busy main road and there are always buses stopping outside the hotel. Also at night the road was still very busy and you had to shut the doors and windows on the balcony so that some of the noise was shut out.Out of 10 i would give the hotel 8/10. only reasons for not getting full marks is the main road that the hotel is located on.

<Content>Not great This hotel has a great location right across from the train station and within easy walking distance to the main sights.Our bedroom was huge but our bathroom was quite small. In order to open or close the bathroom door, you had to lift up the toilet seat!! The decor was sparse. Our room did not have air conditioning (I think some rooms did, but ours didn't...)The bathroom was clean with new fixtures but the shower was very primitive -- it was just a curtain around a corner of the bathroom, with no place to put soap/shampoo. Of course there was water all over the floor afterwards...The towels were terrible (and weird). They were really more like bed sheets than towels -- very thin and neither soft nor absorbent! I felt like I was drying myself with a pillow case.We didn't get to have breakfast since we checked out too early. We asked if there was any way we could get something before the official breakfast time and we were told no.Overall, this hotel was not great and for us it was not a very good value, especially since we weren't able to get the included breakfast.

<Content>Bad hotel, good location  Me and my husband stayed in this hotel on our multi-city tour of Italy and by far this hotel was the worst we stayed in on our trip. The room was all drag with plain white walls and a bed which gave a hospital bed kinda look. In fact the whole room had a hospital look. There were no towels in our room and when asked we got paper thin towels. Then the rod to hang the clothes in the bathroom was broken and there was no other place to hang the clothes/towels. The shower hardly had any place to stand in and the shower curtain would stick to your body while bathing which made bathing seem useless. The safe in our room was not working properly and when we called the reception to help they were very rude as if we spoiled the safe. Some guy came and looked at it and found no problem (as we realised later that the safe would work fine for some time then start malfunctioning again). We kept our imp documents inside and when we tried to remove them the safe wouldnt open. Well we some how got them out and got them to put our papers in their private safes next to reception. The good part of the hotel was the location. Very close to attractions and train stn. The price is also moderate compared to other hotels in other cities. There was a small shop of some pakistani/bangladeshi guy near the station from where we got our daily picnic food which was very reasonable. You would need to get loads of water in Florence as it is very very hot there. We would buy our water/soda at this shop for the day as it was way too expensive to buy at the attractions. The breakfast was good with a lot of variety. Also the breakfast room was really good. If they had only spent half the money on the guest rooms!!!!

<Content>I hope you don't like Air Conditioning The hotel itself is pleasant, reasonably priced and close to sights and attractions. We checked in and the staff was polite and efficient. The room was clean and well appointed. The trouble began when we found that the AC in our room was non fuctional. We complained at the desk and they assured that it would be repaired. We complained again after four hours and were ignored and not offered any concession for our trouble. Incidently, when I complained the second time, another couple on our floor was complaining as well to no avail. The hotel staff did nothing for two days even as the room was unbearably hot... I'm sure it was because my room was prepaid.

<Content>Good value This hotel is in a convenient location, modern, clean, and very affordable. The SMN train station as well as a post office is directly across the street. The hotel has staff and internet access available 24 hours a day. Even though we reserved a room for 2 people, we had a suite with a king bed and a single bed on the 2nd floor that overlooked a small courtyard. We didn't hear any street noise. The heart of Florence is a 10-15 min. walk. The breakfast, which is free, is nothing great - mediocre cereals, some cured meats, bread with a sweet glaze, and hyper-sweetened juices. There are many local bakeries, pastry shops, and gelaterias if you decide to skip the breakfast.

<Content>Above average yet reasonably priced Hotel Delle Nazione We stayed at the Hotel Delle Nazione from 16th-20th May 2005, having booked through Expedia at a cost of around 拢65 per room per night. We had booked a double room for our stay, but were given a triple room on the first floor at the rear of the hotel. The room was very spacious - even for three people, and was very quiet. The bathroom was large enough and reasonably clean. Not much of a view from the bedroom, but we were more interested in seeing Florence and the surrounding region by foot. The hotel is situated literally two minutes walk from the main train station, the Santa Maria Novella, and there was a bus stop right outside the hotel. We didn't use any bus or taxi services during our stay so we cannot comment on the links to the main tourist attractions but the hotel was around 15 minutes walk from the Duomo, Ponte Vecchio and most other areas of interest. The area immediately surrounding the station had a few unsavoury characters, but that always seems to be the case at main train stations - all other areas seemed okay. The staff were friendly and helpful and, another few of the reviews have pointed out, there is free internet access from several terminals. Breakfast in the hotel was available in a self-service buffet style from 7am until 10am and comprised cereals, breads, cheese and meat, coffee, tea, etc. We would recommend this hotel to budget conscious travellers as accomodation prices in Florence can be very expensive. The reasonably-priced Hotel Delle Nazione offered every service expected from a 3-star rated hotel and more, with the added advantage of close proximity to the main train station for those wishing to see more of Tuscany by rail, and is also within walking distance of the major tourist attractions.

<Content>Great value modern hotel in Florence Recently stayed 3 nights at the Delle Nazione. It was a really good deal - 拢155 total including breakfast. The location is very convenient for the main station although a little walk into town - gets a bit much 3 return trips in a day. The hotel rooms are modern if a little small but ones at the front are noisy, particularly when the windows are open - we had to have them open as it was very warm and the a/c does not come on until June, even when temperatures are 25C. Staff are really helpful, polite and speak good English. Breakfast is basic but there is ample choice of cereals, breads, meat, cheese and yoghurt together with a wide range of coffees. Free internet is available on request.

<Content>Neat Hotel We stayed at Delle Nazioni for two nights in April.The hotel is right across the train station S.M.N. which is great.The rooms are big,comfortable and clean.The hotel is either new or lately renovated cause it looksvery nice inside and the decoration is very pleasant,modern but warm.There is free internet access in the lounge(didnt use it, we saw the pcs).The breakfast also is very good, not rich, but good enough.The only bad thing i can think of is the thin towels which werelike tablecloth, but thats minor.

<Content>Early Checkin Warning We arrived early (12:30 pm) and checkin time is not until 2:00 pm. We asked if we could leave our luggage here while we went sight seeing. We were told we could leave our luggage in the room over by the front door - there is no lock on the door and anyone has access to this room. There is no ticketing system for your luggage - so someone could easily walk off with your luggage. The sign in the room says they are Not Responsible.Just a friendly warning.

<Content>Better than expected! We stayed at the Hotel Delle Nazioni for 4 nights in March 2005. We had a triple room on the 4th floor, at the back of the hotel. The room was clean with plenty of space for the three of us, and we had a balcony with a lovely view of rooftops of Florence. The staff were friendly and helpful, and the breakfast was good. There were groups of young people staying there, who were occasionally noisy, but this wasnt really a problem.Overall, the hotel gave us great value for money, and I would stay there again.

<Content>think about it The front desk area was all new and clean, so was the bar. They even had free computer internet access and that area was nice. The breakfast in the morning was a normal euro affair. But the rooms were lacking luster. The whole hotel looked new and clean and the rooms were about 20 years behind. They were dark and uninviting. The bathroom was the same. The shower had no stall. But was just part of the bathroom floor. The floor sloped to one side in the bathroom to the shower drain. But for the money and location it wasn't bad. Plus, we had a private balcony on the 4th floor that looked out on the historical part of the city. The people at the front desk are not very helpful, keep that in mind if you don't know the area.

<Content>Nice Place I didnt except the hotel Room to be Big and Clean - Stayed there for 2 Nights, Romm 411. The staff was Surprisngly Smiling ( As opposed to eslewhere) . The room was Clean, Confortable. Bath Room was Big ( yes, expecially after seeing Bathroom in venice). * Cons: Towels where Super Thin - But I guess thats ok. Breakfast was nothing great, just a stomach filler expecially when you want to getout and start sight seeing. Over all : Good Hotel - 2 Minutes walk from Train Station and Close to All of the sights, We walked all of Florence - Due to Bus Stop next to Hotel it may look very busy - But once inside its nice.

<Content>My first hotel in Italy and not bad overall Stayed here as part of a Tuscan Valley + Rome package tour in Feb. 05.Pros:- Room was large and had one king bed and one twin. - Room faced the courtyard, very private with no street noise, etc- Room was relatively clean - While just a continental breakfast it was above average- Free Internet access with 5 PCs (not all working at same time) - never had to wait- Very convenient location- The front desk was very helpful and gave us excellent referrals to nearby restaurants that were excellentCons:- Was in a room that had not been renovated; plaster was falling off the wall in the small shower- The room was never vacuumed for the 3 nights we were there- Heat worked fine but it seemed like it either ran all the time (and we got hot) or it wasn't running at all- While the location is convenient there are bus stops right outside the hotel so every time you come or go it seems like you have to work through a crowd to get into the placeOverall the hotel met our expectations and since the tour package price was so cheap the price we paid offered very good value!

<Content>Good hotel and great staff Just returned from Florence and Rome, and found the Delle Nazioni Hotel quite adequate, if not good. After reading some of the negative reviews, I was quite skeptical about staying at this hotel. The room and bed was good,not great, but goood. The staff was very helpful. And most of all the breakfast room offered quite a variety of foods. The Coffee selection was great. I found by combining cappucino with expresso, I got a pretty good cup of coffee. If you want bacon and eggs (not my choice) stay elsewhere.I would highly recommend this hotel. It was in a great location for navigating Florence on foot.

<Content>Impressed  I was impressed with our room at the Delle Nazioni Hotel. The room was very big and bright. Our room opened up to a beautiful balcony were we could see the Duomo Cathedral on one side and the beautiful mountains on the other. Be sure to ask for a room on the 4th floor if you pick this hotel. That's the only floor you can see the Duomo. We stayed here for 4 nights in September. We really enjoyed our stay. We were very close the attractions and great shops and restaurants - even a little grocery store. We took the train from Rome to Florence and when we got off the train, we just walked across the street to the hotel - didn't waste money on a taxi!!! And although the train station is so close, you can't hear it in the room. It's very quite. The bed was very comfortable and the tv had several channels. The pictures of the hotel on expedia are very true to what the room looks like. The hotel staff was helpful and nice. They also provided a nice continental breakfast each morning with croissants, cereal and coffee. The only complaint I have with the room is that the bathroom was very small and there was not a lot of places to put things such as your toothbrush, towels, etc. The shower was very small and it was not enclosed so water got all over the floor each time you took a shower. I recommend bringing a pair of flip-flops/thongs to wear so you are not slipping all over the floor. Otherwise, I was pleasently surprised with the room and the hotel overall. It was very nice and affordable without being cheap. I read the reviews on this website and they really helped me make my decision and I'm glad I followed the advice of previous visitors.

<Content>Average Hotel I stayed 3 nights in this hotel in Dec-04. At first I only reserved 2 nights via an agent on the Internet at 鈧?0,00 (so-called special rate). Then I extended one more night some days later by phone at 鈧?0,00 (standard rate). So my experience was: try to make it in advance, at least you can search the prices listed by various agents! Regarding the hotel, its location is so great - only 200m from the SMN Station - at the Station, take the exit on the left (facing the platforms), cross the road, turn right and walk 200m to reach the hotel!!! According to some comments on the Internet, I requested a room facing the backlane - no view but extremely quiet. The room was so big that was far beyond my expectations - the biggest I've ever stayed in Italy! Although the facilities were just ok, I would say they were acceptable for a 3-star hotel. At least the room was clean, tidy and comfortable. About the breakfast, only bread and corn flakes were served. Only surprise was the beverage - there were two machines at the breakfast room, by which you can have expresso, latte, chocolate, American coffee, etc. with unlimited supply!!! In general, the price at 鈧?0-80,00 was reasonable and worths the money!!!

<Content>Pretty nice with only one problem Room was large and clean (as was the bathroom). Stayed there the begining of December. Breakfast was fine. Staff was helpful. Only issue was that after the first night I thought it was a little warm, and was unable lower the heat, so the next night I left the windows open (no screens) and was bitten several time by mosquitos, however the next night I did not do this and it was fine. Agreed that the hair dryer is terrible. I had one of the remodeled rooms as well.

<Content>Nice Clean Hotel We stayed at the hotel the last week in October. We were in one of the renovated rooms which were very clean. Showers didnt bother us a bit, most of the water went right down the drain and used one towel as a bathmat. Food was good at the breakfast buffet. Hotel is just a short walk from the Duomo. The hair dryers ARE VERY slow and the handle gets hot after a while but, other than that, no complaints with the hotel. Would recommend to others and if/when I am lucky enough to get back to Florence, I would stay there again!

<Content>OK on a budget Clean rooms that were fairly large. Staff polite but not always very helpful. No irons or ironing boards or clock in the room. Slow blow dryer in the bathroom and the shower was a flimsy looking plastic box that leaked some but showers were hot and had good water pressure. Breakfast was cereal and rolls with juice and coffee from a machine. Be wary if you use the phones to make local calls - no directions on how to use the phone and rates not posted. Staff does not advise that if you call a local cell phone that the rate is much higher than a land line. Overall stay was pleasant for travelers on a budget.

<Content>Lower End of Average!!!! We were there Nov 12 thru 15, 04. We must have been given one of the unrenavated rooms. It looked like a dormatory. We did not even have a shower. There was a tub w/a spray hose and nozle and luke warm water. I found the night staff rude and very short, to the pont of giving us wrong directions. However the lady that was there in the daytime was helpful. If I had not been on a package deal I would have spent a few more euro and tryed to get something a little better in the same area. If your looking for just a place to sleep the beds were clean and comfortable . They looked like roll away beds bolted to the wall ?????

<Content>A better than satisfactory experience We were a four couple group that just got back from our stay in Florence. While the reviews about the shower size and the napkin type towels are true, the room was clean and the bathroom spotless. By the way, the towels are quite absorbent and better than many hotel towels. The hotel staff was helpful and the breakfast just fine. The Manager was also accommodating and helpful. Overall, not a five star hotel, but fine for a place to shower and sleep while enjoying Florence. By the way, we had a terrace with a view of the Duomo. Very nice indeed.

<Content>A Pleasant Surprise! We just got back. Rooms are a little small, but very clean and modern. Other reviews mention that the shower stall is a little strange and the towels are like large restaurant napkins. Both of these things are true, but really, whose trip to Florence is ruined by stuff like that? If you're like us and want something reasonably priced, clean, safe and in a convenient location, then this place is for you. If you want a cookie cutter of a Marriott or Hyatt, stay in the US. I was a little worried by what I had read regarding the shady characters that supposedly hang out at the train station next door. What a joke! They should come to New York sometime to see true shady characters. During the day, it can be a little noisy facing the train station, but it didn't disturb our daily nap or evening's sleep, but I could see if you were very sensitive to noise, you should request a room away from the station. Front desk was lovely and very accomodating. Breakfast was OK, not great. Overall, it was really a great place to stay

<Content>Quite Nice My boyfriend and I had just come from a little cave of a hotel in Rome, so we were happy to walk into the tidy, newly-renovated lobby of the Delle Nazioni. Our room was spacious and everything was brand new. The shower is nothing more than a little lip in the floor of the bathroom -- so the whole room gets wet when you shower. But we didn't care. The staff was very patient and helpful -- and my boyfriend will stand there and ask questions as long as you let him. The breakfast was very nice -- rolls, juice and a latte machine that we took full advantage of. There was also a bar -- which was nice. I saw many other three star hotels in Florence that did not look nearly as nice as this one. I would stay here again in a heart beat.

<Content>Very Pleased My boyfriend and I stayed here for 6 nights in late Oct.-early Nov.. We had a great room on the 4th floor. It was newly renovated (which we asked for per- advice on this site). The bed was very comfortable and spacious. The bathroom was a good size. The shower did get the whole bathroom floor wet once it was turned on, but thats was no big deal. We had a great view, and it was very quiet. The breakfast was a good typical european one, and the lobby and bar were very nice. The staff (all english speaking) was very accomodating and always willing to answer any questions. Good location across from the train station and easy access to bus and taxi stops. All the sights are within a 15-20 minute walk. Due to the warm climate there are still mosquitos in the fall season, so be aware of this when keeping the windows open. The in-room safe provided the extra security of leaving valuables in the room. The elevators were slow and creaked...but again...no problems and definetly not worth a complaint  I would highly reccomend this hotel to anyone looking to see Florence. There are many other hotels that we passed that looked horrible. If you do not want to stay at the Nazioni, make sure you research your hotel so you are not misled. Enjoy Florence!!!

<Content>Horrible!!! Don't stay here!!! They have bugs that bite!!! Do not stay at this hotel!!! I am warning anyone who is considering booking this hotel. Although the hotel looks nice, there are other things people should know about it. My friend and I booked this hotel for 2 nights and on the first night there, my friend woke me up around 3am because she was getting bit by bugs. I went to go check her bed and there were these little black bugs crawling over her bed. I went to go check my bed also, and they were crawling under my pillow. Apparently, they come out when it is dark. We were moved to another room but spent most of the remaining night awake, paranoid about more bugs and also kept the lights on. When we checked out, we asked for at least a partial refund for the first night but the reservation manager, Renato Campestrina, refused saying that we had booked through a travel agency. When we got back to the States, the problem became more serious because both my friend and I had caught some form of scabies. I called the travel agency and they said that they would talk to the hotel. I received an email saying that the manager was still refusing because he said it was basically our fault and that we had probably opened the window. One would wonder why I would open a window when the room was freezing cold and it was raining. He said that we had probably been bit by mosquitos but I have a doctor's note and I have pictures of my arm breaking out in hives, and I can tell you that those are not mosquito bites. I am quite ------ off about the lack of concern from this hotel and I would really advise everyone to stay away from here if you want to avoid going to the doctor and pay about an additional $200 in medication. Do not book this hotel!!!!

<Content>Central and comfortable The hotel is definitely worth more than it's 2 star rating. Having paid a little extra for one of the self-catering apartments was pleased with the additional space and compact kitchen, and overall the room was clean and comfortable. Yes, there were a few minor negative points but nothing worth complaining about as the positive points outweighed these (the complimentary breakfast was especially nice, and the bar/lounge area very comfortable). Everything is within walking distance (with buses on the doorstep when your feet have had enough) and, although there were a few dodgy characters around the station at night, I never once felt threatened. Will definitely return to Florence, and can't imagine finding a better deal than the Delle Nazioni.

<Content>Not bad Stayed at the hotel in October 2004. The front desk was very nice. Internet is $8e per hour. Breakfast was good, but no meat/cheese. Stayed in a room in the back and it was quiet with great view. Bathroom was small and shower floods bathroom floor. Could not hear the train station. We walked everywhere or took a bus without a problem. We did not have any fears about theft and felt safe walking all the streets. I guess the key is to not look like a target. Booked hotel through hotels.com ($120e night). If you think you are going to have to change your schedule, it is easier to find your best price online and then call the hotel directly and book it. This gives you flexibility with the hotel to extend/decrease your stay without hotels policy.

<Content>TERRIBLE - avoid at all costs We were on our honeymoon and were supposed to stay at this hotel...DISGUSTING. We booked a superior non-smoking room 3 months ahead. When we arrived we got the last room left available and it stank like stale cigarette smoke. We were only able to stay in the room for about 5 minutes before we demanded to be moved to another hotel. The walls and floors were covered in dirt, there were dish towel instead of bath towels. It seemed more like a jail cell instead of a hotel room over $130 a night. The location is horrible with creepy people walking the streets outside the lobby. This one occurance nearly ruined our whole experience in Florence. Spend a little more money and avoid this place! It will be money well spent!

<Content>Nice Hotel What a gem, a very nice hotel for the price. Right next to the train station and within walking distance from all sights. Free breakfast, nice rooms, nice front desk. Would recommend it to most people, unless you are a snob of course. If so, pay your $300 per night and stop complaining.

<Content>Great location, Quality room, Good Proce In travel books this is rated as just 2 star accomodations. In terms of its location, cleanliness of the room, helpful staff and reasonable price it deserves a much better rating.Located next to the train station, upper rooms have a good view of the top of the Dumo and the Palace Vechio and it is within easy walking distance of these sites.The windows keep out any street noise so you are ensured a restful night's sleep.The continental breakfast provided was descent and far superior to most of the ones we had in Italy. Place to stay in Florence at an affordable price.

<Content>Convenient location but wouldn't recommend if you need A/C Booked here based on reviews - here's our experience: POSITIVE - close to train station, restaurants, and attractions. Elizabella and one young gentleman (front desk) were so helpful, nice size rooms, and okay breakfast. NEGATIVES - no air conditioning and weather was 35-40C!!!!, room was on train side so very noisy if you opened windows but without them open the room was like a furnace, most of other staff were rude and not very helpful

<Content>Nice Hotel We stayed at the Delle Nazioni Hotel for 3 nights in July 2004. It is right across the street from the train station. When you get off the train, leave through the exit on the right. Go across the street, make a right and go down 1 1/2 blocks. Overall the hotel was nice and the staff was helpful. The room was big but the shower was very, very small. Around the corner was a shop that sold drinks for 85 cents. A great deal considering that in most place a can of Coke is 3-5 Euros. From the hotel, we were able to walk to everywhere we went. Overall a nice hotel with a good price. I would recommend it to anyone going to Florence.

<Content>Absolutely Terrible - Don't believe the Internet Descriptions We booked this room based on the other reviews on this website and on their internet descriptions. We made a huge mistake.Apparently, this hotel has renovated and unrenovated sections. Since we did not specify in our reservation, we were put in the worst rooms in the unrenovated section. The paint was peeling off the walls. The beds were COTS! We may as well have slept on the floor. The bathroom and shower were disgusting. The hotel front door is right next to a bus stop and the crowds that gather there are not what you would consider friendly. We did not stay a second night. For only a few Euro's more we moved over to the Londra Hotel around the corner. What a pleasant difference.Dont's waste your money and ruin your vacation on this dump! There is inexpensive and there is cheap. This is much below cheap.

<Content>Very Nice Accommodations Stayed at Nazioni in May 2004. Although the location is convenient and perfect for easy walking to/from train station and the sights, it is on a VERY busy street. Luckily, we had a room that must have been on the back side, because our room was nice and quiet. The room in general was great -- modern, big bathroom, comfortable bed, and NICE blackout curtains. Breakfast was good, but the staff consistently had trouble with their two coffee/chocolate machines. Out of the four cities we stayed at in Italy during this vacation, this was the most expensive. Was it worth it? Well, we slept well, we were safe, and the location meant for easy touring. I would say yes.
