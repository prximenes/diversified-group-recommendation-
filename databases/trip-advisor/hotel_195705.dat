<Content>Flawless stay This is one of my favorite hotels. Everything, from the decor to the service was perfect. Location is excellent as well --- steps to Ponte Vecchio, the Uffizi and Palazzo Vecchio, as well as a good little gelato/cafeteria in between. I even had a view of the tops of the Duomo and Palazzo Vecchio from my room on the 6th floor.My room was immaculate. Room service, should you need it, was unbelievably fast and delicious. The hotel was full but somehow I never ran into any other guests and never felt like the front desk was overwhelmed. Breakfast, which was included in my rate, was wonderful with tons of fresh fruits and breads, preserves, yogurts, etc.I never ate at the hotel restaurant, but it was always full and hopping any time I passed by it, especially at night.I would definitely stay here again. In fact, I can't wait to return.P.S. The pictures posted by other reviewers must be a little dated---the hotel now has flat panel televisions.

<Content>Waited on hand  Stayed 3 nights here with a friend thanks to a competition prize. Our original room at the Continenale (across the square) was unexpectedly unavailable, so we were transferred here  immediately upgraded for our inconvenience - though I would hardly call it that! For a first trip to Florence the hotel is in a perfect location  the staff are friendly  helpful. We loved the comfy beds  bathroom with double shower (no bath). The water can take a while to get going, so be patient. There's also a good buffet breakfast with the best capuccinos.

<Content>Thiefs in the hotel! During spring, we stayed in the Gallery Hotel for one holiday week and we had the bad surprise to be stolen our brand new reflex camera in our room!Not only this event was shoking but today, quite 6 months later, we still have no news and no excuses from the hotel! We have declared the theft to the police, given a copy of this declaration to the hotel manager and filled the hotel's insurance form. But no news!They may think that it is a normal situation to be stolen goods in the room. Even worse, the manager told us that in the same evening, another room had been visited. An Ipod was missing.So Florence is a wonderful city, museums,restaurants and people are great but if you plan to book in the Gallery Art Hotel, say goodbye to your goods....

<Content>modern chic within 50 feet of Ponte Vecchio Absolutely fantastic experience.I booked this hotel as part of a special long weekend to propose to my girlfriend. I emailed the hotel to ask about my room and if it had a balcony - i received an email back stating i was being upgraded to the Junior Suite (very large sofa TV room, large modern bedroom and double basin bathroom). This certainly made an impact and highlighted the personal touch of the hotel. On arrival the reception staff and porter were very helpful and accommodated our request for wine and champagne glasses - they assisted with the ideas and options of food and drink. We ate at the Hotel Savoy which was fantastic, limited menu but impeccable service as expected. I would recommend the Golden View Open Bar Restaurant (just over and to the left of the Ponte Vecchio - you may need to book) but it was very busy with a good mix of locals and tourists, live jazz band playing in the background but was not intrusive - excellent wine menu and food was glorious.All in all the whole experience was fantastic, an Italian city full of excitement and things to do - its very centred on the art and craft world (obviously) but if you are like me, who enjoys the sun, relaxing and eating nice food and e people watching then Florence is the place for you - its not cheap, but remember to haggle at the markets and with the fake-good guys where there are plenty on the road to the Ponte Vecchio. Also, remember if you book a taxi you pay from when you actually book (our taxi was 18 euros to the train station...!Enjoy.

<Content>Aperitivo-time! This Ferragamo-owned hotel is stylish in every sense of the word. This, however, is not the only reason why we found it such a wonderful place to stay for our short break in Florence this Easter: First of all, it is perfectly situated by Ponte Vecchio within easy walking distance of all sights in the city centre. It's zen-like atmosphere isn't just about Japanese prints -in fact it was more quiet at night than my neighbourhood in rural Norway!Our room was quite spacious by European standards, had a spotless bathroom and a French balkony with shutters. Quality leather details on the bed and furniture and beautiful mirrors added a glamorous touch to the othervise minimalist room.The hotel staff were extremely sweet and helpful. They gave us excellent advise on where to eat and made dinner reservations for us as well. Having said that, we could have stayed at the hotel to eat every night: The food was absolutely delicious -Asian and fusion cuisine mostly. We strongly recommend the hotel's aperitivo: From 7 p.m. and for a couple of hours you can help yourself to an amazing display of finger food -all free when you buy a drink in the bar! For drinks, I also recommend a visit to the Continentale -another Ferragamo hotel in the same small square as Gallery Art: In stylish surroundings with a Hepburn-touch, you can have very nice coctails. In the summer season the Continentale is also famous for its rooftop bar with a beautiful view of Ponte Vecchio and Oltrarno.

<Content>Loved The Gallery Hotel Art Spent three nights here in March and loved the hotel. The staff were warm, helpful and friendly. The room was done very tastefully in a simple, clean and elegant decor and it had a great bathroom. We needed internet access and the hotel even provides their own laptop for your room which you can keep and use for your full stay. The lobby was very attractive with a hopping bar and the location of the hotel could not be more central. Our only issue was that breakfast was not included in the rate. This was the only hotel of five we stayed in Italy where it was not included and to pay for it separately, even in a nearby cafe, was outragously expensive. This is definately a four star hotel, not sure how it got a three star here.

<Content>chic and modern We stayed for 3 days last week end and as regular visitors to florence we decided on a bit of of a blow out this time. what a find. friendly, knowledgeable staff in a perfect setting right in the middle of Florence at the ponte vechhio. Modern, chic rooms and a great breakfast made this trip very memorable. We sought the advise of the conceriege regarding a restaurant and he recommended Parione. Well worth a visit if you feel like splashing out. The steak Florintine was huge and the gnocci was the best we have tasted...... ever.

<Content>Location is AMAZING When looking at hotels in Florence, we discovered the wonderful Gallery Hotel Art. But one thing that we didn't know was how amazing the location of the hotel was. It is located in a quiet side-street less than a block from the Ponte Vechio. But despite the masses of tourist crossing the bridge daily, the side-street is never loud. One main reason for this is that the company that owns the hotel owns a second hotel right across the street. Also, the hotel is less than a five minute walk from the Uffizi gallery and the Piazza Della Signora. We stayed in one of the penthouses, which was a good choice. The room had a massive bathroom with both a shower and a large bathtub. We had a beautiful terrace and a really comfortable bed. Also, breakfast is included in the rate. In general, the breakfast is continental. But they do have bacon, roasted tomatoes, and scrambled eggs. They are also willing to make you toast and coffee to order. The staff were accommodating and helped arrange for train tickets and various other museum passes. Also, the restaurant is really modern andappears to be a hit with the locals. In the end, the Gallery Hotel Art is a great hotel with an exceptionallocation and you should definitely consider for your trip to Florence.

<Content>Nice boutique I believe the hotel is part of Ferragamo group... and it's very boutique, very nice. It's not sophisticated with huge restaurants and others facilitaties, but its lounge/bar and its dining area is very well maintained and nice (especially the scramble egg in breakfast, fresh orange juice is served upon request). For the price and the location, one couldn't ask more... unless you are a student... then it's entirely different issue. I am on business trip at a group rate.

<Content>Loved it! Would definitely stay here again! I read some of the TripAdvisor reviews on this hotel, with some mixed reviews, so I wasn't sure what to expect. Well, let me tell you - sometimes you have to experience things for yourself. Hotel Gallery Art was wonderful. It is on a quiet side street, but ridiculously close to the Ponte Vecchio and other attractions. The room was nicely appointed: interesting art, nice bathroom (although the tub could use some work), free Internet access via Ethernet, and spacious interior. The bed was a tad firm for my taste, but my friend loved it. The staff was incredibly helpful, gracious, and accommodating - not stuck up at all. We had room service our first night there because we were rather tired from the long flight and rather arduous journey from Rome to Florence, and it was delicious. As part of our package, we received a 3-course dinner at the Fusion Bar restaurant, and the food was fabulous. Our waitress was incredibly nice! The art in the lobby was fabulous (meant to get pictures, but I didn't).This was my first trip to Italy, for a girlfriends' getaway, and Hotel Gallery Art helped to make it a wonderful stay.

<Content>Excellent Hotel! Highly recommeneded. I stayed here for 4 nights across a weekend and could not have been more satisfied. Everything from the location to the service and room was outstanding. As always, the good, bad and ugly to follow:The Good- Location. Right at the Ponte Vecchio, actually about 75 yards away! Great if you are taking a taxi in. Not so easy if driving in like I did. Doable but bring your patience cap!- Room. One of the nicest rooms I have ever stayed. We were upgraded to a suite (room 705) that had a balcony overlooking the Duomo. Not an awesome view because of high wall, but pretty darn nice. The room itself was super and clean. Beautiful wood floors, excellent bathroom (tub/shower combo), sizeable closets and safe. Bed was very comfortable (firm) and the pillows were ok (one super firm, one very soft).- Service. Checked in by Pigi who was super helpful the entire stay. Service at breakfast was also helpful daily by offering cafe, tea, etc. Room service was excellent as well. I communicated via email which was promptly responded to.- Hotel resturant (Fusion Bar) - I know, why eat in the hotel? I had same question but we were a bit tired and wanted something easy. Excellent food. Had an unforgettable soup - bean/gargonzola cheese that was outstanding. Wife had excellent fillet while I had sea bass for main course. Food was very good - as good as any of the nice restaurants we had in the city (and we ate well). The Bad- If you are driving, be sure to have an updated map, or GPS and your patience cap. This is no fault of the hotel - it's just a fact of driving around Florence! Many one-ways and tight quarters.The Ugly.- Nothing!Highly recommended for great location and service. Room was also very nice.Enjoy Florence.Jeremy

<Content>Great location, comfortable stylish room After staying in a couple of more 'authentic, rustic' rooms in Italy (read: old and uncomfortable) and after a bit too much of the Rennaissance style, I found the decor, simplicity and comfort of the HOtel Gallery ARt to be a great respite. The room is very comfortable and stylish as is the bathroom (great shower). We looked forward to coming home after a long day of walking and sightseeing. Everyone says it...the location is superb...much better than some of the fancier hotels right in the middle of tourist central. It's a 3 minute walk to the Duomo and being on a quite courtyard next to charming little streets is very relaxing/appealing. And of course being a few steps from the Ponte Vecchio for sunset is great. I found the concierge to be quite helpful. He got us a car to the Mall and offered some good restaurant suggestions. WE also enjoyed a night at the Asian fusion restaurant in the hotel...it's quite hip and is fun people-watching...also nice to have some Asian food after a week of non-stop pasta!Recommendations: Book Uffizi and Academia in advance, eat at Olio  Convivum, watch Sunset from Continentale Bar.

<Content>Luxurious stay We stayed at the Gallery Art Hotel at the end of August 2007Great central location on tiny Via Vicolo dell 'Oro,very near the Ponte Vecchio, a short stroll from the Duomo  the UffizziThe rooms were very cool with wonderful, comfortable king size bed in our room  2 twins in the children鈥檚 room; sheets were 1st class as were the pillows.The bathrooms were very clean, white, luxurious with great water pressureVery nice touches like terry cloth slippers, robes, Free Internet in the room with a codeBreakfast @ 25 Euros per person was not included. When I expressed that it didn鈥檛 make sense for us because I didn鈥檛 eat much and neither did our daughter, the price was slashed to 12 Euros per person. We chose to breakfast out for a total of approximately 15 Euros.Concierge was a little out of touch when I asked her to recommend a trattoria for dinner. She was unimpressed by several of the names I gave her, obtained from TripAdvisor, and suggested Trattoria I鈥?Parioni located on Via del Parione, 74/76/r where my husband  son split a massive bistecca alla fiorentina  ordered an extravagant bottle of wine. It was far more elegant and costly than what we had in mind for ourselves and our children and I resented it (despite the choices my husband and son made ... my husband resigned himself to the prices and said he was going to enjoy his meal)鈥?br/>

<Author>amybojo
<Content>Charming, modern boutique hotel! This hotel is a modern hotel located close to the Ponte Vecchio (spelling?) and to all of the amazing sights and museums Florence has to offer. The Uffizi Gallery is just a few blocks away and the Academia (where David by Michaelangelo is housed) is not too far either. The hotel lobby is ultra modern with art (hence the name) grazing the walls. The check-in experience was OK. We were early and they were hoping to accomodate us. They told us initially it would be 15 minutes (in Italian time -- I'm learning, this is more like 30 minutes). After about an hour our hotel room was (said to be) ready. We squeezed into the really, really small elevators and headed to our room with the bell hop. When we got to our floor our room was not ready - as initially thought - but they quickly (after a heated Italian discussion between the bell hop and housekeeping) accomodated us in another room. The room faced the Duomo and we could see it's roof from our small balcony. The room was tastefully decorated with modern decor. A VERY comfortable bed and linens....with a HUGE mirror adorning the wall. The TV was OK - but much better than what we saw in other hotels in Italy during our trip - but with the great sights and sounds of the city -- who needs to be watching TV in the room for long periods of time?!? The bathroom was very tastefully appointed and updated impeccably with modern furnishings and a great shower -- with a huge massage shower head. The toiletries etc. were all high quality and a nice touch - although some of them looked used. The hotel has a restaurant area on-site and a nice sized patio for dining - and relaxing after a long day. They also have a room off of the lobby with books, newspapers and nice modern, comfortable sofas. Overall, this was a wonderful stay for the money (even if the Euro is strong against the US $). I would definitely recommend staying here. Other tips -- book the Uffizzi in advance either through the hotel - or in our case we saw it w/the aide of a licensed guide. The Academia also needs to be booked in advance - and it's definitely worth it. When you look into the eyes of David - - you know you've arrived someplace special. Enjoy your trip!

<Content>Location was superb Saw this hotel many years ago when I was with my Italian friends and vouched I would stay here one day. It is very beautiful in it's location and presence in the little square, which was why I probabaly wanted to go. However even tthough the lobby was lovely and the breakfast room and bar have a great atmosphere and edge to them, I was very disappointed in our room. It was very small and pokey with a very small bed I felt for a double. Our bathroom was lovely but the view was a real disapointment of the courtyard and junk below. I felt the staff were a bit tired of everyone and when I asked for a fabulous restaurant I am pleased I did not trust their view as found a fabulous place on our own in the end and the place they had recomended was actually considered a tourist trap in Tme Out Florence, which I do tend to trust wholeheartedly. Would not stay again but did the job for a few days!

<Author>DCUnited
<Content>Good real estate, mediocre service I just came back from a 4-night stay at the hotel. This really is a 3.5 star review but I am rounding it up! My generocity is driven by the general shortage of boutique hotels in Florence. Most hotels, restaurants, bars etc. in the city are of the fussy, old-Europe variety. So when this hotel opened 5 yrs ago or so at a perfect location within spitting distance from Ponte Vecchio it was an immediate hit and still is revered by the trendy set in the city.The hotel is part of a Ferragamo-owned mini chain of 4 properties. Hence the nice leather touches in the rooms. For example, the headboard and desk chair and armoir handles were all done in nice yellow leather. Bathroom was great and the details were solid. The bed was of the Euro side-by-side twin variety (which I hate) and was firm but not terribly comfortable. Still nothing unusual for Euro standards. Smallish room had a tiny balcony opening to a dark internal courtyard. None of the rooms have any views, really.The main lobby is too spartan but next to it is the Library lounge which is nice and comfy. Also at the hotel there is a fusion restaurant and bar which is nice but nothing to write home about. In short, the place is almost 1990's (passe) stereotype - minimalism,fusion food, lounge music - we've seen it all before. However, as I've said, the combination is rather refreshing in Florence.The real downside of the hotel is service. Don't expect any service from the front-desk staff and you shall not be disappointed. Most of the time, there is only 1 person who is supposed to check in people, answer the phone, give food recommendations, etc. No wonder that you get rushed and that phones don't get picked up. At best they will give you the bill and call you a taxi. One tip - make sure you go to the rooftop of the sister Continentale property next door for a drink and spectacular views.The verdict: great bathrooms, very good (if smallish room), nice designer details. Nothing breathtaking but all quite solid. Except for front-desk service. Why can't they hire 3 East Europeans to be around and cheerful at all times?

<Content>Florence at its hippest Thanks to the reviews on Trip Advisor we booked a top floor suite at this amazing hotel to celebrate our silver wedding anniversary. We had planned to arrive refreshed after a luxury train journey from France, but because the Italians trains were on strike we hired a car and drove (nine hours) over the Alps to get here. Not a good start but it was liberating to fling the keys at the doorman, in a very theatrical way, and say park the car!. After a drink or two and a fantastic sushi dinner in the hotel's bar-cum-restaurant, we were under its spell.The staff were warm and welcoming, the atmosphere is buzzy and attracts Florence's bright young things and it is great to stay somewhere so comtemporary as a contrast to the Renaissance masterpieces. We had pushed the boat out to stay in one of the best rooms (room 707), with a huge bedroom, mezzanine lounge area and patio doors on to a split level roof terrace, complete with built in seating areas, loungers and dining table. It was certainly a life you could get used to.I will remember details like the beautiful bed linen, glass bannister rail, fantastic bathroom smellies and waking up to hear the Florentine bells chiming out all around us. The hotel is literally yards from the Ponte Vechhio but tucked away in a side street which makes it beautifully quiet, a real luxury for a city break. Breakfast is also good - the best we had in Italy. The hotel is part of a small luxury chain and we had dinner at the sister hotel across the Arno.If you want a memorable experience (and the credit card will take it, or as my husband said, the stay cost us 35p for every day we've been married - the old romantic) this is certainly the place.

<Content>Horrible Service!! I stayed at the Gallery Hotel Art along with 5 business associates for 3 nights during a recent business trip to Florence. The hotel itself was fine: a convenient location, small but pretty rooms and a good in house breakfast which was included in the room rate. The problem lies in the absolute lack of service offered by everyone we encountered in the hotel. Everyone from the front desk clerk at check-in, to the bellman, the concierge, and the housekeeping staffhandled each and every request with an attitude of utter disdain. It was truly unbelievable how poorly we all were treated. I have traveled to Florence at least twice a year for the past 10 years and have never, ever encountered a level of service this poor. It is my recommendation that when staying in Florence you choose another hotelwhere you can experience the kindness and warmth of the Florentine people!

<Content>Perfect Hotel for Us!!! My mother and best friend visited me here in Italy in December. We booked this hotel based on a reccomendation from a friend and were not disappointed. It was a great hotel. Very contemporary furnishings with a nice breakfast buffet. The location is near the Ponte Vecchio and is close the everything. There is no parking, but they have a garage that will pick up your car and bring it back as needed. Staff was really nice and even wrote out directions to the designer outlets for us. I would definately stay here again.

<Content>Can't wait to go back! Absolutely my most favorite hotel ever! Beautiful contemporary style, comfortable beds, spacious bathrooms,excellent food (the fusion restaurant is wonderful) - and the best service anywhere. I've had the privelege of staying here 3 or 4 times, and hands down, the best time I have ever had, and the best hotel in Italy that I have ever stayed at.

<Content>Good Location but... everything else was just so so. The staff were pretentious, not friendly at all. Housekeeping leaves the cart in front of our door everyday and I don't know why. Small room and bathroom, not worth the money.

<Content>Excellent Room Hi - Just stayed for 3 nights at the Gallery Hotel Art. The rooms were absolutely fantastic with a separate living area / bathroom / and bedroom. Rooms were quiet, fresh, elegantly designed. We actually requested to see rooms in several other hotels (JK Place, Hotel Lungarno), and would rate our room as the best. The location was amazing, just 2 blocks from the Ponte Vecchio Bridge, a very short walk to the Uffizi, and convenient to everything. The only downside was the concierge service (or really lack thereof). We were forced to go to their sister hotels (Lungarno, and Continentale - which is right next door) for advice that was more than just a reservation somewhere. Would still stay here again though for the rooms and breakfast!

<Content>Loved this Hotel! We adored the Hotel Gallery Art. The interior is stunning and modern. It is very fresh and minimalist. The room was beautifully appointed and the bathrooms were the prettiest that we came across in our travels. The bed was so comfy we didn't want to get out of bed for the wonderful breakfast spread every morning. The one downfall is that some of the staff came across as stuffy and snobby. Overall, we did have good service, especially at breakfast, but the bar and front desk attendants seemed to have a bit of an attitude. Make sure to check out the roof top bar at the sister hotel next door...the Continatale.

<Content>Great Hotel , would stay again. Gallery Hotel Art was a great find; this was our first trip to Florence. The hotel location is exactly where you need to be, night and day. The staff are welcoming and helpful. The room was clean, spacious and tastefully decorated. I would not hesitate to stay again if in Florence. Make sure you have an early evening drink in the hotel bar, the free nibbles are great!

<Content>Hip Hotel Excellent Location Stayed there a year ago on our honeymoon. Very hip hotel , perfect location to great restaurants and walking distance to Ponte Vecchio and everywhere else! Very clean, modern , without being pretentious. Staff was good, breakfast buffet was awesome. Elevators are very tiny, and sometimes at night we could hear the staff cleaning? or lugging trucks , blocks or carts across the hall. Nicely appointed rooms very clean, small, but there's quite a bit too see in Florence so you only really sleep there. Can't go wrong with this hotel. Great food in the square I forget what it's called. Any of the restaurants there are excellent. have the Florentine steak ! Waiters are very very friendly. We loved Florence, it's such a sexy city.

<Content>Excellent Location Upmarket 'reassuringly expensive' boutique hotel enjoying an excellent location. Standard rooms are on the small side but this is the case in many of these type of establishments. Service of rooms was efficient and to a high standard. Front desk adequate without being obsequious (which was fine by me!).Breakfast was highlight, with food and service excellent. Outdoor bar area pleasant, with high cost of drinks offset by well-prepared and presented quality nibbles.Note. If you are in any way claustrophobic, you may wish to request a lower floor room as the lifts are no bigger than upended coffins!A perfectly pleasant stay.

<Content>nice hotel, poor service Standard rooms are very small but much less stuffy than it's standard in Italy; room cleaning could be better; nice breakfast with quality products; sushi restaurant has good menu. Don't expect much in terms of service, as the restaurant staff is as unprofessional as they come and the concierge's main concern at our departure was whether there was anything he might have forgotten to bill, not the happiness of his guests or the arrangement of the taxi transfer. It's a good deal if you're after a central location (it's a few meters from the ponte vecchio) and don't expect much besides a good bed  breakfast.

<Content>Great location, great hotel. We spent three days in the hotel while exploring Florence. The location is perfect and is near numerous restaurants, attractions and shopping. The staff was incredibly helpful in recommending restaurants. We were fortunate to have one of the hotel's penthouse suites, which is well worth the extra expense. The views are incredible and it was a great place to read and relax. We plan to stay in this hotel or one of its sister properties on our next trip to Florence.

<Content>Fantastic stay at Gallery Hotel Art I found the Gallery Hotel Art on Trip Advisor and it totally exceeded my expectations. When we arrrived the very friendly hotel staff were very welcoming and helpful. The hotel style and decorating of the rooms are amazing and we were lucky as they upgraded us when we checked in. You can not beat the location central to everything, and the staff booked us some amazing dinners in the local area, plus their lobby bar is excellent as well. You will not be dissapointed if you stay at Gallery Art.

<Content>Magnificient! Probably the nicest and most helpful folks that we met in Italy. Always available and accomodating. Even at 5:30am pre-cafe open, the attendant brought me a cappaccino! Gratis! Rooms have character and are clean. Loved the towel next to the bed at night to step out to along with the slippers. Room opened to the alley so we could see a bell tower and hear the excitement of the streets along with the clopping horses. Location is great, next to the River Arno and Ponte Vecchio. Cocktail hour is fun! Cute outdoor patio area. The lounge is comfortable and the feel is contemporary. Clean is important, value is important and most of all having superior and welcoming customer service is important--ALL this and more! PS Got rain and they offered use of umbrellas! Art is interesting too. Location is perfect. Don't miss sunset at their sister hotel, Continental, across the street. Top floor is an outdoor rooftop bar. Wonderful views!

<Content>Beautiful Boutique Hotel Beautiful Boutique Hotel. Japanese fusion hotel with modern art adorning the walls. Beautiful, modern, stylish and impeccably clean bedrooms and bathrooms. Great attention to detail with slippers and dressing gowns laid out for you every evening. Staff very hepful and friendly with lots of suggestions for restuarants and tips for getting cheap tickets for museums and jumping queues. Thoroughly recommend visiting the hotel bar and sitting outside if weather permits- fab cocktails served with complimentary canapes. It's visted by lots of twenty something Italians- when the locals go there its always a good sign. Wonderfully positioned - just off the ponte vecchio and so it's conveneient for shopping and all the major attractions but set in a little courtyard which is like an oasis of calm in amongst the hustle and bustle of the city. It may not have lots of facilities but you don't need them when you are in a city.The perfect city hotel- cannot recommend it highly enough and will definitely be going back and have recomended it to everyone I know!

<Content>Great position and magical city Hotel was in a great position and was nice and clean, but it is extremely over priced as the rooms are small and dark. However the beauty and charm of Florence fortunately means that you don't have to spend much time in your room.

<Content>Not a great value Like most other boutique hotels, the rooms are uncomfortably small, shelf space for toiletries, etc is virtually non-existent and price/value is low. Their location, however, is fabulous and the staff is super. For our next trip we will book their sister hotel across the street,. The Continentale Lungarno. We've stayed there before and it is unbeatable.

<Content>great hotel in florence I too highly recomment the Gallery Art Hotel.It is in a very quiet little square in Florence but so close to everything you want to see. We had a superior room and it was very comfortable. The bed, linens and pillows are very sumptuous. The bathroom was lovely, not huge but you could move around in it, more so than many others in Italy! The front desk staff were adequate but not great. They were not very helpful in suggesting restaurants, when asked.The buffet breakfast was fine and the staff here were very nice. Would definately recommend and would love to stay again.

<Content>Expensive but worth every cent What a lovely hotel. I arrived after a difficult trip from Milan to the comfort, luxury and top flight airconditioning of the hotel Gallery Art (an essential in the middle of August).In contrast to other Italian hotels I experienced, the staff were consistently delightful and superbly helpful at all times. The location is unsurpassed being right on the Arno and next to the Ponte Vecchio. I unhesitatingly recommend it and will stay nowhere else when I return to Florence.

<Content>Perfect haven for the well healed Perfect location and rooms to die for. This was a real treat in the middle of a beautiful city. We drove in from a farmhouse in the Tuscan hills for a couple of days in Florence. This hotel provided the perfect base for our daily adventures and a perfect santuary for our night-time adventures. Just book it when you are next there. ps - you must go to Moma Gina's for lunch or dinner it was unbeleivable.

<Content>Wonderful service and style We spent 5 nights here for our honeymoon in May. Upon arriving, the upgraded us to a bigger room and made us feel very welcome after a long day of traveling and losing my husband's luggage. The room was beautiful with a big marble bathroom and big windows. The lobby was very stylish and the breakfast room was incredible! Speaking of the which...wonderful breakfasts! We were sad to leave and move on to Rome and the rest of our hotels never measured up. Every employee, including the maids and breakfast servers, were generous, kind and helpful. Also, we loved the location. We will stay here every time we return to Florence!
