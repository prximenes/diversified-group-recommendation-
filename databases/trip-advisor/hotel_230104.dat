<Content>A Poor Experience Never To Be Repeated We make a booking through another AC hotel en route from Germany where we stopped for coffee. we were informed cost for two persons with breakfast was 77euros.We arrived at 1400 no room booked, no problem said receptionist there are plenty of rooms here!After a good day in amsterdam we returned tired and hungry, dinner in their restaurant is very poor, when you do get some service you do not get but the minimum of attention. Hence we gave up trying to get the missing items from our order. Poor food, poor service.Very noisy room, very basic room. We lay straight on to a stained mattress no underblanket! HORRID.Breakfast although there were 4 staff in attendance we eventually sat at a dirty table, no-one came to clean it or offer us cutlery, we helped ourselves from behind the counter. Check- out we were charged 111euros for our room? No explanation except we were given a business room which is n ot advised, front on the hotel next to the noise and it is noisy!!! We were on a leisure trip as explained on arrival no rate given or indeed displayed anywhere behind reception. Watch out !Next letter is to the hotel to ask why!A POOR EXPENSIVE EXPERIENCE NOT TO BE REPEATED.

<Content>Not as bad as it's painted We read the reports and thought it cant be as bad as the Admiral Oostend. It did sound that way so we were pleasently suprised to find the hotel clean dispite a major flood the previous week. Some of the rooms had limited service on the TV due to a lighining strike. We were given such a room but with help from the night porter JONN he put us in a room with 90% service on the TV. The system is due to be checked out this week 25.08.08 so check before you go. The rooms were clean but do need to be upgraded as they are now looking a bit careworn The food both breakfast included and dinner bought was fantastic and service very good. The only problem we had was a group of rowdie guests (not sure where they were from not English) who decided they were going to enjoy themselves and to he-- with all the other guests. Unfortunatly the hotel staff did nothing to stop them. One of them was using the flowers from the tables as a microphone and each time one of his companions took one off him he just got another from another table it was funny the first time!

<Content>Horrible Insight vacation hotel This hotel is horrible for taking luggage to your room. We had to go all the way the end of the hotel to find our room, only to have been given a key that was not working. We had been traveling since 5 am and were exhausted from the pace of Insight vacations. About midnight we heard a commotion outside our window - someone entertaining a giggling lady and at 2:30 am the same couple approached from outside our hotel door giggling and then OPENING our door. I flew out of bed, I had my two teenage daughters with me, and barely slammed the door shut. They had given the key to my room to the guy and his date! I told him we were in the room and he tried AGAIN to open the door, telling me it was his room. Insight Vacations had assigned us this room and our luggage was delivered to the room, When I called the front desk, I was informed that the rooms had been entered in the computer wrong and no one even apologized. I told our tour director from Insight, Raymond and he just laughed and said that was a first for him

<Content>A bit scungy, on a noisy road, and quite far away from the city centre This was the last stop of our tour and what a disappointment it was. The room was quite scungy. I could feel the springs in my bed. The room we had was right next to the road and was very noisy. The curtains didn't block out any light and the shower was pathetic. Breakfast facilities were ok, but other than that, this hotel was nothing to rave about. It was a long way from the centre of town, and the walk to the nearest train station was about 20 minutes. Not worth it.

<Content>It's not what it seems (sadly) It's not an hotel for visitang Amsterdam. We already know it and we took it as a base to travel by car. Even then we've been satsified.It's a very long building. You have to take a long walk to go to some rooms. The rooms aren't specially confortable, although they're very big. The receptionists weren't helpful and seemed to not know some basics of the hotels. There was no do not disturb sign in our room and we asked for it. When they got to know what we were asking they said they'd do something about it. We asked again later and they told us they have said to the room service to leave it there, hanging on the door. We told us to not leave it hanging in the door, because we'd be out all the day. Our fears came true at night when we got back. The sign was hanging in the door and the room wasn't cleaned. The room service thought we were in.Don't even think to eat in the brasserie. Or... yes, do it. It was a complete disaster. We decided to eat there because we were tired and we spent 2 hours there, most of the time waiting. Waiting to be asked, waiting the dinner and... no! Not the note! This was fast. Luckily, as it was a complete disasters, they got wrong in most of the things and our dinner ended being 10 euro cheaper as it was supposed to be. Most of the customers there were really angry.The breakfast buffet was correct.We suggest to change the air-freshener.

<Content>Not bad Stayed here because we were going to a concert at the Amsterdam Arena, which is outside the city, and didn't want to travel back downtown after the show. Room and bathroom were quite large for European standards. Room was very clean. Free parking, which is a huge plus in Amsterdam. It is far from the downtown area but not too difficult to get there as long as you aren't expecting a 5 minute trip. We brought our bikes and biked downtown, which took about an hour each way on some nice paths. The second day, we walked to the metro station (about 10 minutes) and took the metro to Central Station, which took about 30 minutes. Desk staff was helpful with questions. It's not a luxury hotel but if you are looking for something a little outside the city, it's a good choice and a good price for Amsterdam.

<Content>Good for motorists; close to motorway Beware: This hotel is NOT in or near downtown Amsterdam !That being said, I have to state that I have stayed in this hotel a couple of times recently while being on business trips.LOCATION:This 3-storey hotel is conveniently located off the A9-motorway near Gaasperplas and has a big parking lot (though even this one can get quite full at times).About 1 km (0.6 mi) away is the terminus of a Light Rail line which will take you to City Center of Amsterdam.There are no other buildings in the vicinity of the hotel. To visit a restaurant you best have a car available (or get a taxi).ROOMS:... are quite large in size with a roomy bathroom.No real problems with cleanliness sofar. Beds are firm and comfortable.Numerous rooms face the street, but noise is not a problem here.A few rooms have a balcony overlooking a canal.The micro-fridge is always locked and I never cared about it.There is no Wireless-LAN in the rooms and also only the business rooms have a dataport - and this is of the local style only, rather than the usually found outlet for Western-plugs. Trying to find a adaptor for it can be difficult.RESTAURANT:Food in the evening is good (谩 la carte) with the set menu麓s offering the best deals. The restaurant is also frequented by non-hotel guests.Breakfast is a mix of continental and american style with a local touch.Beware: Upon my recent trips, almost every morning there was a tour group of chinese tourists in the hotel: Not every morning the hotel staff was paying attention, that these groups have a seperate area set aside for their breakfast - so it became rather full in the breakfast area.SERVICE:Apart from a single occasion where I got checked-in into a room that appeared to be occupied by a member of hotel staff, I haven`t run into any further problems.As I am a return customer, check-in is accomplished very fast - no more forms to be filled out for me.Upon my last check-out, staff surprised me when they were aware that I would return 3 weeks later ... (another 2 weeks in this hotel for business).COSTS:With a negotiated company rate, this hotel costs only a fraction of the hotels downtown plus parking is free !

<Content>Not even a 2 star hotel Our recent stay in Amsterdam was totaly ruined by our agent booking us at the Tulip Inn Riverside. The entery and lobby and also the dining areas are all OK but.....just walking down the hall will give you the impression that the rooms can't be much better than the hall. The wallpaper is torn off, the carpet needs to be replaced etc. We were first put into a room on the ground floor that had a patio sliding door but it didn't open. The room smelled as if that door had never been open. We asked to be changed and were put into a room with one twin bed and a window that opened about 4 inches. There is no a/c and it got hot and humid when it rained. When we asked about the bed they said they only have twins and would bring in another bed. Oh well. The cab ride into Amsterdam costs about 30 ureos and the train about 3 each and takes one hour. We asked an employee and were told not an area to go out at night...no matter there is no where to go. You are out in the boonies. One evening when we came home there was a notice on the door that the restraunt would be closed for dinner. It was not there when we left in the morning and thank God we ate in the city. The next night was Sunday and when we went to eat the waiter told us the kitchen was closed....Sunday is buffet night but of course no one told anyone. There were other people who had cars so they went elsewhere but we were sort of stuck there. After talking with the Mgr we did get something to eat but not a very happy waiter/chef at the time. I would suggest paying more getting closer to the city and you'll still probably spend less...transportation will be so much less. The hot breakfast that we got included was actually pretty good. The employees are good except for the Mgr who asked us just what we expected for a 3 star and then we found out it is a 2 star.

<Content>nice hotel for groups If you are a group visiting amsterdam for nightlife it is a clean and friendly hotel.The metro is just a 10 minute walk and coming back by cab it is 20 minutes and about 35 euros.The room is spacious and clean. Beds are good and breakfast is excellent!Employees not always friendly and stressed.I would recommend it.

<Content>Terrible Location, Acceptable Service The hotel itself is acceptable. However, the location is terrible. It is certainly not located a stones throw away from anything except perhaps sheep (which you can see out the hotel window). The only way to get to the train station is to walk down a deserted street approximately a mile from the hotel with only an RV trailer on one side, and a wooded park on the other side. This walk takes about 20 minutes, and there is NO other option. Buses do not run down this block, and cab companies will not come only to take you to the train station. Once you get to the train station, it is about a 20 minute ride to Centraal Station. This hotel is not at all centrally located to ANYTHING. The hotel service itself is acceptable, and there is a breakfast served in the morning consisting of eggs, breads, and assorted meats and cheeses. The hotel room itself is clean, as are the hotel grounds. I would never stay there again though, since the location is so terrible and so far and unsafe from the train and bus station.

<Content>Poor location, no air conditioning Stayed one night at this hotel as part of an Insight tour. The hotel is located far away from Amsterdam city centre (taxi fare about 20 Euros each way) and reaching public transportation is not convenient either. The hotel has no air conditioning but there are plenty of mosquitoes since the back of the hotel is essentially farmland (you can see cows from the hotel rooms). Otherwise, fairly standard hotel room.
