<Content>Swish Hotel The Park Hotel is a very swishy hotel, located on the 25th+ floor of the Shiodome Media Tower. The staff are friendly, speak very good english, but not as friendly as in other hotels. We found it fairly rare to be greeted, but the checkin desk is a few metres back from the lobby, so it wasnt so bad. They have a nice lounge and sometimes music played by a band or quartet. It has a fantastic view of the Tokyo Tower behind the counter. The rooms are big, with comfortable beds and pillows, in-room internet for free (although it is a little confusing reding the instructions) and a great view of Tokyo. It is two stops out of Tokyo station, and one stop to Ginza. The mall below the hotel and joined to the shinbashi station has a few boutique stores, walkways joining to the other shiodome towers (there is like 5 of them) and mini-marts. There is a subway station around the corner from the hotel, next to the subway restaurant, just to confuse. It is also about a 5 minute walk from the Tokyo Central Pokemon Centre, a favourite for young and old alike. This is round the corner from the World Trade Centre, a great place to get views of Tokyo and Tokyo Bay and the Tower.There are a few restaurants in the hotel, we didnt have anything from them, we found the Pedi Shiodome around the corner is the best tower, with lots of places to eat at reasonable prices. Being christmas, there was fake snow in the mall underneath the towers, a christmas show (with prizes) for the kids, carols and differnet events each day. Which was nice.It was nice ot be only a few stops from Tokyo but its a decent 20-30 minute JR ride (all stops) to shinjuku and harajuku from shinbashi.

<Content>Good but not fantastic Stayed at the Park Hotel Tokyo for 5 nights.First impression was good as the lobby is really beautiful with a kind of indoor courtyard where you could see all the floors.On the left you have the lounge and breakfast area, and restaurants on each side. Behind the reception you could see the Tokyo Tower, a great view of Tokyo, and, on a clear day, Mt Fuji (really fascinating).The hotel occupies about nine floors of the Shiodome Media Tower, on the 25th floor and above.The disappointment came from the room, really small and average with some kind of Ikea furniture with an even smaller and very neutral bathroom. The other minor problem was the noise from the train and metro 30 floors below (my room was not on the best side of the hotel).Breakfast was excellent with great choices.The location is convenient as Shimbashi and Shiodome metro stations are only a few minutes walking, very easy to explore Tokyo.The staff was very pleasant and helpful.Overall it's a good and convenient hotel with decent prices (especially for Tokyo) but my room was really too average and small.

<Content>Fantastic! We stayed at this hotel for our honeymoon, it is great considering the prices of Tokyo and the space you get for any room.It is close to the undergroung station and within the business district. The hotel amenities are great and the service of its staff never let us down.We would stay here anytime when we go back to Tokyo.

<Content>Top notch spot in Tokyo (at a very reasonable price) Tokyo's best kept secret. This hotel was not listed in any of my guide books but I was totally impressed. It was the classic Lost in Translation experience I was looking for, but for about 1/3 of the price of the Park Hyatt (and in a much better location than far western Shinjuku where the Park Hyatt is). Shimbashi station is only a 4 block walk from this hotel. Ginza is a 6 block walk. Tsukiji fish market is an easy 10 minute walk... And if you don't want to walk anywhere, the wildly futuristic Shiodome complex where the hotel is situated has plenty of good restaurants and bars. All in all, the Park Hotel took very good care of us and we were sad to leave after 5 nights.

<Content>Location + peace  We arrived at the hotel around 7pm and were extremely tired from our long flight in from Seattle. The hotel suggested taking the Limousine Bus from the Airport and that worked out marvelously. It cost about $30.00 US for each of us and it took us to the door step of the hotel. I must mention it was extremely easy to find the Limo place inside the Airport and they were super friendly. Once we arrived a guy from the hotel greeted us and took us up to the lobby. As soon as we looked out the window we saw nothing but the most beautiful view of Tokyo Tower. It only took about 5 minutes to check and we headed to our room right away. Everything was super clean inside the room. They even provide you with the little things you tend to leave behind like tooth brush, q-tips and nail filer.The hotel is located right above a major train station (Shimbashi) and has tons of stores and restaurants within the station. From the hotel you can access the underground station by elevator which is wonderful. The places you can find down there are MacDonald鈥檚, AMPM, Starbucks, a book store, and many more restaurants. Once you arrive within the station terminal you can take a train pretty much any where you need to. From Shimbashi station we took one train to, Shibuya, Harajuku, Akihabara, Ueno Park, and Yokohama just to name a few. Take the train, its so much fun and so cheap plus to hotel will provide you with a map of the rail way and tell you which train to catch.I must say everyone in the hotel was more than helpful. They all spoke English if that is important to you and went out of there way to make sure we new how to get to the places we needed to go. Bravo Park Hotel Tokyo!!!Going to Tokyo for the first time was amazing and staying in this hotel just made it even better.

<Content>Top Notch base in Tokyo Stayed here on the way to Australia earlier this year for three days, booked it totally on the strength of reviews on this site and was not let down. Got the Narita Express to Tokyo Station and a taxi from there. Until you have had time to explore the area I would take this approach to the hotel. Underground there is a warren of subway walkways and it can be a little disorientating after a 12 hour flight. It is much simpler to just grab a cab and roll up to the front door. I loved the lobby and reception desk. It was a beautiful day and the backdrop of the Tower and cityscape of Tokyo was a fantastic welcome to the hotel and to the city. Staff are not falling over themselves to make you feel at home, but neither are they rude. Generally I found the service in Tokyo awesome, they are a class apart, very very polite and very friendly.I had emailed in advance to request a room with a view and an early check-in, they duly obliged, which I was most appreciative of as it was 9 am. The hotel is in a great location and is well appointed. We got a great rate and after shopping around I don't really see where you would get better value in the city. The subway system is really easy to get the hang of, surprisingly, as I had been led to believe it was indecipherable. I loved Tokyo, every minute of it and will be returning for longer as soon as i possibly can. The Park Hotel is a great hotel to base yourself in for a great price. Highly recommend it

<Content>Marvellous hotel This is a great place to stay. Be sure to book a corner room for the view. The rooms are comfortable and well laid out. Before you go do a little backround research into the subway system and print off a map in English. It will save you a lot of trouble. Great staff.

<Content>Small and efficient We stayed here from November 1-3, 2008. I have to admit we were a little confused when we arrived at the office building and then we figured out we had to go up to the 25th floor. We arrrive late in the day. Once we arrived on the 25th floor, the view was incredible and there was a pianist and bass player playing jazz music. It was so relaxing. The staff immediately greeted us and took our bags. Everyone seem so respectful and helpful. When we arrive in our rooms, the person who helped with bags mentioned no tips are accepted by the staff. They have a free busines center with two computers for anyone to use. The breakfast was good and nice variety to choose from. The rooms are small but efficient. The toilet is programmable and this is common in Tokyo. Overall, this hotel was a good value and convenient to the subway, restautants, and shops.

<Content>Useless concierge We were in Tokyo for five nights and we spent two of them at The Park Hotel. Lobby and views are impressive but the rooms are a dissapointment - they reminded us of a slightly upgraded Travel Lodge. You can also find same cost hotels in much better locations (with an atmosphere which this hotel has none of). The concierge was also useless. We tried to book a trip to Hakone and arrange a few restaurant bookings for the following nights, but she could only tell us what we already knew from leaflets and could never seem to get through to the restaurants, which we ended up booking ourselves. Luckily my husband has been to Tokyo before so has a little knowledge of the different areas and the langauge but, if we had been first time visitors, we wouldn't have been able to rely on this hotel for helpful advice.

<Content>Great, quiet, safe, clean, convenient stay in the city! We really enjoyed the stay at the hotel. The prices were reasonable for Tokyo, the location was quiet and convenient. It is located in the business district which is very quiet in the evenings and weekends which we really appreciated, especially after a day's walk in busy Shinjuku or Ginza. Great place to rest! The room was really comfortable and nice, no complaints at all. For the taxi ride, be sure to state Shiodome, Park Hoteru, Media Tower, next to Conrad if they have no ideas. There are many restaurants within a short underground walk to the Caretta Shiodome. Check the Caretta Shiodome's website for a list of restaurants! Starbucks in the Conrad's basement which is next door. Train and subway stations are within a short walk underground. There is even a supermarket right above the train station on ground level where you can buy quick meals as well. Can walk to Ginza or take the subway. The subway line right outside the hotel on the second level takes you on a scenic ride to Odaiba where there's a great indoor hot springs, Oedo Onsen Monogatari. Also, a nice walk to the Tsukiji market for great sushi breakfast when you are jet lagged. Left the hotel by airport shuttle booked through the hotel which was easy. A bonus was there were different all-girls bands playing every night we were there!Will definitely stay there again without question if we ever go back to Tokyo!

<Content>Sleek hotel Very modern and elegant hotel situated in Shiodome which has great transport links. We stayed there for 4 nights as part of our honeymoon and found the hotel a great place to stay. Getting there was fine - we just took the Friendly Airport Limousine service which took just under an hour and a half (traffic), and which stops at the hotel as one of its stops. Checking in was smooth - our travel agent had organised a bottle of champagne for our arrival. Our room was on the 33rd floor and had amazing views of Tokyo Tower and all of the surrounding area. The bed was comfy, everything was clean. We had the infamous japanese toilet which comes with bidet and shower. The anti-fog mirror was great - I'd never seen one before! We didn't have any meals in the hotel restaurant, but there are quite a few restaurants in the surrounding areas. Overall, staying at the Park Hotel was a really good experience - the building is so modern and sleek, the staff were extremely helpful and friendly, and the views were breathtaking.

<Content>Excellent hotel! Fantastic hotel in the Shiodome district! Great location (only 2 stops from Tokyo station, and right near the fashionable area of Ginza). We can also walk to the fish markets in about 10 minutes. The views are amazing (reception is on the 25th floor) and the hotel is stylish and spotless. We stayed there on two occasions (once on the 31st floor and then on the 33rd floor), so the view you get of Tokyo is breathtaking and worth every penny you spend. The rooms are comfortable, bright and well proportioned, so we were very happy with our decision to stay there. The hotel just celebrated its 5th birthday so it's thoroughly modern and sleek. In addition to all of this, the service was excellent too, so we would totally recommend the Park Hotel both for business and leisure travelers - we will certainly return next time we are in Tokyo.

<Content>Stylish, quiet, elegant but not pompous - recommended Stayed here for three nights in September as part of a longer trip. The hotel is located in a business district but is close to the subway station and not far by subway from entertainment areas - we never felt we were too far away from the action!Note - my taxi driver took me to the similarly named Royal Park Hotel, which is across the street, by mistake. The Park Hotel is located on the upper floors of the Shiodome Media Tower, in the same building as the Kyodo News agency, so you may wish to ask for that if traveling by taxi.As previous reviewers have mentioned, the hotel is well designed, rooms are reasonably sized for Tokyo, and the view is great since it is on the upper floors of the building. We had a view of the Hamarikyu garden and the Sumida river. Service was excellent, bathroom was nice.The cafe in the lobby is pleasant but in my opinion overpriced (800 JPY for a coffee versus 250 JPY in a cafe). There is also free internet access from a little computer room just off the main reception, with a nice view of Tokyo Tower - only grumble here is that only one of the two terminals allows access to online email services like gmail/hotmail.Overall, one of the best hotels I've stayed at in Tokyo - would definitely return.

<Content>What a vista! This hotel is quite spectacular in many ways. First, its lobby starts on the 25th or so floor; the wall behind the reception area is glass-panelled and you have a first-rate view of Tokyo. Then the stunning view repeats itself once you in your room (don't take the cheapest room category - no good views there). It's the Lost in Translation feeling. On top of that, the lobby's atrium extends for some 10 to 15 floors. Architecturely the place is quite a sight. That being said, the rooms are on the smaller side, as could be expected in Tokyo. But everything is new (the hotel just celebrated its 5th anniversary) and very clean. Moreover, the hotel is centrally located. Lots of restaurants around and a 10 min. walk over to Ginza.

<Content>Perfect for our needs We went to stay there for 5 nights, based on the positive reviews here. We weren't disappointed - its rooms were small but we didn't expect anything else in Tokyo (for the price anyway). Service is as good as any other hotel in Tokyo. My partner is not 100% keen on the location but I thought it was fine - Shiodome had good transport links, and lots of restaurants. The only issue was that we normally shopped in the west side of town (Shinjuku, Shibuya) and this hotel is on the east side. But you can get to those locations within 30 minutes tops. I'll definitely consider staying there again.My only complaint was that there was no gym, but I don't think many hotels in Tokyo actually have one anyway...

<Content>Great Hotel Great Location We stayed on our first 3 days in Tokyo and this hotel is a well suited nice stylish hotel perfect for all your needs.We booked a premium king room. The room was georgious and quite big. However my one complaint about this hotel is NONE of their premium rooms have a view of facing Tokyo tower. Only standard and corner rooms have a tower view (or so I was told , when i enquired) so bear this in mind when booking. You would think premium meant not only larger room but also better views, sadly not so. However the city view from our room was adequate.We had breakfast each morning , expcept on final moring when we had to catch a shinkansen to Hiroshima. The breakfast was ok not huge but satisfying.They have 2 computers and a laptop with internet connection which was free of charge. The lobby is beautiful and nice for a drink or two late at night.The hotel is well connected to the JR and Metro lines. However can be confusing arriving for the first time. I recommend arriving at shiodome metro station , its closer.We also found the family mart on the ground floor of great help.Please email if you would like to know more about hotel e.t.c I am happy to advise from my experience.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great City Service by hotel staff is fantastic eg our bags were out of the boot of the taxi and inside the hotel before I'd had a chance to pay the driver! Also very helpful desk staff for booking taxis etc.The lobby area is a cocktail lounge which has its own jazz band playing most nights, but you really need to get out and get on it elsewhere ... Room spotless, and okay size, with great view out over city. Bathroom something else: heated toilet seat, with all sorts of apparatus! a condensation-proof mirror ... with all your usual 'boutique' bathroom stuff refreshed daily.As stated elsewhere, at the bottom of the building is a small mart where you can get some essentials in eg water. Also tube stops are right there for both subway and Yamanote 'circle' line. Tubes - spotless too - run until about 1 am - worth bearing in mind as taxis are relatively expensive, and can be hard to get late at night, though there are seemingly millions of them about!Oh - if first time there, forget Rappongi - Shibuya and Shinjuku are where it's at. (So only 'improvement' on Park Hotel I can think of is to find a similar quality hotel in those areas.)Time Out Tokyo really good too for info on where to go, but sometimes you just have to take the plunge ie you find a bar is up on the 4th floor, accessible by lift, so you have no idea what it'll be like. But we were only stiffed the once ie charged for food put out for us that we didn't request (thus a 拢15 drink!) ... otherwise really great cool bars, people friendly . Lastly, the food is fanatstic - and not expensive. How? Use your eyes, and eat where the locals go! Drinkswise the beer is London prices ... and Asahi won my taste contest.

<Content>Very well priced for top drawer service... Had 3 great nights at this hotel. Rooms weren't massive but were fine and Tokyo is an exhausting city if you have just 3 days to explore!We ate here on the first night and paid extra for buffet breakfast each day. Was worth it and saved the hassle of finding food outside and set us up for the days. Food was good each time.Staff couldn't do enough for you. Very polite, welcoming and friendly. There was also always some entertainment in the foyet area, be iit a pianist or a jazz band making it a relaxing place to have a couple of beers.Very well priced and great location. Easy to find.

<Content>Great hotel - do not hesitate Stayed at the Park Hotel for two nights, then returned after a night away at Hakone, for another night. Hotel was immaculate. Great views. Fantastic staff who were helpful with great English. Free internet access from the room. Rooms were a reasonable size. We had a twin room, and there was room to have both our suitcases down and open, and still move around comfortably. Room had a bar fridge, table, two chairs, desk and flat screen TV. Good sized bathroom. There was no problem with the hotel holding our main luggage when we left for a night away, and we were recognised and welcomed back on our return the next day. Hotel was walking distance to two train lines - subway and JR lines. Also easy walking distance to the detached gardens, Ginza, and the fish market. Other attractions and locations were easily located via train. Great hotel for a reasonable price. Would highly recommended it.

<Content>Great hotel, great location This hotel is located in the Shiodome Media Tower, from the 25th floor upwards and is an ideal location for exploring Tokyo. The subway is directly connected to the hotel so getting around couldn't be easier.There is a 'Family Mart' convenience store on the ground floor which is ideal for drinks  snacks and there is a 'Subway' sandwich shop just outside the hotel on the 3rd floor.The staff couldn't be more helpful and polite. The rooms are clean, spacious and very modern.Internet access in the lobby is free, best time to access this is midday as it can be busy at other times.The centre of Ginza district is just 15-20 walk away with it's high class boutiques and jewellery shops, everything else is best traveled to by the subway or other rail links.The weather was very hot and sticky, but there is a pleasant breeze.Western mobile phones will not work in Tokyo, apparently there are hire facilities but we chose not to bother.Don't hesitate in booking this hotel, you won't be disappointed.

<Content>Good choice in Tokyo I've stayed at the Park more than once and think it's an excellent choice - good rooms, location and value - and deserving of its Tripadvisor rating.Positives -Reception, restaurants and rooms have excellent views (starting on the 25th floor), and are also stylishly well equipped and furnished.Nice bar and restaurants.Really good value for Tokyo, in comparison with other hotels of a similar standard.Free use of internet etc.Negatives - Anyone who has been to Tokyo knows that the city is so expansive that there is no such thing as a perfect location. However - if you're going to be spending most of your time in Shinjuku/Shibuya this may not be the ideal choice.24 hour facilties - would be good to offer a lounge with 24 hour food etc - especially for business travellers.

<Content>Great Location - easy access to subway - helpful staff Booked this hotel after seeing the great reviews on Trip advisor. It was a great hotel. The best feature was the subway stop below the hotel (Shiodome). This made it so easy to get everywhere in Tokyo. The room price was so reasonable too for Tokyo! The rooms were a bit small, but I was expecting that for Tokyo. The bathrooms were on the smallish side too and did have a kind of funny, musty smell, perhaps from a lack of ventilation. We just kept the bathroom door shut and it didn't bother us. Even with that, the room was clean and had newer furniture and free hi-speed internet (not wireless though). The location was great, we walked to Ginza and there was a great park across the street. The Tsujiki Fish Market is only one stop away on the subway line! It was nice staying in this area because there were less people around than other areas of Tokyo (like Ginza/Shibuya/Shinjuku). So if we wanted to go shopping or to restaurants, we'd hop on the subway and go to those busier areas, but when we got off the subway at our stop, Shiodome, it was quiet and not crowded at all and more peaceful.

<Content>Lost in Translation! A Good choice A good choice - location is handy and safe but in a business area - don't let it put you off though. You are so handy for the excellent subway system. Rooms are compact but ultra clean. The toilets are something else!! We had a super view of Tokyo Tower and Mnt. Fuji - simply stunning. I would stay here again.

<Content>Excellent service, beautiful view Customer service in Japan is legendary and rightly so. The Park Hotel lives up to these high standards with excellent, friendly service. As a bonus, the staff all seemed to speak very good English. The ten-story atrium is beautiful. Rooms are on the small side but modern, bright, quiet, and (most importantly) immaculate. We had a lovely view of the bay and Hama-rikyu gardens. Loved it!

<Content>Just what we needed This was my husband and my first trip to Japan - on our own. Staying at this hotel was a perfect base. Our day tours picked us up from the lobby plus access to the JR, subway and every train line you can image. (note: it took me several days to learn the system and once we got it it's super easy and convenient.)Location:Near upscale Ginza, location was a good start to get around Tokyo and beyond (like we did to Kamakura) I agree with other reviewers - nightlife is hard to find - need to go to Shibuya or Shinjuku for that. Consider the location a business location but the peace is welcomed after long days.Room:Room was clean but a bit smaller than our Kyoto hotel room. But after long hot days, the room was perfect. The bed was super comfy and bathroom was great. I already miss the heated toilets.Service:They staff was super pleasant and excellent. Before arriving, the concierge arrange getting tickets for a Tokyo Giants game for us. I can not complain as for their service was the best I have experienced and I travel a lot to know.Overall: You can not go wrong with this choice. If I return (crossing my fingers I do) I would return.

<Content>Beautiul Views, Good Service This hotel was a great find. The rooms were a reasonably spacious given Tokyo standards, and I would definitely stay here again. Ginza is a short walk away, and the hotel is near Shimbashi station (a major train hub).However, I would caution you if you are seeking nightlife. The hotel is tucked in amongst a cluster of office buildings so you won't find bars and clubs right outside your door. You'll either have to walk to Ginza or grab a train.

<Content>Excellent Hotel Myself and my wife Suzanne stayed here for 4 nights as part of our honeymoon.On our arrival we received a bottle of champagne,as a little honeymoon present ,which was nice.We were looking for a nice,clean and prices that did'nt break the bank.We really liked this hotel.The hotel does have a business feel to it which some might not like.The rooms are tiny,I mean really small but clean and modern.I had never stayed in Japan before,so maybe smaller rooms are the norm.The room had fabulous views of the city and of the Tokyo Tower which were spectacular.I must mention the toiletries which were really nice.The hotel is located close to a lovely park and to the subway.The staff were all really helpful and polite.We only stayed for a short stay but we will be back and we will stay in this hotel again.

<Content>Perfect Choice Stayed four nights here in June. This hotel is exceptional - beautifully designed and with a fantastic, relaxing atmosphere. Everything was so calm and tranquil. Stunning views of Tokyo Tower from our bedroom - 2808. The hotel is spotless and immaculately cleaned. Staff could not be friendlier. Would not fault one thing and hope to go back soon. Really miss it now!

<Content>Very Stylish and very cool We stayed at the Park for three nights and loved it. The hotel is so stylish the lobby area and bars are great places to relax and chill out. As the hotel starts on the 25th floor views are amazing from all areas (even the internet room has mindblowing views)The hotel has two Michelan star restaurants, we dinned at the Japanese one and the food was amazing.Our room was a touch small but the bed and covers amazing, like sleeping in silk. The room had all modern features and teh view was amazingThe hotel has very easy access to a subway station that takes you to all parts of the city and is walking distance from Ginza A great hotel and at the price 拢100 night amazing value in tokyo

<Content>Great Location We recently stayed at this hotel having seen it recommended on Tripadvisor. As we only had a couple of days to explore Tokyo we thought this was a great location - very accessible from airport and hotel situated adjacent to an underground station. We could get everywhere pretty quickly from here, especially the superb fish market (Tsukiji) and Hama Rikyu Teien garden.The hotel is in the Central Busness District area so staff are super efficient with great English. Hotel and room were spotless with amazing views.Good bar - great evening views - amazing Barmen who does impressive ice carvings.

<Content>Convenient Location We recently returned from our trip to Japan. We stayed in Tokyo for 3 nights at this hotel. Hotel was nice but the hallway to our room smelled a little musty. It might have been from the lack of air conditioning in the halls. there was air condition in our room and the room was very clean. the staff was helpful but we did have some language barriers. it was conveniently located to the subway and the fish market which was great. we went to the fish market for breakfast and at first i thought it was going to be gross eating fish but it turned out to be so good and of course fresh.

<Content>Good value We felt that the Park was a great bargain for Tokyo. Though the rooms are not the fanciest, they are very comfortable and offer exactly what we needed. It was the quietest hotel we have ever stayed in, we were in a room right next to the elevator and did not hear a thing (and I'm very sensitive to noise). We had a laptop and they did not charge for internet access, and there is a cable in your room. Everyone was very helpful, welcoming and most people spoke English. One employee even ran down the street to hail a cab for us (we couldn't envision that ever happening at any US hotel we'd ever stayed in). Subways are very easy to get to and there are a lot of eating options in the area ... cafes, restaurants, even Starbucks. There's free coffee and tea stuff in the room too. (The only problem we had had nothing really to do with the hotel itself - a rude cab driver took us to its sister hotel, the Royal Park, and insisted we were at the right hotel despite the fact that we had a little card from the hotel with the name and a map. Just beware that could be confusing.)

<Content>My Favorite Hotel in Tokyo My current favorite hotel in Tokyo. I've had the pleasure of three visits so far. There is no better balance of value for cost out there. If the location suits your needs, then you must stay here. Having said that, I can't comment on the restaurants or bar, as I rarely use those facilities in the hotels that I stay in. The plus side is that there is plenty of choice within a minutes walk. Truly one of the most comfortable beds I have slept in, in a hotel. Great selection of linens and attention to such seemingly minor, but important details are found throughout.

<Content>Close to Perfect Hotel We stayed for 2 nights in Mid-May 2008. From the Narita airport, we took the Airport Express (about 40 minutes) and then changed to the metro which took us to Shimbashi station. It was only a few minutes walk (completely underground) to our hotel. The hotel staff was indescribably professional. The entire hotel, including our room, was spotless. The decor was very modern. The room was on the small side, but it was what I expected in Tokyo! The bathroom had all new appliances and was very clean. The toilet even had a bidet. We were able to access the subway that was just below the building, so we were able to go everywhere in Japan for just a few bucks on the metro. In the evening, we had drinks in the lobby in cushy modern seats while listening to a live jazz band. My only complaint was the breakfast in the hotel. Our stay did not include breakfast, so we paid for it out of pocket at $25USD per person, and it wasn't very good at all. Not much of a selection at too high of a price. However, we discovered that at the building across from the Shiodome Media Tower (which is where the hotel is), there is another building that has tons of affordable restaurantes for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Finally, on our last day, the hotel arranged an Airport Limo to take us to Narita. It costs $30USD per person, but it was worth the convenience. All in all, I would definitely recommend this hotel, and I plan to stay there again on my next trip to Tokyo.

<Content>Outstanding Booked via Designs Hotel site for the best rate at the time. Agree with most other reviewers...great hotel and fantastic value for money in a city where hotels are expensive. Very minor points: They could use another computer or two for internet access as the supply frequently outstripped the demand.Initially, the hotel can be a bit tricky to find. If you have a couple of large bags you may wish to consider either the airport express bus direct to the hotel, or take a cab from Tokyo station. Loved the Park and would definately recommend to friends and would come back again.

<Content>Brilliant Hotel I stayed 3 nights in the Park Hotel from 11th-14th April 2008. The hotel is beautiful and in such a great area of Tokyo. I was blown away by the beauty of Tokyo and the friendliness of the locals. It truely is a city I want to go back again soon as it has so much to offer. More about the hotel.ROOMS:The rooms are small but very functional. The bed was very comfortable and my view of the city through the small window was lovely. The plasma tv, space age toilet give the hotel a very new and clean look.STAFF:Staff are friendly but not the friendliest i've met along my travels. Considering that I found Tokyo people to be the nicest I have ever run into this is only a small let down for the hotel.FACILITIES:The facilities are second to none in the hotel. The free internet room beside reception to the surrounding area where restaurants, shops etc very accessible.It takes a while to get used to the 'madness' of Tokyo but just embrace it. The hotel is situated in the Shiodome area which is the 'Docklands' area of most cities where new high rise skyscappers sit in a very clean, safe area near the bay. I loved it and felt totally safe and believe me that includes being lost at 7am in the morning after too many beers. The locals go out of their way to help. I got lost so many times and acts of kindness will never be forgotten.I thing to remember if you are an international traveller. My visa card would only let me withdraw cash at Citibank ATM machines. It was a bit fustrating as there are only about 10 in the city. The 7-11 store ATM's did not work for me. So please have some cash with you before you go and then use the Citibank ATM's if all others fail.Overall Tokyo has a big heart and the nightlife and food and people all add up to an experience i wasn't expecting. wow!!!!

<Content>Peaceful, useful Park Hotel The Park is not the swankiest hotel in Tokyo, but it's much nicer than you'd expect from the bargain rates. The location is good, near a metro station; the room was large enough, if not enormous; the views are spectacular, or can be (a friend's room looked down on the Ginza, while mine had a view of another high-rise); and all rooms are equipped with high-speed internet. Just the thing to check in with loved ones at home.

<Content>great central location Stayed at the Park Hotel for 5 nights. Great location, central to everything. Choose hotel from reviews and primarily for location which was great. Railway subway adjoins the hotel with clear directions from the terminal. About a 5-10 minute walk under the subwy. Once you are familar with signage its an easy walk to the hotel lobby. Very clean hotel, fairly new, contemporary small rooms but adequate. Staff were always friendly and accomodating. English speaking staff memebers which was nice as many Japanese do not attempt to speak English.Would hightly recommend hotel to tourists wanting someone central to all attractions and the railway system (which is a must use in Japan).

<Author>HelloThereAgain
<Content>Works Well For Comfort, Convenience and (for now) Price We write briefly to add our support for the Park Hotel Tokyo and mention a few other notables. We found the location of the hotel to be perfect for our tastes, first as a designated stop on the limousine bus line from Narita airport, then as a point of departure to the Ginza district, the Shiodome subway station, and the JR Train station.(But be forewarned and make no mistake about it: maps and guides and compass and preparation notwithstanding, you will inevitably, as our guidebook stated, get lost at some point....Have no fear for you will eventually, given enough time and practice, figure out the lay of the land in Tokyo and, failing that, come to rely on the good nature of a Japanese stranger for directions)The area surrounding the hotel is chock full of restaurants, shopping areas, and one of the neatest, large scale, colorful, imaginative, acrobatic, musical, clock towers we have ever observed (see the third floor promenade). The check-in desk, it bears repeating, is backlit by an amazing view of the Tokyo skyline. The lobby is ample with soaring sight lines. We had a city view room with a queen bed. The 'snug' size of the room set us slightly aback at first but we adapted; ditto the bath and shower. Housekeeping is dependable. We were generally comfortable. The breakfast buffet is a real treat with a nice selection of items, set up along one of the back walls in the lobby. Guests sit informally in oversized chairs at low set tables. The cost is about $25/pp at current conversion rates. Service at the hotel is, in the seeming Asian tradition, attentive, polite, endearing. Our room rate, roughly 17,500 yen for an 'early bird' booking, is terrific. We hope the hotel is able to maintain such an attractive rate. We would surely like to return.

<Content>Fine hotel, not blown away though Based on review from Trip Advisor, we booked 4 nights in the Park Hotel for April. The view from the room was great. Free internet was nice. The room was a bit smaller than I would have expected but it worked.Unfortunately the metro station in the building isn't a very useful one. It's on the Oedo line which doesn't go to many touristy places and it's not a quick connection to get to a more useful line. 95% of the time we ended up walking to Shimbashi station which is on the Ginza line. It's about a 10 minute walk from the hotel but involves using highway overpasses and crosswalks that go across 6 lane roads which can take a while. If you're caught in the rain, it's not a fun walk. Plus getting into the hotel isn't always straight forward. The raised entrance from the highway overpass and JR station closes at night which can be annoying. Also you have to take two elevators to get to your hotel room. One to get to the lobby on the 25th floor, and another to your room. Not really something you look forward to after a really long day; and the elevators are really slow.The restaurants in the hotel were grossly expensive, but this isn't a deficiency unique to this hotel.If you take an elevator from the lobby to the basement level you can get right to the Shidome metro station on the Oedo line. In the basement there are also a bunch of smaller restaurants that are reasonably priced. You can walk past them and outside to get to a FamilyMart (ubiquitous convenience store in Japan).All in all I'd say the hotel itself was fine. Really nothing special. Next time I'm in Tokyo I'll be looking for something with a better location; both for walking and for using the metro.

<Content>Lovely hotel but cold and unfriendly staff First - the good points...The view from the rooms is STUNNING! on many occasions, we would get breakfast from a nearby cafe and bring it back to the room so we could sit by the window and just look out at the buildings and trains below.It really isn't a huge problem to find this hotel - I took a taxi from Tokyo station the first time and it was only a short drive and a reasonable price - make sure you tell the taxi driver that it's the park hotel in shiodome media tower, as the royal park hotel in shiodome tower is opposite! confusing?! nah!The location is fine... it is a bit of a walk to Shimbashi station which is the station we used the most but it wasn't too bad.Bad points - I totally agree with some of the reviews saying that the hotel staff are a little 'off' and cold. I have been living and working in Japan for the last 7 months and have been stunned every day with the kindness of the Japanese so I was so surprised to see such a change when I entered this hotel. I think they do probably give a bit more attention to people wearing suits rather than jeans and trainers which seems unfair as we're all paying a lot of money to stay there!Also, I found the room a little bit tired... lots of marks on the wall and a few stains on the carpet. I know this is bound to happen but it just surprised me when the lobby area is so stunning and immaculate.Overall, this is a good hotel to stay in - I would definitely recommend this for the view but if i were to go to Tokyo again, I would find a new hotel.Enjoy the craziness of Tokyo - Gan batte!

<Content>Excellent hotel Chose this hotel from TA reviews and it was excellent. Decor is modern and stylish and service impeccable. We were upgraded on arrival to a top floor room with views over Tokyo Tower, which on a clear morning gave us a view of Mount Fuji.Very good location as part of the Shiodome Complex with its access to 3 stations, plenty of restaurants and coffee shops to suit all tastes and shops to cover essentials.Good area to be in as it's close to Ginza  the Imperial Palace, and away from the frenetic areas like Shinjuku.We'd been warned that it wasn't easy to find if you arrived by train so downloaded a map from the hotel website and the instructions couldn't have been clearer.Very easy to get to from Narita airport. The JR line stops at Shimbashi which is part of the Shiodome complex, or there's several other easy options. Plus if you look puzzled Japanese people always ask if they can help.

<Content>Good value Very nice hotel. Relatively small room, but adequate. Very comfortable. Very nice and helpful staff.A bit odd of an entrance to the lobby: you must go to the 21st floor; rooms are floors above.Location is plus and minus. It is relatively close to a main JR station (Shimbashi); approximately 15 minute walk. However, it is in a pretty isolated part of town. The closest attraction is the Ginza district (30 minute walk) and the fish market (30 minute walk).The Shiodome Complex, where the hotel is located, has several restaurants. Be warned though that the underground tunnels are a maze, and it is easy to get lost.Advice: make sure you get a JR Rail Pass.

<Content>Fantastic faultless Hotel Can't praise this hotel highly enough. It was extremely clean, we had 2 superb large rooms with dizzying views towards the Ginza and lots of windows. Didn't hear any noise at all. Bathrooms were fab and the toilet was fun! There is a button on the TV remote to remove the Japanese voice-over on BBC and CNN. Breakfasts offered a wide choice including lots of fruit which you don't see much of elsewhere in Tokyo. Croissants, toast, hot choices ,cereals etc. Or you can choose a Japanese breakfast if you prefer. The staff were great and lots of English was spoken.There is a room off the lobby where you can use the computer for free if you haven't brought a laptop. This was useful for checking out restaurants and opening hours of places we wanted to visit. The hotel is superbly connected via an underground maze to at least 2 subway stations and is 10 mins walk to the Ginza, much of which you can do underground if it's raining. We would highly recommend 3 visits from this hotel:1. Walk to the local Hamarikyu Gardens and experience the tea ceremony there.2.Take the Yurikamome Line from Shiodome station to Fune-no-Kagakukan and visit the Museum of Emerging Science (aka Miraikan) to see the robots in action! Watching the humanoid ASIMO run across the room in front of us was quite extraordinary. And brilliant for our teenage kids who were enthralled.3. Walk to the Tsujiku Fish market - it's very wet and fishy underfoot so wear the right shoes!Can't wait to go back to Tokyo and will definitely stay in this hotel.

<Content>Fabulous hotel - highly recommended My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in March 2008 and we were very impressed. The hotel was easy to find from Shimbashi station thanks to the detailed map on the hotel's website. The hotel foyer has gobsmacking views of Tokyo and the staff were friendly and efficient. The room was spacious by Japanese standards and was spotlessly clean and comfortable. They even provided yakutas to sleep in which was a lovely touch. While Shiodome is not the most exciting neighbourhood in Tokyo, the fact that the underground and JR stations are downstairs means that it is very easy to get around. Another advantage of staying here is that the Tsukuji fish market is a 20 minute walk away - definitely worth getting up at 4.30am to see this!

<Content>Nice, but Overrated The hotel was very nice, but a bit overrated from previous reviews. The location is pretty good. We walked to Ginza and train lines were around the corner. Staff was pretty nice, but not spectacular. I know it is Tokyo, but I found the room a bit small. The courtyard concept is pretty cool, but one would think they would reduce the size of empty space in the center and make the rooms a bit bigger. A highlight: amenities in the bathrooms are absolute top notch. Rate was very good.

<Content>Wonderful hotel with excellent staff! My friend and I stayed at the Park Hotel for 4 nights in January, and it was fantastic! LOCATIONThe hotel is right near the Shimbashi station. Not really knowing how to get there from the NRT airport, we took a bus, but it took an hour and a half due to the number of stops along the way. You can buy a Japan Rail Pass prior (this is good if you are traveling to other cities in Japan. We used it to travel from Tokyo to Kyoto -- you purchase the exchange order outside of Japan, and then get the Rail Pass once you arrive). With the rail pass, you can take the metro to Tokyo Station, and a cab to the hotel from Tokyo Station is not that expensive (by tokyo standards). The hotel is also walking distance to Ginza and the Tsukiji fish market. Underneath the hotel area is a mall or restaurant area -- we discovered it on our last night, and it had a lot of restaurants. perfect if you are getting in around the evening and don't want to travel far for dinner. Can't remember exactly where or what it was called b/c it's been a few months, but the hotel staff should know.STAFFextremely friendly and VERY helpful. The Japanese are normally very polite and courteous, but I thought the concierge was exceptional. They helped us get tickets to a Sumo tournament (we were lucky enough to be staying in Tokyo at the time of the tournament), and assisted us with directions everywhere else.HOTEL ROOMSWe stayed in Tokyo for 3 nights, went to Kyoto for 2 nights, and then came back to the Park Hotel for our last night. Japan hotel rooms are usually very small, and it is the same here, but that is normal. On our last night, the hotel room was a bit bigger and nicer (i posted pics).Great experience overall, would definitely recommend!

<Content>Brilliant for the money Fantastic hotel, especially if you book very early and get the early bird price. We got a great room with a great view for about 拢80 per night. Stayed for 4 nights and it was a great base for seeing Tokyo. Walking distance to Shimbashi station and the JR circle line around Tokyo which takes you everywher you want to go, and its free if you have a JR Train Pass. Good location for shopping in Ginza and nightlife in Shimbashi. Also walking distance to the famouse fish markets.Easiest way to get here is the Narita express to Tokyu station and then a cab (拢6), takes you to the door, so you dont have to navigate the rather confusing overhead, underhead, through your head walkways, which you eventually get the hang of, 5 minutes befoire you leave Tokyo.Only drawback, was the bar life, restaurants etc was a little dead in the hotel as everyone goes out.Would definately stay again.

<Content>Nothing but the best I've stayed twice at the Park Hotel Tokyo. The first time was ver recent to their oppening and I had a hard time with the taxi driver finding the place, but the second time (one year later) was smooth and with no problem (the first time I was there, they were still building the roads to get to the hotel, buit now everything is fine).What I like the most about this hotel, that I always recommed and I'm happy to see that jumped up to the second best choice in Tokyo for TripAdvisor users is):1) The location: is perfect, because at the ground floor you'll find the metro connections to almost anywhere worth a look in Tokyo2) The friendliest staff you can get (I've only been to another hotel in Tokyo besides this one, but the staff is just a 10/10.3) The shows at night. Once you get to the hotel at night you'll find some show (piano playing, a chorus line, some music) at the ground floor. You can have a drink while watching the free show, and that's just perfect4) The japanese restaurant at the groun floor is as best as it gets. Please, try the shasimi if you're into raw fish because it's excellent.5) The place itself is awesome. The lobby is somewhere around the 40th level, and the look up to the hotel from the looby is breathtaking.6) The spa might not seem big but will do the job just prefectlyOn the downside is the size of the rooms that are quite small but who care when you plan to stay in them just to sleep. Besides, the views are just amazing.So, in all, it's the perfect hote in Tokyo for the price. I've been to another, more focussed on the western taste and didn't meet the expectation as well as the Park.

<Content>excellent hotel - and reasonably priced for Tokyo My girlfriend and I stayed in the Park Hotel for 8 nights in mid-March, and I don't have any complaints. From the efficient way they helped us check-in as soon as we arrived from the airport bus, to the smooth check-out, everything was well done. The reception desk staff were faultlessly polite, and spoke better English than at Cerulean Tower, the room was a decent size, and very nicely appointed, and the bathroom was really nice. The shower in particular was awesome. Our view was of Shimbashi Train station, which was ok, but not really inspiring in any way, but that's ok. Basically the only possible problem I can imagine anyone having with the Park Hotel is it's location. Shimbashi itself is not the most exciting area. But it is on the Yamanote line, so it's really easy to get anywhere in Tokyo from here within 30 mins. Personally I preferred Cerulean Tower, but has to have the caveat that Cerulean is about twice the price. Booking the Park Hotel guarantees a comfortable, well-connected, impressive hotel, and at a very reasonable rate. Highly recommended.

<Content>Top quality hotel We spend three nights here en-route to Australia. It's too far away for a one night stop-over, probably close to 2 hours door-to-door from hotel to Narita Airport. Anyway the hotel, the hotel is great. It is spotless and modern. The decor is stylish and has the feel of a top class hotel. The staff (although lacking charisma) were extremely helpful. It is a short stroll (12 mins once you figure it out) to Shimbashi station, the Shiodome station that is closer to the hotel doesn't really connect well with the main areas of interest. So the location is fine because there ain't a 'centre' in Tokyo, you'll get to anywhere you need from Shimbashi.The food in the hotel was great. We had dinner there one evening and also has breakfast in our room each morning (don't think this cost anything extra). There is a Michelin-star type restaurant and a more informal restaurant area to dine in. There is a cocktail bar there also but honestly the place was lacking in atmosphere when we were there (as these places tend to be, it is a hotel bar after all).Our room, a premier room, was brilliant. It had a stunning view of the city (therefore breakfast with this view won hands down versus the dining area). It was a spacious room that faced towards Shimbashi, some people mightn't like looking at the station and tracks but I found it facinating watching the people march along like ants in different directions. The beds in Park Hotel Tokyo are probably the best I've encountered anywhere in the world. Which was welcome to weay travellers like us.I would stay here again, in a premier room, in a heartbeat.

<Content>great value for money My husband, 7 year old daughter and I stayed here for 5 nights. We got a triple share room. I thought the room was adequate in size and definitely very nicely appointed. Location is great! The building is around office towers , there were a lot of good office lunch places with very reasonable prices. 10 min walk away from Ginza. The staff were very helpful , a couple of concierge personnels spoke excellent english and gave very efficient service. We liked the hotel for its boutique - like feeling , quiet and calm, we prefer it this way than a big chain hotel that can be chaotic and impersonal during peak hours. So happy we chose this hotel based on the reviews here. We will definitely come back. Great value for money!!!!

<Content>Super-Fantastic This hotel is super-great. Location is right next door to a subway station and the interior of the rooms are impeccable. If you like modern, you'll love it. Was a bit worried as I selected this hotel purely based on reviews as I was rushing for time. Its subway station (Shiodome) is well located and close to many tourist sites. Would not hesitate to recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great View from room We spent 3 nights at the Park Hotel in February and thought it was great.We arrived late evening  were very impressed with the size of the premium room we booked as some reviews suggested rooms were small. When we opened the curtains we were very impressed with the view of the neon lights  energetic Tokyo. The view was just as good in the morning especially with the sun glistening.As mentioned by several other people the heated toilet was a novelty  the toiletries provided were very good.The hotel staff were very helpful  friendly providing maps  advise on how to get to places.The free internet access was handy to look up places to visit or log onto tripadvisor for tips.The view from hotel reception has been mentioned several times before but is fantastic - Tokyo tower  Mt Fuji in the distance.It was our first visit to Tokyo  we were happy with the location but have nothing to compare to. The JR train line was only a short walk away  we got that everywhere. Would be happy to come back to this hotel again in the future as its excellent value  a good base to explore unique Tokyo.

<Content>Would definitely go back! We just got back from a 10 night stay in Tokyo and found this hotel to be perfect for our needs. We stayed in a standard queen bedroom on floor 33 looking out at the park and the bay. While the room is small, I thought it was extremely space efficient and didn't need anything larger. The room was stylish and very clean, and the housekeeping was fantastic. Our room was on the train station side, which I was quite wary of due to the reviews here and being a light sleeper, but strangely enough they didn't bother me. I found it more of a white noise than anything else. Your mileage may vary. I did not find the hotel front desk staff to be rude; they are certainly not as friendly and welcoming as most Japanese customer service staff we met elsewhere, but nothing to get your knickers in a twist about.We didn't use the room service or hotel restaurant, there is just so much choice in Tokyo that I didn't find it even remotely necessary. Keep in mind that my partner and I are both in our early twenties, and were keen to explore the city every day and most of the night. So really all we did at the hotel was sleep, shower, and watch a little tv. While Shiodome is not exactly in the heart of the action, so to speak, this can be a positive or a negative depending on how you look at it. I loved Shibuya for exploring at night, but as far as staying there? Not really that relaxing. Shiodome on the other hand, was clean, brand spanking new, and almost like a little retreat from the hubbub of Tokyo for us. We used the nearby Caretta mall restaurants and the convenience stores on a daily basis, and the walk through the underground passage to Shimbashi station was really convenient. Overall I adored this hotel, its amenities and services, the location and the room. Would love to go back some day.

<Content>Excellent hotel, great value for money I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in February 2008 while visiting Tokyo with my boyfriend and his family.We had a wonderful stay here and I cannot think of a single thing I didn't like about this hotel.We paid what seemed to have been a very cheap rate, though whether this is because of the roadworks going on below (which did not affect us at all as we used the overhead walkways) plus being winter, or whether this is their usual rate I am not sure.It is an excellent location- a very short walk to the Ginza and not far from Shimbashi train station (which most/all subway lines pass through), and Shiodome station is right next door (which has two subway lines). It is in the 25th to 33rd levels of Shiodome tower in a nice business district.The interior is very stylish, not what I expected at all for the price. The lobby is very comfortable and never seemed too full, and drinks aren't too expensive. Staff are very attentive. Rooms have a good view over Tokyo, beds are comfy, there is good lighting, good tea and coffee and minibar supplies, with drinks vending machines tucked away in some hallways. There is free internet next to the lobby and free secure wireless internet.Bathrooms are excellent, and well stocked with everything you could need, even razors and toothbrushes.The rooms are spacious enough (for a hotel room) with good lighting, radio and tv. There is a walkway leading from the 3rd floor of the tower so you don't need to walk to the street, which then blends in with all of the other walkways, so it is easy to get around.We had a wonderful stay here, it was one of the best hotels I've stayed in, and I can't think of anything I didn't like. Admittedly I didn't eat at the restaurant there, so cannot comment on it, but I don't usually see the point of staying in the hotel to eat anyway! It's only a short wlak to the many restaurants at Ginza, and it's a very safe area to walk around in at night.I highly recommend this hotel!

<Content>great value for money but over rated and rooms very small After reading lots of brilliant reviews on tripadvisor i booked this hotel on that basis , My review is mixed i am afraid !Hotel great value for money , very clean and stylish in a minimalistic way but void of character. Hotel only had one bar and one restaurant , so not much choice, seating area for both of these seemed to be mingled together with the lobby area . Other reviews mention the restaurants in the basement of the building , all i can say is good luck if you cant read / speak japanese,( we ordered tons of food by mistake!)Rooms were very small and compact ,with comfy beds, lovely toiletries  great heated toliet seats. Location, in a quiet business area with excellent access to all tube stations. The biggest selling point to this hotel is the price as its very cheap compared to other Tokyo hotels, so if i did return to Tokyo (which i wont as its not for me ) i would stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Great Hotel!! Lovely hotel. We're expecting a hotel in Tokyo around this price to be small and uncomfortable. However we're pleasantly proven to be wrong!The staff were very friendly and helpful. The rooms very nice and comfortable. The view were just to die for, amazing from every angle. We definitely will stay in this hotel again!

<Content>Still talking about it almost three years later This was our last stop after a whirlwind 2 week visit to Japan. I booked it on expedia the day before I checked in because I was so disappointed with the original hotel choice. The hotel is very stylish and modern. We sheepishly walked in with backpacks not knowing how we would be received. I was surprised to find everyone was very nice. I read a review below about how the front desk was rude. I will add, in that respect, that I spoke Japanese to book the hotel and initially at check-in. I know in some countries that knowing the local language can make a difference in service, but not sure if that was a factor here. The room had amazing views and reminded me of what I would expect from the New Otani. The room was rather large for Tokyo standards and the was nicely decorated and very modernI recommend this hotel for the last leg of your trip if you want to spend a low key day before your flight home. I woke up very early and walked to world famous Tsukiji fish market which is only a few blocks away. I also enjoyed drinks and an amazing view at the bar the night before. It was an absolute perfect way to end a perfect trip.

<Content>Stylish I chose the Park Hotel for a 4 night stay in Tokyo in Nov 2007 after much research. The hotel itself was great, stylish lobby, all the mod cons that you would expect in a Tokyo hotel. We had a corner twin room which was the mid range room type. I'm glad we didn't decide on the lead in as the room was small (again as many hotel rooms in japan can be). The fabulous view of the city and Tokyo tower made up for the slightly snug space. The hotel is located in the new business district of Shiodome which though a little quiet outside of business hours did have good rail and underground connections which meant we were less than a 20 min ride to most areas. I would definitely stay at the Park again however next time would possibly look for a hotel in Shibuya which was my favourite area in Tokyo.

<Content>Great Stay! Just back from here and it was the perfect place to stay in Tokyo. Here's why:1) Great location - bear in mind you have to get the subway everywhere in tokyo. This place is 2 mins walk to 1 subway, 7 mins to the main station. So its perfect as a base for getting about.2) The staff all speak perfect english and are very, very friendly + helpful. I'm surprised some people found them not to be. Must have been ignorant americans. ha ha3) You can leave your bags there while going travelling elsewhere (we went to Kyoto).4) You can get an early bird rate if you book early enough via the hotels own website and you don't even need to leave card details to do it - so do it anyway and cancel later on if need be. We got a lovely room with a prefect view of Tokyo for 拢90 a night. Not bad at all5) Heated toilet seats etc - as said by many others. They're dead rightBad point:1) The restaurant is a rip off. Just take a stroll to the main station and theres millions of places to eat for a 10th of the price.

<Content>Design value Truthfully, I thought this hotel was overrated for a hotel that has won design awards. The set-up of the check-in waiting/lobby area was great: comfortable, good-looking couches set facing each other in pairs, bookcases with design  other cool coffee-table books, and good lighting. However, the room was ho-hum. While clean  spare, the 'City Queen' room was tiny, much tinier than either of the standard hotel rooms in which I stayed in Seoul (both 4-star+ hotels), and the design  materials of the furniture  bedding were poorer (the blond wood composite was definitely cheaper) -- look at the photos of the small round table. Also, I did not find the service 100% polite and seamless. One woman whom I asked about mobile phone rental (which I mistakenly thought was included with the room) spoke excellent English but was quite rude and brusque. Also, we had to remind them about our luggage for the airport shuttle, as they had forgotten our original request.The special elements of this hotel were the small details such as Dean  Deluca products in the minibar and the quality of the toiletries. The aromatherapy products smelled fantastically fresh and invigorating and I loved the wash-cloth, shaver and other products in the cool packaging. I also liked the computer room with free internet access and the mobile rental desk, both next to the check-in desk.The hotel was conveniently located close to the main rail station and some great places to eat. However, as the Shiodome area is predominantly a commercial area with office buildings and we were there for a couple of days just after the new year, the area was really dead.Overall, this experience was mixed. I would consider going back to the Park Hotel, but probably only if I could book a premium room.

<Content>Great Place to be The hotel is well located and as a family it would cost about UDS10-12 to taxi from Tokyo Station which is what we did until we had time to get our bearings right instead of lugging bags through strange passageways. The staff are professional though some slightly aloof but almost all we met spoke great English and even delivered maps and directions clearly marked right up to our room at night. We found that we did not really need our heavy guidebooks. The cleaning staff were so courteous and honest and highly consistent. Depsite our mess the room always welcomed us in superb and almost identical generous fashion each evening. We had small rooms with railway noise though soft , despite request for quiet room. The bathroom is space-age with great auto toilets (in fact greatest toilets in the world are in Japan!). However if you are obese find another hotel! Literally the bathtub took its entire length and the width was 2.5 times the width of the bathtub. The heated mirror was great and the Thai (Thann) toiletries soothing. We found such an amazing choice of restaurants in the surriunding areas that we did not need to eat in the hotel. With JR pass we used the subway free of charge just by sticking to the JR Yamamote Line-(just show to the attendents do not bother with subway tickets on this line) gets you to Akihabara, Shinjuku etc from Shimbashi Stn which is 10-15 minutes walk. The secret to finding the hotel is to follow signs to Hamamatsucho (monorail station). Tokyo is amazingly safe even at night, There is a Family Mart downstairs as well as the AM/PM mini supermarket. Stock up on drinks and snacks for the next adventure in this great megapolis. There is even a Sinagpore Hainan Chicken rice Rest. and Vie de France (see petite Japanese ladies roll out french pastries!) in Shiodome City Centre. Tsuijiki Fish market (15 minutes walk) great experience with almost alien species there but traffic in there can be dangerous.

<Content>Good Location We stayed here for 4 nights 6/30/07 鈥?7/4/07 (booked online via hotel website on 4/13/07). Although the hotel was right above a train station, it was difficult to find. We met friends at the exit to the station, and walked for a while to get to the hotel. One friend was Japanese and could read the signs, and even she found it difficult to locate. We finally located the elevator and made our way to the hotel. It was mid-morning, so our rooms were not yet ready. At least one person spoke English at the front desk, and it was easy to communicate.We returned in the early evening, got our keys, and found that our bags had already been brought to our room. Hotel was very nice 鈥搇arge clean room. The best part about this hotel was the availability of Starbucks and convenience stores. When exiting the hotel underground, there are a variety of shops, restaurants, and stores. We loved the convenience store 鈥?in fact, we bought most of our souvenirs here 鈥?a variety of candies not found in the United States, including Green tea Kit Kat, Cola life savers, and Every Burgers (candy shaped like hamburgers -my favorite!)Breakfast buffet at the hotel was very expensive, and we did not indulge. A coffee and sandwich at Starbucks started each morning.Overall, hotel this hotel was decent, and we would recommend it. Once you get used to the walk from the hotel to the train, you鈥檒l find it is very convenient.

<Content>out of the way the park hotel is lovely but you've got to find it first. It seemed like a good idea to stay in a hotel that was above a train station as i'd heard tokyo was notoriously difficult to navigate. However the hotel was at least a ten minute walk through a maze of bland walkways and not very well signposted. We happened upon it almost by accident. The hotel itself is elegent but just a bit too far from any of the action. The Shiodome centre which it is housed in seems a bit of a white elephant.

<Content>Nice hotel for reasonable price Park Hotel is conveniently located near the subway and 20 min walk from the fish market which was convenient for the 4am start on that day! its not as great a location as staying in Shibuya which we did for a few days.I agree with another reviewer on their comments about the front desk staff - not overly helpful and sometimes bordering on rude.Rooms are a decent size for Tokyo with comfy beds and nice enough bathroom. The rooms do have a slightly odd smell when you first enter them- almost like bad body odour. we tried a few rooms but found the same thing in each. This would be my main criticism. The complimentary coffee is very nice so don't forget to try it!Overall a decent hotel to stay in Tokyo without spending too much. The views are lovely but other than that nothing special.

<Content>Great hotel with a great location! We just got back from a three week trip to Asia, and the Park Hotel in Tokyo was one of the best hotels we stayed in. The view from the lobby is great, and the view from the room wasn't too bad either. The room was bigger than I thought it would be given all I had heard about the size of hotel rooms in Japan. The concierge was very helpful about giving us directions to various places and even helped book us on a tour. The location is really convenient. We were able to walk to the subway without going outdoors, which was a plus in December. We will definitely return to the Park Hotel the next time we are in Tokyo!

<Content>Wouldn't stay here again if you paid me! Am amazed by the positive reviews of this hotel. We just must have been unlucky. Stayed 5 nights in October and found the service (apart from the fantastic concierge) to be absolutely dreadful.Having spent two months travelling across Asia and staying in the best hotels 5-star hotels on that continent (including the Oriental and Peninsula in Bangkok, and the Park Hyatt in Tokyo) this was undoubtedly the worst - by a long, long way.The design is nice, and the location good if your priority is to walk into Ginza every night, but the front desk attitude is beyond belief. One guy was so rude to my girlfriend when she asked for another key to our room, that he was lucky I didn't drag him across the desk and give him a good leathering.Japanese service is amazing - from the taxi drivers to the bank clerks. Don't ruin it for yourselves by staying here, when there are far superior (cheaper/pricier) hotels on offer in this great city.

<Content>Brilliant! Just returned from the Park Hotel and can only repeat what others have said. We stayed here at the start and the end of our holiday and stayed in rooms overlooking Odaiba (at the start) and Tokyo tower (end) both views were fantastic.The staff were polite  helpful. Rooms were clean and a reasonable size by Tokyo standards.The room service was pricey.Shiodome is a great base and there is a wealth of restaurants and cafes if you head towards the underground station. The proximity to Shimbashi station is handy. In total the hotel is within walking distance of 3 underground lines, JR line and the monorail which makes travel easy.I would love to stay here again.

<Content>Great Value Like the other reviews say this is really good value for a new hotel in a convenient location for everything.The rooms aren't large but are well laid out and have amazing views (ours overlooked the water and the city lights) the bathrooms are very small but come with so many amenities you can overlook the tiny size.The hotel itself wasn't too hard to find from the Shimbash Train Station, just follow the signs for Shiodome Media Tower or ask where the big cukoo clock is and it is just around the corner from there!The concierge service was very good, they booked restaurants, gave us maps and directions and where in general very helpful.I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a new, very clean, well appointed hotel in Tokyo for a very reasonable price.We booked thru designhotels website and paid AU$200 but heard some people say they ahd booked through agoda.com and got it for AU$160!

<Content>Very Nice This is a nice hotel, located close to the Ginza. The views from the front desk are amazing. The breakfast is pricey but super delicious. The concierge was very helpful in making restaurant reservations, and the staff go out of their way to be helpful. The rooms are nice, but a little small, with simple furnishings. But for the price I paid ($150 per night), it was well worth it. I would recommend this hotel as a nice place to stay. You could pay more and get better, but it's high quality for its price bracket.

<Content>Luxury hotel at an unbeatable price! My husband and I had a fabulous experience at this hotel. The staff is helpful, the rooms are quite spacious by Japanese standards and the hotel has luxuries beyond what is expected with this price tag. The rooms are immaculate, the views superb, and you are a quick underground walk to two subway locations. I whole-heartedly recommend this hotel, and will definitely stay there again during my next trip to Tokyo. I still can't comprehend how the prices are so low for the experience you receive.

<Content>Excellent service, staff and accommodation We stayed here for a few nights on the way back to the UK from Sydney. The hotel is well connected to the Tokyo metro network with many lines having a station linked to it within the vast underground network of shops, offices etc. The hotel staff were excellent, finding us taxis, local info and maps (in english) and even lending us an umbrella to keep the rain off our heads.The rooms were excellent and very well presented. The food and drinks were very good though maybe pricey. There is free internet available for those without wi-fi.We would highly recommend this hotel when in Tokyo.

<Content>will be back in a heart beat We(5 people) booked it through its site. It required all your personal information. But the hotel is great. It sits 25- 43 floor with great view. Room is well cleaned and modern. Staffs are frendly and speaks English well. We goes out to the nearby mall for food, which is about the same price as in US. It takes a bit effort to find where the exits are and where to go since there are three floors underground and 2-3 floors above ground. There are two major metro station closeby. SO you can get anywhere. There are also two 7-11ish mart nearby so you can get drinks etc. Overall, it is a great hotel with great view: one side is faced toward Tokyo tower(such as front desk). We will go back without any problem. We stayed for three nights which is probably not enough for this city. I think you need at least one week there. PS, the fish market is 10 min walk from the hotel. And we walked to Ginza from fish market which is about 20 min. I could not post pictures since the wed site only allow file upload 1M or something.

<Content>Great Stay! We stayed for a week in late November and had two rooms on different sides of the hotel. Both rooms were above average in size, well lighted and very clean. The room on the side with the train station had some noise but not what has been mentioned in other reviews. Our other room was facing away from the station and it was quite quiet.The staff were very helpful and it is quite nice not having to tip in Japan. Below the hotel is an underground mall connecting this building to a number of others along with the rail system and metro. There are many places to eat in this complex and we had many very nice dinners with a beer or two for $20-$25 per head.There is direct service to the hotel from Narita via the airport bus which was quite helpful when we arrived. Returning to the airport we took the metro and rail which was less expensive but no faster.The location is within walking distance to the Ginza district although the Ginza metro line also has a stop in the underground mall. The fish market is also within walking distance.Next time in Tokyo we will stay here again!

<Content>Fabulous, modern, immaculate hotel This hotel is above a train station on the top 10 floors of the Shiodome Media Tower, so, you're guaranteed some kind of view whatever the aspect.Hotel is immaculate, excellent service, happy for us to check in early (at 9am!!), wonderful bar, compact but comfortable rooms, small but excellent bathrooms. Our toilet was space age - warmed seats, jet wash, etc,. great products were available for the toilette and the small touches like the lounging gowns, hotel slippers, coat brush, etc. were lovely. Fully equipped, comfortable and well staffed, this hotel was a lovely oasis of calm in the hustle and bustle of Tokyo. Also, the Shiodome city housed loads of restaurants frequented by the locals, so good food was plentiful and within easy reach.Would highly recommend it.

<Content>Loved the Park Hotel We stayed at the Park Hotel for 3 nights in November in a twin room on floor 26. Our room had an absolutely beautiful view of Tokyo including Tokyo Tower and on a clear day, Mt Fuji. The rooms look like they had been recently renovated and some beautiful toiletries were supplied. The reception, concierge and bell staff all offered excellent service and were fluent in english. The hotel location itself was excellent. Right above the Shiodome subway station and a 5 minute walk underground to the Shimbashi railway station. While we chose not to eat there (the prices were a little expensive) there are a few good places in Shimbashi station to pick up breakfast and the Family Mart (convenience store) downstairs offered some food items as well. The hotel provided free internet access which was definetly a bonus. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay a nice hotel and convenient location in Tokyo.

<Content>Affordable luxury in Tokyo I stayed in this hotel with my parents for a week when they came to visit me in Japan. It was more than 2 years ago, but our stay was so good that I still remember it well.The hotel is located in central Tokyo near the Shimbashi station on the circular train line, so it's really easy to get to any part of the city from there. The Tokyo train station is also a few stations away, so it's really convenient if you want to go on a trip to Kyoto for example. Plus it's in the most modern part of Tokyo, everything is so clean and easy to find. There are a lot of restaurants in the area, and the chic area of Ginza and the Tsukiji fish market with it's delicious sushis are not far away. The hotel is located at the top floors of a skyscraper so the views of the Tokyo bay were beautiful. We even saw mount Fuji one day when the weather was clear. The rooms weren't huge but still at a good size. The decoration of the room is pretty modern, very comfortable and cozy. A nice surprise : the fragrance coming from the bathroom.The staff is the best my father has ever seen -- and he travels alot. They were so welcoming, kind and patient. They really honoured the Japanese sense of hospitality.We didn't go to the restaurants of the hotel much because they are quite expensive, but there are plenty in the area. We did go to the Japanese restaurant in the hotel for our last night though, and it was delicious, the best sushi I have ever eaten in my life. For breakfast we went to the caf茅 at the ground floor, it was pretty good. There is also a Starbucks and a bakery in the Shiodome tower across from the hotel.

<Content>Cool luxury at nice price To us, this was a luxury city hotel at an affordable cost, and a great first stop in Japan. Easy to reach, within a short walking distance from JR Yamanote line as well as several subway stations (but do print out a map), with a cool atrium lobby and professional front desk staff, fluent in English of course.High class room with all the amenities offered superb night time view over Tokyo Bay, which you can also enjoy from the rather pricey wine bar. However, despite the proximity to Ginza, the surrounding area seemed quite characterless.

<Content>My Favourite Hotel in Japan This hotel is wonderful; Nothing is too much trouble, the food is superb, particularly in the Japanese restaurant, and the views are breathtaking. My favourite view is looking down at Shimbahi train station from the Japanese restaurant whilst having dinner. From 25 floors up it is like watching a model railway set up but in complete silence. Breakfast in the lounge area is also good and there is plenty of variety to choose from. I know that some folks have thought it expensive but it's less than 拢12 which is about par for the course. You can get a continental breakfast at the cafe on the 3rd floor if you like but I prefer to start the day with something substantial. The rooms are very good with just about everything you could need. I stayed here twice and my second room was smaller but still fine. The internet is free but usually not too difficult to get on. There is often very good entertainment in the evening. A good range of drinks and cocktails and a very swish French restaurant. Most of us aren't here to eat French food of course but the Japanese themselves seem to love it.The hotel is on the route of the airport bus and has a stop right outside.The only gripe I ever had was that altough Shimbashi station is easy to get to from the hotel, finding the hotel from the station always caused me trouble, even with a map. A bit of signage would be a great help I'm sure.

<Content>Nice ambiance We stayed at the Park Hotel for 7 nights (first week of November) The hotel itself is situated near plenty of nice restaurant's, however you will need to go for a wander into the basements of some nearby buildings. Just a short walk accross the upper level walkways (which really are outstanding) head over to th building with he big clock (you`ll know which one), head down stairs and you`ll find the Rose  Crown bar. The food there is outstanding and the fish and chips were certainly a cut above the common greasy stuff you find at home.There is also a nice pasta place nearby oposite McDonalds which does a lovely plate.Overall the hotel was nice, however one thing that really dissapointed me was the amount of people smoking in the main lobby reception area, Japan has still a lot to learn about health from passive smoking. The rooms while not overly large, were comfortable and very clean. The toilet was an experience in itself...leave you to decide about that. Also much to my suprise, you can drink the tap water and clean your teeth no probs. I thought this was the better place to stay out of a lot of others I read into. Thanks to all who contributed on here and helped make up my mind.

<Content>Great hotel, reasonably priced This is a great hotel. 7 minutes walk (underground) from Shimbashi JR station, maybe a bit tough for some people to find, but we printed out their PDF and had no problems. Located halfway up the Shiodome media tower, it is very clean, contemporary and reasonably priced (for Tokyo). Rooms a little on the small side (compared to western hotels), but comparable for Japan. Lovely toiletries (Thann) and all the amenities you need. Staff were incredibly helpful ... front desk, bell staff, waiters etc. Did I mention the staff were helpful? (smile) I have no hesitation recommending this hotel and would not hesitate to stay here again.

<Content>Can't say enough good things I've never written a hotel review before, here or anywhere else, but I feel compelled (in spite of all the OTHER good reviews) to write about the Park -- great location, lovely decor, thoroughly competent staff, and a really reasonable price. My husband and I stayed here for almost a week before going to Kyoto for a few days, and then we stayed again for several more days before leaving Japan. Both times we had a very clean, modern room (lovely bathroom with a great shower and lots of great products, by the way -- brush, razor, toothbrush, various toiletries, etc) with a wonderful view of the Tokyo Tower (and even Mt. Fuji on some days!). The hotel is easily walkable over to such great/convenient locations as Shimbashi Station, the fish market, Ginza, the Ginza Corridor (great dining of all sorts), etc. Back to the hotel, they were very efficient and accurate about arranging things such as a day trip to Mt. Fuji and a bus back to Narita at the end of our trip. We never ate at any of the restaurants/cafes there, since they seemed a little pricey and there were a ton of lovely and reasonable places to eat in neighboring highrises that were easily accessible by the over-street walkways that connect the buildings in this area (by the way, highly rec. the set meals at the Excelsior Caffe in the Pedi Shiodome building if you're looking for something easy to get to, good, and cheap 鈥?for instance, first thing in the morning 鈥?think they open as early as 7am), but we did splurge on drinks in the lobby bar on our last night -- we sat and looked at the beautifully lit-up Tokyo Tower and contemplated our lovely stay in this wonderful city and at this wonderful hotel!

<Author>Hello_Elo
<Content>Nice, but not great We previously stayed at the New Otani and if it's true that the design of the trendy Park Hotel is much more contemporary, it also has a soulless tourist park feel that almost put us off.The location is good but not great - yes it's connected to a metro station but you have to walk about 10 minutes to get there. It's mainly a business district so there's nobody around at night or during the weekend which explains why the restaurant choice is somewhat limited to small lunch joints. We resorted to using taxis (600 JPY for the first 2km - it actually makes sense if you're a couple and not sure where you're going exactly).Even though we got there at 12:00, we had to wait 1 hour for our room and were not even offered a drink at the bar (not great when you're jet lagged and just want to go to bed).The room was pretty small with not much space left for luggages. The deco was nice though and the view was amazing. The bathroom amenieties were nice and the shower very powerfull, although they ask you to close the door as the steam might trigger the smoke alarm (?!).CNN and BBC World were the two English speaking channels on offer.We had breakfast through room service (about 5,000 JPY, crazy expensive!), nice an quick. We also had the buffet breakfast, which was served in the lobby bar and felt a bit like a train station cafe.Yes, everybody speaks English, including guests (mainly American, English and French - not a native in sight...) but what you gain in convenience is somehow lost by the impression that world-class Japanese customer service has been replace by a not so attentive one.That said, they didn't hesitate to give me some headache pills after a crazy karaoke night, lent scissors to open gadgets packaging, were always prompt to bring iron/ironing board to the room and the mini-bar was well stocked.All in all, nice enough stay but we'll try something else next time.

<Content>A gem in tokyo This is an excellent gem of a hotel situated in Shiodome. We stayed there for a week and was pleasantly upgraded to a room with tokyo tower view at no additional cost. The staff were ultra-friendly and extremely helpful. Transportation via shuttle bus to and from the narita airport to the hotel can be arranged and it beats the hassle of lugging your luggage around in the train stations. You can also request for them to post your letters/mail/bulky boxes for you. Service is always courteous and English is well spoken by the front desk staff. We ordered room service on the first night and the meal was delicious albeit slightly expensive. The dinner set was beautifully presented and top marks for quality.The shiodome station is within 5 minutes walk. We got lost initially because there were no distinct signs. Instead of getting off at the ground level.. get off at the floor which leads directly to the overhead bridge where it will lead you to the train station. shiodome station also has a ginza line and the subway nearby which is extremely handy if you want to drop by tsukiji fish market. I am always a big fan of nice toiletries (Hahn) rather than some crap labelled shampoo/conditioner/shower gel (all in one). Extremely excellent value for money. IF you don't mind that there isn't a swimming pool.

The Centre Mall is opposite and it has restaurants and other shops at the doorstep.I canr fault this hotel and would definitely recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Great Location with Awesome Skyline View of Tokyo Park Hotel is in a great location of Ginza district . It is walking distance to the posh shopping district in Ginza, as well as the to the famous Fish market. It is also about 7 minute walk to the JR Shimbashi station on the Yamonote, which can get you to all of the tourist attractions in Tokyo. The hotel room is a quite roomy compared to the business hotels in Japan with awesome views of the city. The hotel also has a fantastic lobby with live jazz music. For the price that we paid (about $160/night) this hotel seems like the biggest bang for buck in Tokyo. I also recommend the restaurants on the first floor or basement for cheap lunches.

<Content>I agree - a great hotel! I just returned from a 3-night stay in Tokyo. I booked the Park Hotel based on all the other reviews on TripAdvisor and the hotel didn't disappoint. It is centrally located, within easy walking distance to Ginza, metro lines, Hama Rikyu, fishmarket. The hotel is gorgeous, brand new and has great views. The staff was excellent, very helpful. And you can't beat the price for Tokyo. I highly recommend it.

<Content>Great hotel - great jazz at night! We have just returned from a three night stay at this hotel - our first time to Tokyo and Japan. The hotel itself is really lovely, with the room (City Queen) an adequate size for the time that's spent there. On reading earlier reviews we requested a room away from the many train lines, which was granted. The view was still awesome - of the bay and the Hamarikyu gardens (you must visit these gardens, easily accessible from the subway under the hotel (exit 7 or 8) and walk over the overpass. You can then get the ferry to Asakusa from the gardens. There's a great tea house and bridges within. Whilst we could still hear the hum of the trains from the two train lines below (31 floors below), it would probably have been unbearable on the other side of the hotel, where I think I counted 6 or 7 train lines - and they NEVER STOP! However, you would get THE best view of Tokyo Tower and at night that's pretty spectacular. (You can visit this Tower until 10pm nightly - a must see also) The size of the city is truly unimaginable until you get up there!The jazz in the lounge in the evening was fantastic. Different every night or so. As per earlier reviews, mostly we found the staff to be extremely efficient and friendly, only one did we find a little unfriendly, but not so much to notice.We had the breakfast on the last morning, and at 22,000 YEN wasn't overpriced for the selection, but the food was uninspiring and cold. The other mornings we took an earlier reviewer's advice and went to Vie de France underneath the hotel in the subway. For directions: if you're heading out of the hotel to the trains, it will be on your right in the building next door.My only complaint would be the directions on the hotel's website about finding the hotel. As the Limousine Bus from the aiport stopped it's route to this hotel ealier than our arrival, we got off at another stop and got a cab. The cabbie didn't know where the hotel was and I ended up finding it for him. The hotel has a great map for finding your way to the subway and JR lines, and back again, but you get that AT the hotel, not off the website. It would be soooo helpful to have it before so you could just get the Narita Express from the aiport. (We did this on our way home and I would get the train every time over that hideous Limousine Bus)! And, if you have a JR pass, and it's still valid, the train journey is free!Hope this all helps! I could go on.....but won't.... Have a great trip to Tokyo!

<Content>I miss it already... My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel for 8 nights on our first trip out to Japan. Wow what a place! As many of the other reviews have said, the hotel is extremely clean, all the hotel employees are very polite, are so nice and most of them speak English well enough to communicate effectively. Any questions you might have, I highly suggest that you ask front desk / concierge. They will go out of their way to help you out. Some things that I want to mention that other reviews have not 鈥?there are many other 鈥淪hiodome鈥?complexes, within walking distance, that have great, reasonable places to eat. My favorite is 鈥淧edi Shiodome鈥? which is just a short stroll thru the Yurikamome (3rd floor) pedestrian walkways. We tried many restaurants here including Ginzo Sushi and Excelsior Caffe (for my Western caffeine fix).The Oedo Subway Line (pink line) is what we took most. This line goes in a circle throughout Tokyo and connects to all the other major lines. The subway system is very efficient but requires a lot of walking (which I am surprised that everyone failed to mention). Be careful and double check that the subway line and the pay station match since each line requires their own tickets which are non transferable. This hotel overall is an excellent choice and I wouldn鈥檛 hesitate to recommend it to anyone staying in Tokyo. Enjoy!

<Content>Quality hotel with great service As per some other reviewers, we were on honeymoon and the Park Hotel was our first stop. Interesting location known as Shiodome- an area reclaimed from marshland and now a modern scyscraper business area but very close to the main train lines and within walking distance of some of the big shopping areas such as Ginza.The hotel occupies the 25th to 34th floor of the building it shares with Kyoto News. Service could not be better. Anything we needed help with (i.e directions on arrival) they were only too pleased to do. We arranged to meet a friend for dinner one evening and when we asked at reception about getting there via taxi, they printed out a Japanese map with the exact location of our restaurant. Rooms were excellent and super clean. It is worth upgrading to the Premium Rooms as the views are spectacular especially at night.We arrived very early off a flight from Singapore and they checked us in straight away.Also, it is wirth getting the breakfast in the hotel as it is a buffet and can really get you up and running for the day! There is a choice of western or traditionalFinally, from here you can walk to Shinbashi station which is on the JR line and pretty much services the entire of Tokyo. If you have a JR (Japanse Rail) Pass, you really get your money's worth. Get your head around the transport system early in your trip and Tokyo just opens up to the visitor!I will atach a shot with the view from the room when I get round to doing downloads!

<Content>All Around Excellent The Park Hotel Tokyo is located in the new modern Shiodome section of Tokyo. You can walk underground to the train station, the subway station, and the new monorail station. The nearby train station is only two stops away from Tokyo Station where you can connect to all other lines. The hotel is also only a 15 minute walk from Ginza where the kabuki theater is located. The walk is a simple direct route and very safe and well lighted even late at night.The front desk staff and concierge speak excellent English and are very helpful and solicitious. The lobby is gorgeous and the room very nice although not large. The restroom is very nice and the toiletries nicely aromatic. There are two computers available for complimentary internet use. We were there in late August when the weather was still somewhat hot and humid and we really appreciated the ice machine on our floor which also dispensed cold water so we could always enjoy ice water in the room. Also very convenient was the Family Market on the building's ground floor, equivalent to a 7-Eleven, where you could buy snacks, drinks, hot food, medicine and toilietries. We would definitely stay at the Park Hotel again.We booked online and got a special rate of 18,000 yen for making our reservation early. The front desk advised me that special rates are only available online so making reservations at the hotel's website is recommended. If you are unable to book at the Park Hotel Tokyo, in the building next door is the Villa Fontaine Shiodome, also a good choice. The Villa Fontaine is a business class hotel chain and many of their locations are not so nice, but the Shiodome location is new and very nice. We stayed there for two nights when the Park Hotel was full. At the Villa Fontaine Shiodome we had a 13,000 yen weekend rate which included a simple breakfast. The Villa Fontaine has self service washing machines and dryers on every other floor.

<Content>Convenient, modern and larger than expected We have just come back from a fabulous trip to Japan in September 07, having stayed 4 nights at the Park Hotel. The hotel is in a great location, very handy to all lines on the metro and JR making travelling around Tokyo very convenient. We were pleasantly suprised by the size of the room (queen bed), good views, very comfy mattress and nice bathroom too. Front desk spoke good english and as in true Japanese style were exceptionally courteous and helpful. We didn't have the breakfast - not included in the rate, approx $30 AUD per person which is pricey, but it looked nice (buffet with pastries, cereal, eggs, juices etc). There are plenty of breakfast options though and by the number of people coming into the hotel with supermarket bags this was the prefered one!I would highly recommend a stay at the Park Hotel. It is central, great value and super clean. What more could you ask for. It is a 5 minute walk to Ginza, where you can find great restaurants and shopping. If thinking about Ginza vs. Shinjuku as a base i would choose Ginza - no comparison really. If arriving by train to JR Shinbashi Station make sure you download the directions and map from the hotel website as the underground malls can be a little confusing.

<Content>Stay here! We stayed in the Park Hotel for 5 nights in July, we visit Tokyo regularly and normally stay in the Hilton in Shinjuku but after reading reviews on Tripadvisor and getting a recommendation from friends we decided to stay in the Park. The hotel, as mentioned in previous reviews, is in Shiodome Media Tower with the lobby on the 27th floor. Visually the place is amazing, beautiful views and very serene. The staff at check-in were excellent and upgraded us to a higher floor upon our request. We were looking over the bay area. We stayed in 2 City Queens (standard rms) on the 33rd floor, the rooms are compact but beautifully designed and the beds are really comfortable.We ate in the Japanese restaurant on our first night with great views  excellent food although small portions and reasonably expensive. Be warned that most restaurants (incl. the hotel) in the area have last orders between 9 and 10pm so you need to take this into account when planning your evenings. I recommed trying the top floor restaurants in the Shiodome City Centre building nearby - the view  food are outstanding.From a location point of view you are within 5 mins walk of Shiodome station with excellent and easy links to all the most popular areas of Tokyo.We have just booked our Christmas trip to Tokyo and are staying in the Park again. Both times we have booked on their website and the rates are excellent plus the hotel personally email you to confirm you booking and any individual requests you might have. The City Queen Early Bird rate is roughly $160/nt and for the room, service and location this is an outstanding deal.

<Content>Park Hotel Experience I think anyone reading the reviews on the Park Hotel will realise that this is one of the top hotels for Western visitors in Tokyo. I stayed here during February 2007, so forgive the belated review but here鈥檚 my impressions and tips.I can confirm that it is difficult to fault the staff and the hotel. The hotel is very convenient for central Tokyo and the travel links are superb, i.e. close to Shimbashi Station for the JR loop line and the Tube. Initially, the hotel is not easy to find but was resolved by taking a taxi from Shimbashi Station (cost less then 拢3) to the ground floor entrance and subsequently obtaining a 鈥榙irections鈥?leaflet from the English speaking Concierge for the walkways accessed from the Third Floor. As other contributors have noted, it should not be confused for the Royal Park Hotel which is adjacent. As for the noise factor, for those who have exceptional hearing, there is some ambient noise in the background but this is not significant. This may be dependent from which side you are located; from what I can discern, all the rooms are built around a central atrium and face outwards towards Tokyo Bay or Tokyo Tower. As for dining, the easiest option is to head for the Caretta Centre or Shiodome City Center as these have every variety of restaurant imaginable.As for the negatives, being very pernickety, the size of the room coffee mugs seemed miniscule by Western standards and the free-internet facility in the Lobby was sometimes unavailable. I was also charged 30 Yen for one A4 copy from the internet which I thought was slightly cheeseparing! This said, if you want the futuristic Tokyo experience, this is the place.

<Content>Consistently Pleases The Park Hotel Tokyo is in the Shiodome area, on the higher floors of an office building and it's very close to other hotels like the functional Villa Fontaine (no room service), the Royal Park and the very upscale Conrad Hotel. Having stayed at the other aforementioned places, for my money, I would choose the Park over the rest (not that I can really afford to stay at the Conrad haha) as it offers the best value for its rates. I have stayed here a few times and on my second visit, they upgraded me to a better room with a fantastic view of Tokyo Tower, not much in the daytime but really gorgeous at night. Now, every time I stay there, they have always given me the upgrade, without my having to ask for it.The rooms are very comfortable and the decor is understated and chic. Bathroom amenities are from a Thai company that makes natural and organic products. If you want to take them home (and they do smell lovely), bigger bottles are for sale at the hotel store, tucked in a small corner off the elevators on the lobby.Don't take the breakfast - at over Y2,000 it's very plain and you can get better pastries and bread at Vie de France and the other coffee shops in the Shiodome train station area.The other great thing about the Park Hotel is that it's connected to the Shiodome and Shimbashi stations via an underground passageway -- terrific to get out of the rain or the cold. It's also connected to the Yurikamome station for shopping forays into Odaiba. And the buildings around the hotel have so many restaurants and coffee shops to choose from. Not to mention convenience stores for last minute emergency supplies.You can also book online and they have a special rate for bookings 30 days in advance that was even cheaper than the corporate rate that I used to get.There are no unpleasant suprises at The Park Hotel Tokyo, just consistently good facilities, service and great value!

<Content>PArk Hotel - the way a Tokyo live... I have just backed from this pretty great hotel.center of tokyo with easy access to shimbashi station and also to narita express through tokyo stationEverything was great except a tiny room , but who spend time in roomin tokyo ? I asked following one reviewer from here a room on the same side as a reception room - with the great view to ginza including tokyo tower. although the side was the same as station I did not hear anything - I was on 31th floor.Caretta Center- full of different restaurants and we did breakfest at VIA de France - yummy. Try as much as you can...sushi is even better than at tsukuji market (15 minuts from hotel)When I saw differents hotels in tokyo then..please believe me you apreciate Ginza district - and i do not talking about shopping (the best area this is shibuya and harajukubut neigbourhood. peace and quite after 6pm but simultanously you can take a train and be in 15 minutes in ueno area.absolutely must buy RAILPASS.

<Content>I liked this hotel I stayed two nights at the Park Hotel. The first night I was put into a double room which was on the 31st floor. Even though I was way up there, the subway trains kept me awake most of the night. At 6:00am I wandered down to the front desk to get a room change so I could sleep and I was taken to a single room, which was much nicer, although smaller, on the otherside of the building. I could still hear the trains but it was a huge differance.Bonus: Toilet seat is heated, has a fancy bidet option as well as a heated section of the mirror so you can see when you get out of the shower and need to do your hair. There is a kettle and coffee/tea in the room as well as good bathroom amenities and soaps.The Japanese restaraunt in the hotel was wonderful and the food was fresh. The girls that were in-training were a great help for shopping and subway directions. They were full of energy and very happy to help, which is more then I can say for the gentlemen at the front desk. The location was good for me as I just took the subway to Ginza to shop and look around the city. There a lots of places to eat in the lower level of the hotel as well as a Starbucks and a McDonalds if you need your western fix. They also offer free internet in their mini business centre with two semi private computers.The last night of my stay, a category 9 Typhoon stormed through Tokyo. The hotel lobby had computer printouts of the weather and kept the guests up to date with what was happening. The television stations had a few good stations that offered english interpretations. No problem in the morning and my flight left on time in the afternoon.They also offer an airport shuttle bus that makes a couple of hotel stops. When I arrived, it was quite late at night and I missed the last bus for this hotel. Thankfully, the airport counter attendtant for the limo shuttel bus service suggested I take the next bus to a close hotel and then taxi it over. This worked for me very well, although beware, taxi's are VERY expensive in Japan. It's a good hour from the Narita airport to this area of Tokyo, but it was worth it. They help with luggage as well as a comfortable ride.

<Content>Always there for me Once again, the staff at Park Hotel has proven their worth in gold.I was there in August and the staff took care of my dining arrangements and even helped me to find a book that I needed to get. Special mention goes to Hirota-san (concierge) and Watanabe-san (Front Office) who went out of their way to book me a hotel whan I had to be out of Tokyo over the weekend.It is just the attention to detail that was super, complete with detailed maps and discount coupons that the staff will arrange for you so that you wont lose your way and get the best deal!I am surprised the hotel is not listed as number one on trip advisor for tokyo

<Content>A real find! This hotel is a real pearl. It's inexpensive, it's chic, the service is great and the location is not bad either. The reception is situated on the 25th floor of one of the towers in the Shiodome complex. You get both excellent views of the Tokyo cityscape going up in the lift and from your room window. It's also easily within walking distance of all the stores in Ginza. We had not one complaint about the service. Everyone on reception was both helpful and efficient. We had read murmurings prior to our trip about the small size of the rooms, but found the set-up similar to many rooms in Europe. The decor is stylish and the bathrooms well-equipped. You have heated toilet seats and the part of the mirror above the sink does not steam up while you're having a shower. So, you don't have to shave or brush your teeth through the mist! For us, the real highlight were the breakfasts, which are absolutely delicious. We live in Paris and the pastries were as good as any we have tasted here. If I had any grudges about the Park Hotel, then they would be slight. The first one would be the difficulty in actually finding it. We arrived at the Shimbashi train station and I had printed out a plan from the Park's website. However, it wasn't 100% clear that we had to go into the underground complex when we got out of the station. There are also steps in the same place going up to an overpass and we were slightly confused. The second thing, which may bother some people is that the tower in which the hotel is situated is right next to a major train line. You can hear the rumbling of trains below all the way through the night. It didn't bother us, but it could be a pain if you're a light sleeper. Otherwise, definitely try out the En restaurant on the 42th floor of the neighbouring Shiodome City Center tower. The views are amazing and the food fantastic.

<Content>Great Hotel and great location in Tokyo Just returned from 6 day family vacation to Tokyo and had a marvelous stay at the Park Hotel. Arranged my stay via Hotel Website after reading accolades from Tripadvisor, very easy to use.Hotel is easily served by Airport Limo Bus Service from Narita Airport. Service is extremely attentive from the greeting at entrance to check in. English is not an issue. In fact, Tokyo is a lot easier to get around now with English translations in buildings, restaurants and subways.Hotel itself is very modern, airy and serene at the top of a 38 story building in Tokyo Shiodome, which is a series of modern skyscrapers serviced by subway and trains below street level and connected via pedestrian walkways on the third floor. Very quiet despite the activity down below. Didn't use the trains, but found the subway connected to the Ginza and Asakusa Lines, which will hit just about every tourist site in the Tokyo area. There is also a monorail that will take you to the seaside development of Odaiba. Hotel is ten minutes from the Wholesale Fish Market by foot--this a Tokyo must see, if you get up early.With my family of 5, got a twin and a triple. Rooms generous in size for Tokyo, bathrooms and amenities were very good. Restaurant services a very good breakfast buffet which our family enjoyed before hitting the streets. Did not eat any other meals in hotel--seemed pricey, but the building is connected to other Shiodome buildings--Carretta and City/Pedi Shiodome had a number of inexpensive and good restaurants offering a variety of Japanese and non-Japanese foods. There is a Family Mart in the basement level of Park Hotel building for snacks. While we were staying in the hotel, there was a free jazz concert every nite in the lobby.Service was excellent. The concierge services were very helpful and helped me to work with a tour agency that had lost our reservation for a tour to the Ghibili Museum on the outskirts of Tokyo. Fortunately, the concierge was able to clear up the problem and we got to go on our tour.Can not think of anything negative to say about the hotel, definitely worth the price, would definitely go back and would definitely recommend it to my friends. Thanks to all fellow Tripadvisor reviewers for the high rating this hotel gets and deserves!

<Content>Great Value, Great Location After the long haul flight to Tokyo it was good to have a bit of comfort to look forward to. And this hotel is really comfortable. The beds and pillows were great. The toiletries were very generous - including toothbrushes, toothpaste, hairbrush, moisturiser, bath salts - and the basic city rooms are a decent size for Tokyo with great views ( a view of Tokyo Tower costs a little extra, but the other views are good too).The location is also perfect. It's a relatively newly developed area, but within walking distance of the fish market, boat trips, Ginza shopping area. There's a metro station right outside and there are lots of good places to eat in the neighbourhood.Would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Very nice Hotel I stayed in Park Hotel last 18th august and I have to say we really liked the Hotel. The room is quite spacious and we had great views of the Tokyo Tower. The bathroom is not so big but that's Japan!! Everything was so clean and the staff at the front desk just incredible servicial. We booked thru the Hotel website and we got a good rate of 22000Yens with all tax included for a queen. The problem to book with expedia or other websites was that they could not guanatee a nice view and the Hotel offered us that without a problem.

<Content>The perfect peaceful retreat in a city of chaos Where to begin but the fact that this hotel is on the 26th floor and upwards of a skyscraper with fantastic views of the city including Tokyo Tower and on a clear day Mount Fuji in the distance with its snow cap.If the fact that you can arrive in your room and gaze out across the bustling city (which is absolutely incredible at night but still impressive on waking in the morning) doesn't win you ovr to stay at this hotel then perhaps some of the finer points may.The rooms by Tokyo standard are a good size, we opted for a King room which was more than adequate considering you probably won't spend that much time there. There are corner rooms available if you want a few extra square feet or perhaps are staying for a while.The staff here are very helpful and brought me hair appliances when mine didnt work (ladies be warned its a different voltage from many other countries and straightners dont work so dont waste your luggage allowance) they are also excellant with advice for where to go or how to get there. Just ask the front desk if you need anything.We booked through the hotels website after checking majority of main sites online and phoning the hotel it worked out the cheapest rate by quite a bit. I think we paid $300 USD for 2 nights so about 拢150 including breakfast and of course the wonderful view.Right below this hotel is a 7/11 convienience store which is not suprisingly about an 8th of the price of stuff in the minibar and obviousley offers some good snacks too.We ate in the hotel restaurant one evening, Don't recall the name but its the one which isn't japanese cuisine. It's not a cheap meal but having said that its not as expensive as things can be in Japan. We had a set menu of 6 course which i think was around 拢30 each and also a wonderful rose wine to go with it. The food was wonderful, they served two different appetizers, then fish, then a meat of your choice followed by 'pre-dessert' and grand dessert' i dont quite understand the idea behind the pre dessert thing but it was definately delicious.After dinner we drank cocktails in the hotel bar which for me is the only negatve to this place, the bar itself is modern and sophisticated and cocktails were up with some of the best ive had but the view has been ruined by an office building that you just can't quite see over the top of. Whether it came after the hotel was built i dont know, but it does make you wonder why they didnt have the bar on the top floor. Having said this its really not bad as you can watch people still working i their office at midnight and revel in the fact you're away from that.All in all a great hotel at a very good price for Tokyo. I feel you get your moneys worth just from the view but if you dont agree theres always buffet breakfast which you'll definately want to return to for more.

<Content>Good Hotel - OK Location My wife and I stayed at this hotel for two nights on the tail end of a recent trip to Japan. We chose this hotel based on the reviews we read here on Trip Advisor, and wanted to try something different than our earlier stay in Tokyo's Shibuya district.We found the hotel to be clean and modern, as described, but our Queen room was quite small, still OK. We found the room fit and finish to be a bit on the spartan side, especially the bathroom. I understand why others have suggested upgrading to the executive floor. But generally speaking the hotel is well appointed and the staff was efficient, although the concierge desk was particularly unfriendly and unhelpful, I guess it depends on the person at the desk. Bellmen , on the other hand were very efficient in dealing with our logitics to Narita.We did not use the hotel for breakfast, but we did have one dinner in the Japanese restaurant in the hotel, which was quite acceptable.I guess our biggest disagreement with other reviewers here is with location. The hotel is right in the center of an office building complex, so if you like empty office lobbies and aerial maze of passageways, this hotel is good. But apart from a strange and quite large mall and outdoor TV studios next door, there is no there there.It is a good 15 minutes from Ginza on foot. Our first adress in Tokyo on this same trip was in Shibuya, which we preferred as the hotel was in a real neighborhood, and far more readily accessible to public transit, and had the feeling of actually being in Tokyo.

<Content>The most amazing staff! We just spent 8 days at these hotel with 2 kids and I have to tell you how amazed we are by the service we received. The staff of this hotel is amazing, paying attention to every detail and request we had and the concierge was very helpful in booking our day trips. At times I ordered something for my room before I got in the elevator and it was delivered 2 minutes later. The room was impecable with a beautiful view of the city. The bed and pillows were very comfortable and the A/C was fantastic. The bathroom has everything you need for shaving,a comb and nice shampoo and conditioner plus creams and many other things. The location is also very nice if you take the time to explore the area. First of all you have Ginza in a 15 minute walking distance and two metro stops that will take you anywhere. Do not be afraid to use the metreo because it's easy to learn (fo;;ow the color for the line you need and the number for the station) and every station has an attendant who speaks english and gives directions. If you stay at this hotel, always get off on the 3rd floor and use the overpass to get to your metro or walking destination. You have an AM PM across the street for water, fruit, beer and many restaurants in the building next door for dinner or take out.Again, for the money you are getting a very nice staff and a great room. Enjoy Tokyo!

<Content>Lovely experience my husband and i stayed in park hotel tokyo after reading reviews on tripadvisor.the hotel is located in the shiodome media tower, starting on the 25th floor. you can walk to it on the skywalk from shimbashi train station. we booked a double en-suite for 拢85/night. it was far more than what i had expected for my money. the room was very nice and cosy and the bathroom had a modern japanese toilet (with bidet and seat warmer). what came as a pleasant surprise were the toiletries: aromatherapy shower gel and shampoo, bath salt, body lotion, toothbrush and tooth paste, and a razor with shaving cream.the hotel staff was very helpful and nice at all times. and the atmosphere was very tranquil as there was a classical music band playing in the lounge (the same place where breakfast is served).perhaps what made own stay there so enjoyable was the fact that on a clear day, you can see mount fuji from the reception area.the only downside is the existence of only two computers available to the guests.i would recommed this hotel to any traveler visiting tokyo as it is great value for money

Staff was very helpful and attentive. Only had the breakfast buffet one morning, and selection was great. Room amenities included yummy smelling bath toiletries, good coffee, and a fun toilet. Location was perfect for our needs - easy access to trains, within walking distance of the fish market and Ginza. I would definitely stay here again!

<Content>Tokyo Stopover We did a two day stopover at the Park Hotel in July. It was excellent. We asked for a non-smoking room and were very pleased with the size of the room. It may have been an up-grade. The bed was king-size. The room was very well appointed and comfortable. The toilet was a delight. Never experienced anything like it. The hotel is close to Ginza and Shimbashi station. The hotel is very tastefully decorated. The lounge area is very quiet and pleasant. The jazz performance at night was a treat. The concierge was very helpful and efficient. The most impressive feature was that the staff were extremely courteous, helpful and well-trained. Do not miss a visit to the Tsukji Fish Market. It is amazing.Also, the limousine bus worked very well for us being airport to hotel door. Saved lugging suitcases around.Overall, we had an excellent stay at this lovely boutique hotel. It is highly recommended.

<Content>Fantastic value and great location We stayed at the Park Hotel Tokyo for 3 nights and thought it was great. It was in a very safe location which was just 5 mins walk away from the shops in Ginza. Our room was on the 29th floor and had great views. The room was a good size, considering it cost only 拢80 per night for a double room. The toiletries provided were great, as were the free toothbrush, hairbrush, razor, and also the tea/coffee. We did hear some faint noise from the train station but it didn't bother us.We found it quite easy to navigate our way from the room to the main streets. Simply take the lift to the Lobby, then walk across the Lobby, and take either one lift to the main entrance of the building or the other lift to the subway. Even jetlagged we were able to work it out. My only complaint was the breakfast we bought on our first morning in the Hotel Lobby restaurant. It cost 5000 Yen for 2 continental breakfasts, which was more expensive than any other meal we had in Japan! The next morning we went to the cheaper 'News Art Cafe' on the ground floor of the building, which cost 650 Yen for a coffee and croissant.We also appreciated the free internet access on 2 computers and didn't have any problem accessing them.Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone planning a trip to Tokyo. It is a modern, well located and well priced hotel.

<Content>Great experience We had chosen this hotel because of the good reviews in tripadvisor and were not dissapointed.We had a twin room on 28th floor for 5 nights. It was very clean. Small in size but totally sufficient to our needs. The view was amazing. The only downside was the noise from the trains, but the traffic calms down for the night. The service was exellent and no complaints about the stylish puplic interiors.We found the hotel location perfect for exploring the Tokyo and it was also easily accessible by foot and several train and metro lines.

<Content>Great hotel, good location We (parents and 12 year old boy) stayed twice in the Park Hotel in July, for a total of 5 nights. We had a corner room and it was plenty big - from the other reviews, sound like these are a lot bigger than the regular rooms. The bathroom was good, with plenty of toiletries, tootbrushes, razors etc. First introduction to heated toilet seats... We stayed on the 30th and 33rd floors with no noise from the trains, even though we were above the train lines. The hotel was great, and we throughly recommend it. For a first visit, the Airport Limousine from Narita stops right outside making travel easy - if you're more confident, its easy enough to take JR to Shimbashi, and then follow the pedestrian walkways to the Shiodome tower (download the map from the hotel's web site first!). The walkway to the 3rd floor of the Shiodome are easy to follow - the basement tunnels are more complicated and we rarely used them. There is a Family Mart in the basement, useful for food and other items. As other reviewers have noted, the surrounding buildings are full of restaurants of all types. The location is also good - lots of metro lines close, easy to get to Tokyo Station (though the fastest way seemed to be the JR lines from Shimbashi, not the metro), right beside the Yurikamome monorail that goes to Teleport, and easy walking distance to Ginza.The only disappointment was that there is no WiFi network (there is cable access for laptops in the rooms however). Also, the hotel is not for those who dislike heights, as it extends from floor 25 to floor 34 of the media tower. Would definitely stay again.

<Content>Intrusive train noise, and that hamster feeling The rooms here are beautiful, and the bathroom alone was half the size of many Japanese apartments. Add in the free internet service, free Herald Tribune under the door each morning, complementary coffee and tea, and the hotel deserves 4 stars. Now for the bad news. Our room faced the Shimbashi train station, and the noise was persistent and loud between 5 a.m. and midnight. A noise generating air purifier was cleverly left running to mask the noise, but did not help. Most frustrating for us was the location of the hotel, attached to the complex of buildings known as the Shiodome. This complex is reminiscent of one of those large hamster habitats, with a bewildering 5 level array of overhead and subterranean walkways. A planned stroll to the Palace gardens turned in to a 3 hour fitness program of stair climbing and many wrong turns. We seemed to always be on the wrong level and the numerous orientation maps placed at corners each have north pointing in different directions. Bono would love Tokyo, because it is a place where the streets have no names. Your first challenge is to exit the building. You cannot simply hop in the elevator and go out the front door. You must first descend to the lobby level on floor 25 and parade across the lobby to the elevators on the other side of the room. Mercifully, this hotel does not employ a legion of service workers bowing and chanting pleasantries as you pass in front of them. Once at the next bank of elevators, you must choose between the ones on the left that take you to the overhead walkway and main entrance or the ones to your right that also go to the subway levels. Even at the subway level you will be descending and climbing stairs in order to get through the bottleneck of the Shimbashi station. Whatever you do, do not try to leave the hotel from the main door entrance. The surface roads are all but impassible to pedestrians. You will spend your day climbing and descending long staircases. And Heaven forbid you should try to enter the nearby Dentsu building to use the escalator. You will cause a great deal of stress to the security guard whose job it is to keep people like you out of there. Like caged rodents it will take you several days to learn the best pathway to food and entertainment from your room. Perhaps some people thrive on this sort of complexity, but if your knees and brain are aging you may prefer simpler surroundings.Some advantages to the location include:Fantastic Miyazaki designed mechanical clock on the pedestrian walkway level. Plays an enchanting tune several times per day. Arrive several minutes before the scheduled performance time. Some people have posted the performances on Youtube.comMany low cost, high quality restaurants in the surrounding buildings. The Shimbashi station is on the JR Yamonote line. Day pass for the JR Yamonote line is only 730 yen. It circles Tokyo and takes you to most of the interesting neighborhoods.

<Content>Great inexpensive hotel This hotel kept popping up over and over on various sites and when myself and my partner checked it out we decided that we would go withit. The reviewers here are all correct, it is a great hotel! The rooms are small, but unless you're living in the room all day then you don't need them any bigger. The shower/bathroom was fantastic and the little extras (razors, toothbrushes etc.) were a lovely and well presented touch. The staff were also excellent, and there was never (at any time night or day) a shortage of them. The views from the hotel were also stunning.With regards to location, which some people had a gripe over, it's just at the edge of Ginza, going by some of the reviews we'd read we worried that the hotel was going to be in the middle of no where. This is not the case, it is less then a 5 minute walk to the department stores and shops or Ginza. The metros that were under or next to the hotel provided fantastic coverage. The only problem we had in terms of location was a cab driver didn't know where the heck to go but luckily we did.The services in the hotel were excellent. Each floor had a vending machine which was very handy and meant you didn't have to constantly stock up in the stores for water etc. The bar was beautiful but closed too early so we rarely went to it. We did avail of a massage and aromatherapy session which was a big highlight for both of us too. And the computers available for guests were great for keeping incontact with home (though sometimes were taken up for hours on end by business men).Only problem and it's very minor, is that the bed was incredibly hardbut by the time it started affecting our backs we were settled into our little room and didn't feel the need to push the issue any further.

<Content>Choose room with care Agree with most opinions expressed about this hotel but with one big caveat. I stayed on the 32 floor of the hotel and yes I know its Tokyo but the noise of the trains down below was a real intrusion from early morning to late night. Guess it doesnt help that the trains are on an elevated track but if you stay here suggest that you insist on a room facing away from the train track. Think the Tokyo Tower side is much better and quieter !!

<Content>Thanks TripAdvisor I researched the best place to stay in Tokyo on Trip Advisor while planning our trip and booked the Park Hotel. It was perfect! A well priced Design Hotel within walking distance of Ginza and Shimbashi. I've stayed in two more expensive hotels in Tokyo, but this is the one I will go back to my next trip!

<Content>Very good value for money I stayed at this hotel for 5 nights in June 2007. Rooms are just standard in terms of interior design. The lobby is beautiful. Service is excellent (everyone greets you with nods and bows, like a king). The lady working at Concierge desk was extremely helpful, and copied me detailed maps from a street directory to make the process of finding places easier.Location is a bit hard to find for first time travellers to Japan (but same goes for most places in Japan).The price was exceptionally cheap at 14,500yen per night. For the 4.5 star standards of this hotel, this was fantastic value for money.If it's your first time to Japan, you will find it a challenge. The Japanese cannot speak English. Street signs are in Japanese. It's very tiring and difficult to find places. And the subway lines are a maze.In Tokyo most of the streets do not have names, and so the address is conveyed as area number, block number, building number eg. Shinjuku 2-1-9. I recommend you get a detailed map from a Street Directory (not a tourist guide), and then it makes it easier to navigate to places. Always find out the address in terms of area number, block number, building number of whereever you are going.This hotel is located above the ShioDoMe (pronounced She Oh Doh May) subway station. The easiest way from the airport is to take the Limosine Bus (a normal bus) to Tokyo City Air Terminal for 30000 yen and then catch a taxi which will cost 20000 yen to the hotel.If you are getting the subway around, I found it easiest to use the Shidome subway station. The Shimbashi station (which was recommended by the hotel) is a long walk and difficult to find in the maze of the underground subway lines. The Shidome station is just outside the entrance from the hotel on Basement level 2.While in Tokyo, I recommend a visit to the basement food court of the Isetan department store in Shinjuku, the array of food offerings are amazing! Also a must is shopping and dining in Ginza, which can be walked to from the hotel. On Saturdays and Sundays they close off the 8 blocks, and it is a pedestrian street. The shops, restaurants and atmosphere is wonderful.

<Content>Really, really well thought out hotel I was really impressed with the hotel during my stay. I've stayed in lots of hotels in Tokyo before where I paid a lot more and got a lot less. The room was on the small side, but so thoughtfully designed that I really didn't notice. Bed was terrific - slept like a baby. Loved the Thann bath products from Thailand - will have to pick some up on my next trip to Bangkok. The adjoining Shiodome complex has lots of restaurants, Japanese and Western, and I tried one tonkatsu place that was really very good. Also, from the hotel as mentioned it is just a short 15-minute walk to Ginza (there is an excellent supermarket under Shimbashi station) where there is all the shopping and nightlife you'd want. It took me just 15 minutes to jog over to the Tsukiji fish market and I am not a fast runner. I loved how the Shiodome subway was right at my doorstep (that line could take you to Roppongi) and how convenient it was taking the airport limo bus. Two thumbs up for a great stay.

<Content>Strong positive - a few tips Based on the reviews from others on this site we stayed here in early June (07) - and were not disappointed. Not much to add that has not already been said - so I will offer some local pointers for those that would like to stay here: 1. The Limousine Bus from the airport stops and picks up at this hotel which is great. This bus is an excellent way to get to and from the airport - as cabs are very very expensive, and if you have a lot of bags, using the subway can be a challenge. You can easily find the ticket counters @ the airport when you arrive and the hotel will sell you a ticket at the front desk when you depart. 2. This hotel is two quick subway stops from the Tokyo (Tsukiji) Fish Market that is in many guide books. You need to get there very early but it is worth the trip in my mind. Unique and fun. But wear shoes that you are OK getting wet and mucking around in (It is an active fish market - not a tourist attraction). 3. For great sushi try Midori-zushi - remarkably reasonable prices given the quality. Note the sign is not in English but it we found it. It is in Ginza and very close to the Imperial Hotel. Address: Ginza 7-108, Ginza Korida-dori 1F. Open 11am-2, 5-9:30pm dailyWe would stay @ this hotel again on future trips.

<Content>Fantastic Deal Wonderful hotel! During our one week stay, we tried this hotel along with a ryokan. This hotel won by far for quality, view, experience and price. Getting to the hotel was a bit of a maze and found the outside walkway to be easier. Also liked the short walk to Ginza and the fish market.

<Content>Wonderful hotel, great location This is a wonderful hotel in a great area. It is located in the upper levels of the Shiodome Media Tower, directly above the train station. It is also a stop on the airport limo service to Narita. There is an elevated walkway between the tower and surrounding buildiings which allows for a pleasant walk above the busy streets. There are many good restaurants in the area and an easy walk to the Ginza shopping district. The room was well appointed and quiet with comfortable beds and nice views. The staff was extemely helpful with all our needs. We booked it through Tablet Hotesl for a great rate.

<Content>The Park Hotel gets the Nod. PINK Glasses says it all comprehensively ! I would say I found the overhead walkways easier at first than beavering away underground. The Park is ideal for JRpass users accessing the Yamonote line (and others) at Shimbashi.The staff professionalism and attention, the cleanliness, the toiletries, the free guest internet access outweigh the fact that the lobby can get a little smoke-filled at times.We stayed 5 nights and will certainly use this hotel again.

<Content>A GREAT Hotel I stayed here with a friend for a few nights on vacation and it was wonderful. The staff is great, even by Japanese standards, and we luckily had a room with a view of the Tokyo Tower. The room design is sparse but attractive, using nice materials. The internet was speedy and the location was convenient enough. It's a good 10 minute walk from the station but as it's accessible from the JR and Metro lines that's excusable, especially since the entire walk can be done across an elevated promenade. The lobby/lounge is a bit pricey for food but features jazz nightly and is a chill way to end a day. A GREAT hotel at a GREAT price.

<Content>The Park was a great choice We stayed at the Park Hotel in Tokyo during a three night stay in May 2007. The hotel is located in the Shiodome complex and was a little tricky to locate initially, however we were extremely pleased once we found it. The hotel is clean, quiet and modern, we got a very good rate. It is centrally located for train/subway access. We never needed a taxi as we walked or took the trains everywhere without difficulty. We did not eat at the hotel, there were a few resturaunts that we in the Shiodome complex for a quick breakfast. We did enjoy martinis at night in their bar which has a great view of tokyo at night. I would definately stay there when in tokyo again for business or pleasure.

<Content>Outstanding Service  We've just stayed 3 nights at the Park Hotel in Tokyo and I couldn't be happier with my choice.The tone was perfectly set on arrival, we got there around 11pm due to a late connecting flight and were very tired, but the check-in lasted less than 90 seconds. The lobby is stunning. The room is nice and cozy, a bit on the small side but nothing of a shock if you're used to other Asian cities like Seoul and HK. Great views from the 32nd floor. Need to mention that the toiletries are simply incredible, and the matress very very comfy. Location is the tie-breaker, though. Walking distance from the Fish Market and Ginza area, 3 metro lines plus the JR Yamanote take you in 15mins to anywhere from Shibuya and Omotesando to Shinjuku. The last morning we wanted to book a restaurant for dinner and when we got back in the evening to change clothes not only did we have our reservation confirmed but also 4 pages printed in colour from a gourmet website with pics of the place, the menu in English, directions for the subway and even a map in Japanese to show the taxi driver.What a pleasant stay. And it's really excellent value for Tokyo.

<Content>Here's the Dirt on the Park Hotel Was there last week and must say it is a very nice. Just keep in mindif you don't get a corner or a premium room you will be in a shoe sized room. I had a corner twin and it was very good sized but we didpeek in the other rooms so and they seemed very small. I found the info on this site to be very accurate regarding this hotel.You will be dealing with 4 levels when you stay at the Park.1. Lobby level which is on the 25th floor2. Overpass level that connect the hotel to surrounding builds and is a raised walkway over the street.3. Street level, there is a little construction going on there.4. Subway/underground.Between all these levels you will find at least 50 or so places to eat for high and low budget meals. I suggest you take an hour or two to look around all the levels. If you don't find that many eateries keep looking cause they are definitely there and wil save you abunch of $$$ with infinite food choices.Also the view is stunning from the lobby and if you have a premium or corner room it is just as good. But after you seen that view for a few days I suggest you walk over to the Conrad hotel right across the street, go to the lounge which is first calss all the way and the water view is stunning definitely worth the walk.The fastest way there is to take the NEX (Narita Express) from the airport to Tokyo station 54 minutes then a ten minute cab ride from the station to the hotel. wait and take the hotel bus and you will get there almost an hour later or maybe longer.Most important tip is to print out the map from the hotel website with street names and hotel info in Japanese. Everytime I wanted to go to the Hotel I just showed it to the cab driver would get there without any problems whatsoever. Used that map at least ten times to get back problem free.

<Content>Great place I want to chime in and reinforce all the good reviews that have been posted about this hotel. The hotel is very clean with an attentive staff. Although the rooms are relatively small, you don't feel cramped. And the floor-to-ceiling windows (we had an amazing view of Tokyo Tower and half of Tokyo) make them feel much larger. They are also unbelievably quiet. You never hear your neighbors or hall traffic; something I can not usually say for US hotels.The location is very convenient as it's only a 10-15 min walk to Ginza (tons of shops and restaurants) and only a 5 min walk to a shopping center (I recommend Vie de France as a bakery for those looking for European-style morning pastries). And there are 3 subway stops and 1 train station in the immediate area, so it's always easy to go where you want in Tokyo.We didn't try the restaurants due to cost, but the breakfast buffet was tempting just b/c of seeing it each morning in the beautiful lobby. On a side note, we exchanged a little bit of money at the hotel our first day to get us going, and the rate we got was within 1% of what we got at a bank the next morning. That might be something useful to know.Anyhow, trust the reviews. You can't go wrong staying here and you'll love it!

<Content>Top notch hotel in all ways Stayed for almost a week in Tokyo on my honeymoon, and selected the Park Hotel based solely on the reviews posted at Trip Advisor.First off, this hotel is extremely hard to find. Our father-in-law, even with a native car and Japanese navigation system, couldn't seem to locate the hotel and had to ask multiple people in the area. In fact, we spent a good 30 minutes in the vicinity circling around until we found it. The reason was that the hotel is part of a skyscraper, and is located on the higher floors. So the only thing pointing out that there's a hotel there is a small sign that was hard to see from the construction-crowded road.Once there, we took the quick and quiet elevator to the spectacular lobby. The view from behind the check-in desk was expansive, and the lounge was in a very open and cozy area with modern furniture and smiling hotel staff everywhere. Everything reeks of upper-class service and quality. For some reason, the entire hotel seemed to be exceptionally quiet...muffled even. White noise perhaps?The room is typical Japanese...that is, small. For those used to living in large suite hotel rooms in the US, get ready for a shock. Needless to say, everything was spic and span clean, but the actual room was barely large enough to fit the furniture.The TV was really like a 21 flat panel monitor from a computer. What was mildly irritating to me was the fact that virtually all the channels were Japanese. The only English channels were CNN International, CNBC i think and some various ones here and there. To make matters worse, they didn't compensate by offering much pay-per-view choices, nothing like the ones in the US. On the bright side, you could get quick previews of Japanese Adult Videos before they asked you to pay.The bathroom was immaculate with a toilet that required a computer science degree to fully enjoy if jets of water is your thing. Room service was pricey as to be expected. The food was quite good.The restaurants in the hotel were top notch and pretty expensive.The bathrooms in the lobby/lounge were, to quote my wife, the best bathrooms I've ever seen. For a germophobe like me, Japanese bathrooms are heaven.Part of the Shiodome complex, the building is actually one of a few towering modern skyscrapers in the area. The immediate vicinity are mostly businesses. If you go down to the subway level, there is a 24-hour convenience store with all manners of goodies...definitely not the 7/11s...we're talking pretty darn good food. On the subway level are some restaurants open only during business hours for some good quick cheap bites. Further along there's a Starbucks and a bookstore/stationary store.The subway system is quite complex and not for the faint of heart. However, everything is laid out with a logic that the Japanese are known for. The actual subway lines to get to attractions in the city is about a 10 minute walk that takes you through the Shiodome complex and down a subway area.All in all, I'd stay at the Park Hotel again in a heartbeat. And at the deal rate we got ($118 US), it was unbeatable.

<Content>Fantastic place - would recommend to anyone not bothered by heights! Booked this hotel after reading reviews on this website  so glad we did - what a great place. We were on a 3 day stopover on the way to Oz with our 2 toddlers. Hotel lobby on the 25th floor of the Shiodomemedia tower in the Ginza district of the city. Booked a superior room size was more than enough even with 2 cots, despite endless reviewsmentioning shoe boxed sized rooms. Also despite various reviewers having difficulty finding the place, we had no problem at all. We arrived at the airport too early for a limousine bus direct to the hotel so we got one to Tokyo station and then a short taxi ride to the hotel. I did give the taxi driver the map provided by the hotel website which is in english and japanese. Staff were very courteous and efficient. The views from the hotel lobby are amazing  we also had a fantastic review from our room on the 30th floor. There were lots of lovely toiletries and yes the biddet stye loo was an experience in itself! The local area does take some navigating  getting used to especiallyas there are lots of levels, i.e, underground trains, street level traffic, elevated pedestrian walkways. There is a 24hrs supermarket in the basement, easy to find,  the cafe on the 3rd floor of the tower is good for a quick bite. Lots of eateries in nearby towers  in the underground malls, best thing is just to explore  you will find.We visited Ueno park  saw lovely cherry blossom, easy to get there, public transport very efficient. A real gem of a find was a lovely garden about 10mins away from the hotel, begins with 'h....something rekki  can't remember name but lovely - reception will know it  a definite must for some peace  tranquility in such a busy place. Overall loved tokyo, loved the hotel, would DEFINITELY return.

<Content>Lovely Hotel. This hotel is a very very nice hotel. I booked this through the hotel website (something I don't normally do, as I usually use one of the last-minute discount hotel websites) and stayed for four nights.The hotel is very new and everything is impeccably clean. It is very central, with a short walk to Ginza and the JR line a 4 minutes walk and two other lines at the side door of the hotel. The lobby is on the 25th floor and the rooms are above, with an atrium in the middle.The room is small (average by Asian room standards), but not squashed. The price is less than a comparable room in, say, Hong Kong, Sydney, New York or Paris and the hotel staff are perfect.

<Content>A nice stay My wife and I stayed @ Park Hotel for 4 nights last week..The Park is an average 4-star property, stylish without being intimidating.Our room (a premium corner king bed, 29th floor) was good in size, very clean and had a fantastic view. The price was cheap in comparison to hotels of the same level in Italy, US or UK. The hotel is literally sorrounded by open air train and metro lines so it is almost impossible to find a 100% quiet room but I'm a very light sleeper and I could sleep very well.On the other hand the location is fantastic: you have direct access from the hotel to 3 metro lines and 2 train stations!Taxis and always available in front of the entrance and Tokyo station is a 10-minute ride.Breakfast: again, average in quality and price.Staff: helpful and very kind, like everybody in Tokyo. Check in/out took 3 minutes and went smooth.A good experience and I recommend this hotel.

<Content>Such disappoitment!! With hours research, my husband and I decided to stay at Park Hotel Tokyo this time because it got really good reviews and we really enjoyed our stay at other design hotels. Our experience with Park Hotel Tokyo is totally a disaster. We checked in around 9pm and found out that they didn't have the room we requested with king size bed, and the rate we got is for their standard room with queen size bed. This is just the beginning of 9 nights nightmare. After second night, we were finally told that we could stay at their standard room with queen size bed) or we have the option to pay more to get the room we requested, or we can check out and check in other hotel. The difference between the rate for their standard room and the room we requested is over $100/ per night. We couldn't figure out how the room rate could increase so much upon check-in (it should not have, we have the print out of the confirmation!!! The rate and room type request are all on it) Hotel insisted it is our travel agent's mistake and they spoke with our travel agent, and our travel agent confirmed it's misunderstanding (between? Hotel never clarified) We decided to stay at Park Hotel Tokyo and in the standard room AND not to waste our time finding out who screwed up our reservation because we just wanted to enjoy our vacation and didn't want to waste our time to pack up and move.The night before we checked out, we found out that our room rate is higher than what shown on our reservation confirmation. We were told that the rate we got is for one person and the new rate is for two people. My husband and I got so furious. Hotel has a copy of our reservation confirmation and it clearly states in the reservation the confirmed room rate and the number of guests staying at the room is two. We decided that we couldn鈥檛 let the hotel get away from changing room rate, so we requested the hotel staff to call our travel agent in front of us. After 1 hour long international phone call, the hotel agreed with AE travel agent and honored the rate. Will we stay at this hotel again? No!! To be fair, the location is good. This is the only good thing we can say about this hotel. .

<Content>Very good.....although toyko is a challenge for first timers! My husband and I stayed for 2 nights on our way to oz. Here is our summary of the hotel and my 'idiots guide to toyko' for those who go without reading a tour book properly!Hotel room: on the small size, but expected for a captial city, very nicely furnished, free internet, good range of free toiletries, very comfortable bed, nice duvet etcHotel service: excellent, always very helpful brought an iron to room etc, lots of staff around to help, free sweets in reception Hotel asthetics: very nice modern design, immaculate clean and tidy. View from room very good, we were very high. Also we didnt hear the trains through the nightHotel food: didn't try, no time, although bar looked very niceLocation: close to all subway stations, walking distance to main shops, plenty of nice bars and restaurants near by My 10 point guide to toyko if you are a first timer1. Dont tip2. Dont point your finger or shout3. Fold your napkin neatly after your meal4. Make sure you get an ENGLISH SUBWAY map before you leave your hotel5. Know where you are heading to eat/drink i.e. have a recommendation b4 hand as everything is in japanese (not suprisingly...so you cant tell a restarant from a karaoke from a internet cafe)6. In most areas you can only go in for a drink if you eat also7. Roppongi - we didnt like it, too cheesy and westernised8. Most restaurants and bars are up in the high rises soyou need to look on the lift menu to know where you are going9. Fashion - its quite smart/casual. Girls kitten heels with girly skirts and macs. Men jeans, pumps, trendy cardigans, pointy shoes.10. Sporadic rain storms, everyone carries umbrellas

<Content>Best Hotel in Tokyo Park Hotel is a great hotel! It was our cheapest and best hotel in Tokyo and Kyoto. Its in a great location - although it is hard to figure out how to get out of the hotel area the first time like someone else mentioned - but once you figure that out its perfect! Shiodome building has a ton of food choices available and a starbucks :) Its a close walk to the Fish market and to ginza. We stayed here our first 3 days in tokyo and then stayed in Shibuya after coming back from Kyoto. I missed this hotel the whole time we were at the others! Definitely pick this hotel if you are staying on that side of Tokyo!

<Content>If you love skyscrapers......you'll love it The Park hotel is a really amazing accomodation in tokyo, just 5 minutes from shinbashi JR and underground station, 10 minutes from Tsukiji Fish Market, Ginza's famous crossing is within walking distance, though the lobby is on the 25th floor and rooms are from 26th floor to 30th, so they have great views over tokyo skyline. All rooms have city view window and corridors overlook the void which spans from main lobby to the skylighted ceiling ( !!! )My room had LCD Tv, tea boiler, choice of pillows, armchair and obviously yukata! It is useless to speak about room cleanliness! It is really advisable to download the english map with direction from the unerground station to the hotel because it is not easy to understand at first glance where to go.We paid 130 euros taxes included (no breakfast) per night which is a quite good price considered the hotel level (it may be considered much more than standard four star accomodation). If you can afford 100 euros per night is is a good option to spend something more for having a lot more.

<Content>We love the Park Hotel Tokyo We stayed 4 days/3nights at the Park Hotel in November of 2006. It is a wonderful hotel and once you figure out your bearings it's very easy to get around by train or walking. There are great shops, bars and entertainment all around the Shiodome area. Getting around by train is very easy, just crowded during rush hour. The concierge were great, they spoke perfect english and did not laugh at our butchering of the Japanese language. Check in and out was a breeze and the prices for the mini bar were more than reasonable. The lounge/lobby area had wonderful jazz every night and the interior of the hotel is beautiful. I highly recommend the Park Hotel Tokyo, so much that we're going back in August of 2007 and we didn't even think twice about where to stay.

<Content>Wonderful hotel! Great hotel in a perfect location! We stayed here 3 nights.The JR station is only about a 10 min walk, only the first time it's a little bit hard to find,but then it's easy. I disagree that the Tokyo metro is confusing. It's one of the easiest metro systems to use. We come from Helsinki with only 1 metro line and we didn't get lost one single time. Also we took a taxi from and to the Tokyo station (because of the luggage we had) and the bill was only about 1000 yen, which is really cheap. Overall we found Japanese taxi prices to be quite cheap in comparision to Finland. In general we haven't found Tokyo or Japan to be very expensive.There are many great restaurants near the hotel. The service was very good and the room perfect.We had a double room on the 34.floor (last floor) with a view of the Tokyo tower. The room was big enough and so was the bed (normal European size bed) and the bathroom (plenty of space for one person). Both hubby and I are medium built, and we had plenty of space in the bed. One would really need to be quite large to fall out of the bed or not to find enough space in the bathroom.Also the room wasnt noisy at all. The view is really spectacular and it's worth spending a few yen more to get a room with Tokyo tower view.Internet surfing is free. Also,all the hotel stuff spoke good English.Even using the hotel phone (which we had to do before our rented mobile arrived) wasn't too expensive.The area is within walking distance of Ginza.Ah yes,one receives also a free newspaper (in English) every morning. For those who like to watch tv even while on vacation, forget about it, everything is in Japanese. But there is plenty to see and do in Tokyo, so you won't have much time for it anyway.The Tokyo tower could be reached on foot from the hotel,it's only about 2-3 km away, but best is to get there with the metro.

<Content>Perfect hotel for Tokyo This hotel was amazing. I normally stay at Starwood hotels, but the prices in Tokyo were just too outrageous this time. So we decided to try out this smaller hotel -- and we couldn't have been more pleased. The service was impeccable, the furnishings were great (rooms are small, but that's just Tokyo in general), and the location was amazing. It's a 5-minute walk to the fish market, so every morning we could have sushi for breakfast. So memorable! Plus the JR line and Metro lines are practically under the hotel.I would absolutely stay here again.

<Content>Excellent stay! The Park Hotel Tokyo is an oasis in the middle of Tokyo. The room was immaculate, modern and extremely comfortable. The location is excellent - about a 5 min walk to the JR Yamanote line Shimbashi station. The Tokyo subway system can be a little intimidating at first, and the JR Yamanote line was easy to use. We would definitely return.

<Content>Fascinating Park Hotel I have always stayed in Ginza area, which is close to the Shimbashi subway because I needed to travel out to Tokyo Big Sight. Since my usual hotel has increased in the room rates, I have decided to do some searching for some nearby hotels. Having read some great reviews of the hotel, I am amazed by the quality of the hotel service, it's family-friendly environment (we travelled in a group of 5 pax, including a boy of 12 years), especially the toiletries.... I have enclosed a snap shot of it. Trust me -- this is the first ever experience being pampered by a full range, including matching coloured bath salts.Well Done, Park Hotel. The best thing is, the hotel is located exactly outside the Shiodome Train Station, on Yurikamome line... which takes me directly to Tokyo Big Sight. Despite being so close to the train line, you can't hear anything (perhaps it's because the lobby is situated at the 25th floor of the Shiodome Media Tower). One impressive impression if you were to return from an evening outing... hang around at the lobby to check out the Tokyo Tower... whilst enjoying the live music on the weekends.Wonderful... just wonderful!

<Content>Fantastic hotel Park Hotel is located in Shimbasi,which reminds you of the Dockland,London but without the water.New area with high rise buildings and restaurants located at ground floors.Hotel was very easy to get to from Tokyo station, we took the JR line to Shimbasi and took the exit signposted Shimbasi exit.Walk across to an overground covered walkway (also lift available for those suitcases) and follow the walkway literally to the Hotel.It is a 7min walk.The walkway is safe,just like the rest of Tokyo.The hotel was very stylish and modern and you get complimentary pyjamas and slippers.The staff very courteous and friendly and reception area has a fine view of Mount Fuji on a clear day as its located on the 25th floor.Shimbasi is located next to Ginza which is the shopping district so we didn't find a 10 minute walk tedious at all.Not like some of the reviews.Would definitley stay there again.

<Content>Highly recommended We stayed at the Park Hotel for 3 nights en route to New Zealand and would highly recommend it. As others have noted, the location is excellent for public transport, including the Yurikomome monorail that goes out to the Odaiba waterfront area - a day ticket is well worth buying for 800 yen to hop on and off and explore this area (spectacular views back to the City at night, too).Many others have mentioned the 'small' rooms; we found our room perfectly adequate and, certainly, well designed - in fact, the whole hotel is stylish and comfortable. Breakfasts are easily bought from one of a number of coffee shops nearby and on our first night at the hotel, being pretty exhausted, we ate in the restaurant and did not consider our simple, but good, pasta dish too highly priced.As has been mentioned, the Limousine bus does not run to this hotel until around 2pm - on advice from the helpful staff at the Limousine counter, we took a bus to Tokyo Airport 'City' and then a taxi for the short distance to the hotel. The hotel concierge will book the return Limousine, store your luggage, if necessary, and deliver it to the bus for you. Typical of the superb service we encountered here.Finally, keep an eye on the view from the huge window behind the reception desk in the early morning - we were rewarded with a fantastic view of Mount Fuji glistening in the sunshine on two occasions.

<Content>Could be close to perfection, the noise of the subway is painful It could have been an excellent hotel , design hotel ,reasonable price, good location, interesting restaurants , helpful staffs, close to transportation, unfortunately the windows sound proofing could be better and with the hotel surrounded by the railway lines (including yamanote line , yurikamome , the Osaka shinkansen, ..) , the noise is too present for people like me. I asked to change room because of the noise which did not seem to be a surprise for the staff. The new room did not improved the situation and when i asked a second time to change, the staff confessed that there was not much things to do due to the location of the hotel .What a pity I will not come back

<Content>Good city hotel Have just spent three nights at the Park Hotel on a stop-over on the way to New Zealand.Overall i was happy with our stay here. Getting to the hotel was a bit of a challenge since we arrived at Narita airport early morning and the bus to our hotel did not leave until 2pm. Instead we got another bus to a nearby hotel and had the name of the Park Hotel written down in Japenese to show the taxi driver - this did not prevent him from taking us to two 'other' park hotels first.The hotel itself is new and located in the modern Shiodome complex. The entrance is on the ground floor but the hotel lobby is actually about 20 floors further up. The lobby / bar and reception do indeed give great views across the city. The conceige was very helpful and spoke good English.The rooms are small but as expected for Tokyo and a little stuffy. They all have a city view. They are well furnished with plenty of complimentary toiletries.The best thing about this hotel is location - pretty much sat on the subway and 5 mins from a metro station and just a bit further to Ginza district for shops/food etc. There is also a nice park with a tea house about 10 mins from the hotel. There are a number of restaurants in the other Shiodome (City) Tower on the 42nd floor, in particular 'En'.What i would not recommend is eating or drinking at the hotel. Breakfast was 2,500 yen - so instead we went out of the hotel on the 3rd floor to Tully's coffee shop - coffee and a bagel for 500 yen. We didn't dare use either of the two restaurants in hotel.Overall this is a good hotel for a few days in Tokyo and well worth the money.

<Content>Excellent value Stayed here for two nights, our first visit to Tokyo. The hotel is an excellent value for money, the room, although small, has everything you need (including free Internet) plus an excellent city view (guest floors start at 26th floor!). Location is good: 15 min walk to Ginza, 10 min walk to closest JR station and a subway station as you walk out the hotel. The area though is a brand new financial center, so don't expect too many dining options there, but again, Tokyo has an excellent subway network, so who cares. Speaking of dining options, these are endless in Tokyo. If you are looking for modern Japanese cuisine, head to Casita. Watch it, the address you'll find in most review websites (like Frommer's) is wrong. They've moved to La Porte Aoyama, in Aoyama St., check it in [--]. Excellent restaurant for a special dinner.All in all, we would definitely recommend this hotel to anybody traveling with his/her partner and looking for an upscale hotel.

<Content>Great location, convenient to transportation The best thing about this hotel is its extremely convenient location. Some people in a few other reviews commented that it was a bit far from a JR line, but it can't be more than five underground minutes away walking leisurely. That's hard to beat, really. It's also even closer to the Toei Oedo line, monorail line, and also a tokyo metro ginza line. That, and you can walk to the fish markets, ginza, and shimbashi easily. We ate once at the hotel, for breakfast, and wouldn't recommend it. They only had pretty disgusting western buffet style stuff, no japanese breakfast, and it was overpriced. You don't need to rely on the hotel though because there are tons of restaurants within walking distance in all directions.There is nothing spectacular about the hotel itself, but for this price you wouldn't expect there to be. It was clean, the staff were polite, and the views were nice(but most tokyo hotels I've seen are high up in buildings, so views arn't that rare in tokyo hotels). If you want to luxuriate for a little bit walk next door to the conrad and have a drink in the bar, the Conrad is supposed to be one of the best hotels in Tokyo. Oh, one word of caution. We were in a double room with two very small beds, and both my brother and myself were pretty much hanging off the beds.I'd stay here again as the location is hard to beat, but if I was after super luxury or really hip, I'd go elsewhere. It depends why you're in tokyo and how much time you plan to spend in the hotel, and who's paying.

<Content>Great last day in Tokyo It was a bit confusing to find the lobby due to construction outside, but the room was great. Very comfortable, excellent service, reasonable price, and comfortable bed. I was just spending 1 night after a 2 week trip to northern Japan and hadn't slept well the whole time. Man, did I realize the difference a good bed could make. From waking up around 5-6am to dragging myself out of bed at 8. I'd definitely recommend it and stay there again. The only part I wasn't crazy about was that it was a bit farther from the train station than I was hoping (about 10 min. walk). Otherwise great.

<Content>Good hotel...great price My wife and I just returned from a long weekend in Tokyo and the Park Hotel proved to be a great base camp for setting out to see the city. Conveniently located on top of the Oedo subway line, and a stones throw (2 min walk) from the Shimbashi JR line, hotel guests can easily access mass transit to anywhere in Tokyo (which has the best mass transit of any city I've been to...)As far as the hotel: sleek, modern, subdued, tasteful.The view: stratospheric! The hotel is on the 25-34th floors of the Shidome Media Center (Kyodo News Building). The atrium design of the hotel allows for every guest room to have a city view...The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. No complaints. The room: a bit small - par for the course in Tokyo I'm told - but clean and comfortable. The price was rather inexpensive as well: $186.00 US per night (including fees and tax)Oh yeah, and the minibar prices were fairly inexpensive too...not the usual gouge rates...impressive.There is a Lawson (7-11) in the basement...very convenient.We didn't eat in any of the restaurants in the hotel...but did eat at a great Thai place in Shinjuku called Ban Thai (near the Prince Hotel)...great food.I'm giving it ***** since it met my expectations and fulfilled every need on this trip. It's a good city hotel at a great price. If you are looking for a resort, you might find it a bit sterile...but then, if you are looking for a resort, you should go to Amanpuri in Phuket!Give the Park a shot...it will not disappoint!

<Content>Ok but nothing super-duper special I guess my expectations were too high after all the Tripadvisor praise - my one night stay last summer at Park Hotel was ok, but nothing memorable. No complaints though - everything was spot on and smooth. Nice view over Tokyo from the lobby, also nice view from the room. The room was uninspiring but functional, obviously spotless and modern. The crowd was very touristy and mixed. I did not try the hotel restaurants - so many great places to eat in in Tokyo.Must say the five nights I stayded at a ryokan (old-fashioned japanese inn) in Tokyo were much preferred to this lukewarm hotel experience. Sure, unfair comparison, but still. :) Also compared to other same class hotels I've stayed in all over the world this was not a memorable stay. It's a fine hotel and gets the job done. Great Ginza location, but in my opinion nothing overly special if you've stayed in good hotels before.

<Content>One of the best I've been a user of TripAdvisor for a few years now and there is no doubt that Park Hotel Tokyo is one of the best in hotel iv'e stayed. Tokyo is not a cheap place to visit but booking at this hotel was a big savings for my friend and I. The staff were GREAT. Directions, recommendations, anything you wanted to ask, they'll help you. Location is great. Close to the subway and cheap food just around the corners. Note: For Americans, the ATM on the basement does not take US ATM card. There is an ATM on the next building that works -- ask the concierge which building.

<Content>best ever this is an amazing hotel I highly recommend it to all visitors to tokyo. we got a great deal through trip advisor and travelocity we paid almost half than the usual rate. the hotel is superb. they were wonderful in customer service and extremely accomodating. Tokyo is a spotlessly clean city and the same is of the hotel. usually i'm a bit nervous about restrooms in hotels but here it was so clean you could eat off of the floor. the free ammenities in the bathroom were great also. we took the advice from the past reviewer of not eating in the hotel cause it could drain your wallet fast so we walked around and found cheap eats all over. we especially love the lunch specials. and about the getting around the hotel, sure the first day it was allittle annoying because of construction but after that we found the above ground walkway which connects you to the subway and jr train it's was so simple. the hotel is located in ginza which we come to find out from other english speaking tokyo-ites that it's where stuffy salary men and snobs of tokyo live. but we didn't mind since the hotel was so great. we took the jr all over. easy easy. then again we are from brooklyn so we don't mind train rides and transfering. once again dont hessitate to book at the park hotel tokyo.

<Content>An extraordinary experience This is a gem! When we first stepped in we couldn't believe that we could afford such beauty, functionality and nature all combined together. If you like architecture you will love the lobby from where you can see Tokyo from the 25th floor and have drinks while listening to Jazz music most of the nights. It was excellent! Our room felt like home with all the modern amenities and great views of the city. The staff are extremely helpful and pleasant although I believe we were the only backpackers in the hotel. What amazed me was the art gallery in the lobby. There are amazing art items all around and a huge tree on the wall which matches wonderfully with the two live olive trees in the lobby . I would recommend it to all! This is the best hotel we have ever stayed.

<Content>Stylish With Excellent Service And Attention To Detail The Park Hotel Tokyo was an excellent hotel that was suprisingly affordable.The Park Hotel Tokyo is a newer hotel that occupies the top floors of a building in the recently build Shidome complex which is located just below the popular Ginza neighbourhood in Tokyo. The hotel is directly connected to the Shidome Subway stop which is on the Toei Oedo Line which my girlfriend and I found was an excellent starting point to go to the various neighbourhoods in Tokyo. Most sights are a maximum of one transfer away. A little further walk can get you to the Shimbashi Station and another metro line that is useful for taking you to other areas of Tokyo directly.The hotel is very modern in design and had a truly boutique feel about it. The view from the hotel lobby on the 25th floor is stunning and features an excellent view of the Tokyo Tower and Mt. Fuji. The check-in process is effortless and the staff is very accommodating and always provided quick and useful advice on issues ranging from restaraunt suggests to directions to timetable information for the Narita Express trains.The rooms are an adequate size and well furnished with a flat screen TV, a mini bar and an in room safe. The entire hotel is spotlessly celan. The bathroom is effecient and supplied with nice amenities such as toothbrushes, razors and soaps and shampoo.We ate in the asian themed restaraunt and it was good but quite expensive, especially when compared to the countless local restaraunts that are scattered through many of Tokyo's neighbourhoods.There is a convenience store in the basement of the building on the way to the subway that is open 24 hours. There is also a Starbuck's coffee shop and a variety of restaraunts in the basement of the building which looked good but we didn't have a chance to eat there. It looks like their hours are mostly oriented towards catering to the office workers lunches and dinners.As for booking, I found that the best rate was avaiable through Tablet Hotels but there was a service fee added to our bill which could have made it on par with booking directly through the hotel's website (to be honest I didn't look into whether it would be added by hotel as well). Regardless, my average rate was $200 Canadian which I think is reasonable for the quality of the hotel in Tokyo.I would stongly recommend this hotel to people looking for a stylish hotel in Tokyo at a resonable price. It is particularly attractive if you are unintimidated by using the subway which is, in my opinion, the best way to get around and to see Tokyo. Those used to the London or New York subways will have no trouble using the Tokyo transit system. In fact, it is the best marked system I have ever experienced. This is particularly true when paired with the Tokyo Handy Guide that the concierge (the woman that works there is excellent) gave us.I would definitely stay again at the Park Hotel Tokyo when I return to further explore the amazing city of Tokyo.

<Content>Very pleasant stay at the Tokyo Park Hotel Based on the excellent previous Tripadvisor reviews, I spent 2 nights in the Park Hotel in Tokyo. The hotel experience has even exceeded our expectations. The hotel is very modern and conveniently located near various subway stations and the Ginza shopping district. The staff is not only friendly but highly knowledgeable and professional. Two advices:1. If you are staying during winter-time, request an air-humidifier as the air in Tokyo is extremely dry.2. Try to ask for a room on one of the higher floors with a view on the Tokyo tower.

<Content>Highly recommended! The Park Hotel is a really good value hotel and the service you receive is impeccable! The lobby area is stunning with amazing views over Tokyo to the tower and the bridge! Rooms are also well-equipped and comfortable.We ate in both of the restaurants too, both of which are really good - but there are far better restaurants in Tokyo so ask the concierge to recommend some. Restaurant called Ukai-tei highly recommended for the most amazing Japanese steak/teppanyaki! Finally, location is pretty good too. It's a short walk into the Ginza shopping district with loads of fabulous shops, bars and restaurants. Subway directly next to hotel too.Highly Recommended!

<Content>Thanks Trip Advisor - A Great Hotel We chose to stay at the Park Hotel Tokyo based on the information from Trip Advisor and it was a great decision. The hotel is absolutely lovely and the staff was more than accomodating. Our room was small - but we didn't expect nor need a lot of space. It was sort of like being on a cruise ship - everything had a place and a purpose. The views from our room were fabulous - day and evening. It was very very quiet - hard to believe that anyone else was staying on our floor. We ate breakfast every morning in the lobby and it was quite good and we had dinner one night in the Japanese restaurant. It was incredibly good and the service was impeccable. The location was especially convenient. We couldn't have had a better experience and would recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Tokyo.

<Content>Height of Luxury Myself and a friend stayed at the Park Hotel on our way back from Australia in July 06 (taken me a while to get round to writing this entry!). It was a great stay from start to finish. The staff are very friendly, speak almost fluent English and are willing to help with your every need. The view from the lobby is absolutely amazing and far outshines the views from Tokyo tower which we visited on one of our tours of the city. The rooms are clean and we felt more than large enough for a few nights stay. A large array of toiletries are provided as well as tea and coffee making facilities. We didn't eat at any of the restaurants, but there is ample choice of places to eat in the shopping mall which can be accessed from the ground floor of the hotel. Contrary to some other reviews on this hotel I would say that it is well placed for exploring Tokyo. We used the subway which was easy to find and navigate, although buying a ticket without the help of a friendly Japanese man who took pity on us would have proved difficult! I think the only small quibble we had was that we had problems getting to the hotel, as it was confused with the Tokyo Park hotel. However, after reading the reviews on this site before we left we were aware that this may happen and were eventually transported to the correct hotel! Something to bear in mind but not something that should deter you from visiting this brilliant hotel, which as far as we were concerned was quite reasonably priced for a city like Tokyo.

<Content>Best Hotel Value in Tokyo BY A MILE! The two hotel mistakes a Tokyo tourist can make is (1) spend a not-so-small fortune and (2) stay in a hotel that isn't convenient to the invaluable and super-easy-to-use Tokyo subway/train system.A good Tokyo hotel can easily cost $300, $400, or more a night. I was really worried that at roughly $155 a night, the Park Hotel would be a dump. Boy, was I wrong. It is a sleek, modern, new, immaculately clean, trendy, and gorgeous hotel. Anything under $200 a night is a bargain in Tokyo and I can't imagine that there is a better bang for the buck anywhere in the entire city of Tokyo. The hotel is very close to one of the main subway lines and an easy 8-10 minute walk to Shimbashi station, which makes it a snap to get to all the other popular areas: Roppongi, Shinjuku, Meiji, Akihibara, Tokyo Station, and Shibuya. I can't emphasize enough how critical it is to choose a hotel that is close to a subway/train hub. This hotel is also within easy, easy walking distance to the Ginza and the Tsukiji fish market. Both of those are absolute must visits. By the way, the only reason to get to the Tsukiji fish market before 6:00 is if you want to see the actual auction process. I found the post-auction process the most interesting. Things like carving up the monster tunas, strolling the colorful seafood stalls, and watching the elaborate engine of sushi commerce in action. My advice is to sleep in a little and arrive around 7:00 AM instead. The only negative is the size of the room. They are indeed small. It was no problem for me because I was traveling by myself, but I the size would be a serious problem for anything more than 2 people. Don't bring a family here. The hotel restaurants are good but expensive. Take advantage of the Family Mart store in the basement. Family Mart is the 7-11 of Japan and has drinks, snacks, and cheap-but-delicious bento boxes to eat. Unless you're rich and have money to burn, this is the VERY, VERY, VERY best deal in all of Tokyo.

<Content>Perfect Stayed here for 6 nights in mid-November in a standard double room.The rooms may be small but they are so well laid out. Absolutely everything you could want, exactly where you need it. The lobby is awesome and the views aren't too bad, either.The location is fabulous. A short walk from the lifts to subway and train networks or just step out onto the streets of downtown Tokyo.This hotel is amazing value for money - although we didn't eat or drink in the hotel. You can eat with the Japanese under the railway tracks for a tiny fraction of the price.

<Content>Great Deal Stayed at the Park Hotel Nov 21 to Nov 27, as indicated in previous reviews. Conceige was helpful. They gave maps of subways, directions and recommended routes with options. (we should have utilized them more.) Would I stay here again - Yes. And the lobby, yes is very quiet, dragging your stuff on the nice wooden floor is not adviseable. Not the hotel for your if you're looking for cultural ambience scene. And you want to smooze with the locals.Room size was was great - premium room with seating. (paid 3,000 yen for extra bed.) They converted the seating to a fold out bed. (for my 13 yr old dau and her 12 yr girlfriend.)Toiletries includes -shampoo, conditioner, body gel, soap, razors, bath salt, wash scrub, q-tips, makeup cloth and nail file, toothbrush and paste, body lotion and a hairbrush. They have a blow dryer, pajamas, terry cloth robes, slippers, tv, nice room lighting, radio, tv (and lan available.) Bed was comfy, no tower view, but thats ok. I was more pleased with the room size. I've stayed at Shinjiku Washington Hotel - now that is small.Didnt get the pillow fitter service as raved in other reviews.They have excellent complementary coffee and tea for your morning dose.We didnt eat at any of the hotel restaurants or used the other hotel services.Recommendations: Check your bearing. We probably should have checked out the Carretta Bulding - several reviews indicated that there are shops and restaurants on 1st and basement floor. Japan has great food. Wish we had more. I kinda feel like I didnt eat as much as I should have. I notice the Via La France (which isnt too bad of a walk about 5 minutes. Shibashi station is another 7 minutes from there. We took JR to Akihabara - and that was another 3 minute from there. (in route we found a great food store - grocery, bentos, fine candies, cakes, all kinds of food things you could picked up.) Fine Foods Fair (I think was the name) We even went back the morning of the day we left.In the same building as Via La France - 2nd floor they have around 12 restaurants all in a row. I was told by hotel that the restaurants areon the 41 and 42 floor of that building. Usually last order for restaurants are around 9:30 pm so had to eat at the English Pub twice - and do the prime-rib thing. Prices is not as cheap as you'd like it to be, but not bad.We found the am/pm store and went there the first three nights - finally found the Family Mart store (yes, the Family Store is very close (just right out side the hotel.) Hotel has two elevators. If going the subway and trains easier to switch elevators on the 1st floor - security guard will help you. (they look stiff but very helpful. (the elevator is hidden behind a wall. (but thats your ticket to get below ground level.Did a walk to Ginza from the Park Hotel. With baby and stroller. A test of endurance to walk through the constructed overpass. I'm sure it would have been a better walk without the staired overpass.

<Content>chic and modern, with a perfect location Like the other reviewers here, we had a wonderful time for five nights at the ParkThe hotel is located in a new complex of skyscrapers at the southern tip of Ginza, with two railway stations within the complex:L an easy walk to the centre of of Ginza or easy access to anywhere in Tokyo via the trainsThe hotel itself is clean, modern, and chic with a great central atrium. It is slick -- some have said sterile but i diasagree -- and the staff are professional and courteous, with excellent EnglishThe rooms are not large but you are in Tokyo after all!Highly recommended

<Content>A really lovely hotel There is not really much to add to the other recent reviews on this hotel. Excellent value - where could you stay in London at the same price? I did not mind the room size - in Tokyo what do you expect? In every way this hotel far exceeded my expectations. They know how to do service without servility. I think the best thing is how relaxed and comfortable you are made to feel. The decor ( I am a bit of a minimalist, I confess) is an absolute delight and the quality of light and sense of space in the atrium is just superb.On top of all this, the location. In 2 days we were able to walk to most of the central sights (site?) and also take the train out of the city.Just great!

<Content>excellent place to stay If you're looking for somewhere to stay in tokyo, that's modern, trendy, clean, accessible and not ridiculously expensive, this is it. The rooms are quite small (but that's tokyo) but they've got amazing views, comfy beds and are all newly decorated and modern. The communal areas of the hotel are great and there's a few shops in the basement too. You can walk to lots of places (incl, ginza) but for everywhere else, you are basically on top of a tube so you can go anywhere really easily)If you're planning to go anywhere to eat or sight see (we were going to football in yoykahama and on to kyoto) the guest services/concierge where just aobut the best I've ever coem across in man yyears of staying in much more expensive hotels all over the world. they're well worth using. Totally recommended.

<Content>Excellent location Having read previous reviews we booked a superior room. It was well worth the extra - fantastic views, bags of room and a superb bathroom. The location was excellent. Near the park, walking distance to the Ginza district and many restaurants. We only had breakfast in the Hotel, which was very good and varied. All the staff were very friendly and obliging. Will certainly stay at the Park Hotel next time we visit Tokyo.

<Content>The best value for money in Tokyo We stayed here for 3 nights at the end of October. I was happily impressed (after having read other reviews) with the size of the room. It was compact but comfortable and well designed and it had a fantastic view. The room and other facilities were spotless and the service was very good as well. The area is very convenient for central Tokyo. Good connections for trains and metro.Fantastic value for money. I would recommend this place and stay there if I go back to Tokyo.

<Content>Great place to stay Would thoroughly recommend the Park Hotel if you are looking for a hotel in Tokyo. We stayed in October for 2 days and had a really great time. The room was very well designed although not that big. The bathroom had one of the great Toto electric toilets, a real experience if you have not been to Japan before.The location is really good, there are a number of good sushi restaurants within walking distance or if you are loooking for something a bit smarter you have the great Gordon Ramsey restaurant at the Conrad over the road.

<Content>Stylish but good value hotel in central Tokyo I stayed here for three nights on business in November 2006. Great hotel for the price - if I were to come back for a holiday I would choose to stay here again. English speaking staff greeted me the moment I walked into the lobby on the 25th floor and asked if I needed to check in, also offered to help with anything after they had showed me to my room. I really liked the atmosphere in the lobby with the bar/breakfast area. I stayed here on my own which sometimes as a woman can be a bit lonely and intimidating. But here I felt very at home - due to the helpful staff and mix of guests: some businessmen frantically preparing for tomorrow's presentation over a beer, some tourists, some Japanese (but not many). The French Restaurant, run by chef Teteru Yoshino, deserves a mention. I entertained 5 Japanese businessmen here and the staff were very helpful in setting it up, providing special menus, etc. The food is good french 'nouvelle cuisine' - beware, the portion sizes are quite small so I think my Japanese colleagues felt a bit short-changed and ate lots of bread. The food is good but not great - this restaurant would not get a Michelin star (although the chef's Paris restaurant Stella Maris has one). And my room had a fantastic view of Tokyo Tower - what more could you ask for?

<Content>Wonderful stay!! From JR Shimbashi station it's a small trek. The hotel map is sort of confusing. When you get of JR Shimbashi station, follow the signs going to the Yurikamome Station. This station is directly across from the entrance to the hotel building (triangular shaped skyskraper). The staff was very courteous and there was free internet access (this was helpful in looking up directions in english to places the staff may not know about - e.g. Parasite Museum in Meguro). It was walking distance to Tsukiji Fish Market and Ginza. The JR Shimbashi Stn is a little bit of a walk, but if you have a JR pass then this gives you all access to Tokyo (via JR Yamanote). The buffet breakfast was pricey (5200JPY for 2 people). However, the rooms were very clean, the amenities were very nice and there was a Family Mart close to get water, bento boxes, snacks etc... There is also a famous MOS Burger (limited menu) nearby (1st floor around the corner from Tully's Coffee). This hotel made our first stay in Tokyo, Japan very pleasant.

<Content>Very Nice Stay We stayed at the Park Hotel Shiodome October 27-30, 2006. We generally agree with the positive reviews. High quality room (not large but this is Japan), and we had great city views of the Tokyo Tower and surroundings from the 28th floor. Found a very high level of service from greeting us at ground level and taking us to check in on the 25th floor. Staff at desk had fluent English. The room has nice amenities, and as said by others nice to get an English newspaper (International Herald Tribune combined with English version of Asahi Shimbun.) We booked over the internet for 17500 yen per night, not particularly cheap but not bad for Tokyo.It is a bit confusing to find (especially at ground level) because of construction right now, and it is across from the somewhat similarly named Royal Park Hotel. Like others we had some trouble navigating at first until we found that if you exit at the 3rd floor, you can exit turning left to reach an upper level walkway that takes you past the Royal Park on your right, then you turn left to reach Shimbashi station which has the Yamanote rail and Ginza subway lines. If you take the escalator down near the Royal Park there are restaurants and shopping. Also on the 3rd level if you go right past the new yurakicho sky train station you reach the Pedi Shiodome which has some very nice restaurants and coffee shops which we frequented. We also ate in the underground by Shimbashi station. We did not eat in the hotel, though on the ground level there is nice cafe, Cafe Des Artes.We have stayed at Keio Plaza in Shinjuku previously and the ANA in Roppongi. While the ANA is a superior hotel, we found the Park to be good value for the money. Unlike another reviewer we did mind being a little out of the action, and having a bit of a quiet retreat in a smaller more boutique like hotel. We would happily stay there again.

<Content>Nice but a bit sterile, with smaller rooms I stayed in the Tokyo Park Hotel at Shiodome (not to be confused with several other Park hotels) for 6 nights on business. As other reviews note, it can be difficult to find if arriving by cab (the roads are very complex and under construction) or by train (the train station/office complex is huge). Best bet for arrival is by limousine bus from the airport.The entire hotel, from lobby to restaurants to guest rooms and bathrooms is beautiful and immaculately clean. It no doubt helps that the hotel is only 3 years old. The rooms are well designed and quiet, and have especially nice attention to amenities in the bathrooms. Beds were very comfortable and there is excellent attention to lighting control in the rooms.The location in the Shiodome area is very convenient for easy transportation to almost everything in Tokyo (or outside Tokyo, for that matter). The hotel connects directly to the Shiodome station for Toei (newer, private) subway line and the Yurikomome elevated train to Odaiba; and it is a 10 minute enclosed walk to the Shimbashi station for Tokyo Metro subway and JR station (Yamanote line as well as several other lines, e.g., to Kamakura). It's only a few minutes by train to Tokyo station for the bullet train. As others have mentioned, it's also about a 15 minute walk to Ginza, Tsukiji fish market, etc.The downside of the location is that taking a cab to the hotel is quite difficult. It's essential to pick up one of their map cards to show the driver. Also, the Shiodome complex is sterile -- full of office buildings and chain stores. Although the enclosed nature of it is convenient when hot or rainy, it can also be claustrophobic, like living in a shopping mall.You may be wondering: why is the hotel so much less expensive than other top hotels in Tokyo, especially since it is new and beautiful? I think there are two reasons: the rooms are relatively small for a luxury hotel, and the hotel provides relatively few services, compared to 5-star hotels. The regular rooms with king bed allow very little room apart from the bed. I stayed in an upgrade corner room which had a separate small sitting area, but it was still fairly crowded, even for just one person. It would be fine for two people, but would probably feel quite small if a child were added (and would be impossible for more than 3). On the other hand, you're likely not to spend a lot of time in the room anyway. One thing to remember, though, is that extra room is very nice when one or more family members suffers jet lag and wakes at 4:00am.As for services, there are many things the hotel does not have: a fitness center, a pool, business services (apart from a couple of computers), a variety of restaurants (only two), etc. Those things are probably of main concern to business travelers. For instance, I needed to make more business cards, which they could not do, unlike other hotels I've visited in Tokyo.Finally, the open atrium style architecture of the hotel (a 10-story high open central space) is dramatic and lovely, but it has a drawback -- one feels as if on display. Eating at the main breakfast area in the lobby, one sits at the bottom of the open area. All sounds are magnified by the echo chamber effect and the hard wooden floors. I felt like I should not talk (it echoes all over) and must walk quietly. When I dropped an umbrella, it resounded loudly throughout the restaurant area. (FWIW, a better place to sit for breakfast is in one of the side rooms, which also have views). So it definitely could feel awkward coming or going through the lobby with boisterous children.In short, is it a good deal? Absolutely. Is it a good location? Yes, very much, as long as you get out of the Shiodome complex. If traveling alone, I'd be happy to stay there again. However, it is not really fair (or the intention of the hotel) to be compared against five star hotels with complete range of services and spacious rooms.

<Content>Great hotel We only stayed for one night in the Park Hotel on a layover, but our short experience was great. As other reviews have stated, this hotel is located in a business area, but a short walk to Ginza, the fish market etc. The staff was exceptional, rooms were immaculate. We would definetely stay there again.

<Content>Great Hotel in Tokyo We stayed in the Park Hotel, Tokyo for 3 nights at the beginning of October 2006. The hotel is in a great location in the center of Ginza with easy access to the metro, shops and restaurants. The hotel itself is located above the 23rd floor giving the rooms a great view of the city, our room had a spectacular view over the bay. The room was small but very clean, comfortable and modern (LCD TV, Toto, nice products). The staff were very friendly and helpful and there was a very nice looby bar which had live music most nights. Highly recommended.

<Content>Nice upper end place Very nice hotel, but rooms are small and area is newer live/work type. Be sure to get the larger room and have breakfast included as it is $25 if you pay. Nice food due to the French Chef on staff, but pricey. Doesn't feel like Japan hotel, more like a contemporary Hilton. If you want to feel the city vibes and eat close by at more authentic restaurants, don't stay here. If you want out of the hustle more modern surroundings, this is your place.

<Content>Highly Recommended!!! I stayed at this hotel for four nights and I have to say that it was the highlight of my trip to Japan. The view from our window was breathtaking- worth every penny.The room itself is beautifully furnished and spacious compared to many of the other hotels I visited. Everything seems to have a designer touch from the toiletries in the bathroom, to the style of the room, and not forgetting the wonderful lobby. I would recommend the breakfast as a special treat...not too badly priced and a wonderful selection. Staff was also incredibly friendly and helpful without ever beign intrusive.The hotel was in a great location, we were surrounded by futuristic skyscrapers and walkways but only 10 minutes from the Imperial Palace and Ginza. Loads of great places to eat and very safe.I would definitely recommend at stay at this hotel. I have stayed in lots of top-class hotels around the world, but this one really stands out in terms of design, luxury and value for money.

<Content>Great Rooms, Sterile Location The hotel is a real bargain. I booked directly through the hotel's website and paid around 拢80 a nights. The room was fairly large and had a great view of the water and surrounding skyscrapers. Decor was modern and everything was top quality and up to 4* standard.The transport links are also very good. Shimbashi station (on the Yamanote line is about 10 mins walk away through underground tunnels and Shiodome station is a few hundred metres away. The hotel is a short cab ride from Tokyo station with the Narita express out to the airport.The downside for me is that the hotel is in a characterless (although upmarket) business district. Reception is on the 25th floor of an office building. In the evening the ground level is totally deserted except for a roving security guard and did not feel at all welcoming. The lobby itself had no atmosphere and at 11pm on a saturday there were just 4 people in the lobby bar. Under the hotel are long spotlessly clean underground passages leading to the subway. Very few people around at night. It feels totally safe, but a bit isolated. If you want somewhere to escape all the hustle and bustle of Tokyo then this is fine. Personally, I think the crowds and energy are part of Tokyo's appeal and I'd rather stay closer to the action in somewhere like Shinjuku.

<Content>I've stayed here twice in three weeks - highly recommended! My husband and I stayed at Park Hotel Tokyo - which I'd chosen based on tripadvisor.com reviews - the first week in October while on holiday, and we couldn't have been more pleased. As I pen this using the complimentary Internet hook-up in my room, I am just wrapping up my second stay this month (this time on business). Excellent value for money. Shimbashi station is about a 10-minute walk (15 minutes when stopping at Starbucks ;), while the Oedo subway line - which I've used several times to get to such places as Roppongi - is accessible through the one hotel elevator that descends to B1 (basement 1). (The hotel has four elevators; the one on the right side, farthest from the reception desk, is the one to take to B1.) You exit into an underground hallway with restaurants; go straight out and through a revolving door, and you'll see a Family Mart convenience store on your right. Keep going, and you'll exit into an underground pedestrian walkway. Look for signs that will direct you to the Oedo line. One trick to get back to the hotel using the same underground access is to follow exits 7 and 8 from the Oedo line exit....you come out of the subway area, take a sharp right and go up an escalator. The Park Hotel Tokyo entrance is up ahead on your right (turn left and through the sliding glass doors for Starbuck's, Mailboxes Etc., convenience store with water, etc.)When my husband and I arrived for our first stay in early October, we were intent on walking to the hotel from Shimbashi station using the hotel's on-line map that I'd printed. We failed miserably - and we laughed when I remembered the one reviewer who said he is a savvy traveler (as are we) and his best advice was to take a taxi. We solved the problem later! When reading maps conveniently posted all around Japan, be sure to look for the symbol that denotes which direction is north. Turns out that maps on display here are oriented in the direction you are facing! And the map we'd consulted in Shimbashi station had North pointing down.Incidentally, my colleague reports that the Business Center on the main floor by the reception has two computers connected to the Internet with free access and printing.We bought breakfast items in a convenience store instead of having the hotel breakfast. When we asked for bowls/spoons for our cereal, they were promptly delivered to our rooms.Also, if you like to exercise, this hotel doesn't have a fitness center. The front desk has a 1-mile-circuit jogging map, though. It's a simple, rectangular route. I would have preferred a fitness center, but the difference in room rates for another, untested hotel would likely not have been worth one.Also, when we asked the front desk personnel to help us plan how to arrive at our various meetings this week, they were more than helpful, showing us on a subway map which lines to use, etc.

<Content>Fantastic!! My wife and I picked this hotel on the basis of the ratings and reviews on Tripadvisor, and we were NOT disappointed.Room: The room we had was smaller than the typical North American hotel room, but you quickly become accustomed to it; it is Tokyo after all! It was super-clean and had FREE high-speed Internet access. Also, the room and the hotel, in general, were super-quiet; even the elevators were silent.Friendly Staff: The hotel staff were some of the most friendly and helpful people we have ever encountered at a hotel anywhere. One evening I called housekeeping to request an ironing board; no sooner had I put down the phone, then the doorbell rang. The front desk and concierge made restaurant reservations for us, and provided us with maps. The hotel kept our bags over the weekend, when we took a side-trip outside of Tokyo. Everyone at the hotel understands and speaks English.Location: We thought the location was really convenient. I actually appreciated that the hotel was in an office district and was removed from the bustling shopping and entertainment districts; it was a nice refuge at the end of long day of shopping and sight-seeing. There is a convenient underground concourse that connects the hotel to the Shimbashi train/metro station; it is about a 15 minute walk from your room to the station, and you never have to go outside. From Shimbashi, you are just two stops from Tokyo Station, which is the main Japan-Rail hub for the bullet trains. Directly beneath the hotel is the Shiodome metro station. This stop is on the Oedo line, which also has stops at Roppongi and Shinjuku; you don鈥檛 even have to change trains.Getting to/from Narita: You can take the Japan Rail train from Narita to Tokyo station; then take the JR line to Shimbashi station. If you鈥檙e adventurous and don鈥檛鈥?have a lot of luggage you can try to navigate the underground concourse to Shiodome Media Tower; just keep looking for the yellow and black English signs that will point you in the correct direction.Food: We took the advice of other reviewers and grabbed croissants and yoghurt for breakfast at the French-themed bakery (I can鈥檛 recall the name.) in one of the nearby office-tower concourses. There was also a Starbucks close by (I think it was in the same building.).Fish Market: You must visit the fish market, and you must do so before 7 a.m.! You can indeed walk to the fish market in about 15 minutes with a good map. I could on鈥ut basically if you are looking for a clean, quiet and modern hotel that is close to transportation and has extremely friendly staff, then stay Park Hotel. Whenever we return to Tokyo we will only stay at Park Hotel.

<Content>great experience I stayed this hotel for 4 days. It was a pleasant experience. Every morning I could read English newspaper .And complimentary tea and coffee was good.Staying in Japan for a English speaking traveler is tough experience sometimes. Even in hotel you may feel uncomfortable due to communication problem. But in this hotel all the staffs speak english very well. There was no communication problem. Besides the location was fantastic. Every kinds of subway including yurikamamoe close to this hotel.But for the first time it was really hard to find the right location of the hotel. It's near shimbashi station but only through subway passage you can find the Park hotel. On the street you couldn't find it if you were a new comer in this district. It took 30 minutes for me to find this hotel. One more thing about the Park hotel Tokyo.. breakfast was so simple and a little bit disappointing for me. You'd better go other building complex(such as Caretta Mall) to find restaurants .

<Content>Would go back Stayed at this hotel for 5 nights. Enjoyed my experience there and would go back. Location is excellent, beside Shimbashi train station and subway. The room was clean and decent size (had a superior room however, did not see standard rooms). I was a bit concerned about the noise from the trains that pass non stop but it wasn't a problem after all. The hotel is in a business area but the underground passage ways are convenient (restaurants, Starbucks, and linked to the subway).Buffet breakfast was good.

<Content>Top hotel in great part of Tokyo We stayed at the Park for 3 nights and had a brilliant time. It was our first visit to Japoan and from the moment we arrived the staff were helpful and went out of their way to assist - there were no language problems at all. The business suite was excellent - we were able to upload our holiday pics as we went along and write our blog so that friends and family at home could follow our trip.Ignore the reviews that say the Park is miles from the subway - it isn't - unless you think a 5 minute walk is miles! All signs were in english and we found it very easy to get around. We didn't eat in the hotel as the breakfasts/meals were quite expensive but there are loads of restaurants (Japanese, Italian and other) in the towers nearby. There is an excellent Starbucks in Shimbashi station.The rooms were quite small but very comfy and had everything you could possibly need (very hi tech toilets!) including slippers and robes.We would definitly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Tokyo for the first time or any time!

<Content>It's just awesome! This hotel cannot be more perfect for our first trip to Tokyo. The hotel is beautiful; the room in the high floors have perfect views; and the staffs definitely go any possible way to help out. Not to mention the perfect location right above subway station. We got rained out one day with a really bad storm; but we did not even need umbrellas all day! The restaurant selections nearby are also very impressive. We'll be back again!

<Content>Best overall hotel value on our visit to Japan Based on prveious Tripadvisor reviews and our particular needs, we chose Park Hotel. Overall, we had an extremely satisfying four night stay.Some of the attributes of the hotel; Reception was great with an extra effort to ensure our bed request was available. We ended up with a breathtaking view of Tokyo Bay (with the Conrad on our left). We felt the cityscape around Tokyo Tower was somewhat lacking during the day, so we were glad that we endured our couple of days of jetlag appreciating the morning sunrise cast on the Bay. The hotel is high above city noise and bustle of downtown Tokyo. The tone and atmosphere of the hotel is dark, hushed tones, so the guest is inclined to speak softly. Hotel clientelle is well-travelled, informed, primarily business professionals with little evident overt gaijin behaviour. The live evening musical entertainment was extraordinary and different each night. A variety of food services and cheap breakfast (Y800) is avialable in the Shiodome complex. We walked to Tsukiji, the Ginza and being too ambitious our first day on Tokyo, the East Garden (meaning we passed out at 1800hours and woke up again at 0300hrs...so much for correcting jetlag our first day!)The attributes of the room; The bathroom had a dimmer switch, great and generously provided Thann amenities (very much like Molton Brown) and powerful shower pressure. Room temperature adjusted quickly, pillows were a mix of Barley-filled pillows and feather pillows, the bed was really comfortable although unlike other Japanese hotel stays, we received a hospital-style nightgown and not a Takata (we prefer Takatas). The Park was only hotel on our visit to Japan to provide complimentary coffee. Honor bar was reasonably priced and a morning English paper provided. I found the room size efficient and comfortable (size is much like staying in established classic European hotels), but I will say the design lends to business travel, so we had little drawer space for our folded clothes. Carpet was in great repair. Found slippers would be ideal for smaller feet.Overall, an excellent selection and best hotel on our vacation. We would stay at the Park Hotel Tokyo again without question.

<Content>Great hotel near train and subway and food. Stayed in September 2006 for 5 nights at the Park Hotel during a business trip and got a great deal from Travelocity of $117/night, supposedly unheard of in Tokyo.I have never visited Japan but the room size was small but very nice and comfortable and very new, 3 yr old hotel. Small TV and bathroom but they provide all toilettries, so you don't have to bring anything, including a razor, toothbrush, and lotion.The hotel walkable from the Shimbashi train station, where you can get trains to anywhere in Tokyo and beyond, and the Shiodome subway station. It was very convienent to shopping areas and food. There are elevated walkways and underground walkways from this hotel to the train, subway, food and shopping. If, like me, you need coffee to start in the morning, there is a Starbucks, Tullys, and Via La France in the underground walkway area.High recommendation for the Park Hotel. Ask for a room with the view of the Tokyo Tower and Mt Fuji on a clear day.

<Content>Great experience! I would like to comment on some of the bad reviews below.Some people you can never please. I found the front desk to be very helpful. If you want a map of the city, you have to ask. What鈥檚 so hard about that? Also, the subway station is very close to the hotel. If you鈥檙e too lazy to walk 15 minutes, than maybe you should stay home. As with every city, you鈥檒l have to walk a bit to get to the station. I鈥檝e found this hotel to be great for the price. If you want a superb hotel, stay at the Hyatt.

<Content>Less satisfied It was our 3rd stay at Park. The biggest surprise was, we couldn't find the concierge who have helped us a lot during our previous stay. She have had the great knowledge of Tokyo, and always gave us the great information. Where have she been? Unfortunately we couldn't get as much information as we did the last 2 times. The location good. Is within 30 minutes to Shinjuku, Shibuya, and the other major tourist spots in central Tokyo, using subway. Once you memorize how the underground walkway is, it will be quite easy.The room pretty small, but should be the average size in Tokyo.If we be able to have great information again, we will stay here again. But if not, we look for the other place to stay.

<Content>excellent choice I have lived in Japan for 13 years (not Tokyo) and I have stayed in everything from $5 campgrounds to $800 a night hotels. The Park Hotel is an excellent deal for Japan. I stayed in a single room for 3 nights in Sept. Despite other complaints of room size, the Park's room is ample for Japan. In other hotels you bang your knees on the desk getting off the bed! Yes, it is clean and modern. For those wanting more of a Japan feel then stay in ryokan. For people not used to walking then the 5 minute walk to Shimbashi station may seem like a lot. However, for Tokyo it is an excellent and close location. There are restaurants all around the hotel in the other buildings. I did not eat the breakfast at the hotel. I prefered simple sandwich from the Vie La France bakery a short walk away. There is also a delicious onigiri (rice ball) restaurant in the Caretta building. Also in the Caretta building there is a famous Taiwanese dumpling restaurant. The menu has pictures and it is easy to order. For the price and location in Tokyo the Park can't be beat! P.S. check out their website. It was in English and the price from them was cheaper than from other travel websites for the days I was going to be there. Japanese prices must include tax so you are looking at the total with the exception of a 200 yen or so hotel tax.

<Content>Horrible experience Horrible experience. Front desk was rude when we tried to check in early. They wouldnt let us check in early and at the same time they didnt offer to even store our bags temporarily while we went sightseeing. The concierge had very few recommendations and initially only gave us a map to get to the subway station from the hotel, we had to press her to get even a city map. Rooms were small, but fairly clean. There was lots of construction around the hotel, so it was difficult for taxis to get in and out. The subway station is actually about 15 mins walk, and then a 15-20min ride to shibuya, shinjuku, and other popular destinations, so it wasnt an ideal location (thought itd be closer to the action). Also thought the hotel being at top of tower would be interesting, but there are only a couple elevators so you have to wait to get into the hotel section (25 floors up), so there was some inconvience. Would never stay here again based on service and location.

<Content>Office Building Hotel This hotel is in an office building in the middle of an office complex. This is a strange location. The whole complex was in the middle of major road construction, therefore it was not easy to walk around. Ginza is about a 15-20 minute walk. The rails are under the complex therefore you have to do a lot of underground walking to get to the stations (even though they tell you it is right in the basement of the building). Our room was the size of my closet at home, I could not even lay out my suitcase. Yes the rooms are modern and clean. Also, the food is extremely expensive. We paid $37.00 for 2 coffees and three minuature pastries!!

<Content>Small but good Stayed here twice on my trip. The first few days I wasn't the happiest with the room as side of the bed was against the wall and the room was tiny. I really didn't see what the fuss was about that I'd read here on Trip Advisor. I then went to Kyoto for a few days and decided that when I returned to Tokyo I'd stay at the hotel again as they offered to keep my luggage so I would only have to bring a small bag to Kyoto with me. When I returned the room they gave me stank of fish (really strong) so when the bellman came to deliver the bags I asked him to step into the room and see if he got the smell. He immedately rang downstairs and came up with another room key. This room was gorgoeus and I'm gutted I didn't ask for a room like this the first time. There was more space and the bed was in the centre of the room and the view of the Tokyo tower was amazing. I have to say that staying in that room completely changed my opininon of the hotel. My advice....if you're booking a normal room then ask for the room I was in which was 3306. If they put you in a smaller room then ask to be changed. It's worth it.Of course I'll also say what everyone else is saying....it was great location because of the subway and trains underneath. Bit of a walk though to get to any of the lines so bring your walking shoes!

<Content>Nice modern hotel though a bit sterile Our stay at the Park Hotel was for 4 nights (Sept 3-6 2006). As most of the other posts stated, the Shiodome area is a great base location. The Shiodome and Shinbashi stations are in the complex itself and can pretty much get you anywhere you need. A plethora of restaurants to choose from. We ate at a few in the Caretta and Pedi buildings and were quite pleased with all and wish we had more time to sample more!We thought the room was indeed a bit cozy, but nonetheless sufficiently sized for a few days stay. We had a great view on the 33rd floor overlooking Tokyo Tower and part of the Bay. The water pressure from the shower was excellent. The one minor negative observation we had about the hotel was the lack of warmth. Everytime we walked through the lobby, it felt as if we were in a library and had to keep our voices hushed. Service was fine, but not overly inviting. Regardless, we would stay here again in a minute.

<Content>Top Value, Great Service We have just returned from a 1 week stay in Tokyo. It was our first trip to Japan, and therefore a little intimidating. We considered the twice as expensive Mandarin Oriental, or the Park Hyatt, but the reviews on Trip Advisor once again steered us in the right direction. We like something a little less opulent and flashy, yet we are very picky on hotels, and this met or exceeded our expectations in every way. I would request a room on a corner, since you get 5 windows instead of 2, and the views are amazing. One night we got a fireworks display thrown in, and what a spectacle it was. The staff were very attentive, and the rooms seemed to be made up as soon as you left , no matter whether you slept in or rose early. Simply, this was one of the best hotel values I have seen in the world, especially knowing how expensive Tokyo is. We booked ahead and paid around 20,000 yen per room per night including all taxes. I think that they upgraded us to the corner rooms because we were staying a week. Go and enjoy, you won't be disappointed. Lots of great restaurants in the vicinity, and well connected to all of Tokyo.

<Content>Excellent Hotel for Tokyo We stayed at the Hotel in April, just after the Sakura (cherry blossom) season. We could not have had a better experience. Although the room wasn't very big (I don't know where you would find a big room in Tokyo), it was extremely comfortable, clean, and it provided everything we could ask for. The price of the room was very good, better than other comparable hotels. Our friends stayed at the much pricier Conrad Hotel next door, and although it was a good experience it was 4 times the price. We also loved the design of the hotel - it was very modern, without being cold. The best thing about the hotel is the location. It is close to a local subway, and more importantly it is close (3 minute walk) to the JR Yamanote Line. It is very important to be on the JR Yamamote line because it is the express train that runs in a circle around the heart of Tokyo stopping in all the best neighborhoods (Shibuya, Shinjuku). The Yamanote also gets you to the bigger train stations such as Tokyo Station, where you catch the bullet trains, etc. to quickly get in and out of the city. The best thing you can do for yourself during a visit to Tokyo is to stay near a Yamamote Line. Also, this hotel is walking distance to Ginza, arguably the ritziest shopping district in Tokyo.

<Content>New York in Tokyo I dont understand people's excitement about this hotel. My wife and I stayed for a week on our 5th trip to Tokyo, but were disappointed by the lack of service in this hotel compared to other Tokyo hotels. It seems that the staff here is trying very hard to imitate the style of New York hotels, in that they make you feel anonymous, and dont really extend a welcome feeling. No bows, no greetings, and no help with the bags. I guess many gaijin prefer this treatment, but why come to Japan if you want New York. The room was quiet with a nice view and lots of amenities typical of Tokyo hotels (toothbrush, hair brush, shampoo, razor, morning newspaper, minibar, tea and coffee). The furniture and rug were spotted with stains. The room safe was too small for a 12 laptop. It seemed the hotel guests were mostly foreigners. By comparison, we spent one week at the Takanawa Prince for half the price, and had much better treatment, same amenities, swimming pool, large room safe, larger room, nice view and felt like we were in Japan.

<Content>Impeccable Service The Park Hotel is the second hotel we stayed in during our recent Tokyo holiday, and it matched the excellent experience we had at our first hotel (Cerulean Tower Tokyu Hotel) in virtually every respect. We stayed at two different hotels because we bookended Tokyo stays with a five-day trip to Osaka and Kyoto. Our bifurcated itinerary enabled us to visit sights near our hotels (Shibuya, Harajuku, and Shinjuku while at the Cerulean; and Asakusa, Imperial Palace and Tsukiji while at the Park) without spending time and money travelling around Tokyo. Even though Tokyo has an excellent transportation network, getting from Point A to Point B can still be quite time-consuming.As far as the Park Hotel is concerned, we had a lovely corner room with a stunning view of Tokyo Tower. Though not overly large, our room was very well-designed and fully-equiped with LCD-TV, mini-bar and, best of all, free high-speed internet. Our bath was spacious and was stocked with a full array of amenities. Service from every hotel employee was gracious and polite. And, location-wise, the hotel is about a seven-minute walk from the Shibuya station on the JR Yamanote line.One tip: We did not think the 2200 Yen cost for the Park Hotel's breakfast was worth the price (the Cerulean's breakfast offerings were far superior), so we decided to eat breakfast at the nearby Conrad. We agree with other posters that the Conrad is a spectacular hotel visually and will only add that its breakfast is also superb. Though the Conrad breakfast was not cheap (3400 Yen), the wide array and the excellent quality of the offerings lessened the sting on the wallet.

<Content>Great Hotel Great Hotel. Great location. 2 very important things. Don't be discouraged about the small space since this is standard in most Japan and European hotels. The staff is very helpful and everyone spoke English. The concierge desk can help you with anything. Housekeeping was wonderful and always willing to help/serve your needs. A must stay in Tokyo. The location to sites and subways is very convenient. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>The Staff is Excellent! The staff is so awesome here! They all spoke great English and were so accommodating to our needs! A present I brought from the US got smashed, and they quickly re wrapped it for me. Also, internet is free, so that is a big plus. The rooms are pretty small, which is the only downside. Check out the spa; wonderful massages although expensive, well worth it! Would definately come back.

<Content>View not as great as in December but wonderful aircon This is the second time I stayed in this hotel and it was as good an experience as the first time.Although rooms are on the small side the quality of mattress is excellent and the insonorisaion is faultless. Having stayed 2 weeks altogether I was never woken up by a toilet flush or a running bath.During Winter, you can enjoy spectular views and see FujiYama very clearly.This hotel is very central and is 10 mins walk to Ginza where all the best craftmen and luxury brands can be found. Even the old Tokyo Asakuza can be reached in 20 minutes by public transport: you never need a taxi when staying at this hotel.Although the breakfast is expensive at the hotel (~拢12), the Shiodome will offer all the variety you may be craving for from Indian food to Cheese cake. Another bonus the monumental painting of Taro Akamoto about Hiroshima nuclear bombing is on display until end of August and literally 5 minutes walk from the hotel.To beat the jet lag on arrival, have a walk at Hanna Park ( just behind the hotel) a traditionnal Japanese park with a tea house on a small island in a middle of the lake. If you do wake up early in the next morning do go the fish market ( 15 minutes walk).On your way back to the airport, the hotel organises a limousine shuttle ( coach) stopping only at 2 other hotels in the immediate vincinity for just 拢15. If you have not checked out 1 hour before the time you booked, they will even wake you up to ensure you are not going to miss you flight: this is what I call service!

<Content>Wonderful hotel My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. The lobby is on the 25th floor with the room above. The rooms are small but very well appointed. The view of the Sumida river and Tokyo is marvelous. It is clean, new and within walking distance to the fish market. We took a taxi to the fish market because it's a little complicated figuring out which road it was on. The staff is very helpful. There is an internet connection in the room (ask for a two prong adaptor, it's free). It's right near the subway and JR trains. We met a Tokyoite for lunch and ate in the restaurant which was very good but expensive.

<Content>Loved the Park Hotel in Tokyo Three of us (my husband, our 12-year old son, and I ) stayed here for a week. We loved the hotel. Our room was quite large with a wonderful view of the Tokyo skyline. It was clean, extremely quiet, and very comfortable. The service was impeccable. The location was great. Both the subway and JR were right underneath the building. There were also many restaurants easily within walking distance. If ever in Tokyo, we would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Pinch yourself We stayed at the Park Hotel for two nights end of May. The lobby and rooms were amazing and the service was impeccable. We arrived at 10 in the morning and not only were they able to accomodate us, they gave us a room on the top floor with a beautiful view of Tokyo Tower. The location was very convenient to transportation and walking distance to Tsukiji Fish Market (a must visit). The staff spoke great English and very helpful, always providing directions and recommendations. We were going to try the spa for a massage but they were having staffing problems, so the conceirge directed us to Ooedo-Onsen-Monogatari, which was the most relaxing experience of my life. I would definately recommend this hotel.

<Content>recommended location The instructions to the hotel were good, but a fair traipse from Shinbashi station (about 15 min walk) not great after a long flight from England! However, easily found. The staff were very welcoming and luckily our room was ready on arrival (11am) although it was a smoking room and it did smell. We couldn鈥檛 be bothered to request a different room.. we just wanted bed! The room was on the small side as was the bathroom, however, it was very clean and had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. The hotel is situated in the Shiodome area, which seems quieter than the rest of Tokyo we had explored. We liked this, and it was a welcome relief from the hustle and bustle of the city. It was a 5/10 min walk from the action of Ginza. Ginza is a great place to explore and preferred this to the other area (Roppongi) we stayed. Overall, very pleasant all round stay in this Hotel

<Content>A Real 'Find' in Tokyo Our stay at the Park Hotel Tokyo was a most enjoyable one. We thought the lobby and lounge area were very beautiful, relaxing, and serene in its decor. Our room was comfortable, clean, with every ammenity provided. As for the service, we were spoiled yet very appreciative of the attention given us. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is visiting Tokyo for either business or pleasure.

<Content>14 Hours into the future I stayed for 4 days, and wish it could have been 2 weeks. The hotel is perfectly located in the cener of Tokyo. Every imaginable type of transportation is right in the immediate area.The hotel lobby on the 25th floor has an impressive view at night of the Toyko tower. My room on the 29th floor has a great view, and while not all that large, it was a perfect fit.Walking out of the hotel on the 3rd floor deck, it is almost like stepping into the Jetsons world. Futuristic skyscrapers with pedestrian walkways that take you every where without interacting with the street traffic below.This was my second trip to Tokyo, and I can hardly wait to return to both the city  the Park Hotel.

<Content>Would definitely return! I had a wonderful stay (6 nights) at this hotel! Everything was clean, pleasant and comfortable, and the room had a nice, modern design. Free wireless was available, which is always nice, and the bathrooms were spotless, another important factor! As other reviewers have mentioned, the rooms are small, but not ridiculously so (I've been in smaller), and are nicely furnished so they feel clean and bright.Location: this hotel is in the SE quadrant of the city of Tokyo, within walking distance of Ginza. It's located in the Shiodome Media Tower, which is right above Shiodome Station (about a 5 minute walk); from this station you can access the Oedo line (which sort of does a loop around the city) and the new Yurikamome line, which offers a direct route to Odaiba (I recommend riding this route even if you don't plan on exploring Odaiba, just for the fabulous view you get while crossing the Rainbow Bridge). If you walk another 5 minutes from this station, you can get to Shimbashi Station, which serves the Asakusa and Ginza lines but also the JR Yamanote line, which is the one you can ride without buying a ticket if you've got one of those Japan Rail passes. Riding from here to the trendy areas of Shibuya/Harajuku/Shinjuku via JR takes about 20-30 minutes, though it never feels that long when there's so much to observe! Shimbashi Station is also just two stops away from Tokyo Station, which is the major hub for bullet trains or trains that take you on day trips to places such as Kamakura. I could go on but the main point here is that the hotel is conveniently located.There are places to eat in the hotel, of course, but there are also a bunch of restaurants in nearby Carretta Tower and also the tower right next door (the name escapes me at the moment). Numerous coffee shops are nearby (including Starbucks, if you need it! - one in the train station and one in the tower next door), as are convenience stores (including 7-11). Again, I highly recommend this great hotel. Just make sure you get the right one, because there are a few hotels with similar names in Tokyo!

<Content>best hotel experience I just returned from a 3 week vacation throgh out Asia, and the Park Hotel Tokyo was one of the best ones I stayed in. Considering prices in Tokyo, the Park Hotel provided by far the best value. The hotel is perfect, great view and beautifull decor. The location was really convenient, and they upgrated our room without any extra charge. Definetly one of the best hotels experiences I've had in every aspect. No wonder is #1 on this list.

<Content>Fantastic! Perfect everything...well, sort of... This truly is a wonderful hotel in every aspect except for the filthy habit of people who smoke in the lobby and restaurant area. Location in perfect proximity to JR and subways. Ginza is a great shopping area and the department stores there put American ones to pathetic shame! The room is a little small, but with new, chic decor. You'd be hard pressed to find a better hotel. Paid about US$200 per night. If you're on a budget, go ahead and spend the extra money to stay here!

<Content>Superb modern hotel We stayed here for 3 days in April.Beware there are several hotels with park in their name including one opposite. This one being newish was not the first thought for taxi drivers etc., Make sure you have the Japanese language hotel card with you to show. Tell them Shidome and they are OK!The best way from the airport is the airport coach,which stops at the hotel (and others) but does not stop at this hotel in the mornings! Booking in at a lobby on the 25th floor seemed strange at first but this is offset by the fabulous overviews of the city.Rooms are adequate (small) but perfectly acceptable, bearing in mind the cost of land in central Tokyo. Service and facilities were A1and the very good western breakfast in the lobby which has an atrium 8 stories high!Well recommended!

<Content>Amazing value Great views. Spotless room. Nice price. We were amazed to find out you could stay in such a nice place in Tokyo for this price. (We paid about $220 including tax). Rooms are small perhaps but for Tokyo it was fine. Bathroom was real nice. Location is convenient to the subway and the JR Line which connects you to pretty much to everything you want. It is close to the fish market (10 min walk) which we thought was one of the highlights of Tokyo.

<Content>Never Again. I am sorry...but I went here on the ratings of Trip Advisor and I was very disappointed. First, the room I received was SO small. I have seen small rooms, but this one was awful. Second, my sheets were stained. This is unacceptable. Third, the room was sooooo hot.I nicely told the front desk after one night that I was going to check out. They offered to give me another room, but I decline and walked across the street to the CONRAD Tokyo, which although 12,000 more Yen a night, it was 3 times better!!Buyer beware.On the plus side...good views and nice lobby.

<Content>Tokyo tower We loved our stay at this hotel, the staff are very helpful, the location is within walking distsnce of Ginza and the shiodome area possesses many restaurants. The hotel room had a great view of the tokyo tower which we gazed at a lot in the evening! The breakfast at the hotel was lovely, and transport very easy from this area of towm. Also within yards of the hotel you can get on the transit line to tokyo bay which was fun with lots of shopping and a small beach. Tokyo is very special, efficient and great people. The area we especially enjoyed was Harajuku and Omatesando, because of the lovely cafes and the museums. Walking in tokyo is very easy also. Shinjaku is as expected very crazy. I'd definitely recommend the day trip to kamakura. The Park hotel was the best city hotel we've stayed in.

<Content>Tokyoite recommendation I'm a seasoned expat living in Tokyo. Have been living in Japan for over 15 years. When my firm or a client is footing the bill and the budget is not a concern, I prefer the Park Hyatt in Shinjuku or the Grand Hyatt in Roppongi. When I'm footing the bill for a short-term stay, I like this hotel. It is clean, comfortable, stylish, relatively inexpensive (for Tokyo), and often has great views. The downsides are 1) everyone from taxi drivers to long-time Tokyo residents confuse it with the Royal Park Shiodome, located across the street, 2) the single rooms are a bit small, so it pays to upgrade to a slightly larger room if within your budget, and 3) shiodome has many great restaurants in the skyscraper buildings, but it is a bit outside the happening central areas of Tokyo. Unless you are comfortable taking the subway (Toei-oedo line is at your doorstep), you'll be taking cabs everywhere. Shiodome is not too far from Roppongi/Akasaka/Aoyama/Daikanyama to make this impractical, but it can be costly and time consuming. That said, this is one of my favorite hotels in Tokyo, and I give it the highest rating with the above provisos.

<Content>Great Value! Understated hotel in Tokyo's Shidome district. Minimalist design and very hip. Room space is decent enough and comes with LCD TV sets. Although Tokyo action might be quite a distance, for it's very reasonable price compared to most Tokyo hotels, it's worth the stay. Getting around Tokyo from Park Hotel is quite easy as well. Park Hotel sits on the higher floors of the new Shiodome Media Center while below it lies the subway station to get you to most parts of Tokyo. Staff are very friendly and in the loop to most of Tokyo's happening places. They'll be more than happy to assist you in and around Tokyo. At night, don't forget to catch the jazz band in the lobby. For smokers, smoking in the lobby is permitted.

<Content>Great View We stayed two nights at the Park Hotel and two nights at the B Roppongi (see review) and both were excellent hotels but obviously aimed at different markets.The Park Hotel is in a different league and so obviosuly the same criteria don't apply, you pay more and so your expectations are greater. We loved the Park Hotel, although as noted in other reviews, the Shidome area was a bit sterile after the lights and action of Roppongi. An easy walk to the Tsukigi fish markets, the Hamarikyu gardens and Ginza and an easy tube up to Ueno park, Akihabara and Asakusa. But the whole walkway above street level among the huge skyscrapers was a bit strange. Have you seen Bladerunner ? The monorail (Yurikamome) out to the Oedo Onsen Monogatori (hot baths) is worth doing as well - the station is just next to the hotel.As for the hotel, we had a standard double room and had no concerns with size (maybe that is a whole US pre-occupation). Very clean, robes, LCD TV with BBC in English, minibar, in-room safe, toiletries and everthing you could wish for. A heated toilet seat but unlike the B Roppongi, no beer dispensing machine on each floor !! The city view from our room on level 32 was simply spectacular. The staff were excellent, spoke better English than I did, and were extremely helpful. Very good knowledge of the local area which is important. They also allowed us to check-in early and had a room for us at 11am which was great.We didn't eat at any of the three restaurants in the Hotel, but there are plenty of good eating options in the nearby Cabretta Mall and for very reasonable prices. Nearby Ginza has plenty of more sophisticated restaurants and bars but be warned, we couldn't find a bar with a happy hour and had to get up and leave one jazz bar after finding out a single beer was going to cost Y2000.Would definately stay again and it was a very nice hotel. I would imagine you could pay a lot more for a similar standard at other hotels in Tokyo. Deserving of the praise received on this website.

<Content>Lovely hotel The Park Hotel is a very hip hotel for a very good price. The lobby is impressive, as it is an open space that rises from the 25th floor, where the registration desk is, to the 35th floor. The morning breakfast buffet, which is served in the lobby, was good. The Japanese restaurant in the hotel was excellent. As for the room, the decor was nice, and the bed was comfortable, although a bit firm. The bathroom was small, but adequate. The location of the hotel is within walking distance of the Ginza shopping district and the fish market. It also sits above the subway station. The only downside to the hotel was the ventilation system, which filled with cigarette smoke from the other rooms.

<Content>Good location and nice hotel My husband and I recently stayed at the Park Hotel Tokyo for 6 nights. The lobby was very nice and although we never sat to listen, they have jazz bands at night for entertainment. The staff was very helpful, although we had to wait a long time for the concierge one day. They finally had someone else help us, but her English was not very good. The manager did check on our way out that she had given us the correct directions to our destination. They made dinner reservations several times for us. We loved the free business center where there were two computers to check/send email. The view from behind the check in desk of Tokyo Tower and the city was truly amazing. We saw Mt. Fuji twice, which we couldn't believe. This hotel caters to westerners, more than Japanese it seemed. It is hard to find at first if you arrive on the train at Tokyo Station, but once you figure out where to go, it's very convenient. We loved the whole underground area that connects to Shimbashi Station on the JR Yamanote line and the Ginza subway line. We ate breakfast in the Vie de France bakery every day rather than paying the high prices for the hotel's breakfast buffet. The pastries were very good and I loved the kiwi banana soymilk smoothies. We thought having a subway station below the hotel would be convenient, but we never ended up using the Oedo line. It just didn't go to any of the areas we wanted to visit. The room was very clean and modern, and as everyone else has said, small. There was enough room for two of us though, and for the price (we booked on Expedia for $180 per night) it was well worth it. The water pressure was very strong and we loved the heated toilet seat. The provided toiletries were of high quality also. We had a wonderful view of Hama Rikyu gardens and the water. It was also a very quiet hotel, we never heard any noise when we were in our room. We liked the location of the hotel (I know there's been mixed reviews on this). It's proximity to the JR Yamanote line was perfect as we preferred to take that rather than the subway because it was free with our JR rail passes. It's also perfect if you plan to visit the Tsukiji fish market and Hama Rikyu Gardens, which we did on our first morning. The above ground walkways and underground malls and restaurants in all the surrounding buildings seemed exactly what this futuristic city should be like. If you wanted nightlife it's a short walk to Ginza or short train ride to any area in Tokyo. We never took a cab so we didn't have the trouble of the driver not being able to find it. Shiodome really is a whole city within the city. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Great Value I won't go over the ground covered by previous correspondents but, this hotel is good value. I paid slightly more than I would pay in a 4 star Hotel in either Hong Kong or Los Angeles, though the quality and service was far, far better.The room I had was small, but very comfortable, with a generous sized bed. Small flatscreen TV, a good bathroom with great toiletries, filter coffee, yukata etc.When i left this morning, the concierge took my bag, brought coffee down to the waiting area whilst I waited for the bus to Narita, and gave out umbrellas to a couple of tourists who were likely to get wet! Needless to say, both the level of service and indeed the level of english is quite good (for Japan).As for the location, it is a bit sterile, but i got used to it. The Shiodome site has coffee shops and eateries all around it. The Shimbashi/Shiodome station system seemed to have all the major lines go through that area which was a bonus.I would definately stay here again.

<Content>Perfect Hotel Just got back from stay in Tokyo. I read all the reviews for the hotel (that is why I chose it). I went to Tokyo by myself and this was my first trip to Japan. I would stay at this hotel again. Here is some pratical advise:Hotel is loacted at the end of Ginza's main shopping street (about 8 min walk). Perfect hotel for high end shopping and back to hotel again.Once you find the hotel it is easy to find your way around. (initially finding it was impossible for me.)If you choose this hotel here is the best way to find it:Take JR express to Tokyo Station. Take subway to Shimbashi station (only two stops away). Exit Shimbashi station and get a cab with the print out of directions from Park Hotel's website). The cab ride was only 660 yen (about six bucks and well worth it). I am a pretty sauvy travler and could not find the hotel on my own. Once you know where it is it is easy to head out and find your way back.If you don't only shop on Ginza it is a short and easy subway ride to anywhere else.Booking your room on their website is the cheapest option.

<Content>Great location We stayed here for 4 nights and had an excellent time. Agree with other review - perfect location (with train lines to get you anywhere) although the rooms are a little on the small side. Ask for a City View.

<Content>Not disappointed at all... Taking the advice and statistics from this website, I chose Park Hotel Tokyo for our 5 day trip with my toddler, 2 years old. It was a good choice. Shinjuku has always been our choice of area for Tokyo visits, this time I decided to try elsewhere. Not disappointed at all. Like most have said, the area is ultra modern, very clean, sleek, and Shiodome area is very business like, and like a small city itself.I found the location to be perfect. It was easy access to everywhere. It's actually next to Ginza. So how much more convenient can it get? going to the fish market for breakfast, and Starbucks just across the basement of the hotel.The staff is the best I have every encountered. Excellent english, and very helpful concierge. Each time we asked for directions to somewhere, they would print out the map, and exact directions for us. Subway map, hotel map provided. The most impressive was, when we got back from our trip to Nikko, we needed to repack our luggage before going to the airport. The Hotel was kind enough to give us a spare room to do this instead of having me to do it in the lobby. It was very generous of them. We already checked out the day before. They stored our luggage, and provided this service of bringing our stored luggage upstairs for us to reorganize, and then had a bellboy help us bring back all the luggage after we were finished.This was very helpful, especially because I was travelling with a toddler.The hotel is very catered to Business travellers, but we were treated with perfect service and attitude even with a young child.The Japanese restaurant was excellent.All in all, I was very happy with our choice. The rooms are small, but that's what Japan hotels are usually like.

<Content>Great Service; Unexpectedly Good location; Small Rooms Rooms: The room we had, though quite small, was clean and nicely furnished. The water in the bathroom gets hot immediately and the water pressure is fantastic. The views from the room--we had views towards the bay, not the city--were quite nice.Location: When you first arrive at the hotel, the area seems a bit corporate, a bit bleak. Once you get used to using the skybridge, which is connected to the hotel at the third floor, you realize that the area, Shiodome, is actually a little city, just three blocks above of the street. Not only that, once you venture from the hotel at ground level, you realize how well-located the Park Hotel actually is. It's a 10 minute walk from the Tsujiki Fish market, 5 minutes from the Hama Rikyu Gardens, 15 minutes from Ginza, and located on top of a subway line and 5 minutes from the JR line. All in all, the location was very, very good. We liked the Shiodome area itself because it looked like how we imagined Tokyo to be before arriving--clean, hyper-modern, and hyper-efficient.Service: The service here--with all the graciousness the Japanese are famous for--was really first class. Each staff member we encountered was very helpful--they assisted us in mailing letters, getting train reservations, and the like. The staff are everywhere and always willing to help.Overall: This is a new hotel in a developing, very modern area. If not for the small size of the room--we had bigger rooms elsewhere for the same price--I would give it a 5.

<Content>Nice hotel but deserted location Impressed by the comments we'd read on Tripadvisor.com, we recently stayed at the Park Hotel in Tokyo for 4 nights in mid-March. While we were pleased with the hotel itself, we felt disappointed with its location and would not stay there again. The hotel is in a high-rise building which sits amidst a small cluster of skyscrapers in the relatively deserted Shiodome area of Tokyo. The area surrounding the skyscrapers is a gigantic construction site which has obliterated most all of the sidewalks. There is no street life whatsoever -- if you have the urge to walk around the neighborhood, get a bite to eat or people watch (as we wanted to do), there is nothing to see  nowhere to go except the confusing, identical underground passageways that link the buildings. On the positive side. the hotel is within walking distance (20-30 minutes) of the Ginza district, Tsjuki Fish Market and the beautiful Hama Rikyu Gardens. However, no taxi drivers or tour guides know about the hotel yet and it was difficult to find our way back when we took cabs. It also didn't help that right next door to the Park Hotel's location in the Shiodome Media Tower is the ROYAL Park Hotel located in the Shiodome Tower. Confusing! The hotel's rooms are well-appointed with a very modern, sleek style that is quite nice. The staff was helpful. But we would have preferred to be in a neighborhood like Aoyama or the upcoming Daikanyama with shops, restaurants and people around.

<Content>small and nice Spent two nights in a double room. The hotel staff was very friendly and spoke English well. There was always someone readily available to talk to if need be. Like other reviewers stated the location may be an issue but we didn't have any problems with using the nearby subway station. A couple taxi drivers had trouble finding the hotel for some reason though. In any event the view from the room was fantastic, Tokyo Tower was head on and the room was very clean and comfortable. The only downside is that the room wasn't large although I didn't mind the size especially considering the very reasonable price for this hotel. Also, there is a shuttle from Narita that is about 30 dollars.

<Content>Park Hotel Tokyo -- just OK First of all, I did'nt mind the location (which seems to be the largest issue most people have with the hotel). It is within walking distance to Ginza and Shimbashi... and a close station on the Yamamote line (Shimbashi) and a Metro stop (Shiodome -- once you learn how to get to each. The room I got was really small, even for Tokyo standards...having said that, I did book a standard double. The room was OK, but I would not call it a luxury hotel room (I also stayed at the Granvia in Kyoto which was). Check in was easy. My largest complaint was at check out, where at 6 in the morning there was a line of 3, and only one person behind the desk. I was asked to sit and wait. Soon the person behind the desk left. Finally someone from the back came out to deal with the next customer. He had an issue of thinking he pre-paid, and didnt want to pay again... so that went on and on. It wasnt until I complained to the Bell person that she fished someone else out of the office to check me out. Ahotel like this (which gets the #1 ranking) shouldnt let customers wait like that. We didnt try the hotel restaurants (there are plenty around the area) so I can't comment. All in all, it was OK, perhaps a decent value for the price.

<Content>very nice We recently stayed at the Park and found it to be a pleasant stay. The location is good and the staff is excellent. They have custom pillow fitters which was interesting:) The rooms are small compared to american rooms. If you need space upgrade. We enjoyed the view very much due to the fact that the hotel is on the 25th floor. This hotel is within walking distance to Ginza. I would highly recommend going on a city tour if you are only there for a limited time. All in all it was a great place.

<Content>Great memories Believe all the positive Tripadvisor reviews, we're very happy that we did. My Wife and I spent 2 nights at the Park Hotel on the way to skiing at Hakuba (also highly recommeded). The panorama window behind reception on level 25 provides a fabulous view. Our room faced a different direction so we opted to pay extra (not much) for the view facing Tokyo Tower (Japan's answer to the Eifel Tower). In the morning, we were very pleased to be able to see Mount Fuji quite clearly.The rooms are efficiently laid out and very clean. The staff were all very happy to assist. Ask at the tour desk for their recommendation of a sushi restaurant down near the fish market. A short walk and worthwhile adventure. The temple beside Tokyo Tower was also well worth visiting. Whilst you're there, one of our favourite destinations was to have coffee and cakes on the 42nd floor of Mori Tower. Sit at the window and enjoy the view back towards Ginza. The hotel's website has location maps for the short walk from the neighbouring station. With direct service to Tokyo Station and on to Narita Airport, the trains are very a very efficient and safe travel option. Expect there to be too much in Tokyo to see and do. Just plan on going back, as we do. The Park will definitely be our first choice. Currently ranked #1 with good reason. Enjoy.

<Content>Good hotel, but not the best location I think everything of this hotel is good, except location. If you go to Tokyo for shopping, choose another hotel in major shopping area - like Shinkuju. You know, you need to drop you bags sometime to hotel and rush out for shopping again. The hotel is close to Ginza, but it is very far from Shinkuji (the major shoppers paradise). It takes 30 minutes by JR from Shinkuju to Shimode! But have to say the hotel is very stylish and staff are warm and helpful.

<Content>Good choice for Tokyo I spent two nights at the Park Hotel with my girlfriend in December 2005. We were very pleased with this hotel. The connection to and from Narita was easy, and the hotel was very modern, clean, friendly and well located at Shidome Station, and a short walk to Shimbashi Station. You can expect to pay unavoidably high Tokyo prices.

<Content>Good location My wife and I stayed at the Park hotel for two nights on route to Sydney and found the location to be excellent, easy walking distance to Ginza. The room was spotless although a little small but from other reviews this seems to be common theme in Tokyo. I would recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Tokyo.If you arrive in the morning you will find that the only option to the city centre is via train or taxi as the hotel buses don't run until 13:00 ish so we left our large suitcases at the airport left luggage counter which made life much easier.

<Content>almost perfect stay Just returned from a 5 night stay at the Park Hotel Tokyo. This is a first class hotel, very intimate with very attentive and accomadating staff. Most all speak english very well. Location was convienent to the Shimbashi train station, where you can take trains to almost all parts of Tokyo, the JR Yamonte line was our train line as it took us to most major destinations in Tokyo. The Shiodame subway line was also right there. Hotel was also connected to the Carretta Shiodame shopping center where there was restaurants. Expect to do alot of walking as the train stations are big and if you get lost alot more walking. Hotel was in walking distance of Ginza also. The view from the lobby was of the Tokyo Tower, very beautiful, especially during sunset. The lobby seemed a little stuffy for our taste but if that's what you want. Arrival at the hotel could have been easier as there is no one from the hotel at the bottom of the building to great or help you with bags when you arrive, since the front desk is up on the 25th floor. All in all would stay here again and recommend it to others.

<Content>Felt luxurious and cared for We usually prefer a smaller hotel with charm but in Tokyo, this was perfect. The location is convenient enough to transportation, the staff amazingly helpful and eager to please. All the rooms have amazing views as the hotel is above the 25th floor of a large tower that houses Tokyo broadcasting below. The room wasn't large but was very comfortable, well heated and nicely appointed. Robes were provided and the moment you requested anything, they were there with a smile. The lobby and cocktail lounge are inviting. At something like $200 a night, this felt like a terrific deal, particularly since they have top speed internet, will store your bags and take care of any requests.

<Content>Great Hotel We stayed here for two nights and were very impressed. We had a room on the top floor with an excellent view over Tokyo. The room was lovely as was the rest of the hotel. The hotel is located on the 25th floor and the reception area has great views over Tokyo. It is also very handy for travelling around and is right next to monorail etc.

<Content>Stylish Hotel We were in Japan for two weeks and stayed in the Park Hotel twice during that time. We found the hotel to be stylish and whilst the rooms are not the largest we have seen they are clean, comfortable and well appointed particularly useful was the free 'always on' cable Internet access in the room. The staff were friendly and helpful and it was enjoyable sitting in the bar listening to the jazz trio of an evening. We also found the location of the hotel very useful. If arriving on the Narita Express, it is only a 1440 Yen taxi ride away from the Tokyo Station and the train links near the hotel make it very easy to get around. There are also shops nearby from a local convenience store in the basement to bars and restaurants in the Pedi Shiodome complex which is linked to the hotel by a walkway. Overall, we had a very enjoyable stay there and would be happy to go back and recommend the hotel to anyone going to Tokyo.

<Content>Bathrooms in 3 different rooms reeked of Urine We just returned from our trip to Tokyo for our honeymoon and thought that we should offer our opinion on the very popular Park Hotel. We chose this hotel because of all the good reviews on TripAdvisor. Unfortunately, we were not as pleased by our visit. First and foremost, I must admit that the hotel staff is wonderful. They are incredibly helpful, and they speak English very well.That said, there were certainly a few concerns that will prevent us from ever returning to this hotel. The hotel rooms were tiny, even by Tokyo standards. But that was not our main dilemma. Our biggest complaint was that the bathrooms smelled very strongly of urine! Although the rooms looked clean, the bathrooms always smelled bad. We thought perhaps this was a fluke, so we moved into another room. The bathroom smelled of urine there too. In fact, we stayed in 3 different rooms at this hotel and found that they all had stinky bathrooms. We were very unhappy.Otherwise, the hotel is in a very convenient location with access to both the Japan railway and the subways. The hotel lounge offers live jazz on some days of the week, which is also very nice. If not for the horrible smell of the bathrooms, I would have given this hotel a better review.

<Content>Brilliant Hotel Fantastic hotel, brand new, in one word: luxurious! The comforts and the staff made our stay in Tokyo a one in a lifetime experience. Very central and it has a tube station very close from where you can easily travel around Tokyo.Will definitely stay there again when we will go back to Tokyo.

<Content>Fantastic Modern Hotel I enjoyed my stay at the Park Hotel Tokyo very much. It's within walking distance to both Shimbashi station (which is a major subway station) as well as the famous Tsukiji fish market. I commuted by subway to a conference every morning, and it was easy and efficient. On the last day, I went for a stroll to the fish market, and had sushi for breakfast, and then to Ginza for some last minute shopping before heading for the airport with the Limo Bus service that the hotel staff reserved for me. It was efficient, easy, and comfortable stay over all. The hotel is modern, with all the latest furnishings. Highly recommended!

<Content>Fantastic Hotel! This is a fantastic hotel. My partner and Ihave just visited Tokyo for the first time as part of our honeymoon trip and we trusted the reviews on tripadvisor and decided not to spend on the Park Hyatt but booked the Park Hotel. This was taking a chance as we are used to 5 star travelling and are very fussy when it comes to accommodation. We made the right decision. The hotel is directly cconnected to the skyrail and to the metro so it couldn't be easier to get around the city. Also, it is a 5 minute walk to Ginza which we think was one of the nicest parts of the city. Much better than Shinjuku which is covered with MacDonalds! The service in the hotel was freindly and very efficient. One night we ordered room service at 3am and it arrived within 5 minutes. The reception staff couldn't be more helpful (they made reservations, posted our mail, provided us with the best guides to the city). The hotel itself is very stylish and modern but the best thing about it is that it is very much Japanese. This is something that we were worried about missing if we booked with a big chain like the Hyatt which has very American style surroundings. The rooms are comfortable with great amenities (trea, coffee, nice cosmetics, etc.) and the views of the city are unbelievable. This hotel is very close to being a 5 star. If it had a gym and the bar opened past 12 it probably would be.We have stayed here for 3 nights and would recommend it to any traveller.

<Content>Would be 5-stars... I would love to give this place 5-stars, but I had just come from a stay at the Park Hyatt, a hotel truly in a class of its own. The service here was especially gracious, even by Tokyo standards. A trainee bellboy, Nobuna, went out of his way to make sure we were comfortable in our room and repeatedly brought us various panphlets and maps full of activitiy and restaurant suggestions. He made our initial impression of the hotel that much better.The hotel's location is quite convenient, in Shiodome, a modern, up and coming area of Tokyo. We took the Yurikamome monorail line to Shiodome and wondered if we would need to take a taxi to the hotel. Much to our surprise, as soon as we stepped on the very convenient elevated pedestrian walkway, there were signs for the Park Hotel. There is also convenient underground access (about 7-10 min walking) to JR Shimbashi station and the Ginza and Hibya Metro lines.I am usually not a fan of open atrium style hotels, but the Park Hotel's design is very striking. The atrium gives one a sense of space that is hard to come by in Tokyo. Also, the lobby doubles as a lounge area and gives the hotel a sense of intimacy and activity while still maintaining that spacious feeling.Check-in was no problem and our room, while not large, was very attractively furnished with a full view of the Tokyo Tower. The 28th floor offered a perfect view of the Tokyo cityscape, perhaps even better than our 45th floor view from the Park Hyatt. Being at that level allowed one to look out to the cityscape, rather than down to it.

<Content>Stay Here You cannot pick a better location, especially if this is your first time in Tokyo. We were in walking distance or easy cab ride from Ginza, Kabuki-za, the fish market, Shimbashi Station ( making coming into Tokyo from many train lines a breeze) as well as user friendly ( though not the best) restaurants via the walkways. Also, perfect area for someone who is handicapped, since so much of Japan is hard to get around. We also we able to connect easily with many subway lines from all of the stations right next to the hotel.Another thing that we liked was this hotel rounded out our stay in different types of Japanese hotels- this was the modern one- we also stayed in Historic traditional and business hotels.On the downside, the hallways seem to be slightly threadbare ( SLIGHTLY!) and we had a view of buildings from our room- not the  on a clear day you can see Mt Fuji that so many other hotels claim. Had an in room massage- not the best I have had.Airport Shuttle bus comes to the hotel and the staff took care of every need- and of course, no tipping. Will stay here again next summer.

<Content>Best hotel in Tokyo out of the seven hotels I have sampled I have stayed at the Hilton, Park Hyatt, Grand Hyatt, Century Hyatt, the Palace and a couple others. The Park Hotel has clean, quiet, modern rooms. The rooms are smallish but incredibly well designed. The location is walking distance to Ginza district and right above a huge shopping center. This is now my favorite hotel in Tokyo. When I checked out I needed a place to change into my street clothes. The manager gave me HIS OFFICE to change in!

<Content>Very funky, very cool Firstly - this place is so new that many cabbies don't know about it. Ask them to take you to Shidome and then look through the construction for the . Warning: The Royal Park Hotel is next door, and a not-so-easy walk across the construction.So perhaps it was because we stayed here the days preceeding Golden Week - but this place was quiet. Very quiet. And that just added to the funky/cool/mysterious/quirky feel of the place.However, I absolutely loved this place. The lobby was gorgeous, the staff extremely sharp, and everything was in place. If you're looking to hit the Tsukiji market first thing, this hotel is an easy walk to the auctions.I would definitely say that this hotel is a rising star in Tokyo - once the Shiodome area comes into it's own and the construction is done. Top notch, on par with the Imperial, ANA, Keio, New Otani - and just maybe one day the Park Hyatt.

<Content>Excellent place My wife (30yo) and I (36yo) were both first-time visitors to Tokyo and plumped for this hotel after the positive comments we read on here. Without doubt we can add to those as this was a superb place to stay and we would recommend it to anyone. It benefits from being very modern and chic and at around 拢120 was definite value for money. True, the room wasn't that big but as long as you go there expecting that, it's not a problem at all. The fancy toilet (two levels of seat warmth!), flat-screen TV and wonderful views more than compensate. We paid an extra 拢5 a night for a view of Tokyo Tower and it was worth the extra for those this was the view from our hotel room window camera shots.The Shiodome area (full of modern skyscrapers) takes a few walkings to fully get your bearings but all the towers are worth a visit - especially for cheap eating. We eat in respectable places for under 拢30 a night (between us that is!) which certainly exploded the myth that Tokyo is the most expensive place in the world. Quite simply, it is not.Shiodome also has its own train station which is good for taking the underground to other parts of the City. You can also get the monorail from there to Odaiba, crossing the elegant Rainbow Bridge and getting a good look back to the City.Shinbashi station is also a 5-10min walk and that serves plenty of destinations on the overground JR Train. You can also take the train from here to Tokyo station (just two stops away) and catch the Shinkansen (Bullet Train). We did that when we had a day-trip to Kyoto.It definitely pays to carry a map of the train lines with you (the hotel will sort you out with one if you haven't got a guidebook) as at some stations the maps are only printed in Japanese. When this happened to us we just asked one of the staff who were all very helpful, taking us to the ticket machine, telling us how much to pay and even wishing us a nice day!We had breakfast in the hotel a couple of times (a tad expensive for 拢12.50 each) and it was a good way to start the day - cereals, fruit, bread, egg, bacon etc (there's plenty of time to eat Japanese food later in the day!).Finally, the staff were all overwhelmingly polite, spoke good English and made our stay a memorable one.For the same money, I'd be amazed if you could find anywhere as good as this!!!!!

<Content>fantastic, great location. We stayed at the Park hotel twice whilst in Tokyo for a total of nine nights. The location is exceptional, Ginza, Tskujii and shimbashi station all within convenient walking distance. We only had breakfast at the hotel once and found ample other options for western style breakfast in the immeadiate vicinity of the hotel (important after several japanese breakfasts).The convenience of Shimbashi station cannot be stressed highly enough. If you are not in tokyo on business and wish to do day trips the proximaty to Tokyo station (two stops) is extremely convenient. We used both the Ginza metro line and the Yamonote Train line extensively. The Shiodome area is modern and fascinating but the area around shimbashi station is terrific also and not mentioned in any guide books. We spent many nights in the restaurants and bars around Shimbashi station and met many Japanese who would later become friends.The hotel is well designed and offers all the modern amenities you would expect. The staff are courteous and could not be more helpful. The views from reception are remarkable. Would not hesitate to reccomend it and would stay again.

<Content>Chic, great staff... Park Hotel near the Shio Dome metro station is definitely boutique hotel hip. GREAT lobby atrium and stylish restaurant. BUT the windows don't open and it's a *little* out of the way. Close to the fish market and just a few minutes from the metro stop, but in an area of mostly business towers. Staff speaks excellent English and is really excited to suggest restaurants etc. Joggers: out-and-back 3 mile loop around the park where Tokyo Tower is situated, which is good since there isn't a gym on site.
