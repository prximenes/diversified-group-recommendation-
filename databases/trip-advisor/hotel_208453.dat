<Content>Happy with our stay We stayed with Hilton Honors points the weekend after Thanksgiving. We had quite a nice stay. When we got there our rooms were upgraded to the next size up. We had two different rooms and the views were great from both.We were above the 30th floor, so there was no noise at all.The location was great, just off Times Square and a very close to a subway stop. Not a good location if you want small crowds and a quaint neighboorhood - but its Times Square....The only negative thing that I can come up with is - that the cleaning staff seemed to ALWAYS be in the halls. Even at around 4-5 pm, the cleaning carts were everywhere. I would stay there again.

<Content>Fleeced at the Hilton Times Square I reserved two corner deluxe rooms at the Times Square Hilton at $699.00 each in February 2008 for New Years Eve. Although the on line advertised price fluctuated and went down to $399.00 on a couple of occasions, I didn鈥檛 want to take a chance in loosing the choice rooms so I didn鈥檛 cancel and rebook. We planned all year for the Times Square for a once in a life time event to watch the ball drop. I wrote emails to the staff how this was my 83 year old Mothers life long dream to see the ball drop in Time Square. Never once did I receive a return reply, but I didn鈥檛 address it to a specific person so I was not overly concerned.We finally arrive-Check-in was supposed to be 3:00 PM but they didn鈥檛 have our 2nd room ready until well after 6:00PM. The late check-in was not as bad as the desk clerks repeated recommendation from 3:00 PM forward that we check back every 30 minutes. This kept us from going out and seeing the city. When we finally received the 2nd room, to our disappointment, it was not a corner but rather a standard room. Because getting the room took so much time that it infringed on our availability to take in the sites, I asked the desk clerk about the availability and cost of the rooms on the evening of January 1, 2009. The desk clerk told me that the rate was at $369.00 but would be going lower. I told the clerk that we would most likely be staying the extra night with the clear understanding that we would have the lowest market rate. On New Years morning I checked the Hilton web in preparation to confirm the extra night and found the 鈥渂est unrestricted rate鈥?at $329.00 (for a corner room) and I went down to confirm the extra night. At that point the Assistant Manager advised that we were already booked in both the rooms at a $389.00 rate for the night. A disagreement ensued and I advised the somewhat arrogant Asst Manager this rate exceeded what I was told and also the unrestricted rate internet rate. His reply was that he didn鈥檛 care and that I would not be paying more than some of his guest for the night. I explained to him that I was a Hilton Honors Diamond member and I had never received such poor treatment, in which he replied that I was entitled to two bottles of water for my loyalty. I advised him that I would not be staying that night, in which he informed me that I would be charged a substantial cancellation fee, even though I objected to those charges. As he promised I received cancellation charges of $200 x 2 (Tl$400.00) for trying to do business with the Hilton Times Square. I can understand housekeeping taking a little longer in preparing a room; I can also understand reserving a premium room and due to some circumstances ending up with an inferior room; but what I can鈥檛 accept is outright fraud because the Hotel has your credit card number and they know you鈥檙e a one trip tourist. Currently this matter is being worked by the Hilton Customer Care team and I will follow-up with this review.

<Content>Great view The location of this hotel is excellent. It is in the center of all the Times Square activity. Our room was on the 44th floor and while we didn't stay for New Years Eve we could see the ball lit up. It was very cool as it isn't something you could see from the street. The room was nice but not exceptional. The bathroom was very small. You definitely couldn't fit more than one person in there at a time. We did not eat at any of the restaurants on site so I cannot comment on them.Overall the hotel was nice but the location made it even better.

<Content>Great Location Wow! What a great location! Our room had a stellar view. We could see the Hudson River (to the left) and, of course, all the Times Square action. Our room was on the 40th floor, overlooking 42nd street. To our right we could see the famous ball that drops on New Year's Eve.On Saturday the 27th we saw Mary Poppins at the New Amsterdam Theater (2 doors down) and ate at Serafina's. On Sunday, my husband, two teen daughters, and I walked to Rockefeller Center and then Central Park -- where we spent most of the day. It was about 65 degrees, so ice skating on the semi-melted rinks was out of the question.On the way back (still walking) we happened upon Cassidy's Irish Pub for fish  chips and sandwiches. Good food, efficient service.On Monday morning, we dined at Brooklyn Diner (don't bother) and then walked to St. Patrick's Cathedral and the New York Public Library. Be sure to visit Bryant Park, too.All in all, this is a great hotel for the location alone. The breakfast was pretty basic -- soggy eggs and undercooked bacon. I'd rather eat somewhere else, but for the comp., it was okay.No worries about noise or undesirable clientele here.

<Content>Ideal locaton I travelled to New York with 3 friends and we booked a double double room at the Hilton, which was plenty big enough for all four of us.ROOMOur room had 2 double beds, plasma TV, desk, haidryer, comfy chair, mini bar and plenty of wardrobe space. The beds were just normal doubles, not kingsize, but they were the most comfy i have slept in. We got a free upgrade to a deluxe room, which was a lot bigger than i expected and it had views over New York and looked out at the Empire State Building. We were on the 41st floor, but it really didnt seem that high. The room was also very quiet, hardly hearing any outside noise or noise in the corridor. We also got a coffee machine and tea and coffee were provided.BATHROOMThe bathroom was actually a bit disappointing, it was very small, with a small bath and also had a shower over the bath. The shower was great, powerful and hot. We were supplied with Evelyn and Crabtree toiletries which were very nice. The towels were good quality and bath robes were also provided, but not much room to move!LOCATIONThis hotel is definatley in an ideal location, literally on the doorstep of Times Sqaure attractions and theatres. There are bar, restaurants and shops all just outside. Is also just 5 mintues walk to Macy's department store.FOODWe never ate at the hotel as the prices were very high, but we usually had breakfast at Applebys which is at the front door of the hotel. BEST BITSLocation!!!!!!!!! Size and comfort of room.WORST BITSwhen we arrived at our room we only had 2 towels, 2 cups and one bath robe for 4 of us. We complained and we were given extras very quickly. Another day we we only given 3 sets of towels...so again had to call reception. Also one day we came back to our room at 4pm and the cleaner had still not even been in to clean it!! Maid service was definately the worst part of this hotel...appear to be short staffed. Overall this was a hotel in a great location, had large comfy rooms and good facilities. Would recommend, mainly for location.

<Content>This Hilton is Great We stayed at this Hilton on 42nd St. for two nights in early November. The location is great - right in the middle of the theater district and walking distance to everything around Times Square. You might think 42nd St. is loud and busy but as soon as you enter the Hilton building and take the elevator to the lobby floor, which is the 20th floor, you're in a different world. We stayed on Hilton points and had a lovely room on the 30th floor with a great view. The staff was wonderful and friendly. We had a buffet breakfast every day. Coffee service in room. Nothing to dislike about this hotel.

<Content>Ok for free but there are better options available I've stayed in a number of the hilton family hotels and was very excited to get a chance to stay at this one. I read the reviews and came to my choice that this would be best. I arrived at the hotel and was pleased at what I saw. Half a block from broadway very close to everything. Then I checked in that went very smooth. They didn't have the breakfast coupons at the time they said they would slide them under the door over night. Get to the room and we were pleased. A good size room for NY city. The over all set up of the room was ok could use a redesign that is more modern. Then we check out the bathroom and that left for a lot more the be desired. Really showing the age of the hotel when you see the bathroom. Other lower grade hiltons are mush nicer decor and bathrooms are higher end then what they have. So, it just leaves me as an OK based on appearance. The next day no coupons under the door. So, we go down stairs and it all gets resolved. Breakfast is well worth it there. One of the best free breakfast in town. However if you have to pay for it the cost is $26 and not worth that price. The waiters that really do nothing for you expect a nice big tip as well and are not so nice the next few days if they don't get a good tip. In the end what you pay isn't bad for breakfast if you have the coupons. The breakfast alone would be the only reason I would stay here again other then that I would much rather stay somwhere else.

<Content>Meh We stayed at the Hilton for 5 nights, and chose it because of its great location in Manhattan. We certainly weren't disappointed with the location, just off Times Square. Any location in Manhattan is either walkable or easily got to on the Subway. Bars, restaurants, shops and attractions like the Empire State Building are close at hand.The hotel itself was a bit of a let down. The restaurant is naff, and the rooms feel a bit run down. You're paying for the location and not much else above average.

<Content>Loved the view We wanted a hotel close to Times Square and this hotel fitted the bill. We could walk to anywhere in Times Square. There is a Starbuck's across the street, an Applebee's in the lobby of the hotel. You can walk to many of the theatres as well. I should warn you not to remove anything from the bar unless you plan to pay for it was it is on a sensor and you are charged for it even if you put it back. Our breakfast was not included and were told it would cost us $25 if we wanted the buffet. So ask about it when you check in, whether it is included or not. We did a bus tour and they stopped close to the hotel as well. Walked to the harbor for the harbour cruise, as it is only 4-5 blocks. I would definitely recommend this hotel and stay here again.

<Content>Not coming back We stayed at the Hilton TImes Square after staying at the Waldorf Astoria. The level of service at the Hilton was very much lacking, especially compared to the Waldorf!We think this hotel should be rated with 3 stars rather than 4. It is in a very noisy part of NYC. The front desk staff simply went through the motions -- there was zero indication that they wanted to help us. Also, the drain and faucet on the tub didn't work properly.We definitely recommend staying on the Upper West or East Sides instead of in Times Square.

<Content>Give this hotel a pass First the good: hotel is well-located and the rooms are large, especially for Manhattan. My room had a great view.Now the bad: The room, while large, was not in the best shape. It needed to be painted. The bathroom was gross-lots of hair on the walls and in the bathtub. The walls were thin, too. I was kept awaken by television  loud chat most the night.Reception was not up to snuff. My room was not ready until 4pm, and my first two attempts at using the key were unsuccessful. Reception apologized - a large group had checked out late. In fact, housecleaning was still at it with other rooms on my floor. Was this my fault?There similar noise issues at a recent New York Hilton stay. I would avoid both. By contrast, my Sofitel stay last August was perfect from check in to check out. No view, but it was clean, quiet, and the check-in staff perfect.

<Content>Good business hotel Stayed at the Hilton Times Square earlier this week. Rooms are bigger than average for New York City, and hotel is conveniently located just off Times Square. The lowest level hotel floor is level 25, so street noise is not a problem. Room decor is functional but clean. Hotel linens and beds are excellent quality.

<Content>Excellent stay Date: 15 October 2008Reviewer: Mature couple from Somerset, EnglandSpent 8 nights at this hotel (with Hilton points) for our first ever visit to New York. Loved it ! On arrival, we were upgraded to a king-size room on 36th floor with views over 42nd Street. Huge bed, big-screen TV, mini-bar, tea  coffee making facilities. Could not fault the service from all the staff who were always very helpful  friendly. No sign of the hard sell timeshare touts that other reviewers mentioned.Didn't eat at the hotel as there are many,many options all around the hotel. Applebees on the ground floor was perfect for breakfast with both of us eating for around $15-20. Hotel bar was a bit expensive (but not too much)  was the ideal place to finish the day after walking the city. Excellent location for visiting all the city's attractions.

<Content>Wow! We booked our 1 night stay using pricelines bidding system so I didnt get to find out where we were staying until after Id paid. I was a little bit dubious about what we were going to get after reading some of the reviews about the Hilton Times Square, but we were more than pleasantly surprised with our stay! And what a bargain!The staff were completely professional, but somewhat cool and distant - there was no friendly vibe given off - perhaps because we looked ragged after travelling all day and had a huge amount of luggage? Our room though, was fantastic. It was alot larger than what I was expecting, perfectly clean, high quality furnishings and the room seemed to have been recently refurbished. We had amazing views over to the cruise terminals, north and partial views of Times Square. We were mesmerised at our first glimpse of New York.Our bed was huge and was the most comfortable out of our stay in NY (we stayed at another 2 hotels during our trip - Affinia Manhattan and Sheraton New York Hotel  Towers).Location wise, the hotel is in a great spot for Times Square, Broadway etc, but was still nice and quiet for sleeping.Overall Id recommend a stay here!

<Content>Great location lovely hotel This is a fantastic hotel for anyone who has never stayed in New York before or wants to be in the centre of everything. The hotel entrance is from Broadway with a lift up to the lobby, once in the lobby you dont event realise you are in the middle of Times Square and can hear no noise. The staff at the hotel are really helpful and we used the concierge a few times. We were also upgraded which was a really nice addition to our holiday. The room we had was on the 43 floor and had really fantastic views of times square and the skyline just what you want when you go to this city.The room was very spacious, bed extremely comfortable with plenty of pillows and great flat screen tv with plenty of channels to watch in bed when you have been walking around all day.There is also free tea and coffee making facilities and they will provide as much tea and coffee as you like if you just ask.A nice touch on arrival was a pocket size map of New York handy rather than always getting the guide book out.We really enjoyed our stay and would certaintly stay at Hilton Hotels again as we have always had a great experience.

<Content>perfect stay I lucked into this hotel through Priceline which I use often when traveling to NY. This hotel had never come up before and I was curious to try it out. First, for the tourist, the location could not be better, right on 42nd St high above all the craziness of Times Square and right in the heart of the theatre disctrict. For me, is was perfect as my meetings were only a few blocks away.Check in and front desk very helpful and professional. Room was spacious and comfortable although I could have used without the two beds. I didn't ask to move as it didn't matter. View from my 30th floor room was terrific and virtually sound proof. Never heard a sound from the hall way either. The only complaint I have is with the carpets. The hotel is fairly new, but the carpet choice has already dated the property. Minor, minor issue. I did not eat at the hotel as there are countless other choices in the area. Coffee service is provided in the rooms which is a nice touch. Internet rates were the typical rip off at higher end hotels (although the front desk clerk did tell me I could get it for free at Burger King)Bottom line - if you get a good rate at this hotel - book it.

<Content>Great Place We stayed at the Hilton Times Square for 10 nights and were very satisfied with our stay there. Our room was located on the 38th floor and we enjoyed unobstructed views to the Hudson River and the Empire State Building. The room was very big, equipped with contemporary furniture, a nice big screen TV and a complementary tea/coffee maker. The beds are the most comfortable we have ever slept in. We would stay there again in a flash and can highly recommend this hotel to everyone who wants a truly beautiful place to come to after a long day in the Big Apple and who is not afraid to pay for it.

<Content>OK, but too expensive The hotel is well situated, near times Sq, with entrances on 41st and 42 Streets. The lobby, bar and 鈥渞estaurant鈥?is on the 22nd floor, and then you access the room by separate lift from there. The rooms were, as you would expect, clean and comfortable (very comfy beds!) and a good size. I was upgraded to a corner room, but on the 24th floor there was not much of a view. The breakfast, and in fact the bar food, was not that good, and expensive for what it was. I鈥檇 defiantly recommend eating out. This brings me on to my other issue, which was price. I guess NY was busy, but I paid $699 a night, excluding breakfast, and it just was not worth that at all. $250-$300 maybe. For that price I鈥檇 also expect internet access to be free, not another $14! Defiantly get the impression that they we out to gouge you where they could.

<Content>great for public transportation Times Square is Times Square. Some people love it, some do not. If you have never been, you need to experience it and decide for yourself, but it is busy. The Hilton entrance is right in the middle of it all... just look for the clock out front. The best part of the location was the access to all the subway lines. If you are new to the City and want to check out different areas within the city you should stay here. Get a MetroPass at the subway station and ride unlimited access on the subway and bus lines. The concierge will give you a subway map that is easy to follow. Starting in Times Square you can get to most places without having to get off and transfer to another train... it is VERY convenient. Then when you come home there is alway lots of people in time square no matter the time of night... that is a comfort for some. The rooms were clean and a good size... no complaints. Once inside and well above street level, you feel relaxed and safety was never a concern. We would personally try a different hotel the next time, just to get away from the hustle and bustle of Time Square... but would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to friends and family who want the convenience of access to public transportation.

<Content>Very comfortable and quiet room We stayed in this hotel for two nights and being right in the centre of Times Square this was ideal for a New York stay.The restaurant was small and quite expensive but after venturing out we found that other restaurants nearby were about the same.We would stay here again purely because it ticks all the boxes for a stay in New York.

<Content>Loved the Hilton Times Square Back in September 2007 we stayed at the Hilton Times Square for one week and absolutely loved it. Room was spacious and comfy. Bathroom was ok, not in anyway luxurious but still clean and big enough. People complain that it was noisy? Times Square IS noisy. It's crowded, noisy..it's a mess.. but what do you expect from the center of Manhattan ;-)But once you enter the hotel lobby..all that noise is left behind. Rooms were quiet, you couldn't believe Times Square was right below you.I would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone looking for quality hotel at the Times Square area.

<Content>Great ! worth the money - just don't eat there ! We booked this hotel on recommendation from friends - Great ! It is clean, the rooms are very big, well furnished with lovely fluffy towels and other amenities and we had a great view of the Empire State Building. The staff in the main are helpful and friendly - in particular the bell hops are very nice and a lovely welcome at the end of a day sight seeing ! The one downside is the restaurant. we ate there twice - once when we arrived - food was great and the service was poor - the situation was rescued by a waiter who was not servicing our table but came and helped us - unlike the guy who was meant to be serving us who didn't speak a word and went about 1 mile an hour ! the second time we eat there we were stuck in cause we got soaked during the day. I ordered the steak and it was cold - well not hot anyway - the waiter was no where to be found to return it to get it warmed up and when he cleared our plates he saw my steak was untouched and didn't say a word ! about the fact that I hadn't eaten anything ! We ate out for breakfast but it looked nice. Over all if you don't eat there it is great ! the room service staff are lovely and friendly and do a super job. It is worth the money - just could do with better waiting staff in the restaurant....

<Content>Style on 42nd Street We returned to NYC for a family holiday (3 of us) after a 15 year absence. We decided that we wanted a comfortable, centrally located hotel and the Times Square Hilton scores extremely well in both these regards.The hotel is located in the heart of Times Square so it provided an excellent starting point for any New York adventure being located so conveniently to all forms of transport, the theatre district and the bedlam that is Times Square.More importantly, even when we had a quiet day e.g. Central Park walk, we were always reminded that we were in NYC when we returned to the hotel.The hotel itself provided an oasis , room was very comfortable , very quiet and always succeeded in providing us an environment to recoup.Most noteworthy about the hotel were the excellent concierge staff who were extremely helpful and professional. We actually used the gym a few times and it is well equipped.In terms of pricing we were able to secure a corporate rate of $329 as a result of the company I work for, so this made the deal very reasonable.All in all I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel for anyone looking at a central located , very comfortable hotel.

<Content>Nice surprise The Lobby was recently was given an update--very nice modern look. Our check-in process was pleasant. Actually all the staff we encountered were very friendly.We used HHonors points and we were given the top floor view room! Loved the clean, spacious new modern interior and bathrobes. The hotel is located on a very busy street, but we didn't hear it (fun to watch activity). Many pillows on the comfortable bed with a straight on view of the flat screen television. The Buffet: The selection was unremarkable and the eggs tasted industrial. Considering the large Asian group staying at the time, I had hoped to see Miso soup (no such luck). I am big on fruit for breakfast, which they did have, but it seemed limited. They did have small bottled waters available (nice touch). We had coupons for free meals, great considering, I believe it was $25.00 each otherwise.This was a thumbs up!

<Content>Rather hip, small hotel We used Hilton points to stay at this hotel. It's surprisingly hip and funky, for a Hilton, with somewhat contemporary furnishings. We had a great flat screen, high-def TV in the room and nice art. The bathroom was just standard, but the room size was large for NYC. We had one snafu with the room safe--when we returned one afternoon, the safe blinked and we were unable to open it. It took security 45 min to arrive and we were sweating it--our Broadway tickets were in the safe and the show started in 1 hour. We had turndown service nightly, and the front desk staff were nice. We were on the 25th floor, which is low for NY, and we only heard light buses, etc. Downside for us was the location on a major street in Times Square--the sidewalks were mobbed at night and we could hardly get to the small entrance. I would prefer to stay off on a side street during peak visitor times. But we were there for the US Open and the 7 line is just a block from the hotel (convenient).

<Content>Hilton Times Square - Must Stay! Having wanted to visit New York, the opportunity of a lifetime came up when we saw a deal on Expedia for four people to visit the city, staying in the Hilton Times Square, 3 nights including flights and during the holidays at an affordable price. So we booked it.When we arrived there was one little hiccup when the hotel had got our booking slightly wrong, but they quickly sorted it by giving us an upgrade of the original room we had booked and a free breakfast every morning of our stay. To our great surprise we were on the top floor in one of the most luxorious suites in the hotel. It has two single beds and one king sized bed and a bathroom fit for a king with a massive walk in shower and jaccuzi bathtub. The room also had the most spectacular view of the Empire State building with the most dazzling look at night. The room was also equipped with a kitchen, a bar and a living area. A very nicely decorated hotel with so many floors you could do a few miles jogging just by going floor to floor! The room we had been given orginally which we experienced for a few hours was a bit smaller but still nicely decorated and had the nice views. Although you couldn't quite see the top of the Empire State building, but that didn't really matter. The bathroom was also nice and clean with a shower and bathroom facilities, obviously not a luxourious as our new room. It had a tv but no kitchen and the only problem with it really was, there was one double bed and that was it. Which is the reason why we had to change and since they had no room which we had ordered, we got a luxourious one for free! A really nice lobby area, modern with a view of the skyscrapers, however, not as nice as the room's view but still it was dazzling for people not used to New York Skyscrapers. The breakfast was something else. Just amazing. A choice of anything and everything. Cakes, muffins, cereal, cooked food, the lot. A really nice way to start the day. Then as soon as you walk out of the hotel you walk straight into the life of Times Square. An amazing experience bustling with life, you feel lucky to have stayed in this hotel. Five Stars is definately what this hotel is worth and certainly the place to stay in New York.

<Content>Fabulous Stayed for four nights on the 25 Aug, All i can say is that the hotel is excellent. Staff are very friendly and helpful even when we had a problem with our booking agent all sorted quickly. Room was spotless, very modern and located on the 31t floor. Bed was huge and was very comfy and the view was great from the room and was very quiet. Hotel in a great location handy for all attractions, bar area nice and relaxing. I will definntley book this again on my next trip to the city and would recomend it to anyone.

<Content>Good Hilton in lively neighbourhood We, a family of 5, stayed here in 2 rooms, 4013+4014, for 2 nights on HHonors points.Checkin was without problems. Only disappointing to hear that only the HHonors card holder gets a complementary breakfast. However he can invite 1 guest. This forced us to send our kids across the street to get a breakfast....... $26 without taxes is too expensive....The room is large and has a nice plasma. In our room however there was no remote control, and channel 4 NBC to watch the Olympics was not very clear. The beds are very good, nice and soft. I don't like those hard ones you'll find in most hotels.Breakfast is ok, although I'm used to have a much larger choice in the Hiltons I visit. Staff over there could be a bit more friendly as well.I asked the concierge for the NYC official City guide, but they don't have it. Instead of saying that they don't have it, they everytime (I asked twice) told me that they were already gone......Annoying as well are the persons next to the elevator trying to sell a Hilton time share. Ok, you get 500 HHonors point for listening to them, but further I would not go, although they make nice promises ;-)Other staff, check-out and porters are all very nice. No complaints.Of course the location on 42nd close to Times Square makes it a very good choice.I can't give it 5 stars though, if I compare it with the Kuala Lumpur Hilton we visited last year. That was absolutely top of the bill.

<Content>Right in the heart of things Had been staying at the Waldorf for my husband's business meetings. But moved here when we were footing the bill. You go up an elevator to the 22nd floor to find the lobby. This made a much quieter hotel stay in NY. And it is right in Times Square district. Plenty of everything close, close, close. We watched Maraha Carey on Good Morning America, for example,and decided to just run down from the hotel and see her live in about 5 minutes. Room fine, clean and large picture windows with view of the Hudson River if you are on one side of the hotel, and the Empire State building if staying on the other. Metro close also.A tip...if you have Hilton Honors points but not enough for a free room, you can add dollars to make up the difference as we did.New York is fabulous and has everything for everyone.

<Content>Wouldn't go back The location is decent and close to Broadway shows. It is a very crowded and loud area, also difficult to get cabs in front of hotel due to pedestrian traffic and road closings (random). Room was larger than a typical NYC hotel room but nothing special. Staff was way below average. Very long waits at check in, no follow ups on requests. The phones to guest services never worked and when calling the front desk, the phone must have rang about 50 times on each occasion. It was a very inconvenient stay and I would not go out of my way to stay here again. I used to live in NYC and travel there several times a year on business - this hotel falls into the way below average category on all marks.

<Content>Good Hotel, Great Location We recently stayed at this hotel for a wedding that we attended at the Tavern on the Green in Central Park. I found this hotel to be very centrally located. Madame Tussauds Wax Museum was right outside about 2 doors down, there is an Applebees on the hotel ground level, Coldstones across the street and any type of food you could want on 42nd street a few doors away. Walking on 42nd street was very ineteresting and crowded. We wanted food one evening/morning at around 3 am and we were told that room service is not 24hrs at this hotel so we wandered out in a search for food. Times Square is only one block over so we went there to find food. There were so many people still out on the streets you would never have known that it was past midnight. The crown changes from day to evening from tourists and working people to club kids and some other unsavory type of people but if you walk with purpose and dont stare at people you will not be bothered. A few points about the hotel:1. We are Hilton gold rewards members through AMEX so were upgraded to a 42nd floor corner roo with panaramic views from two sides. If you are a rewards memeber remember to rquest and upgrade because they do not have an executive level at this hotel, which is what they will normally give.2. Also, we were given complimentary breakfast for two for all of the days we stayed, again because they did not have an exeutive level to put us on. This was good becasue the breakfast or two was $52....and it was edible but not great.3. The bellman on the ground floor will ask to see your room key if you are trying to enter the hotel at night so make sure you have it to avoid an unneccesary hassle. 4. You have o valet your car on 41st street entrance if you are parking. They do not have self park for the hotel. Also, when you are leaving call the bellstand about 30-40 minutes prior to when you need the car or you will be waiting for your car. They park in a lot 5 blocks away. FYI, parking is $42 per day.All in alll we enjoyed this hotel. Service was good, concierge was very helpful and all of the staff was friendly. I will be returning with my children to stay and sightsee.

<Content>The Hard Sell Hotel Stayed for 5 nights in July 2008. Good points:1) spacious room which was well maintained and cleaned well each day. Great views from 25th floor (although 44th floor afforded much better obviously!) Very quiet (apart from occasional late night corridor noise (no double doors and door to room very ill fitting with big gap at the bottom of the door));2) location is great as is very central and enabled walking to many placesBad points:1) breakfast charges were extortionate ($30 per head per adult!). Meant having the inconvenience of having to go out and get breakfast each day as simply not prepared to encourage such rip offs anywhere esp when paying for 4. To add insult to injury, one day as we were on our way out, the sales desk man by the elevators stated that he was excited and proud about the breakfast on offer in an attempt to persuade us to stay (clearly few do!). It is very simple Hilton Hotels: sell the breakfasts at a reasonable rate and people will buy them. Hardly rocket science;2) Rooms advertised with internet access - it does not exist. You have to go to the conference centre and pay extra. Not so great on a business trip.3) Too many sales pitches in the lobby - each day we were bombarded with something as we went to and fro including the chance to return to the hotel within 12 months for $149 per night. Having paid $429 per night this was somewhat irritating... but the offer turned out to be a timeshare sales pitch and we would have to have committed to go to a sales event to secure the rate offered. Hey ho! Luckily we are not that gullible...AND...next time we are in NYC, we'll be staying elsewhere away from the desperation of the Hilton group.

<Content>Awesome! Convenience and service are two key words for this hotel. We checked in late Friday night and were treated respectfully by all staff. Check out was just as easy and again we were treated very well. Room was clean and cool considering the temperature on TImes Square was 100. Rooms were quiet, view was spectacular, service was excellent. Couldn't ask for a better location to Theater District.

<Content>Nice business hotel in the heart of Times Sqaure You wouldn't even know that there was a Hilton in Times Square unless someone pointed it out to you. It is very nondescript from the outside. When you walk into the front door, you are only on an elevator level (not the lobby level) so it doesn't look like anything except a bank of elevators. When you take the elevator up to the lobby there is a nice bar, restaurant, seating area and the reception desk. When you go up to your room you take another bank of elevators. Sometimes during rush hour there can be a bottleneck with the elevators since everyone has to go from one bank to the other to get in and out of the hotel, so you kind of have to plan ahead if you have theater tickets! The room is nice size for NY standards, quite spacious and well appointed. The hotel is fairly new so the rooms are modern and up to date (no ugly floral bedspreads that would give you the creeps). The beds are super comfortable Hilton signature beds. We had a nice city view looking out onto 42nd Street from the 26th floor. I imagine that the low stories do not have much of a view so try to request a high floor. If you want to avoid the hussle and bustle of 42nd Street every time you come and go, just enter through the other side (41st street) which is quiet and uncrowded. We walked out onto the 42nd street side one time and that was the last time we did it. It's just a mob scene, but the good news is you can avoid it completely. If you are going you are going to NY to go to Broadway shows and to be in the middle of the action, you will love this location. If you want a quieter, more residential scene, then this is not going to suit you. If you stay here, just accept crowds and traffic as part of the scene. Enjoy

<Content>Great stay in a great locatoin Located just off times square this hotel is the perfect place if you are making a first trip to Manhattan. Times square is in the middle of everything touristy so, as tourists, we could not help but have a great time. The hotel was in great shape. Even the lobby has godd views since it is well above street level. Our room on the 40th floor was even better. It had a great view of the city, the room was well appointed and comfortable. Although the city was all around us we never had a better night's sleep. The service was perfect - although the night staff could not really help up with information on getting to Newark Airport And odd break in service from an otherwise great experience.

<Content>Great view, location but everything else average Not overly impressed with this Hilton. I booked on the Hilton website. I was unhappy that it was completely non smoking, especially when I called specifically to make sure I had a smoking room. Their website could be a little more accurate, as well as those staffing reservations. The staff at the hotel are very polite and the rooms are fine, however, for the price their lobby could sure use some updating! The couches and chairs are very low to the floor and the fabric is old and they are rather beat up. We stayed at the DoubleTree Times Square(also a Hilton property) last time we were here and liked it much better. The view from this Hilton was great. We were on the 38th floor and could see the Empire State Building.The location is good, too! It is on top of Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum and close to everything on Times Square, which was very convenient. Location was important to me. I probably would not stay here again, but I was happy with the view and location. Everything else was just okay.

The room was so clean and flawless, and the food was great in the restaurant on the main floor. Overall a super experience. One tip, we walked one block east to the Port Authority and caught the New York Airport Service Express Bus for $12 each way to and from La Guardia.

<Content>Great Location, Good view, friendly Staff I've been to New York City many times for business and vacations but never stayed in this hotel. I was headed to Canada on business when American cancelled my flight at the last minute. Frustrating after checking my bags in and then getting the flight cancelled. While waiting for my bags I was looking for a hotel to book at the last minute. Many hotels were full. I saw that this one was available so I booked it. There weren't too many options and I was frustrated as I didn't expect to have to book a hotel in NYC. I just flew in for a quick meeting and then was expecting to head to Montreal on another meeting that day.I called the hotel and they confirmed a suite on a high floor. $400 + tax rate. I took a taxi and promptly checked into the hotel. Everything was quick and easy at the front desk and they had my room waiting. A bit strange since you have to take an elevator from the ground floor up to the lobby and then another set of elevators up to the rooms. I had a room on the 35th floor and it was very spacious with an amazing view. Surprisingly it was quiet even though it faced Times Square. The location couldn't be better as you are in the heart of the action. There is an entrance from Time Square or another entrance on 44th Street as well. There is a bar off the front desk area. Nothing super high end but it was busy when I checked in.The room was comfortable with a King bed that was comfortable, a good sized bathroom, LCD TV and a couch and desk. View was great. Friendly staff with no problems at all. Pay to play internet that was $21 per day and it worked glitch free. There are higher end hotels in NYC but this location is great if you want to be in the heart of the action.

<Content>AWSOME ! I have stayed at this Hotel Twice in the last 2 years and am in the process of booking AGAIN ! Yes the Hotel location is fantastic and the staff great but the main reason we stay there is the disabled access.Before we booked the first time i was looking at the internet sites for MONTHS trying to find a hotel with good disability access and a good location and i even E - Mailed around 30 hotels for information regarding disabled access and the ONLY hotel that answered me was the HILTON ! This is why we ONLY stay here and we dont care that we can find cheaper ! When we were there last year they even got me 2 New York Giants game tickets so i was Exited ! I never thought I'd get the tickets ! Thats How good they are on front desk !There is no better Hotel ! In the whole of NYC !

<Content>Good hotel, large bedrooms, very well situated I stayed for 5 nights at Hilton Times Square. It was my 2nd time there in 5 years, usually going to Novotel NYC. I was upgraded to an executive room at the 41st floor. The room was very large, perfectly clean, with a comfortable king size bed. Nice bathroom with a real tub you can lie in. A lot of towels, changed every day, also bathrobes. Large LCD. A well-sized desk with a good armchair. An high-speed ethernet connection. Everything to work efficiently. I faced an issue with the safe and it was fixed in 10mn. My customer was also satisfied. The only drawbacks are the noises from the 42nd street, even being at the 41st floor (with outside building workers, picking even at 10pm on saturday). The 1st time, my room was on an other side, so less noisy. The breakfast could be better for 30$ (incl.tax  tip), lower quality than the one offered at Novotel NYC for the same price. Service is very good (bell men, restaurant, concierge) to excellent (front desk, security and maintenance). Check-in  out are very fast. Access is very simple through metro, in between the 42nd and PTA stations, a few steps from PTA terminal to commute to/from airports through the airlink shuttles.I would definitely recommend this hotel if you can get a reduced rate, the public fare of 500$ being out of the money.

<Content>Great Location, Great Hotel! We stayed here March 12-14, 2008 with my two daughters for a combo business trip/pleasure trip. The hotel is AWESOME! It's so centrically located your right next door practically to Madame Tussauds and all the great places to eat. They have a nice drink lounge and great views! I loved this place! Housekeeping was great, staff was great! The only thing I did not like was the pushy doorman/cab hailer they have on the back door that does not face Madame Tussauds. As if I can't hail a taxi myself since they are already lined up there! Then I had a limo take me to the airport compliments of my company and all he did was OPEN the door for us which I did not ask him too in the first place and he stuck his hand out for like 5 minutes until I got the picture that he was EXPECTING a tip. I begrudingly gave it to him but that to me is like pan handling in my opinion!Great hotel, but stay away from the back door taxi area. Hail your own taxi's down the street. It's cheaper!

<Content>Had a Great Time!! My husband and I just returned from a 9 night stay at the Hilton Times Square. I researched alot of hotels prior to making our reservation. I chose this hotel because of the good reviews. For the most part everything that was said was true.The location is right in the middle of everything! Convienent to anything and everything. Port Authority, subways, restaurants, Broadway shows and shops.The rooms are larger that most and were very clean. The beds were extemely comforable and the bathroom was a decent size. We always had hot water. The elevators were fast. On 2 occasions we had to call maintenance, no sound on one tv channel and the a/c wasn't as cold as it could have been. The crew was very efficient and took care of the issues right away.I cannot say enought about the staff. Everyone was extremely nice and helpful from the bellman to the front desk. Adrian the conciere was very pleasant and always willing to explain directions to us. Olga at the front desk was one of the nicest ladies I have ever met.The only things I would change would be to add more drawer space and to have free internet service in your room. We paid over $500.00 a night and I thought it to be very unfair that I had to pay extra for this.Other that that, we had a wonderful time and would return again.

<Content>Very nice place in a central location The main entrance to this hotel is actually on 41st St., but there's another one - easy to miss except for that big askew clock - in the middle of the busiest block of 42nd, between 7th and 8th Aves. The rooms are all from the 23rd floor and above, with the lobby on the 21st, via a dedicated elevator. I got there late AM and was told my room wasn't ready. But they took my cell number and said they'd call when it was. They did, at about 1 PM. (Baggage check is at ground level.) Getting the key took a while because of a line at the desk.The room, on 23rd floor, was bright, clean and spacious, with a desk, lounge chair and a 37 flat-screen TV, which I only used to get local weather. A big window lets in lots of light and offers decent city views. There was no street noise, and this is 42nd St. we're talking about. A nice-sized closet with had real hangers, and cloth bathrobes, too. I almost slipped in the shower, though. When I mentioned this at check-out, the clerk told me I could have asked for a mat, so you might want to keep this in mind.A passable exercise room is on the CC, or mezzanine, level, not the 23rd floor as stated in the hotel guide in my room. There's also a business center, $2.99 plus $.59/minute to use the computer.The location is great, a short walk from subways, Times Square, the theater district, restaurants, et. al. The biggest problem was negotiating my way through the crowds on the street. If you can get this place on Priceline, it's a pretty good bargain.

<Content>In the Core of the Big Apple My wife and I just celebrated an anniversary in New York City and stayed at the Times Square Hilton. We abosolutely loved the location. It is right in the heart of Times Square and within a block of a subway station with access to almost every subway line in the city. The rooms start on the 25th floor, so street noise is minimized. We stayed on floor 26, so we could still hear an occaional horn or siren, but it was not as bad as expected. The only other problem with the room was a slow draining tub leading to ankle deep water by the end of a shower. Overall we had a wonderful stay.

<Content>Perfect if you're there during the week! The women of my family decided that we were going to take our first ever trip to NYC together--we had 7 women in two hotel rooms, and we were still comfy! This hotel is perfect if you want the turist view of NYC. It was soooo clean and more than what we had expected from a NYC hotel. The rooms were normal size and the hotel was more than happy to help us in anyway possible. Security is tight,so you are sure to feel safe. The lobby on the 21st floor is a little small, but beautiful. We stayed on the 43rd floor and one room had a view of Times Square and the other a view of the Empire State Building. I wouldn't recommend staying in times square however, if you are wanting a true local experience, but the location can't be beat. Directly downstairs from the hotel is AMC Theatres, McDonalds, Dave  Busters, Ripley's Believe It Or Not, Madame Tussauds, NYC Gift Shop, and a Subway stop! Across the street there is more shopping and a Cold Stone. ***TImes Square on the weekends is CRAZY. Wouldn't recommend being there on the weekend. You can't get anywhere and the sidewalks are insane.The hotel rocks though, if you want to stay in TImes Square...You have to stay here.

<Content>Not bad, had better Having travelled all over Amercia, staying in San Fransicso, Los Angeles, Las Vegas and lastly New York. I have to say this was my least favoured hotel. Had dinner in the hotel on the first night, it was terrible and shockingly overpriced.Room was ok, nice and clean. Good location for all there is to see and do in New York. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to a friend - it's way too pricey for what you actually get.

<Content>Great Experience At the Hilton I have just returned from a trip to New York where we stayed at the Hilton Times Square Hotel for 5 nights. I cannot fault the hotel in anyway, from the moment we arrived we were welcomed by a very pleasent door man. We took the lift to the reception on the 20th floor, where we checked in. The staff on the desk were very polite and upgraded us to a king room on the 41st floor with views of the Empire State building which was excellent.The room itself was clean and comfortable with a plasma tv and loads of space. The location was perfect as we were close to all the things we wanted to visit and see. Just off Times Square where we were able to pick up the Grayline tour bus for the Downtown loop, the port Authority was half a block away, which was handy when we arrived back from Woodbury Common weighed down with bags. Macy's and Central Park where only 5/10 mins walk away as was 5th avenue and just to the left of the 42nd street entrance there was a subway station that connected with most parts of the city conveniently.I will definately stay at this hotel on my next trip to New York as we had a great experience here. And I would highly recommend it to anyone who wanted a central good standard hotel.

<Content>Great stay at the Hilton My husband and I stayed at the Hilton on a Saturday night. The staff was wonderful. When we drove up to the hotel the doorman was helpful and explained that since check in was 3:00, we would have 50-50 shot of being able to check in right away (it was noon). He told us where to go if we could not check in to leave our bags. (Note:if you drive, the valet parking is not on 42nd but around the back of the hotel on 41st) At the desk (no line) they told us our room was not ready (as expected). The processes our check in so when the room was ready we could just get the key--but then instead of waiting we then were told we were being upgraded and could check in right away. Fast elevators, spacious room, great views. Location was great! Concierge was helpful securing reservations for dinner. We will stay here again for sure.

<Content>Fantastic stay at Hilton - Location! We live close to NYC so we used Priceline for a quick one night stayover. I was given this hotel (4*, Theatre District). I wasn't sure what to expect but we were quite pleased. However, there is a risk of not getting a double room by booking thru Priceline. We were first given a Single for 2 adults  2 small children. We immediately went back and asked for a Double. To make a long story short, after a bit of a wait, we were upgraded to a double on a top floor with great views of Times Square. No complaints here! FYI - be aware that you may not be able to get a double on a weekend night. The Hotel is quite nice and clean. The staff was very pleasant. Our valet was quite informative. Our room looked like it was newly done. Everything is so convenient . Carmines is a wonderful family style Italian restaurant nearby - be prepared for lots of food. There is a nice bakery around the corner. Toys R Us was a hit with the kids. The breakfast prices were a bit high so we ate breakfast right near the hotel. We did have to pay for valet parking - $52. It is NYC after all. I'd recommend this hotel to anyone that enjoys the action of the Theatre District.

<Content>Time Square Hilton checks good As stated before you can't get more central to Times Square unless you sleep in the square itself. The hotel staff is very courteous and the rooms are standard Hilton fare which is usually a cut above average. They have the new 3 foot HD flat screen TVs. I have read this hotel charges a lot for amenities but I did not use any and cannot comment on that information. Like most of NYC the bar and menu are pricey but the food is very good and a step up from the regular hotel fare. The bus terminal is 1/2 a block away and makes for easy access to the city. Clean and quiet rooms in the middle of the tourist action.

<Content>Perfect place to stay in Times Square Stayed at the Hilton from March 15th-19th. Being the first time in NYC for my family we weren't sure what we would end up with.This was perfect.We were on the 39th floor able to look down onto 42nd.Our room was a double but had plenty of extra space.The staff was one of the friendliest I've seen. My husband has a coat that is noticable. It never failed that the staff at the desk recognized him and would always ask how we were doing and what we had done.We were able to walk to almost anywhere that we wanted to go. Even locations not in Times Square. My one draw back is the internet charge. With what the room costs and the items in the refrigerator one would think they could not charge for the internet.Would that keep us from going back? No way. I would be willing to tell anyone they need to stay at this hotel.

<Content>Right in the centre Never been to New York before. Easy check in. Taxi had no trouble finding it $45 from JFK. Fantastic room on 31st floor. Amazing view. Could see lights of Times Square but couldn't hear a thing. Extremely comfortable beds. Huge flatscreen TV. Digital clock. Maps and information guides. Big fluffy towels and bathrobes. Evelyn Crabtree bathroom goodies. Free newspaper.We ate breakfast nearby, lots of choice. 15 mins walk to 5th Avenue (Abercrombie). 2 mins to subway (buy metrocard really easy). Theatres all round hotel , can book cheap tickets at TKTS on day of show. We chose this time because of the St Patricks Day Parade and we walked to The Rockefeller Centre to watch. Really worth going and good position to get good view. Macy's and Empire State 5 mins on subway, Ground Zero 12 mins on subway. Central Park 15 mins walk. Lots of great places to eat. Try cheesecake at Juniors. Would love to stay there again one day.

<Content>Great location in the Times Square area I spent six nights at this hotel in Feb 2008. I was extremely pleased with this choice and would happily stay here again.Positives:- Location! On 42nd St. between 7th and 8th Avenues, right in the heart of the theater district and the Times Square area. Almost every subway line in the city passes through the Port Authority station or the Times Square station, both of which are right by the hotel. Excellent inexpensive ethnic restaurants are within walking distance in the Hell鈥檚 Kitchen neighborhood to the west (I avoided the touristy and chain restaurants in the immediate vicinity of the hotel, though). I felt safe walking alone in the area at night, even at midnight or so (I am female). I couldn鈥檛 have asked for a better-located base in NYC.鈥?Very friendly, helpful staff, from checkin to checkout.鈥?My room was kept very clean, and room makeup was prompt.鈥?Because the hotel is so high, it has excellent views and is insulated from the noise below (the noise isn鈥檛 inaudible, but it is muffled, and it didn鈥檛 bother me even though I consider myself very noise-sensitive). I loved my view north over the midtown skyscrapers and the Hudson River.鈥?The hotel is relatively new, and it shows. Everything worked and was in good shape. 鈥?The room was well lit, with excellent bedside lights for reading.鈥?The shower pressure and hot water temperature were excellent.鈥?My room was quite large, with a large comfy chair right by the window with its spectacular views. I brought my takeout ethnic dinners back to the room and enjoyed them while gaping at the view.鈥?The bed was the now-typical Hilton comfortable bed, with lots of pillows and a down duvet.鈥?It was very easy to get here from LaGuardia. I took the NY Airport Service bus directly to the Port Authority bus terminal; it stops right outside the terminal, and a quick walk across 8th Avenue and half a block down 42nd Street, and you鈥檙e there. Very easy even with my relatively large piece of luggage, and it only took about 25 minutes.鈥?I didn鈥檛 use most of the hotel鈥檚 services, so I can鈥檛 comment on service charges, but I did check a bag for a few hours with the bellhop downstairs and wasn鈥檛 charged for that. He retrieved my bag in about two minutes, too, very speedy!Negatives/other factors (not very negative):鈥?If you do not want to be in the bustle and crowds of the Times Square area, you may want to choose another hotel. The minute you step out onto the sidewalk, you are in the midst of the action. I love big cities, and I loved this, but others may not.鈥?As others have mentioned, you take an elevator to the lobby and then a second elevator to your room 鈥?no direct trips. The elevators were very speedy, though, and were rarely full.鈥?I paid for this hotel with HHonors points, so I can鈥檛 comment on price or value.鈥?A couple times when I came back to the room, the maid (I assume) had turned off the heat altogether. Although it鈥檚 not that big of a deal, I would prefer to have the thermostat left where I set it. (I would have been crabbier about it if it had been the A/C in the summer. :-)鈥?The 42nd Street entrance is not that visible. Look for a sign and a tilted clock about 12-15 feet above street level, and little metal statues at ground level. I never used the 41st Street entrance so can鈥檛 comment on finding that.In summary, I loved my stay here, in this exciting part of the city, and would be delighted to stay here again if my travels take me back to NYC.

<Content>Hotel Was Nice, Price was a Different Issue Okay, upon arriving at this hotel, i was nicely greeted by the doorman who took my luggage to the bell stand and then was handed off to another bellman who took me up to the 19th floor to the Lobby.Upon getting to the lobby, i was greeted by the front desk manager and was able to check in about 3 hours early.I was given a corner room on the 39th floor that faced Times Square itself.Very nice views of downtown and of the area.However here is where the concern comes in.The next morning, i went downstairs to the restaurant to get breakfast.I waited at the stand for a few minutes, and since no one was at the desk to sit anyone i just got a seat for myself.Since, i was only really thristy and wanted some fruit, i was asked if i had the breakfast voucher. I handed the guy the voucher and then was on my way.Upon drinking my juice and banana i recieved a bill by the guy.I looked in it, that so called juice and banana i had would of ordinarily cost me $20.50. Then there was a hand stamp on here saying (Gratuity not included) What gratuity, all i had was some juice and a banana.I'd feel sorry for some other person with no voucher who wanted a bowl of cereal and some juice and had to pay $20.50.Then, upon getting my bill, i noticed that the supposed $13.99 for the internet had actually turned into $15.70 with taxes included.So you get the my sense of where i'm going with this.I was just concerned with the price for a juice/banana and internet for one day would of ordinarily cost me over $35.00.So just beware when staying at the hotel about the breakfast price and internet.The fitness center is actually in a make-shift meeting room.There are a couple of pieces of equipment to use but it would be a little embrassing in your workout clothes and have 100 people for a meeting outside the door talking and watching you workout.

<Content>My choice for NYC visits My wife and I live in the NY area, and this is our choice for weekend visits into the city. Rooms are spacious for the area, service is always good (especially bell service  taxi). The hotel is SPOTLESS - from the lobby through the rooms, even during snowy / slushy periods. The other nice feature - the hotel is QUIET - no street or interior noise. Climate control is also very good. Easy to subway  transit. You can feel comfortable and at home here, and I never have to worry about having unfortunate problems when I'm trying to relax.

<Content>Amazing hotel in excellent location. We stayed at this hotel between 16th Feb and 21st Feb 2008. Hotel is very clean, spacious and comfortable. All staff were friendly and helpful especially the bell men at the entrance. They always met you with a smile and were more than happy to give directions and advice. Our room was on 42nd floor with the most amazing view of Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty in the distance!! AMAZING!!!!!!!!! We can't wait to get the pictures developed!!!! The view was priceless!!! We travelled with 2 teenagers who absolutely loved the hotel. The room was clean with the most comfortable beds which had fresh linen on every day. They also liked the flat screen TV! The location was excellent with shops, restaurants and theatres right outside the door. We went to see Mary Poppins which was brilliant and only 3 doors away from the hotel. Can't wait to go back!!

<Content>Feel Cheated at the Hilton Stayed here for a convention. In every way we felt taken advantage of. The hotel is so overpriced for what you get. It felt like a giant factory where no one really cared about us as guests. Everything was extra. It is unbelievable that a hotel charges guests to use the hotel gym. Two years ago the hotel charged $12. Now they charge $18. That's a 50% increase. On their website, they mention that guests enjoy 24 hour access to the fitness centre but fail to mention that they charge $18 to use the facility. To check a bag is $3.50 a service that most hotels even in New York do fo free. I left feeling taken advantage of and a bad taste in my mouthStaying here has tarnished the Hilton name for me. I would not stay here again.

<Content>Fantastic Stay My wife and I stayed at the Hilton Times Square over Presidents' Day Weekend. It was an excellent stay overall. The location is ideal, and the hotel itself was just what we were looking for. Because the main lobby and all of the rooms are on relatively high floors, the hotel is very quiet and relaxing--even in the midst of the energy of Times Square. Check-in and check-out were efficient--we really didn't make use of many other services. Our room was very spacious and comfortable, and it had a great view looking north over 42nd Street. We packed a lot of sightseeing into the weekend, so it was nice to have a quiet, comfortable place in a central location. We would go back without hesitation.

<Content>Nothing to shout about Took my girlfriend here as a surprise and I have to say the location was good, but other than that it wasn't anything special. I was actually expecting a little bit more.Beds were comfy and rooms were good sized, but I wouldn't call the staff that helpful or friendly.Average at best - does not compare to the Marriott around the corner, which is fabulous.

<Content>Loved it! I was here on business, and had a great stay at this hotel. Compared to other NYC hotels, the room was HUGE as well as the bathroom (I had stayed at the Sheraton Times Square and their rooms were TINY!). The bed was super comfy, the room had a flat screen TV, an arm chair and a desk and chair as well as a mini bar. I had a great view of Times Square and never heard one taxi honk while staying here (I can't say the same for the Sheraton). The front desk was very friendly and check-in was speedy. The only thing that was annoying was you had to take an elevator up to the lobby from the street. We had drinks both nights at the lobby bar and service was great here as well. I would definitely stay here again!

<Content>Great hotel in times square We stayed here for a night. The hotel was really great because of the following reasons:1. Location - smack bang in the middle of 42nd street, steps away from everything that Times square has to offer, without the crowd.2. Spacious rooms - It is hard to imagine that a hotel in Times square can have such large rooms, but Hilton had it.3. Great rates - I got a $50 discount simply by using my AAA card. And the hotel website gave the cheapest rates in any case. No need to book it on any other website.4. Transportation - A hundred feet away from the Port Authority bus terminal, and a few steps away from almost every major subway line.The only thing that might be annoying to soe people is that you have to use two elevators to get to your room - one to get to the lobby which is on the 20th floor, and then from the lobby to the room.

<Content>Another excellent stay Just returned from an unexpected, unplanned, very last-minute, three night stay in New York. We booked on Wednesday and travelled on Thursday morning and, as we had stayed very happily at this hotel three years ago, we decided to book here again. We were not disappointed. The hotel is fabulous and in the best central position possible. The reception staff are so helpful and the whole experience was excellent. The room was beautiful with such a comfortable bed and high-grade ameneties. Our coffee-maker was in the bedroom not the bathroom ! The hotel is top class and immaculate. We absolutely loved it again and would not hesitate to stay there in the future. Wonderful ! Go NOW !

<Content>Location, Location, Location!!!!! This hotel is perfect for a weekend getaway with your spouse. The location is the best. The rooms are very nice, even had a view of the Empire State Building. Applebee's is adjoining in the lobby, but there is much better choices right out the door.I would not hesitate to stay again. The lobby bar is a nice place for a nightcap and the staff was friendly and helpful!

<Content>Nice spacious room and convenient location Stayed one night at the Hilton Times Square. AAA rate was $369 U.S./night - about average for a decent hotel in the Times Square area. I stayed on the 28th floor so street noise was not apparent.The room was spacious, clean and the bathroom was well appointed. Good quality (Evelyn Crabtree) and complete set of toiletries including mouthwash, a sewing kit and shoe cleaning cloth - these items tend to be missing in a lot of hotels.Highlights:- Large LCD TV- Very spacious office desk and comfortable ergonomic chair- Comfortable bed- Clean and well furnished bathroom- Great location - 42nd near Broadway. Given the central location, there was no need to use the hotel restaurant - tons of good places to eat nearby to suit almost any palate.Negatives:- Internet access was $13.95/day - Shower head was quite old and should have been replaced, but water pressure was okay

<Content>Convenient The location was excellent, close to the attractions we wanted to see. But hotel entrance on either side was easy to miss and didn't feel like a Hilton hotel I expect it to be. Once upstairs in the lobby, it was more like it. Rooms were spacious and clean. Though I still find it odd having tea and coffee making facilities in the bathroom. Imagine waiting for your coffee whilst sat in the toilet. There was a nice selection for breakfast. Concierge or front desk weren't so helpful in giving advice to get to the airport other than catching the cab. Overall, the hotel provided convenience and comfort at a fair price.

<Content>Great New York City spot! Stayed right in Times Square which is a super location that is easy to get a subway to everything and walk most places. Never took a cab. Hotel starts on floor 22 so you are away from all the noise and hustle and busle of Times Square yet it is right out the door below. Very quick and friendly check in and check out. We were on the very top floor and had a great view of the Empire State Bldg. We could see for miles. Very big windows to take in the view. A little slow with getting things delivered to the room but we were on the top floor. Conceirge not readily available on the phone. Lovely and big room. Would most definitely stay here again. Best part is you are in a great location but it is sooooooo quiet in the room. AND to top it off the view is awesome.

<Content>wonderful hilton times sq. Its location is amazing: 100 meters from Times Square, near Broadway, the 5th Avenue and the main theatres. Our room, on the 24th floor, was cosy, clean (room and bathroom cleaned up every day) and warm, not so noisy, even beeing above the 42th street. The staff was very kind.

<Content>Magical Experience Family member arranged this great trip. Right from arriving in the taxi, our every need was catered for. Met at door, luggage taken, escorted to lift. Front desk very friendly and efficient. Concierge excellent even to printing out our boarding passes for us for flight home. Rooms large and very comfortable. Excellent views - quite breathtaking. Housekeeping efficient and friendly. Told us to let her know whenever we needed anything extra. Only down side was the long queue for breakfast. Make sure you are not in a hurry. Once seated though, it is well worth the wait with great selection and great views. Don't ask for a hot drink from the bar!! It will take at least 30 minutes and may well arrive cold. They are clearly not geared up for this. Great location. Easy access to everywhere. When we left, a taxi was hailed for us without having to ask and we were escorted to the car but were not even given opportunity to give a tip which was encouraging as, in NY, it seems that tips are expected for everything. Taxi driver had no difficulty finding hotel on our arrival although, I gather, many do.

<Content>Great Visit to NYC Just returned from a weekend stay in NYC. Stayed at the Hilton Times Square after shopping around. We had a very nice stay. Hotel was clean, quiet, and staff was very helpful. Our room was not ready when we arrived, but we did request a certain floor to be near family members. Lobby is on the 20th floor. Separate elevators take you to your floor quickly and quietly. New linens on the beds were evident. The views from the room were excellent! After we explored the city, we had a great spot to come back to recover. Had a drink at the bar in the lobby which was nice. Caught the Lion King, dinner at Carmine's and cheese cake at Juniors. Excellent weekend on all aspects.

<Content>Awesome hotel Hilton times square, New York, The best hotel i have ever stayed in!I have just returned from Hilton times square. I spent the week before xmas there. I had the most awesome time there, the hotel made me feel very welcome, on arrival the reception upgraded my room and had a view of the empire state building and downtown manhatten. The room was very large and was extremely comfortable. I was there for one week and i could have stayed for weeks, the bar is very nice although a little expensive. Its location is perfect for anyone first time or experienced vistors to the city. would recommend it too anyone! Great place to stay.Dan, South London

The concierge is worthless.Housekeeping is poor also..found old clothes of a previous guest under the bed in one of our rooms. room sevice pizza is GROSS. We were very disappointed in the service at this place. Other reviews had left us hopeful. But the hotel needs better management, seriously.

<Content>Nice but not helpful w/ taxis my boyfriend and i stayed for 2 nights. the room was nice with everything we needed and housekeepng was great. only problem-when we checked out we had them hold our bags and the guy made a 'joke' about a tip...i felt all he wanted was money, and more money. i know it is nyc but come on. we asked they call us a taxi as i know it is a pain to get one and they refused to help us and another couple as we waited outside to get a taxi. i would have expected a fancy nyc hotel to be more helpful upon check out. as far as breakfast-we got seated right away but after a few minutes there was a huge line and the person who seats you basically left the restaurant and made people wait at least 5 minutes when there were many tables available. not sure if i would stay again due to service.

<Content>Hilton Times Square Enjoyable Nice hotel ,good sized rooms comfy and clean our airconditioning was'nt working and we could'nt open the windows due to construction outside still these things happen.The reception and conceriege staff were nice and helpful, we did'nt eat in the hotel as it was quiet expensive and there was'nt a great choice,the breakfast menu looked good but its New York and we left early everyday to get a head start.It is a nice large hotel with a great location and its slightly off the madness of Times Square one minute walk so there was'nt problems with late night noise.

<Content>Loved It! Times Square is an easy place to stay. You are close to nearly every thing you want to see, and can easily get there by taxi cab, the subway and by walking. This hotel starts on the 21st floor, so it is very private. The staff was excellent. Our room was clean by the time we came back every day. We were given plenty of towels, soaps, shampoos etc. By the third day the staff left extra coffee and shampoo because we had been using it. The bed was VERY comfortable. The room was the largest I have seen for NYC. It was nice to have a flat screen tv. The hotel might have been nicer than my house. The lights from times square were not a problem at all from our room, and we really enjoyed the view of the city. It was not a great view room, but the view of the city was still nice.

<Content>Great place to stay! Great hotel and staff was very accomodating to our requests. We asked for adjoining rooms and got them. Rooms were large and very clean. The safe is underneath the beverage refrigerator. The hair dryers are not on the wall in the bathroom but in the closet in a canvas bag. One of our rooms had a robe and the other didn't, so you may have to ask for one. Even though we were on the 23rd floor, we felt the view was great. As others have stated, it is hard to see from the street so look for the black and white clock. Since our flight did not leave until late in the evening (8:45 p.m.) we called for luggage pickup and they took all 9 pieces to storage. All we had to do was tip them when we picked them up. Very convienent to the subway and bus tours. We did not eat in the restaurant based on other's reviews. There is an Applebee's attached to the building that serves breakfast. It was as good as Roxy's and about half the price. Someone left a review and said Dallas BBQ across the street had breakfast but they do not serve breakfast now. There is also a McDonald's (world's largest they say) right next door. Also, there is a three-story pharmacy across the street with an ATM. There is a pizza place across the street on the corner. (not PAX)..don't go there!

<Content>Large, Clean, Comfortable Rooms in Prime Location The Hilton is a gem in Times Square! The upscale rooms are huge by New York standards, the white bathrooms sparkle, and the bed, lounge chair, ottoman, and huge modernistic desk and chair are inviting and accommodating. Add the large flat panel TV, tons of drawer and closet space, a mini bar frig, and full length closet mirrors, and The Hilton surpasses most of the 4 star properties in the vicinity, especially for the value. The fitness center seemed smaller than my guest room and only has two treadmills, two bikes and an elliptical machine amidst a weight station with four machines fanning out from the center and a rack of free weights. An old TV and water cooler have seen their day, and the machines need maintenance to keep from squeaking. Luckily, I was the only guest interested in exercising early in the morning, as the facility is quite tight though adequate. The bar and restaurant are a bit small for the property's size, and the food was average fare. The bartender, as well as the front desk staff were very friendly. I was welcomed for an early check-in and was granted a 2pm checkout without any incident. Bags can be checked for free with the bellhop, and umbrellas are available from the concierge or front desk. The maids ranged from curt to exceedingly friendly, and one went way out of her way to get me toothpaste when I inquired. The Hilton's location is great, and you can take the Times Square subway or walk almost anywhere you'd want to go in the city. Lord  Taylor and Macy's are within a comfortable walking distance, as are the theaters and Radio City Music Hall and Rockefeller Center. Bryant Park behind the NY Public Library on Fifth and 40th has a free skaing rink, and rentals are only $10. My stay was extremely comfortable, and the drapes blocked the sunlight in the morning so that I slept well. The bed had a great mattress and pillows, and the bedding and furnishings were upscale, bright and attractive. The large bathroom counter ran the length of the room, and a Cuisinart coffeemaker for two with large ceramic mugs and tea selections provided a nice touch. The bathroom itself was a bit small, but by NY standards, it was above average. The tub was very deep, and the shower head was placed very high, a great touch for tall guests! Water pressure was fantastic as well. Overall, the Hilton far exceeded my expectations. It is a bit difficult to find, as several enterprises share the same address between 7th and 8th Avenues. Look for funky sculptures on the ground where the entrance is tucked into an alcove. You are whisked up to the 21st floor lobby, and rooms start on the 23rd floor. The building is situated a couple blocks from any other buildings to the north and many blocks to the south, so that the views are all phenomenal in comparison with other Manhattan hotels, where you could be looking out at the adjacent building's windows a few feet away, or some mechanical apparatus on a rooftop. I highly recommend this property!

<Content>Great location My husband took me to this hotel as a surprise trip to new york for a special birthday. He did a good job!! This was our first time to New York and we loved it. We crammed so much in to a 3 night stay - we were exhausted. The hotel was perfect. Big rooms, big comfy bed, big TV! Fab views of the empire state and it was lovely and clean. One of the best thing about this hotel is its central location, you could walk to most things which was great as you didn't feel like you were missing out on anything by being underground on the subway. I would recommend this hotel to anybody visiting new york.

<Content>Location super We booked directly through the hotel website and luckily we got a corporate rate which was fantastic so that is also mainly what my review is based on the price. Having looked extensively for a relatively resonable rate on a good standard/any hotels (they dont exsist in New york at Christmas period) we were happily surprised by the good rate we got. It was appox half the price of the standard rate, possibly my review would not be as good if we had paid the full price.The hotel room was nice, big and bed comfortable, pillows very comfy, nice big TV (not that you have time to watch anything) bathroom nice with crabtree evelyn products etc. We had fantastic view empire state building 32nd floor. The check in was easy, every one we met at reception was pleasant and helpful. We didnt eat in hotel but the applebees restaurant next door (connecting door from hotel) was nice for breakfast. I would not consider the hotel plush but having been our first time in new york the location was just fantastic, walking distance of everything which is what we wanted. They had scaffolding up right outside timesquare entrace but we entered on arrival through 42nd back entrance. The hotel was very quite we slept really well and had no problems what so ever with noise. I have stayed in nicer hotels but as this was our first time in New york, so Im told the room etc are new and big and exceptionally clean in comparison to some others! If you are looking for plush luxury I would try somewhere else, New york palace hotel was stunning we popped in to have a look and the standard rate was the same as the high rate on hilton so possibly for luxury a better option.Whatever you decide have a nice stay.....

<Content>Worst Customer Service Never have I seen such poor customer service. I have stayed at Hilton many times for business and never had to ask for a change of service. I will never recommend this chain to anyone again.Even being a gold member they would not change the date of reservation. As a scientist, trainings are mostly subject to change due to personnel's schedule at a major hospital such as Mt Sinai. You would think a hotel of this prestige and name would be top for customer service. They have lost one member and anyone else who heeds my advice.

<Content>Clean and nice, plus great location The hotel was a bit difficult to see from the street, I almost walked past it; the frontage on 42nd street is narrow and the neon surrounding it sure is bright!The check-in is in the upper lobby, next to the bar and restaurant; they're going for the 'cool' look here. Check-in was fast, efficient and courteous. I did not interact with any other staff during my stay.My room was a double on higher floor (38th) with a great view of Empire State Building. Rooms are new  clean, with modern good looking interior and a good work area and chair. The bed was very comfortable, with great selection of pillows. There's a minibar in the room, didn't use it.The TV in room is a nice 37 LCD but unfortunately they have only analog channels available, thus image quality was quite poor. This is a pet peeve of mine, why do so many hotels get this wrong?! Putting in new flat panel TVs without HD signal is just pointless.The bathroom was clean and neat. Two small things: hot water took a while to arrive and there appears to be little ventilation in the bathroom, lots of condensation on the mirror after a shower.The exercise room was under renovation, they had moved the very basic equipment to the conference center level into one of the meeting rooms. Just a small universal machine, one bench with light dumbbells, a bike, an elliptical machine and two treadmills. Functional but not that great even by hotel standards.Overall impression is positive, good room, great location, will be back as long as company pays.

<Content>Great location for a first time in New York This hotel is in the centre of New York - great for Times Square obviously, close to Fifth Avenue - Tiffanys, Saks, The Apple Store etc... Convenient for Central Park. Also close to Bryant Park, near the New York Public Library. Views of the Empire State Building. Usual Hilton service, very friendly. Clean rooms. Breakfast OK (porridge fine, hot buffet should have been called tepid buffet, fresh fruit a plenty, good choice of juices, bagels cold and hard and nowhere to make toast or toast your bagels, good selection of cold meats and smoked salmon for your cold bagels...)Not the best of Hiltons but not the worst.

<Content>Horrible Service, nice rooms Rooms were recently renovated, but the service was lousy at best! Had to wait for 15 minutes at bar before we were acknowledged by bartender because she was busy speaking with a tall darkskinned employee in grey. He looked at us as if we owed it to them to be there. None of the staff from check in to check out smiles except for the bellman who expected a tip for the mediocre service he provided. Managers were non existent to provide feedback to. Upon inquiring, found out that this is not a true Hilton hotel - its franchised to Sunstone - which then all made sense. This hotel does not meet the service standards I have experienced with other Hilton properties. Will not stay here again and would not recommend!

<Content>Excellent hotel, excellent location Just came back from a week-long reward stay at the Hilton Times Square.Everything in this hotel was perfect.Especially the room which completely overgone my expectations.Very big.Beds were extremely comfortable, and the chocolates and bottled water left in our room after turndown service was a very nice touch.The staff couldn't have been friendlier.Room was very quiet compared to the noise on the street.I couldn't have found a hotel with a more convenient location than this.Best choice for anyone.

<Content>Great location and excellent rooms Room and bathroom were very clean. Decor was functional. I was able to book this hotel with a corporate discount rate so the price was around $300/night. Location wise, I would consider this hotel as one of the best in NYC. Easy access to subways and the NYC taxis. Great front desk staff. One caveat - if you do need to check out and leave your bags with the concierge, they will charge you $10 a day per bag to hold it. Pricey but needed since my flight was later in the evening and I wanted to spend the day sightseeing unencumbered.

<Content>Overall good experience just returned from weekend in New York where we stayed at the Hilton, Times Square. stayed in a delux room on the 38th floor, room was large and clean and we had a good view of 42nd street.Room was quiet and well kept. everything i read on tripadvisor about this hotel is correct, Boy can they charge!!!!this is a great base for a weekend in the Big Apple as you can not get a more central location. I would recommend this hotel to anyone and would stay there again.

<Content>Surly Staff, Maid Was Lazy, Hallways Blocked by Beds Being Changed-out... Ahhhhh... what memories: the condescending staff, the barely-there maid service (if we used coffee, then YES, we need more coffee... same with creamers, sugar, stir-sticks... TOILET PAPER(!) etc. ) and of course, that particular week they decided to change-out all the beds in each room on our floor... blocking the hallways all the way to the elevators AND stairs... over most of two days! We wondered what would have happened if there was a fire during the day, or GOD FORBID, if we had brought our wheelchair-bound daughter with us. And, lest I forget, the constant hum of a jackhammer in the street below, beginning at 7:30AM each morning!Good location, though - although the Hilton Garden Inn, on I believe 45th, is even better location-wise. Madame Tussuad's House of Wax is next door to this hotel. Decent breakfast bar - don't order ala carte... it adds up QUICK when a cup of coffee alone is 4.25!! Room was fairly large, but the maid was lackluster, at best. So is her supervisor... I wouldn't stay here again... next time, I'll try the Hilton Garden Inn.

<Content>Liked it - Not Loved it Booked this for a weekend wedding after 2 nights at the Waldorf=Astoria. Our company lives in Hilton Hotels for HHonors, so we stay in Hilton properties around the country. This one was just OK. The staff wasn't overly friendly on check-in, the lobby wasn't particularly inviting, the bartender was downright rude. No robes in the room at check-in but delivered after my wife asked. The room was nice, overlooking a great view of mid-town Manhattan. The price was in line with other mid-level Hilton properties in Manhattan ($500 a night), but between Times Square and Mid-Town North(either Waldorf or Hilton NYC), we prefer to stay farther north.

<Content>Peace and Quiet in the middle of Times Square Stayed at Hilton Times Square one night Oct. 13 with my mom. We were in town for the weekend to spend a nice mom/daughter weekend, see a show and shop. We chose this hotel for its proximity to Port Authority and to the theatre we were to attend for our show. I reserved two double beds through Hilton's website and got a great bounce back weekend rate that included a breakfast buffet for each of us. ($459.00). This was the same price for a comparable room across the street at the Westin, but wihout breakfast. Note: Currently the entrance of this hotel is not easy to find. It is marked by a large, black and white clock with little brass men climbing on it. The same clock is on the 41st street and 42nd street entrances. Right now, though, the 42nd street entrance is obscured by scaffolding. No worries: There is a giant red sign that says right here for Hilton Times Square and some other establishments right there as well. Check-in at 11:30 am (3 1/2 hours earlier than their regular check-in time of 3:00pm) was quick and effortless, and they easily accommodated my room request. Room was very clean. Small by hotel standards, but not tiny like other NYC hotels. The room was equipped with the standard hotel room furnishings, and had enough space for a chair and ottoman, cocktail table and desk. Room 2304 (our room) had not much of a view other than the rooftop where the satellite dish was, but if you look beyond it, you get a flavor for the city. Nice big LG flatscreen TV. Beds were comfortable. The bathroom was a little tight but provided enough room for easy use. In-room coffee was particularly good -- Lavazza, an italian brand that I have not seen in hotels so far in my travels, but a brand I like to drink at home. Pot was one of those pod machines that could make 1 or 2 cups at once. Compact but nice. Crabtree and Evelyn La Source toiletries had a unisex, pleasant smell (like the ocean). Hotel staff were pleasant. No one overly friendly, but not rude either. Present but non-invasive, which is the way I prefer it. Greetings from everyone we passed.The bellman were hit and miss -- sometimes eager to get you a cab, sometimes they could not be bothered. If you prefer, you can walk 1/2 block to Port Authority and catch one of the long line of cabs waiting there. Breakfast was good; nice selection of hot and cold items and everything was replenished quickly. There is no video checkout at this property, or in-room movies (that lodgenet that everyone seems to have). I had to express checkout by calling front desk, but this took about 20 seconds, so It's express enough for me.We really liked the serenity of the hotel. The lobby is on the 21st floor, which is above all the chaos of times square. The rooms are quiet; can't hear noise from street or other guests. It is really a peaceful place to be at the end of your long, busy day in New York City. A nice place to rest and refresh.I had stayed at this property back in 2002 with my husband and enjoyed it then, and this experience was no different. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a nice, quiet place to stay in the middle of everything.

<Content>Great stay over New Year's Got a good deal here over Christmas and New Year period. Like the Westin Times Square, the location is absolutely perfect, but the entry way could be a little better/more obvious if you ask me.The security was really good with a guard on duty at the street level all day. The lobby is upstairs in the hotel's tower so it's very quiet and away from the hustle and bustle of the streets of Times Square. The location is right next to the AMC cinema and near the subway.The rooms were very large for our 3 person family staying there. In a way, it's not as nice as the Westin in terms of luxury feeling, but it is very upscale for the average Hilton hotel. The only weird thing was on check-in, I had gotten there before my parents and they wouldn't let me go up to the room because I didn't have the credit card used during the booking, but that wasn''t a major deal.Overall, I would recommend this hotel to families and tourists in New York.

We will definitely stay at this hotel again! note - the hotels website said valet parking is $52, but it is free if you get your ticket validated upon checkout.

<Content>The Diamond of Times Square This hotel without a doubt provides the absolute BEST location, accommodations, service and atmosphere that Manhattan has to offer. The room had an excellent view of The Empire State Building as well as other notable landmarks. It is located right in the middle of everything, yet secluded enough to experience privacy and luxury if that is your desire. It sits right in between the Garment District, and the Theater District. It is within walking distance to the finest theaters, resturants, shopping, and attractions. My wife and I will stay at no other establishment on subsequent visits to New York.

<Content>Great location, poor quality We have stayed 3 nights at this hotel with my husband and I am so glad we booked it through priceline. If I would have to pay 400 usd fo that room I would be mad... the quality was very poor, service not very friendly, to take breakfast in the morning you have to wait in long lines... beds were extremely unconfortable. Maybe Hilton should purchase some of the swedish Hastens? Only strong point is location, but nevertheless I would never ever stay in this hotel again.

<Content>Sanctuary on 42nd Street I stayed at the Times Square Hilton for the first time for a total of 15 days in August and September 2007. I usually stay at Hiltons, but I was put off by the atmosphere of 42nd Street near 8th Avenue for a long time. But this hotel has an excellent location for theater, the rooms are spacious and have great views, and the breakfast service was very good. The service was surprisingly good, and the room was taken care of twice a day. I recommend it strongly, and I would stay there again anytime I visit New York.

<Content>Loved the Hilton Times Square My husband and I stayed at the Hilton Times Square for 4 nights. The hotel concierge was extremely helpful and the overall service was impeccable. I loved being in the middle of Times Square (I noticed that some people did complain about the location). The excitement and energy can't be beat. That's why I love NY...........I highly recommend this hotel!

<Content>In the middle of a lot of people in Times Square! We ended our trip from Washington DC to Philadelphia to NYC at Times Square for 2 nights. The Hilton was a very nice stay with a great view of the city! The staff were very friendly the moment we arrived. The baggage attendant was very helpful with directions and advice on which subway route to take to the Lower East Side Tenement Museum. Whenever we would go to the main lobby, we were greeted by staff. The hotel was very clean, had fun sculptures and art, and was decorated very modern. The room was spacious, quiet, clean, and the bed was super comfortable. Depending on which room you stay in, you can see into other people's room next to you. Make sure if you do not want to be seen to close your curtain (we noticed we could see into our neighbor's room very easily if we were standing in our room in a certain spot). Depending on your cell phone provider, if you are on a top floor, you may not get good reception (that is what the front desk told us). There was a refrigerator in the room fully stocked...anytime you took something out it would automatically keep track and charge the item to the room. If you didn't want the items from the minibar, there was a Pax across the street with lots of good food (I suggest getting a pizza late at night and taking it back up to your room for a snack!). We had no problem getting cabs, the attendants would have one ready by the time you got down to the street. The hotel is very convenient to any show, walking distance. However, if you stay in the Times Square area expect a lot of people. You are shoulder-to-shoulder on the street and it makes walking around a little difficult. Granted, NYC is full of people, but Times Square is crammed with people! I'm glad we stayed in Times Square, but once is enough for me. The Hilton is a great place to stay if you choose to stay in this area!

<Content>My favorite New York Hotel By far my best experience in New York city. The Hilton Times Square is a relatively new hotel and it shows. I have stayed at many properties in mid-town that are a bit shabby, with old ventilation systems and little insulation from the noise. Not so for the Hilton Times Square. It was wonderful on all fronts.First, what I liked...1. Very clean room with new furnishings2. The bed was a dream3. Excellent pod coffee in the room4. A bright clean shower, with a light over the tub (nothing worse than a dingy tub with poor lighting)5. The ventilation was excellent - quiet with no smell and I could actually regulate the temperature to a point where I was comfortable.6. Ate dinner at the hotel restuarant - had the updated version of a surf and turf - delectable, if a bit on the pricey side.7. Absolute, bone-deep, ear-resting, trash truck evading SILENCE. Most mornings in Manhattan I wake to the sounds of the trash trucks, sirens or construction. The Hilton (24th fl if I remember correctly) was totally peaceful! Heaven! A great night's sleep in a clean comfortable bed.Overall, the room (I had a king bed) was a good size, clean, fresh and comfortable, with all the amenities a business traveler could need. Internet access, good iron and ironing board, water in the minibar and a comfortable place to sit and work. I have not been so comfortable in a hotel room in NYC ever...and I just stayed at the Ritz Carlton in Battery Park. Nutty, I know...but the Hilton Times Square was just cleaner and more comfortable. Now, what I didn't like...only that they are booked for my next 3 trips into the city. The next trip I have to stay at the Helmsly Park Lane...oh my goodness, with their pink wallpaper and dirty dark green carpet....I am longing for my room at the Hilton all ready.

<Content>Fantastic Stay at the Hilton Times Square I booked this hotel for a one night stay through Priceline and was very excited as although I have been to NYC quite a few times, I have never stayed in heart of Times Square. This hotel was perfect from check-in to check-out. We arrived at Port Authority around 1:30 in the afternoon and took the three minute walk to the hotel. We were early, but our room was ready. Melissa at the front desk was friendly and very helfpul, even asking if we wanted another bed brought to the room since there were two of us travelling (my sister and I) and only one king sized bed in the room. When we got up to the room we were very surprised by its size - compared to other hotels we've stayed at in the city (namely the Algonquin  the Paramount), this hotel room was huge! The king sized bed was very comfortable and the shower was great with plenty of hot water and adequate water pressure. The location of the hotel, for our purposes, could not be beat! While the address of the hotel is 42nd street, there is an entrance on to 41st street, which brought us right to the Nederlander theater for Rent. The staff was incredibly friendly and courteous, always saying hello, asking about our stay, holding the elevator, and letting guests on the elevator before them. If I had to pick a negative aspect of this hotel, it would be that the toliets flushed loudly, and you could hear when someone flushed the toliet in adjacent rooms. Also, while in the bathroom, I could overhear a conversation that taking place in the room next door. Other than that, this was an absolutely perfect stay in NYC. I would highly recommend this hotel and would not hesistate to go back.

<Content>One of the better choices around Times Square We stayed for two nights at the Hilton on Times Square. Upon check in we were upgraded into a Deluxe room and being a Hiltonhhonors Gold member we received vouchers for breakfast. The room is very large for NYC standards. The room is very clean and has comfy beds. We had a great view. We will certainly consider staying here again.

<Content>Was there a year ago, loved it We stayed at this hotel a year ago for 2 nights.(took a while to write a review, I know). We had never been to New York before and were so impressed with this place. It is a little hard to find when you are in a car, but advise from TA helped- look for the clock  the valet parking is from 41st street.It is a perfect location for walking  subway, buses, cabs, restaurants, shopping, Central Park and other sites. The concierge was VERY helpful in directing some very green visitors!Didn't go to the bar or anything, just used the room to change  sleep- it was the most comfortable hotel bed I've ever been in! The room was very clean  perfect for what we were there for. We got a great price for this hotel from the Hilton website. Will definitely go to this hotel in Times Square again. We liked being in the middle of the action

<Content>Great stay-enjoyed everything Our flight arrived early, but our room was not ready. They took my cell phone # and called me in less than 2 hrs. to say we could check in. But we stayed out after 3pm-normal check in time! Had to call to get our luggage delivered so I could change my shoes to go back out to Times Square which is VERY close.. hotel is in great location. We did not have a view of Times Square but did have the Empire State Bldg. side. We had no problems with the jackhammer-not even aware there was construction going on so maybe ask for the Empire side if you are going soon. Close to McDonalds for a cheaper breakfast than the hotel. Close to just about everything. I would definitely stay here again and have recommended it to several friends already. Beds were super... bathroom good too-nice water pressure and all free toiletries if you left something at home. Room was bigger than ones I have stayed at in past visits at other hotels. Desk help nice, welcomed us back everytime we passed the desk. Got a little tired of tipping the bellhops/doorman for doing their job.. one to store your luggage, one to bring your luggage, one to call you a cab... always someone with a hand out.. but overall---no complaints about the hotel. Very nice, as I said, will stay there next time.

<Content>Stay Away! You think the Hilton would be nice... ok the bedrooms appear nice, and if you are a tourist, then Times Sq. might be ideal.CHECKIN: The moment I checked in there were issues. I had to ask the bellman in the bottom lobby to actually help me with my bags. CLEANLINESS: When I went to my clean and ready room, the bathtub was filled with hair on the walls and soap dish holder.I asked the bellman who arrived later with my bags to call housekeeping to come clean the tub, and they came and willlingly cleaned the tub.KEY ISSUES: Later, my key didn't work, and after having the front desk re-issue another key, it still didn't work! I had to wait for the 3rd try in order for my key to work.RESTAURANT: Also, they tried to make amends by giving me free breakfast in the lobby. When I went to breakfast the next morning, I waited for 10 minutes looking at 6 tables full of dirty dishes. Patiently waiting, I finally asked a waiter if he had any clean tables available... and he yelled at me the following: There are only dirty tables. Go ahead and sit down. I was shocked that he wanted me to sit at a dirty table, so I asked him if he really wanted me to sit at a dirty table, and his response was Either sit at a dirty table or don't sit at all!Needless to say I asked for a manager and that put the icing on my very unpleasant stay.NOISE : there is major construction going on next door, and you can hear it eve inside your hotel room.ROOM: I stayed in 2822 (right next to the construction site). Jack hammer began around 6am every morning!

<Content>Great location, great hotel Booked for one night stay to show our daughters a little bit of Manhattan. Booked two double beds, when check in time came, would have been a significant wait, so settled for a king with a rollaway. Room was large for Manhattan, and amazingly quiet, 41st floor. Room and hotel very clean with nice bathroom. Staff were helpful and courteous. Times square location great with easy access to food, sightseeing, shopping. Bar nice place for a nitecap, but pricey. Parking was a little confusing, but it was nice to valet the car and forget about it. Overall, a great place for a quick 24 hour getaway.

<Content>Jackhammers at 7 am My daughter and I just booked one night (8/1) on Priceline at a 3-star hotel, midtown in NYC. When our price was accepted, we were upgraded to a 4-star hotel, which turned out to be the Hilton Times Square. Great location, nice hotel, but guests should know that there is major construction (jackhammers) going on next door, the hotel has no control over when they start (can be as early as 7 am) and if you're in NYC for the nightlife, you may want to stay elsewhere. Sleep is not an option when the construction starts, it vibrates the walls of the entire building. The front desk picked up the tab for our breakfast when I complained, but I would rather have had a little extra sleep. It's not noted on their website, and they say they have no control' over it, but the Hilton and Priceline should be up front about the fact that the property is not as advertised. Hilton gives you a letter saying you may be awakened by construction noise in the packet with your room key, at which point it would be a major inconvenience to back out.

<Content>I would stay again I stayed here repeatedly for one-week periods from 2003-2005.It was always a great experience. The location is fabulous - it's by all the trains, right in the heart of Times Square. There are drugstores, eateries, movie theatres and all things New York right there.I would recommend this hotel to anybody, and I would definitely stay again. I suggest asking for a high floor so that you get a good view of the city from your room.

<Content>Nice Hotel I would give a 4 out of 5 for this hotel for its hardware and handy location. The room size was big enough considering the location, which was close to everything, time square, broadway theartres, 5th ave, etc. I just didn't like the over crowed reception/bar/restaurant area. I didn't feel very welcome from its staff upon my arrival or during my stay, which you can usually get from some other hotels.I followed the advice from Ladyd123 that I didn't eat or drink at all at the hotel. But I thought the bar was nice if you had a drink with friends some time later at night. (I was travelling alone).Just a side note, if you book through Expedia (3rd Party), you don't get the HHonor points - You must use its own website to be awarded. This is my first using an online travel agent - not so impressed. I might switch back to real travel agent in the future.

<Content>Hated the Hilton Times Square Location good for Broadway and Macys but would not recommend to people who dislike noise or crowds . Times square was very claustrophobic . We had deluxe room which was extra large and a nice view from the 33 rd floor and well soundproofed . Room very clean . All the staff were helpful especially the bell boys . The air conditioning in the public lobby which served as a reception , a bar and a restaurant was inadequate and the area was often stuffy and suffered from food smells coming from the restaurant area. The drinks were unispiring and expensive and not a patch on the exotic cocktails available at half the price in a restaurant over the road . Dinner menu was expensive for what it was and the braised vegetable that came with our steak was bitter and inedible . I would not stay in the Times Square area again and in fact preferred the Radisson on Lexington Avenue

<Content>Very good location Stayed there for a couple nights in late June. It's a little weird at first getting in depending on where transportaton drops you off. If you enter on 41st St. , then you have the big clock to focus on to find it and it looks like the entry to a hotel. If you enter on 42nd St. , then it doesnt look like a hotel at all, its and entry way jammed between lots of other things. Once in you have to take the elevator up to the lobby which is a little small - the bar and restaurant take up most of that floor - and then another set of elevators up to your room. By the way, the restaurant makes a killer Kobe beef burger. We were on a floor that was being remodeled so sometimes early in morning there was noise and the hallways had plastic down on the floor. No biggie. The staff was very nice but the concierges were hit and miss on information depending on who you got.The rooms were a bit small especially the closets and that teeny bathroom, I mean TEENY!! Other than that the room was comfy, the location was great for walking to just about anything you wanted to see or do. Getting a cab sometimes took awhile, but that seemed to be all over. Wouldnt mind going back providing we got a higher floor that didnt have rehabbing going on on it.

<Content>Very nice hotel, great location in NYC, highly recommend! We just returned from a 3 night stay at the Hilton Times Square over the 4th of July (we used Hilton points for this stay).This is a VERY nice hotel. Beautiful lobby with floor to ceiling windows (not dark at all, per the previous reviewer!), excellent location off 42nd St. Very LARGE rooms (the largest in midtown), very clean, new and tastefully decorated with good closet/dresser space. We had a great view of midtown and the river, and could not hear any street noise in the room. A/C worked just fine and kept the room cool during the 90+ degree weather. We did not hear ANY noise from doors slamming or from people in the other rooms. Only one small complaint - the bed was OK but a bit soft (just a mattress with a thin feather bed that was too small for the king mattress)...the newer Doubletree and Hampton beds are more comfortable than the beds at this Hilton.  The bathroom was bigger than average with plenty of counter space and nice Crabtree  Evelyn products. Water pressure was fine and we never had a cold shower. All staff we encountered were very pleasant and helpful, from the bell staff to the front desk and housekeeping.We did not eat in the hotel, but the bar in the lobby looked nice and there were always people there.Overall, we really enjoyed this hotel. It is so nice, new, and clean, and the location was perfect for us. It is a wonderful retreat in midtown and we highly recommend it!

<Content>I can't recommend it. Yes, I've seen many of the good reviews and know some will disagree, but I am writing this directly from my room AT the Hilton Times Square, and am merely reporting what I've seen.Also, sorry if my reviews are a tad long, but I get so much good advice here that I feel obligated to paint a decent picture for all of you when I review something.***LOBBY: Nice, but smallish and on the darker side. Cozy, but it can full up fast.PRE-ARRIVAL: Pretty good about phones. They pick up 70% of the time. I know cause from Vegas airport it took 5 tries to get someone. They booked me a car from Newark airport to the Hilton Times Square (HTQ) and upon arrival, we had to look long and hard for the driver who somehow appeared and smelled of fresh cigarettes. (In fairness, I booked this at the last minute and they may have picked their last resort vendor. I suggest NOT using Spectaclular for transportation.)**************ARRIVAL: 11pm arrival, only one bell guy on staff but he was visible and helpful. Bell staff overall is fine. *************Check-In: I had confirmations for 2 Corner Rooms which I paid extra for, as usually corner means corner and there's less neighbor noise. I re-specified this at check in and the MANAGER (Mr S) said no problem. More later.*************Room: Good size and recently renovated IMO. While Hilton's bed is NOT as good as Westin, Hyatt, and Marriott, it was still ok. Bring your own pillow I suggest. Lighting is fair, TV worked fine. Air Conditioning is almost adequate for sleeping with blanket. Like many hotels, it's positioned stupidly where the thermostat thinks it's cool, but by the bed it's not. (In fairness, I get hot fast so perhaps you won't feel this way here)************Smallish bathroom but bright and well stocked with toiletries, towels and robes. Water pressure is slightly below avg, but gets hot quickly.************Cleanliness is fine, although there's a stain or two on shower curtains do a good job of keeping it dark.************DINING: One basic restaurant and room service till 11pm. I didn't try it.************INTERNET ACCESS: I'm paying $10 dailoy which is fine, but service is erratic. Had to try logging on 3 times to write this review. When calling front desk they explain that there's a 1-800 number for tech assistance. How nice.*************SERVICE: Despite a few impersonal staff members, there ARE some good staff here. Melissa at front desk, Megan at Concierge, or Cara at front desk is who I suggest to work with. *************Ok, so far so good so why can't I suggest it?NOISY. Not city noise. But you can hear the room next to me as I write this, and hear when ANY room door down the hall closes. Also, you can hear toilet flushes like clockwork and it's from more than one room. Last night I couldn 't figure out how many toilets I was listening to, but frankly I'd prefer Mozart at 3am.CORNER ROOM? NO. I'm almost at the corner and next to me is a room used by HOUSEKEEPING. Yep, so from the 'corner room' I paid more for, I can hear the housekeepers next door at 9am.*****So despite the tgood stuff, I can't recommend it due to NOISE and improper room assignments. $329 per night in NYC does NOT buy marble baths and staff waiting over you hand over foot and I get that. But it SHOULD mean accurate room assigments and especially, a somewhat QUIET room.*****Other than that, NYC is fun as always. This weekend Times Square seems to be mobbed by the hip-pop crowd for some reason, so one has to navigate past the loud profanity, budding fights, etc. But usually it's really nice. Safe travels to everyone!Jedi

<Content>Highly recommended This is a clean, comfortable, safe and quiet hotel in the heart of Times Square. Our rooms (standard double bed rooms) were spacious and had fantastic beds. Our northside room had a great view of the midtown area, and the southside room had an awesome view of the Empire State Building. Bathrooms were very nice -- excellent water pressure and hot water availability. NYC was 90 degrees during our stay. The A/C worked well in each room, but we wished they had been slightly more powerful. The rooms never got warm, but never got as cool as we wanted.All elevators are very fast -- I don't believe we ever waited more than 10 seconds for an elevator. Very convenient subway access. Internet service was very good, and cost $10 per day. The breakfast buffet was $19 per day. The buffet could have had a better selection, but the available items were all very good. As other reviewers have mentioned, Dallas BBQ across the street is a great place to stop for large portions at very low prices. The staff was exceptional. We stopped by the front desk often to inquire about luggage that our airline had lost. The staff was always patient, friendly and helpful. We asked for a late checkout, and were immediately offered to stay until 2:00. I can't say enough about how impressed we were with the service.I very highly recommend the Hilton Times Square.

<Content>Location, Location, Location If you want easy access to the hottest attractions in New York and a great hotel into the bargain then The Hilton Times Square is a great option. The front of the hotel is very unassuming and you could walk right past it if you weren鈥檛 looking for it. You check in to your room on the 21st floor (I think) as the first 20 floors are occupied by the movie theatre next door. This hotel is always busy and I found it difficult to get a room with a great view, but for the amount of time you will spend in your room it doesn鈥檛 really matter what your hotel looks onto, as long as it doesn鈥檛 offend. The reception staff is not the best that I have ever encountered nor are they the worst. I found the room to be spacious in comparison to other New York hotels. My advice is to book your room on the Hilton website where if you are willing to pay for your stay up front without chance of refund you can get greatly reduced prices and even a better room cheaper than most of the online travel websites. In New York, you only spend sleeping time in your room so there is not much more I can say about the hotel as I was out all day and all night, like the city, never stopping. Don鈥檛 bother with eating at the hotel, there are too many other places to go, but avoid ROXY鈥橲 diner at all costs 鈥?expensive for not much and they are very rude about tipping. Also, steer clear of using super shuttle for a transfer to the hotel, one of the worst experiences of my life. The bundle people in a tiny van and chuck your luggage about and are rude about it. If you, like me, love the theatre and are not worried about where you sit you can get greatly reduced tickets from TKTS, which used to be located in Times Square and has moved temporarily next to the Marriott Courtyard across from the Amsterdam Theatre. Also, for the most sought after tickets you can enter a lottery outside the theatre. For example Wicked does a lottery, which you enter at 5:30pm and is drawn at 6:30pm. You can reserve 2 tickets and if you win, they are only $25 each for front row. Even if you don鈥檛 win you can chat others waiting and the atmosphere can be quite fun. Note: I tried 5 days in a row and no win, so don鈥檛 waste your time if you are a pessimist. Anyway, I hope you found this helpful and remember if you don鈥檛 care where you stay don鈥檛 pay through the nose for this hotel, there a few other budget hotels round about. Keep your money for shopping.

<Content>New Favorite Place to Stay Stayed @ Hilton 6/14 -6/17. Our time in this wonderful hotel was picture perfect from the moment we arrived until the very minute we left. Room was huge by any city's standards and was immaculately clean and prepared. Hotel staff was very friendly, courteous, and always helpful no matter the question and situation. Hilton bedding provided wonderful sleep although we didn't do much sleeping! IT's NEW YORK!!!! Also, Hotel provides super easy and convenient access to everything from the Subway to Times Square  the Theater District and fashion district! A++++ service from top to bottom and will definitely be staying here on all future visits.

<Content>Great Location. Good Hilton Hotel We stayed at the Hilton Times Sq the week following Memorial Day on hhonors points. Our room was great and the staff was very attentive. The breakfast buffet was also good. The hotel is a hop skip and a jump a way from Times Sq and many subway stations. The only drawback to the hotel in my mind was their bar - it was off the lobby and had no scene. But then again, you are in NYC and there are plenty of other places to go.

<Content>Top of Times Square I just returned from a lovely one night stay at the Times Square Hilton. The location is terrific, less than one block from Times Square. The nearest subway stop is in the same block. I received a lovely room in the corner, so windows on both sides. The room was very large and had a king bed, a chair and ottoman, a desk with two chairs - every thing you needed. The bathroom was very nice and the towels were really very soft and thick - not like some hotel towels. All the staff members were friendly and helpful. The only couple of drawbacks or difficulties, as others have mentioned, it is a bit difficult to find. I really appreciated the tip to look for the large clock - because it just does look like a storefront, not a hotel. Also, you need to know that the parking is not on 42nd street, it is on 41st street. You need to go around the block. They will valet it there, but factually, I saw a parking garage directly across the street and I concluded that it would probably be substantially less expensive to valet it myself - no parking is inexpensive in NYC - but I didn't pay Hilton's premium.... The only drawback in the hotel itself was that it appeared, although I didn't ask, that the only breakfast option was a buffet. I went to sit down, saw the buffet, and no indication of menus, so I left. This probably saved me a fortune too - so no great loss. All in all, it was a lovely stay and I would recommend it to anyone who wanted a nice, central hotel in Manhattan.

<Content>Nice hotel in a good location We stayed at the Times Square Hilton for one night (27 May - the night before Memorial Day). We were booked into the Doubletree Guest Suites Times Square for 6 nights but when we arrived on the Sunday evening they had no room for us, so they arranged to get a taxi for us to take us to the Hilton for one night. The room we had at the Hilton was very nice, clean and had a very comfortable bed. We didn't eat in the hotel. The hotel were happy to store our bags on the Monday as we were going out to Belmont Park to the racing and we got the use of a safe deposit box for the day.This hotel is in a great location, slightly quieter than the Doubletree in Time Square, and is very close to many theatres, restaurants and shops. All in all a great hotel to stay in in New York.

<Content>Great week in Times Square My wife and I have just spent a week at this hotel which is is located in the heart of Times Square and within easy access to almost anywhere of interest. especially the theatres. The times square subway stop is just 3-5 minutes walk away. Superb BBQ restaurant opposite the hotel!We stayed in a king size room on the 23rd floor (construction work was apparently underway at the higher floors) and I must say that the room was very comfortable and pretty large for New York. The room and bathroom were clean and the shower and hot water was extremely efficient. The lobby is located on the 21st floor so you have to take two separete elevators to get to your room. The rooms were cleaned every day and water and chocolates were provided free every day. In summary, the goods and not so goods:-Goods:- great location - good, comfortable and sizable room- friendly and accomodating staff- good serviceNot so goods:-- Very expensive business center ($10 for 10min of internet time)- Slight inconvenience with the lobby on the 21st floor.- Coffee maker located in the bathroom (my wife had a problem with this) Overall, this is a great hotel to stay especually if you want to be in the heart of the action at Times Square.

<Content>If you like hustle bustle - this is the place If you want to be smack in the middle of Times Square hustle  bustle, this is the place. (on 42nd street)As someone in another review mentioned, it can be hard to locate, look for the large clock near the Applebee's. You enter at ground level and the lobby is on the 24th floor. The staff was courteous and helpful, the room was clean, well appointed, nice size and with very comfortable beds (I even had a view of the river). The bar area is nice as well as the breakfast. The only negative - for me - is that it IS in the middle of the hustle and bustle. I was there for a trade show rather than to take in the sights so much and 42nd street where the hotel is located could be thronging with people from mid-day through the late hours of the night - so much so that it was difficult to walk down the street. However, the well-connected subway station is conveniently located steps away and a plethora of lovely little restaurants can be found a few blocks away west of 8th on 46th street.I usually stay at the Warwick (smaller, nice, still near Times Square but on 54th/6th where it is a little quieter) and might still prefer that, but other than the crowded street, I have to say I did like the Hilton Times Square.

<Content>My Favorite in NYC My girlfriend and myself go to New York for the weekend a couple of times every year. We've stayed at the Hilton on Ave of Americas, the Wellington, and the Westin. We just stayed here and this may be a close tie with the Westin as our favorite. Great location and Fantastic staff, especially Jimmy at the front counter. Close to everything. A bit expensive but what isn't in NYC. I will definately stay here again.

<Content>Will DEFINITELY stay in this hotel again!!! It is our first trip to New York City and my husband  I are absolutely delighted by the service of this hotel. We spent 4 nights in this hotel and arrived early in the morning. The front desk couldn't checked us in but they are willing to take our luggages. Theroom is very clean and bed is very comfortable. Room cleaning left chocolates and bottled-water...Staff are VERY friendly and never hesitate to answer our questions. The area is constantly busy. The convenient store opposite the hotel definitely is a big help. Subway is just a few blocks away, the only complaint is that the hotel could be difficult to locate for first timer, look out for the big clock! We'll definitely love to come back again!

<Content>Excellent Hotel Stayed at this hotel in early May for 5 nights and have to say that it was one of the nicest hotels we have stayed in during our many trips to NYC. Excellent room with really comfy bed, very clean. Staff were always very friendly without being in your face. Hallways were very clean, lobby very clean and bright and a lovely bar area to sit down and have a drink after a long day walking the streets of Manhattan. Would definately go back here again.

<Content>Great hotel, excellent customer service My fiancee and I stayed here over the weekend for his birthday. As a HiltonHonors Diamond member, our room was upgraded and we received a good, complimentary breakfast buffet each morning. The entire staff was wonderful, from the bellhops to housekeeping to frontdesk staff. Excellent location too, about 1/2 block to Times Square subway station. Tons of theaters within walking distance as well, not to mention great restaurants!

<Content>Great Location, resonable rooms I stayed in the Hilton Time Square with my girlfriend on a 4 day city break. We flew in from London. As a diamond VIP Hilton cardholder I have experienced a number of Hiltons, mostly in the UK. I think my expectations may have been slight high.Location-wise we couldn't have asked for anything more. Bang in the middle of the tourist hotspot that is Time Square. It's easy from here to get to all the major landmarks. There was a bit of a mix up when we arrive with finding a room for us, which took 1/2 an hour or so to sort out, but the staff were professional and friendly and offered us free drinks while we waited. In other Hilton hotels there is usually a executive floor for free drinks, nibbles, but unfortunately none here. Instead we were offered free breakfast which we took. The room was ok, a little old and shabby. They are in the process of updating the rooms. Views were fantastic. We got a room on the 38th floor and had great views over time square and the empire state building. Breakfasts were very good. Lots of different foods each day and polite service staff. I suppose I was a little disappointed to the finishes and state of the hotel and the fact there wasn't an executive floor, but all in all a good stay. New York is great! Best city I've been too so far as a tourist!

<Content>Fantastic customer service We had a family holiday here in April 2007 (3 English couples, aged from 53 to 24). This is a great hotel; it's in an excellent location, the public areas are spacious and well maintained, and the rooms are quiet, well equipped and a very good size for New York. OK, so the ensuite bathrooms are quite small, but they are clean  well equipped and how long do you plan to spend in the bathroom when you are in NYC anyway?! The best thing by far, though, was the attitude of the staff. Their focus on friendly customer service is unrivalled, from the staff at the front desk, through to room service and the porters. (Thank you, Patrick, for the 6 complimentary breakfasts which you offered us following the minor confusion when our rooms were not quite ready on our arrival.) The concierge, also, was a mine of information, and enthusiastically helpful (thanks, Kristen, for handling our online check-in for our flight home while we were out at dinner!). We will definitely return!

<Content>Great location we were in the city for a short visit as part of a business trip, so we wanted a good quality hotel situated in midtown; although we didn't make any special request, we were surprised to get an impressive 42nd floor view - which is almost on the top of the hotel - overlooking the surrounding buildings, including the Empire State; it is always kind of a bad surprise though that for over 500 bucks per night you don't get a complimentary breakfast in NY (well, given all the excellent coffee shops around of the well-known brand, that's not really an issue), and some of the items (coffee pads, filled trash bin, ...) weren't replaced by the personnel during cleanup, but apart from these details, it's a hotel I would certainly recommend for those who have a short time and a big amount of travel budget to spend

<Content>A great place to stay I had heard a lot about New York hotels being small. This wasnot the case. The room was spacious, clean and had a greatview. The staff was professional and friendly. The hotel wasin walking distance to a lot of great places. You must visit thewax museum. We had four guest in a double bed room, andwe were very comfortable. Thanks for a great stay. I highlyrecommend staying at this hotel.

<Content>Fantiastic! We stayed here for two nights in February after staying for two nights at the Millenium Hilton in the financial district.Firstly the location was superb as it is right in the heart of Times Square. Over the two days we walked from our hotel to the many different sights including the Rockefellar Centre, Grand Central, and library with ease. Nightime was fantastic with the choice of different restaurants, shows, cinema or for just a walk round times square to soak up the atmosphere!Hotel and our room was also excellent , very clean and very large for New York standards. We had a great view overlooking the Empire State Building. Service was good and we mentioned on our booking form we had a birthday so they sent up a large plate of chocolate strawberries which went down a treat!I would definately recommend this hotel and could find no faults with it whatsoever.

We found it to be perfectly located with easy access to sighseeing tours, subway, 5th avenue, Macy's etc. The staff were very friendly and helpful and always offering advice on how best to do things. The hotel was clean and we have a room with a great view of the Empire State building.We would definitely stay there again when in NY.

<Content>Great Choice for a Times Square hotel My husband and I booked on Priceline. Having read some previous reviews about negative treatment of Priceline customers, we were surprised by the considerate treatment we received when checking in. We were allowed to check in at noon. Without asking (I wouldn't have dared!), we were upgraded to a Deluxe King on the 38th floor. The room was huge and in perfect condition. The view was spectacular.It was very quiet. We never ate at the hotel nor did we spend any time at the bar area because there are too many other great options all over Manhattan. We would be thrilled to stay here again.

<Content>warning - credit card required Spent four nights in the Hilton Times Square in March. As first-time visitors to NYC, the central location was ideal for sightseeing, and airport transport. The room, on the 24th floor, was spacious and comfortable.One major complaint - the hotel asked for a credit card when we checked in, and we don't use a credit card since almost losing thousands of pounds to credit card fraud on a previous visit to the US. I did email the hotel regarding this a week before arrival - my email was ignored, and the hotel staff denied any knowledge of receiving it. Despite having paid for our accomodation weeks in advance, we were forced to hand over a $100 per night deposit in cash.

<Content>Can't wait to return Hilton Times Square staff are wonderful, we just returned from a 7 day stay, very helpful, friendly and at all times professional. The rooms could use some work but they are large and clean, the location is the best. Hardly had to wait for the elevator鈥檚, and the service in the restaurant was way above what we received anywhere else. The price of 5.00 for a cup of coffee was terrible, but the service made up for it. Service just about everywhere else was terrible, as we where in a party of six the restaurants put on a surcharge of 15%-20%, had the service been okay we would have not had a problem. The people of New York are charming, had heard they where unfriendly and rude, totally the opposite. What did amaze us is the police are everywhere, we felt very safe walking at night and down Canal Street. Can鈥檛 wait to go again and would stay at the Hilton Times Square again. Next trip we will buy all of our theater and sporting tickets in advance as it is hard to impossible to get the best seats for the popular shows when you are there. The concierge was a real asset, they made our dinner reservations, had maps and gave a lot of great advise about what we should do, and what not to miss and mostly they where right on.

<Content>Not worth the $$ What a dissapointment... I booked on priceline and even at that price I was unhappy. First I called to request a non-smoking room, which they can only request but not guarantee. When I arrived I was told the hotel went completely non-smoking some time ago. Upon entering the room, I realized it was previously a smoking room and had to open the window to breath. The bedside lamp was broken, bathroom door lock broken and shower head not working correctly. maid servie knocked three times before 9am to see if I had left and the noise heard through the vents from neighboring rooms was horrible. The lobby bar was dirty and service BAD, front desk and doormen were fine. I will NOT return to the Hilton Times SQ.

<Content>Nice Hotel, Poor Restarant Service -- "Nickle  Nice hotel overall, good location, friendly desk and concierge staff. Wait staff for breakfast needs help, took 15+ minutes to get a cup of coffee.... could not get check to pay so walked over to manager to advise. Manager was more concerned about what my room number was than the issue. Next day got coffee immediately but had to hunt waiter down to get tea .. after making request and waiting 10-15 minutes.Nickel  dime type charges -- asked for late checkout - $25 p/hr, wanted to use business center $2.99 for login etc etc.These are annoying type charges and poor service not worthy of an upscale hotel.

<Content>Great location if you are into BUSY scenes ALL THE TIMES! First the good. The staff at this hotel is excellent. They always have a smile on their face. There was one bell man when we checked in April 1, 2007 who deserves a special mention. I forgot to ask for his name but he is a tall African American gentleman who could not do enough for you. Check in staff is OK, concierge is OK, some are better than others, housekeeping staff is great. Overall you cannot find any faults with the staff. Hilton must do something right to keep their staff friendly and happy!!!! The location is central. You can catch subway to anywhere right outside your door. You can also easily walk to most tourist spots. Now this could be a Hilton chain problem and not this hotel itself. I got a room through Priceline. Good price but not bottom of the barrel by any means. I requested two double beds with the hotel a few days before I arrived and also at the front desk when I got there in the morning. I ended up with a king bed and a rollaway cot. Not cool! I had a feeling it had something to do with the fact that I booked via Priceline and not with them. The same thing happened 4 years ago when I did priceline with Hitlon Costa Mesa (except they were WAY ruder!). Anyway I was in NYC in 2/07 and got a room with Grand Hyatt via Priceline. I never once had a priceline vibe. So yes this is definitely a Hilton thing. The room was spacious for NYC standards and the bed was very comfortable. This is a newer hotel and yet the bathroom was very moldy. ICK! Lobby is tiny like a boutique hotel. You either get greeted or stared at every single time you walk by. Hotel is right on 42nd street so you have a mob scene every single minute!!!! It got kinda old after the 3rd day. However you cannot beat the location. Up to me, I would stay AWAY from Times Square. If you plan to do a lot of Times Square stuff or see the theater, this hotel is very convenient. We walked 2 blocks home after Les Mis (cannot miss this!)!!!!!!!

<Content>It was okay Stayed at the hotel for 3 nights and had a room on the 33rd floor. The room was ok, everything you would expect, a decent bed, TV and bathroom. The service through out our stay was polite and efficient, we had a couple of minor problems, but these we sorted out quickly. The breakfast was acceptable, the normal hot and cold buffet selection, nothing outstanding. There is a small bar area by reception that was expensive, but not as bad as some hotels we have stayed in.In summary a decent, convenient hotel that ticked all the boxes, but nothing we could get excited about..

<Content>Excellent location, hotel and city Stayed in this hotel for 4 nights in Feb. Room was massive with a fantastic view, overlooking the Empire State Building. Broadway and Times Square are on your door step. It is a perfect location. The hotel was spotless and clean. All staff and cleaners were friendly and helpful, left us water each night and gave us fresh towels for the morning with a turn down service. Didn't eat in the hotel as slightly expensive along with room service. One tip, if you don't want anything out of the mini bar, don't take anything out because as soon as you remove an item it is charged to your room!Could not fault this hotel and would recommend this hotel and stay here again on my next visit.

<Content>Very good NYC hotel Pleasantly surprised by my Priceline win..got a spacious, very clean king room with a great bed. The location is great, but as others have noted, easy to miss, as it has a very small street entry that leads to elevators that wisk you up to the lobby.OK view on the 25th floor.. use the 41st Street entrance if you are driving in...valet will park your car, and it was ready when we needed it. all staff, very pleasant and helpful...Clean decentbath..perfect location for walking NYC. we will add this to our list of NYC faves.

<Content>Amazing Location Booked this hotel on Priceline and got a super deal. It was for a one night stay March 13th and was reserved only the day before. Priceline was not mentioned at check-in and I was offered a room with 2 double beds on the 43rd floor or a king on the 26th. We opted for the king.The bed was the best I have ever had in a hotel and that includes many Sheratons and Marriots. The room was much larger than I would have expected for New York and even though we were not at the top, the view was good.We ate supper across the street at a restaurant called Dallas BBQ, we got a window table on the 2nd floor and had great fun people watching. The margaritas were top notch, the portions huge and good and most surprisingly for New York the prices were cheap.For this trip I didn't care where we were staying so I used Priceline but I liked the hotel enough that even at the normal rates, it is worth it and I would stay there again.

<Content>worth it Stayed at NY Times square Hilton March 2007 with wife and 6 yr old daughter. Had a great time. (We have stayed in hotels all over the world)Excellent location within walking distance of all major Broadway shows. Lion King was 2 blocks away. The hotel opens out onto 42nd Street on Times square. Lion King finished at 11PM, we enjoyed the walk back, less than 5 min. Madam Tussauds is next door.Nice modern decor, superfast nonstop elevators, no waiting time to go up or down. No signs of neglect or need for updating in the near future.Breakfast buffet (scrambled egg, bacon, sausage, oatmeal, roast potatoes were among the hot items) was $ 20 per person, smallish serving area. Applebees is adjacent, serve full BF for $ 8. McDonald's is right next door.They offered us 40th floor, which was a treat, great views of Manhattan with Hudson river, Empire state building etc.Parking (SUV) cost $ 52 per day, but you have to come up to the 41st street entrance to hand your vehicle over, note there is no drive up lobby due to the hotel's location. We tried the 42nd street entrance first which is what our GPS unit told us, and got confused because you barely see a sign that says Hilton, let alone a drive up lobby.Room was excellent, we chose the larger 360 sq ft room witb 2 double beds, for $ 260 ($ 100 lower than Times Square Marriott's comparable room), and was spacious. Pillows and bed were top class. Bathroom was large enough and well equipped. Big windows and views make it unforgettable, especially if you get the top floors.Will definitely stay there again.

<Content>Great Girl's Weekend Stayed here the first weekend in February with 5 of my girlfriends. We had two rooms that were adjoined with a door (two doubles in one and king in the other). The hotel was great, clean, modern, etc. The service (especially the concierge) was wonderful. The hotel is in a great location to restaurants, stores, theatres and train. Would recommend to anyone. Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>WOW! Amazing experience! I cannot say enough about my experience at the hilton Times Square. Being that it was my first time going to New York, I was hesitant about where to stay, but knew instantly I had made the best possible choice. This hotel was located in the middle of Times Square walking distance to pretty much anywhere! At the check-in counter I was warmly greeted, asked how my travel was and immediately checked-in. When I told her that it was my first time and if she could give me a room with a view, she said she would see what she could do and then said she definitely could. I was given my key and sent off to my room...WOW! She had given me not only a room on the 43rd floor, but a two bedroom suite! I had booked on Priceline and only paid $125/night and ended up with a room bigger than my apt. back home! This was more than I could have ever asked for. The staff said hello everytime I was walked by, and the hotel has just an overall great felling. My only dissapointment was the hotel bar. This is not a hip scene and not a place I would brag about to my friends back home. But with everything else being so great, the Hilton Times Sqaure made my first NY trip absolutely GREAT!

<Content>Do not book there please! Folks...a word of warning, booked for one night at the Hilton Times Square on the way to Houston. I booked a smoking room which was a mistake since it smelled like an ashtray. The service at the restaurant was mediocre at best. The only good thing about the hotel was the reception, which was manned by efficient personnel. There are better choices in Manhattan for the same money spent, Millenium by the UN Plaza for example, but that will be said in another review.

<Content>Enjoyable stay My girlfriend and I spent 3 nights, paying $279 a night.Positives:- Brilliant location - very close to Broadway (we saw two shows), right near Port Authority (useful for getting to Woodbury Commons) and right near a number of subway stations. It's super easy to get around from here- Great soundproofing - despite being right in the heart of Times Square, we never heard so much as a whisper from the crowds and traffic. Probably helps when rooms start from the 23rd floor. We had a very peaceful and restful stay - Generally good service - we paid for 2 doubles and asked for (and were upgraded to) a king room on check-in- INCREDIBLY comfortable beds. I stay a lot at 4 and 5 star hotels when travelling for work, and these were amongst the most comfortable beds I've ever slept on.- Nice touches in the room - good toiletries, a radio alarm clock which doubles as speakers for your MP3 player (it comes with required cables)- Reasonable gym: weights machines and some free weights (although dumbbells only go up to 30 lbs)Negatives:- The main negative was the maid service - my girlfriend asked for extra tea and milk and it never came. She had to ask on 3 separate occasions before they finally got it right.She also asked for extra face towels twice and again they never came.- Also, they were a bit too eager - we had put up a do not disturb sign and they called us on the phone to ask us if we were aware there was a do not disturb sign up! Of course we were - that's why it was there.. if we had been asleep at the time, we would have been very annoyed.All in all, would recommend this as a great place to stay - particularly because of the exceptional location.P.S. If you like brands and shopping, go to the Port Authority bus station right next to the Hilton, pay $38 and make the hour trek out to Woodbury Common. Some of the best outlet shopping we've ever had, with brands including Gucci, Chanel, Prada, Versace, Zegna, Ferragamo, Tumi  Samsonite to mention a few. Also, if you like pizza, we loved the pizza at Famous Famiglia's right around the corner - we ate there every day.

<Content>perfect for a short break We have just returned from a 4 night getaway at the Hilton Time Square. The location is fantastic - we entered the building from our taxis on 41st st. and did not realise the other exit was going to lead straight into the heart of the Time Square bright lights! There are plenty of fast food establishments close by (some better than others!!!) and we reccommend Dave and Buster's (a few door down from the hotel) for a light bite and frozen cocktail in the bar area. Also we had no problem finding good restaurants in the area too, The reception staff at the hotel were very welcoming and helpful. We had brought the wrong plug adaptor and they had one sent to our room within 5 mins followed by a phone call to check it had arrived. We requested a Time Square view however there were none available but this turned out to be a good thing as we had a beautiful view of the Empire State building instead - much more tranquil. In fact you find it hard to believe how busy the streets are from looking down from the 40th floor as you cannot hear a thing. The room was extremely spacious, clean and comfortable. It is nothing flash but as we were only using it as a base we found it to be perfect. The bathroom is small but adequate and the power shower is excellent. The beds are very comfortable and we found the temperature of the room was good (considering the freezing temp outside). We did not eat in the hotel and we only used the bar once as we found the barman who served us to be very rude - however this was not a problem because drinks were far cheaper elsewhere with a better atmosphere and service. We found it a good location to walk to most main attractions in the city and it is very close to a subway which we used to get down town (in fact we are proud of ourselves for working out how to use it!)If you are looking for a clean, spcious, friendly base with a great location then this is the place for you!

<Content>Excellent Hotel ! I took my daughter to New York for her 18th birthday. I chose this hotel primarily for the location which I have to say was fantastic.From the moment we checked in (3 hours early) we were met with friendly staff who could not have done enough for us.The hotel was immaculate. Our bags were taken to our room which was on the 23rd floor. It was just what I had requested - 2 double beds. The room itself was of adequate size, and again spotless. The bathroom was on the small size but nothing to worry us gals. You do not go to New York to sit in a hotel bedroom after all !!We had a great view from our room overlooking 42nd St. We did not eat in the Hotel, but it looked nice and was always busy. We had breakfast in Applebees (next door). I disagree with the comment made about the food. We had a lovely breakfast 3 days in a row, served be friendly staff. Each to their own I say ,but it is good to have different viewpoints.When we were in New York it was FREEZING COLD!! It was -9 on our first day!! I kid you not, we have never felt cold like that. We ended up buying ridiculous hats from a street vendor!!We would recommend a bus tour doing the Downtown Loop. It is good value and takes you to all the sights.On our first day we visited Ground Zero. We found this to be humbling and sad. It is also worth visiting St. Pauls church across the road. This has been turned into a sort of museum telling its own story of its part in 9/11. It was very moving.A wee tip, if you want to go into the Staue of Liberty- go early or book.Overall we had a brilliant time and I would have no hesitation in recomending this hotel for all.You can leave your bags when you check out free of charge which is great as you can make the most of your last day.I have to say that everyone we met was so ncie and helpful it was a real pleasure.

<Content>Sold choice for Times Square area My first stay at this Hilton property located on 42nd Street.Location is good if you like close proximity to the 2 large movie theaters on 42nd. Just down the block from the New Amsterdam and across the street from 2 other theaters. On the south end of the theater district, so it can be a several block walk to some of the theaters.Room was nice sized, in fact, it seemed there was a good bit of wasted space over near the windows. This is important when you consider the biggest negative of the hotel and that is the tiny bathrooms. They could have taken another 5 feet from the bedroom and added that to the bath. As it is, you can hardly turn around in the bathroom, and the bathroom door is awkwardly placed where it opens just shy of the edge of the commode and backs up to the tub/shower. For the small bathroom, I would probably not return to this hotel.Only had breakfast in the Above Restaurant. Once ordered off the menu and found the bacon to be near raw. Another day ate off the buffet where they were out of bacon. For $20+ for breakfast however you order it (menu or buffet), I was not impressed. Tried Applebees breakfast which is right next door, and though cheaper, the food was truly terrible.The other main negative on the rooms were how noisy it was with all the plumbing sounds. Whenever anyone in an adjoining room (next to, or up or down) would flush commode or use the shower, it was very evident to those of us in the room. Even woke me up one night it was so loud.With the negatives mentioned, I would not rule this out completely for future trip. Price was reasonable at just under $300 per night. Room was large and bed was comfortable. Design was quite nice.PRO'S- large room- decent location- nice design- fair priceCON'S- tiny bathrooms- very busy on 42nd street entrance- noisy plumbing- 2 elevator trips from room to the street

<Content>Good value for New York Stayed for 6 nights from the 9th January.Had to wait till 4pm for room(official check in time 3pm)The offer of a complimentary drink or pot of tea would have been nice but not offered. Room was big by NY standards and best view over NY I've had in 6 stays in the city. Very central for all attractions and the staff helpful and efficient.Very surprised nobody has mentioned the Westway diner on 9th Avenue between 41st and 42nd street as a great place for breakfast-or for that matter any meal-they're open 24/7.

<Content>Excellent stay I stayed at the Hilton Times Square with my boyfriend on our first trip to New York. We loved it. The location of the hotel is perfect and the beds were the most comfortable either of us have ever slept in. There was no noise once inside your room which was perfect after a busy day sightseeing and shopping! We found all staff at the hotel to be most helpful and polite, particularly the concierge who arranged our bus transport to Woodbury Common (a must for hardcore shoppers!).It was just a shame we didn't get time to fit everything we wanted to do in during our 4 night stay....shame, that means we'll have to book to go back! When we do, it'll definately be at the Hilton Times Square.

<Content>Fabulous Location  The Hilton times square is a great location, it's located right next next to the New Amersterdam Theater. The location worked out wonderful and we were able to walk to 5th avenue, central park and many other touristy destinations. The staff was very helpful, they gave us the exact trains we needed to take to get to the Yankee's game. The hotel bar was charming, a bit pricey but something I would picture in NYC. Our room was spacious for NY standards and the room was very clean. I would definately stay here again!

<Content>Great Location in Midtown This hotel should be known for its average facilities and accomodations but great location in Midtown. The rooms, restaurant, and bar were just ok. The walls were paper thin and the business center was more like a closet. On the positive side, the rooms are large and recently refurbished and the location is perfect. For the price, it's a good option.

<Content>Nice stay at Hilton Times Square My husband and I stayed at the Hilton in Times Square after winning a bid on Priceline for $112. We were super happy to find out we were staying at the Hilton for such a low price. Tip: check betterbidding website for priceline bidding strategies. We arrived at 8:00 am and they did not have a room ready, which was understandable. We hung out in the lobby for a while to warm up and the desk person waved to us to come up. A room was ready and we got into our room at 8:30. We thought it was really nice of her to acknowledge that we were waiting and give us a room so early. The room was big and very clean. The bed was super comfy - comparable to the Westin heavenly beds. Bathroom was a good size with lots of towels and nice amenities. We also thought it was strange that they had a coffee maker in the bathroom. Why not on the desk? Our room was on a low floor - 24th, but we were very happy with the view. There was no street noise, but we did hear housekeeping in the hallway a few times and could hear the toilet in the next room flush a few times. The only negative experience we had was with the bellhop. We asked him to store our two small bags and he acted like we were asking him to cut off a limb. Then he kept on saying how he wasn't going to be around later and just stood there with his hand out. We tipped him since we were worried he would sabotage our stuff if we didn't. I would stay here again, but I do like the Westin in Times Square better. It feels more trendy, yet elegant, and all their staff has always been super.

<Content>Hilton Times Square: The best place to stay! I stayed at the Hilton Times Square during the pre-Christmas rush. I got a real bargain on the price by booking directly via the website in September. We stayed from 13th until 17th December (4 nights) in a 2 bed deluxe room for only 1,279.32 USD. This was amazingly low if you take the exchange rate with Sterling into account.The room was spacious (much bigger than any other NYC hotel I鈥檝e stayed in) and spotlessly clean. We had a spectacular view of the Empire State Building. The hotel was quite festive with a large Christmas tree in the lobby and a Menorah, since it was Hanukah during our stay.The hotel is in the best possible location if you want to be in the heart of the action. Noise is not a problem inside. I didn鈥檛 eat at the hotel. There are many food outlets nearby, including Applebee鈥檚, located on the ground floor of the hotel, which is good for breakfast, burgers, milkshakes etc. The BB King Blues club is located across the street and is a good place to see a live band. The subway station is at the end of the block, making it easy to get to Fifth Avenue and Bloomingdale鈥檚 via Grand Central Station. Macy鈥檚 is a short walk down town.Staff members were very friendly and extremely helpful. I asked for information about shipping something back to Ireland and they arranged everything for me, including packaging, without any service charge. I also made use of the safety deposit boxes at reception. These proved to be very useful as I didn鈥檛 want to leave my laptop in the room safe. When it came time to check out I asked to check out an hour late. They agreed to this with no charge. Closer to the time I decided I would like to stay for another hour and they said that would be no problem but that there would be a small charge of $25. When I finally checked out they didn鈥檛 charge me at all. We also had the free nightly turn-down service with chocolates left on the pillows.This was my fourth trip to New York and this is the best hotel experience I have had yet. (I am particular about hotels!)I will definitely consider staying here again.

<Content>Location I stayed here recently and liked the size of the room. The area is swarming with people, you are in the middle of it all. If you are looking for a more leisurely area do not stay here. There's so much in the area that it would take eternity to explain.

<Content>Good Location I stayed at the Hilton Times Square last April with my mum and younger sister, I booked direct through the Hilton website however after a long flight from the UK we arrived at the Hilton to be told they had no rooms available with 2 double beds as we had booked, and we would have to stay in a king bed room with an extra roll away bed! Im not exactly sure why this happened, the receptionist said something about the people who were occupying our room the night before had decided not to check out and stay a bit longer?? All a bit of a mess! Anyway to make it up they did knock $50per night off of our bill and gave us a free breakfast every morning (we spent 5 days here)! After the messy check-in everything else at the hotel was fine, the room was huge - the bed was the biggest bed Ive even seen - and the comfiest!! The hotel is not actually on times square but you are literally a stones throw away, we didnt have a room facing times square so the view wasnt much - but hey you dont go to new york to sit in looking out of your window so that was OK!All in all, the service was excellent, the room was lovely and the location is great, my only concern is the hassle over the room we had booked - if I visit new york again I think I would splash out a bit and go for the Hilton Millenium - it looked fab!!

<Content>Excellent Stay at Hilton Times Square We recently stayed at the Hilton Times Square for 2 nights right after Xmas. We had booked our room early in Sept through the Hilton Honors Member dept. and requested a room w/2 beds as we were travelling w/our teenage daughter. We called and checked numerous times to confirm we had the double room. The day before we left we were told they had us in a room w/just a King bed and would try and provide a cot. After a few calls to the upper management we were moved to a suite on the top floor. The suite was lovely w/beautiful views of the city. There was a king bed room w/ a very large bathroom and a sitting/living room w/ pull out coach and small bathroom. It was so quiet that once we were in our room you didn't know you were in New York City unless you looked out the window. We had breakfast each morning there which was buffet or you could order off of the menu. We also had dinner there the firstnight we arrived as we were trying to make it to a show we had tickets for. Our dinner was very good - no complaints and we did enjoy the breakfasts as well. I would highly recommend this hotel, especially if you are going to see any shows. The Nederlander Theater is right outside the 41st St. entrance of hotel. The Times Square area was not that nice of an area to walk around but it was very close proximity to everything. The room was kept very clean and so were the other areas of the hotel. We would definitely stay there again if we were visiting New York to see a show. .

<Content>Enjoyed the Hilton I have stayed at the Hilton Times Square, the Marriott in Times Square and the Crowne Plaze in Times Square. (Actually I immediatley checked out of the Crowne Plaza after seeing my grungy room and dealing with the rude staff) The Hilton is very nice and I enjoyed my stay. The linens are nice, the shampoo and other products are nice (Crabtree and Evelyn), and the room is a nice size. The hotel is quiet and peaceful as well.However, I am a little suprised that this hotel is noted as the Best Luxury Hotel in NY. It is nice, but nothing over the top. In comparison to the Marriott - the Hilton is a little further away and the bed/linens aren't quite as nice. The view is better at the Marriott as well. However, the room in the Hilton is slightly larger (although the Marriott room was a nice size) and the Hilton is significantly cheaper. Overall, I think I'd recommend the Marriott first with the Hilton a close second.

<Content>Great location, wonderful service! Stayed here for one night following a move from previous hotel. Great location, we stayed on the 30th floor facing Empire State which was great. Room was lovely and comfortable, staff could not have been more helpful and courteous. Especially in transporting our 85kg of luggage! When returning to New York we will definitely be staying here again :o)

<Content>Location, Location, Location Stayed here in December 2006. What a great location. Check-in service was fast, friendly and efficient. Rooms were sound-proof and quiet. Room was okay. Nothing special, but was clean and very large (by New York City Standards.) I would stay here again. Paid Over $500.00 per night once taxes were added. It was worth it for the location alone. Nightly turndown service was nice. All associates from bell staff, front desk and housekeeping were friendly and either acknowledged you or smiled when they passed by you. Guest room was worn, scratches on wall, carpet worn, artwork on walls faded. Because it was clean- I would still recommend this hotel.

<Content>great location, great service My husband and I just returned from a one-night stay at this well-located, comfortable hotel. I reserved two connecting rooms, using Hilton HHonors rewards. My daughter, her husband and two children were in the connecting room. We were on the 24th floor, with great views of 42nd Street and the Hudson River and New Jersey. We found the bell-hops, front desk, concierge and all the staff very efficient and helpful. The location couldn't be beat. Madame Toussad's is next door, as is Applebees and McDonalds (good for a quick breakfast). Bryant Park , where my grandchildren ice skated for free, was two blocks east, and the theater and many restaurants were within walking distance, as was the American Girl Place and Rockefeller Center.  The rooms were modern, roomy and spotless, with everything one needs for a short stay. Parking was convenient, though quite expensive, but subway stations were right there, so this hotel is quite accessible. Our family ate at Tony's Dinapoli on 43 Street, where the food was abundant and good and quite affordable for a large family. For a quick and delicious sandwich, try Cosi restaurants, spread around the city. All in all, I would give this hotel four stars. We would definitely stay here again!

<Content>Perfect for first timers! This hotel was everything we hoped it would be. Perfect location for sightseeing with nearby subways. Friendly, efficient check-in and check out took less than 5 minutes. Room on the 42nd floor with great views of Manhattan and the Hudson. Large, spotlessly clean room with contemporary decor and very comfortable king size bed, plush towels and robes and tea/coffee making facility, albeit in the bathroom! Hardly heard a noise even though we faced 42nd street!We are quite self-sufficient travellers and so didn't require any of the hotel services, neither did we use the bar or restaurant which looked OK but a little staid for us.Overall I would say the hotel is above average, although not luxurious or grand. We had a fabulous stay and would definitely consider this hotel if we return to NY. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great location, large modern rooms and great views from the higher floors.

<Content>Nice but beware of best rate guarantee Stayed at the Hilton Times Square for 3 nights. This was my 4th trip to NY but my 1st stay in Times Square. I was concerned about the noise level given the location, however that was never a problem at this hotel. Our room was on the 36th floor with excellent views of the city and never even heard a drop of a pin! Rooms were spotless and above average size by New York standards. Turndown service was a nice touch. Beds were very comfortable. Bathrooms were nicely equipped but quite cramped, even for one person. We never ate in the hotel. For breakfast we found that Applebee's next door was convenient and inexpensive.My only complaint was that I booked the room via the Hilton website and within 24 hours found the identical accomodations for $30 less per night via NYC.com. I filed a claim via Hilton's best rate guarantee -- big mistake!! The claim was denied, despite having screen captures showing all the identical dates and terms. When I asked for the claim to be re-evaluated, the staff (in Memphis) never had the authority to match the rate. My claim continued to be escalated to the manager, who never returned calls, e-mail or fax inquiries. However upon check-in, I expressed my disattisfaction and gave them copies of the items I had previously submitted. The manager on duty was apologetic and quickly matched the rate.

<Content>Nothing special - not great - not bad I guess a bit disapointing really - in so much that I wanted a really stylish above average place for this short break. We were over in NY to see Barbra Striesand (who was fab by the way). I used the reviews here to choose this Hotel and the overall rating (7th top ranking in New York - not bad), and paid 拢800 (about 拢$1400) for a room for three nights, so I expected something a bit special (is it really that much money for the central location - just off Times Square).The check in was quick, the room on the 29th floor a standard type Hilton, but the whole Hotel is in need of a freshen up, its looking a bit tired. The beds big and comfy, the rooms plenty of space, great manhattan views but nothing stylish about the design. The room service staff were efficient and did a good job, although as a previous review the corridor seemed to be perminently littered with used old food trays - no big deal though. The Bar and lounge was not really inviting, we thought. So nothing bad to report. Just nothing outstanding either, and for the money - we wish we'd have tried some of the other Hotels we considered.

<Content>Overall--a nice experience We booked the Hilton Times Square in large part due to the positive reviews on TA, plus we are also Hilton Honors members. I called the hotel directly to make the reservation and requested a room on a high floor and also booked a standard room. After all, the deluxe room is only 20 square feet larger and cost about $20/night extra. When we arrived at the hotel, there was a long line to check in and only 2 clerks working at the desk, so we waited 30 minutes. Upon check-in, we learned that we had been upgraded to a deluxe room and that our request for a high floor was honored. We got a room on the 37th floor that had a great view of the Empire State Building. Overall, the hotel rooms are nicely decorated with blond wood furnishings. Positive things about this hotel -- every night we had turn down service. Not only were the bedcovers turned down but the maid left two bottles of water and two pieces of chocolate. The rooms were kept very clean. All the staff we encountered, were friendly and helpful. During the week, you get a complimentary copy of USA Today. The closet was surprisingly spacious. The downside---there is only one very small trash can in the room, in the bathroom. By small, I mean that once you throw out those two empty water bottles, there is little room for anything else. As for trash removal--sometimes the maid was a bit over zealous. One day, we left our copy of USA Today on the desk and the maid threw it out. Other days, the maid wouldn't take old newspapers we left next to the trash can--go figure! The shower pressure wasn't the best but that is often the case in hotels anyway. The hotel lobby is on the 21st floor. You enter at street level on either 41st or 42nd Street and then take an elevator to the lobby. Once in the lobby, you take yet another elevator to your room. Just note that it is easy to miss the entrance on 42nd Street due to the fact that the street is cluttered with large, bright signs, thus it is easy to bypass the entrance. Overall, we would stay here again. I think the positives outweigh the negatives.

<Content>Great Rooms, OK service. Stayed at the Hilton Times Square 5 nights for a business event. The rooms were above average for NYC and the were very clean. The service wasn't great but it was OK. After getting a room on the 41st floor and a great recommendation for a sports bar around the corner, the quality of the service went down hill. When I asked the concierge to help get a reservation to a new restaurant in the city she wasn't aware of it. Ted's Montana Grill opened the week that i was there and I wanted to get some buffalo steak. She found a place called Ted's IN Buffalo that she could get me into. I had to give her the url and number of the place to call. Great location if you need to be in the center of everything!

<Content>Loved Hilton Times Square and NYC! My family(party of 4) stayed at this hotel on Sept 2005 for 6 nights. We got a very good rate at $249/night for a deluxe room on the high floor. Excellent Views of 42nd Street and some views of Times Square from there. The hotel was excellent. I noticed that some people were complaining below, but cannot understand their complaints. The room was very comfortable and spacious, the bathroom was a large size, beds were comfortable and the elevators were very fast. All the staff members we met were friendly. They even checked us in and let us go to our rooms in the morning as we arrived in NYC at 7am(although check in time was supposed to be noon). We just returned from our trip to Europe, we went to London and Nice and paid even more for our hotels there. With the price we paid in London and Nice, the hotels there were below average. The Hilton Times Square was definitely 5 stars compared to the hotels we stayed in Europe for exactly the same price we paid. The location of the Hilton Times Square can't be beat. Walking distance to all the sites and attractions of Times Square. Next to it is a subway stop and you're also close to all the city tour bus stops. It's not a far walk either to 5th Ave, Macys, and Central Park. We even walked to the UN from our hotel last year, not too bad of a walk if you're up to it. There are a bunch of restaurants, delis, bars in the area. No need to eat at the hotel's restaurant or have 24 hour room service, as it's expensive. Some of the delis we went into were 24 hours and the food was inexpensive but very good. Location was awesome!I noticed that the hotel rates have gone up since last year, but we still got a good rate as we're coming back this Thanksgiving 2006 for a whole week, this time with more family members. We did book 7 months in advance to get a $299/rate for the Thanksgiving week. I just looked at the website again and it's now $600/night for the same room. Hotel room rates in Manhattan have skyrocketed so expect to pay if you are staying in Manhattan during peak times.. One of the reasons, there's a lot of conversions of hotel rooms to condos/lofts, so there are less and less hotel rooms available in Manhattan. When researching for hotels, even for a 2 star hotel can cost you $200/night during peak season. Plus so many people from all over the world wants to go there, that would mean more demand and less supply which will make it more and more expensive to stay in Manhattan. Loved NYC and can't wait to go back there in a month!

<Content>Totally a tourist trap! Stayed at the Hilton during fashion week and the per room rate was over $500 for a larger than average (by NYC standards) room but not much else.The staff were friendly enough but nothing stood out as being exceptional for the money.Location is good if you are going to the shows but has few good restaurants in the area and all are very expensive. Moreover, Times Square is constantly filled with tourists from Nebraska or Iowa who think it's Las Vegas with style!Stay in Soho or uptown and at least see NYC as it really is.

<Content>Going Down Hill Have stayed at this hotel about 4 times over the past 2 years. This hotel has been my preferred spot due to location, clean rooms, friendly staff and great breakfast buffet. This pass visit, the staff was professional but not at the friendly level as before. The furniture had numerous mars, chips and scratches and the shower in the bathroom needs replacing. The next morning I became ill after eating at the breakfast buffet which previously had more and better tasting selections. Time to find another hotel!

<Content>300 $ just for accomodation?? stayed at the Hilton on Times Square Sep 05 for 1 night. Though staff was somehow friendly by NY standards I cannot agree in what other travellers commented. Due to a cruise we started from NY we had some suitcases to be carried and helped with. There are two different bellman depts in charge of your luggage. 1st from street level to 21st floor,2 nd. from reception up to your room which means tipping twice for one service and, yes, the bellmen of each division fight with each other regarding the tipps. Very unpleasant situation fot the guest!! rooms are average, bathrooms small and not very welcoming equipped. beds far to soft to be comfortable. Due to late arrival we did not leave the hotel for any food or drinks but decided to take a glass in the bar. bar/restaurant/reception all located in kind of a station hall without any optical or accustical dividing. Sound level just to high to have a conversation. but price level even higher.... Decided to go up to the room and order something to eat from 24 hr. roomservice. Were informed that roomservice ends by 10.30 pm due to new procedures. Well, what makes a hotel worth the money, how defines a hotel its nightly price? With lacking services???? We do not agree and will definitly avoid this hotel in future. A management dividing the hotel into cost structures and canceling services the moment they are not profitable is not what we expect from a hospitality place

<Content>Outstanding Location My girlfriend and I stayed at the Hilton Times Square in mid-August.vvOur room was on a high floor overlooking the Empire State Building at a reasonable place. The hotel is a 15 minute walk from Grand Central Station and about a 20-25 minute walk to Central Park. Room service was pricey but cheaper then most of the restaurants in Manhattan. Overall we enjoyed our stay and we would definitely stay again here.

<Content>Not worth the price, beware of bogus charges!! At $500/night you expect something better than a painfully average room with an uncomfortable bed. Yes, the location is good, but there are so many other hotels in New York and in Times Square for that matter. Seriously, for that price you could stay at the Ritz.My husband and I stayed here on business and they added a $50 charge from the lobby bar that we never made. It took 30 minutes for them to agree to remove it and they were somewhat rude about it. Our colleague had secured a special corporate rate and when he checked out they told him it was an error and tried to make him pay another $200 even though he had a confirmation with his rate on it. Again, it took 30 minutes and much arguing for this to be resolved.Is it dirty or run down? No. Is it the worst hotel in NYC? Not by a long shot, but if you are going to dig deep into your pockets, do yourself a favor and stay somewhere worth it.

<Content>Great Hotel I recently stayed at this Hotel with my niece. A trip to NY was her 18th Birthday present from me and her first visit to NYC.  I have stayed in NY several times usually around the Times Square area but this was my first stay at the Hilton.  All of the previous reviews I had read proved to be very accurate and I was certaily not disappointed with the Hotel. Having read previous reviews I had asked to be in a room as high as possible to ensure we had the good view that people had mentioned. When we checked in we were allocated a room onteh 23rd floor which is the first floor for rooms and the view was of buildings opposite. The room was lovely but I was disappointed witht he view so I went back to reception and without hesitation they moved us to the 39th floor which had a stunning view of the Statue of Liberty and was much lighter. Will, the receptionist, was wonderful and always said hello to us as we passed reception from then on. The location is perfect, the staff are very friendly and the rooms are very clean. This is much better value overall than the Hotels I have stayed in which are far more expensive with less room and often no view.I would have no hesitation recommending this Hotel and would certainly stay there again.

<Content>Average Our family of four stayed here for 6 nights in August. Booked this hotel mainly due to the good reviews on Trip Advisor but on the whole felt disappointed. The rooms were a fair size for New York, although the bathrooms were on the small size, and they were clean and well serviced by the housekeeping staff, but there was nothing of particular note about them, they were just average. We had problems with noisy neighbours on two nights and although Hilton did recompense us for this it was disturbing.The lobby/bar/restaurant were all together and I think that this is what was most annoying. It was not possible to just sit and have a relaxing drink as hoards of people kept passing through on their way in or out of their rooms or to visit reception.The staff were all very polite and helpful though and you cannot fault the location. In summary it is an average hotel, in a great location, but definitely not on the cheap side, especially in the bar and the restaurant.

<Content>Excellent All Round I can't say enough good things about this hotel. It was in a prime location just around the corner from Times Square on 42nd St., they let us check in an hour early, the room was large and spotless with a great view of Manhattan and all of the staff were polite and courteous.There is one minor thing to look out for, and it is so minor that I'm almost embarrassed to mention it. The hotel offers you the facility to play your Ipod in your room but once you get there it's a really small bedside alarm clock and once you plug your ipod into it you can barely hear it. As far as I'm concerned, if that's the only complaint I've got about a hotel then I've done really well!

<Content>Great location! The rooms are clean  comfortable. We even got to check in early. Park in the lot across the street. It's cheaper than the hotel lot. The toilet has an extremely loud flush  the service in the restaurant for an after theater dessert was not the best, but the dessert  martini were delicious. Can't beat the location. It's in the theater district  walking distance to the Javits Center for business purposes. Walk over to 9th avenue for some nice bistros with some better pricing. Lots to choose from.

<Content>Exceeded expectations Travelled to NYC for my daughter's 16th birthday gift in March '06. We spent 2 nights--a Friday and a Saturday night.Pros: Great staff--we all felt very attended to from the moment we arrived until our departure. Doormen, concierge, hotel check-in, housekeeping, restaurant staff--everyone was great. Frankly, that is why I really like this place. The staff is the hotel's greatest asset in my opinion. They sent my daughter a nice birthday gift--a card and wonderful fruit platter-for us all to enjoy upon our arrival.Location is in the heart of 42nd street--noisy outside as one might expect... but inside the hotel, it's calm, quiet and peaceful. Easy walking distance for my family to lots of theaters, shopping, Rockefeller Center, Penn Station, etc.Clean rooms; comfortable beds; ironing board and safe in room; TV worked well; great PAX market across the street w/ reasonably priced items (muffins, sandwiches, pizza, etc.)Cons: Rooms are average size; the hotel restaurant is pricey so don't be surprised, BUT the food is good. We had breakfast and dinner 2x each. Bottom line: It's a 3 star hotel which does an EXCELLENT job w/ the basics. In NYC, you can spend $$$ and still not get the basics covered. YES!! I will stay here again.

<Content>Absolutely fantastic! Our first time to New York so obviously we wanted to be in the heart of it for a brilliant first impression and we were not disappointed!The staff were friendly and happy to assist. Rooms were clean, modern, big and came with some booklets on New York - especially helping first-timers like ourselves!We couldn't have asked for a better view either, being on the 37th floor, overlooking the likes of the Empire State Building!The connecting Applebees is a good alternative for breakfast if you'd like just a cereal, and the hotel itself is ideally located just a block from many of the Broadway theatres, the guided bus tour start, and shared the same street as many shops, restaurants and Madam Tussauds.We'd definitely stay again at this hotel

<Content>Unbeatable location Stayed 6 nights - with wife and 2 kids 15 and 11- at the HTS late July-stifling outside but the hotel was an oasis of coolness and peace right in the heart of Times Square.Rooms large and comfortable by NY standards and well above the hubbub below so noise was not a problem - an added benefit was a great view of Empire State BuildingStaff all very pleasant and am happy to recommend this hotel

<Content>Great with kids! From the minute we stepped out of the rain, the doorman started us out with our wonderful stay at the HTS. Although we were 3 hours early, they had our room ready! With two little boys (6  10), we were very thankful! The front desk personnel were very friendly, professional, and even took time to remember our son's birthday that weekend. Later, they even provided a complimentary ice cream party for him to celebrate! Wonderful!! Then Omar took care of our baggage and wisked us right to our room. What a pleasure it was to meet him! He was so friendly and informative, the kids loved him! He remembered our son's names and always went out of his way to say hi and ask how their day was. The room was very large, two queen beds, desk space, chair with ottoman, separate, large, bath on a non-smoking floor. Everything looks new and fresh. The non-smoking floor was important, and although I have a nose like a bloodhound, I couldn't not smell anything from other floors. Maid service was great, prompt, and plenty of fresh towels and pillows. Amenities were nice quality and promptly replaced. The view was fantastic, and we did not hear a peep from any other rooms or outside. The location is fantastic, close to all the NYC tourist venues, and be sure to find all the bronze statuary throughout the hotel. So cute!Give it a try, you will NOT be disappointed!!! We will definitely be back to HTS!!!

<Content>Do not stay here!!! Horrible experience!!!! This hotel is run down... the beds are extremely soft-- hotel made excuses and said  Well sir, we are now installing these soft beds Could not sleep at all -- bed too soft for your back. Very rude front desk staff that were not accomadating -- all they did was put boards under the mattress. Had to leave hotel and check into Westin. I will never stay here again and I am a Diamond elite member with Hilton.

<Content>Location, location, location.... Clean hotel, great beds, and location, location, location. Stayed with spouse and two boys (6  8). New Amsterdam Theater half a block up, Dave  Busters next door, ESPN Zone one block away, Toys 'R Us flagship store two blocks away. Price was commensurate with the location... little legs can't go too far before life gets miserable. Boys made the walk to and from Penn Station without a problem. Finding the entrance can be tricky, but the clock pictured on the Hilton's website is exactly what you will see when you get there. You will enter on the ground floor and take the elevator up to the lobby. Professional staff checked us in. Three people behind the counter moved between a few languages flawlessly. Kudos to Hilton for putting the right people in the right place.Check in, our stay and check out was smooth. Baggage handlers stored our bags after check out for some additional sight seeing.

<Content>Great sheets, clean, safe, convenient location It was hard to find the front door, but later realized that the hotel sits atop a 22-story building. The street-level elevator takes up you to the lobby. Security always asked to see our room-key before getting onto the elevator. Yes, things were expensive -- weak breakfast was $36 for two, MMs was $3.50 from in-room fridge), but hey it's New York. USA Today provided to room M-F.This hotel is very convenient to all the theatres and subways. There's a Starbucks right across the street. There's a great magazine/newspaper store right next door open to 3 a.m.Checkout was a breeze. Doormen helpful hailing cabs. We didn't ask much of conceirge, but they gladly answered our basic questions about getting to Ellis Island. Despite another comment, we stayed on 25th floor and the air-conditioning units didn't bother us, but we're from Florida and are used to the noise.The sheets on the bed were very high quality, dreamy. Good mattresses.

<Content>Great hotel in Times Square My wife and I returned from a weekend in New York at the Hilton Times Square. We were both impressed with the location, service, size and condition of the room, and the low noise level. We got a great rate on the hotel through Priceline. Even though we were Priceline guests, the staff treated us in warm and friendly manner. From the doorman to the security officers at the elevator entrance to guest check in and bell server, eveyone was terrific. The location is great if you're going to the theater. Times Square was mobbed this time of year, with the crowds at some points just too great for the sidwalks. There were cops everywhere so we felt very secure. The room size was large for a New York hotel, although pretty standard for room in other places. The room was very quiet, which can sometimes be a problem in a hotel in a busy part of New York. The hotel part of the building is set back from the street and begins on the 22nd floor of the building where the lobby is located. We were on the 30th floor and street noise was non existent. Our room was next to the elevator bank, which initially concerned me. However, we couldn't hear the elevators moving at all, so the soundproofing was pretty good. Nor did we hear any noise from the corridor or other rooms on same floor or the floors above or below ours. The room looked almost new. The bath was modern and extremely clean. There's a small restaurant in the lobby, if you want to eat onsite. The hotel is 2 blocks from the TKTS discount outlet.

<Content>Incredible From the first minute there  Omar checked our bags early - to when we checked out - it was perfect. They offered to call us when our room was ready - they did. Security was obvious but not opressive. Room had plenty of space for a family with 2 teenage boys. Clean, beds were heavenly, great location. When we go back to NY - we will stay @ the Hilton Times Square - everything was perfect. Probably the best aspect was the service - each staff member took extra time to check on you - without being pushy Omar deserves a raise!

<Content>Good Hotel for First Time Tourist to New Yori This was my first trip to New York City as a tourist so Times Sqare location is good for one who wants to do the touristy things. My five night stay was free because I cashed in my Hilton Honors points and I conclude these points were well invested. I liked the location of the hotel since most sites I wanted to tour were within walking distance, keep in mind that I like to walk. Subway stops are nearby as well as many night clubs, shops, restaurants, drug store, post office, etc.My room was on the 40th floor and was quiet, no street noise at all. Room was very spacious with two double beds, desk, reading chair with floor lamp, cable TV, mini bar, bath with shower. Air conditioning worked fine and there was lots of hot water. Carpet and paint were not exactly new but otherwise everything about the room was fine. View to the south was good however the new Times building, under construction, will prove to be a future obstruction. Breakfast was included which was a small but delicious buffet. Service in the coffee shop was very good. Lobby with bar are Art Deco style and a popular meeting place after business hours. Hotel desk staff were friendly, professional, and helpful. Business center is lacking, internet access is much cheaper next door to the hotel on 42nd Street. Entrance to the hotel off 42nd street can be hard to find, just look for the door under the clock. Bellmen at the ground floor entrance will help if asked, otherwise you are on your own. 41st street entrance (back of the hotel) is more convenient, again look for the clock. No problem getting a taxi from the 41st Street entrance.I recommend this hotel to anyone desiring this location - just a half a block from Times Square. Regarding price justification - one has to compare.

<Content>Fantastic location We stayed at the Hilton for 7 nights at the beginning of May. We did ask for a room on a high floor room if possible, and we were given a huge corner room on the 27th floor overlooking 42nd Street which was lovely (would have liked it a little higher though). We could not fault the cleanliness of the room or bathroom. The views were beautifiul particularly at night. The actual entrance to the hotel is not the best we have seen, and if you arrive by taxi make sure the taxi driver goes to the 41st street entrance (not the 42nd street), or you have to carry your luggage across the road like we did ! Reception staff were very nice - we actually managed to check in at 1pm. The little dealings we had with the concierge was very good. The security was good at the hotel, we had to show our keycard most times to begin with until they got to recognize you. We did not eat or drink in the hotel. Applebees next door is great for breakfast and Paxs foods across the road is brilliant for lunch. There are loads of great irish Bars just off Broadway - particularly the Pig n Whistle on 47th or 48th Street. The location of the hotel was very convenient. It is so close to most things - Bryant Park is only yards away and is beautiful in the sun. The entrance out onto 42nd Street did get a little crazy and busy through at times which is not what you always wanted. We have been to NY several times now, and if you want to stay around Times Square we would certainly recommend this hotel. (Waldorf is great as well if you want to stay somewhere different).

<Content>it's okay but wouldn't stay here again We stayed here for 5 days this week. For the price I paid (about $360 a night including taxes) I was underwhelmed, so to speak. Our first impression was not good. As our taxi arrived at the door, the doorman immediately began to give the driver a hard time simply because he gently beeped the horn to announce he/we were there. They started arguing and only stopped when I stepped in to ask how much I owed the driver. Yikes. Welcome to NewYork. We were allowed to check in an hour early. I had requested a high floor, as I was aware that a low floor would put us right over the drone of the airconditioners. So where did we get put? The 25th floor, over the airconditioners. I intended to ask to be moved on day 2 but we were just so tired and the thought of packing up all our stuff to move wasn't inviting. My advice: don't stay here unless you can get a room up around 30 floors or above due to street noise and airconditioning units.The conceriege (both of them) were not much help to us. One guy could have cared less to help us. I didn't have complicated questions, just a few things I would think someone in that position should know (if we walk to circleline tours at the end of 42nd street, can we cross the highway on foot? or do we really need to take a bus down 42nd street just so that we can get across the highway? He had no idea even though we are talking about a distance of about a mile or less. Answer: you can walk and cross the highway on foot. We found that out after taking the bus.) But it was the attitude this guy had about not helping us, which was offputting. The other guy did find a phone number for me, which was good. But when I was asking a question about where to buy a 7 day subway pass because we were setting off for one of the art museums, he tried to convince us to take a taxi instead and not ride the subways. What? Not ride the subway in NY to get around? How helpful would this be? He said a taxi to the museum would only cost us about $12 so do that instead. Well, we headed straight for the subway instead because the TOTAL trip to the museum would have been $24 ($12 EACH way) and we could by a 7 day subway pass for $24 each allowing us unlimited travel. Glad we did this. The subway was safe and relatively fast and not too hard to figure out once you get going.More about the hotel: the room was clean and the beds were fine. But on one day we returned to our room in the afternoon and the room had not been cleaned. Several managers had different reasons for why it had not been serviced. I'm not sure really what the reason was. But even after I was told it would be serviced, it took 2 1/2 hours to get it done and so we lost that time because we were not totally aware it would take so long ( the maid did not begin as soon as our request was made).One more thing: do not eat breakfast at the hotel dining room. We tried that one morning and it cost the three of us $49 for very little. A glass of orange juice was $4 for goodness sake. My husband and daughter opted for the buffet for $18 each only to find out that they were out of eggs. Okay, so my daughter had three strips of bacon and a sausage link and a hashbrown for $18. (we had to pay $4 for the orange juice). My husband had some type of quiche and some bacon, again for $18, plus $4 for the juice. I don't eat at buffets, so I ordered a blueberry muffin (made right there, the menu is happy to point out). The muffin (again $4) was not one of these fluffy overflowing the top of the muffin cup kind of muffin, it was a flat cupcake muffin, like if a batch was supposed to make 12 muffins the chef had stretched the muffin mixture to make 18 muffins instead. And it was cold, like right out of a refrigerator. To top that off, our waiter could only mumble vague words to us, which were no answers at all, really. Anyway, a lot of money for very little.I know this review focuses on the negative. Yes, the hotel was clean and safe, those were the positives. But if I return to New York, I will try another hotel for the same price. This one, for us, was just not that special. Maybe there are helpful concierges there that just were not there during our stay. By the way, there was no concierge available all day on Friday while we were there (sign said they were sorry for the inconvience, see the check in clerk for help...which we did once, but was no help), and later in the late afternoon a concierge showed up. Maybe others who request a high floor get one (we didn't), and maybe others are happy to pay $18 for a breakfast buffet that has run out of eggs and doesn't replace them, but we just were disappointed. It didn't ruin our vacation because we didn't dwell on it. But I didn't have the same great experience other posters on this board had and i felt like I had to say so.

<Content>Fabulous Stay at this Hilton We stayed at the Hilton Times Square for a four day vacation weekend. We had a great time. Upon check in our front desk personnel was extremely friendly. She offered to upgrade us to a suite on our second day if we were interested. We asked for a corner room, which I recommend b/c they are large. The room was so large we didn't even want to upgrade on our second day. The bellman who took our luggage up was familiar with the city and answered our questions with great recommendations. The room was very clean and well dusted. The beds have the upgraded linen similiar to the W's Heavenly Bed and was very comfortable. The concierge was quick to respond. The hotel was very well located to everything we wanted to do on our trip. It is a 1/2 block from the bus station if you fly in and take the bus into the city from the airport. The breakfast buffet was reasonably priced and offered great selections. We didn't experience anything negative during our stay and we are very particular about staying in great hotels. A true recommendation to those who love five star hotels. The customer service was above average, which was amazing b/c all of the staff were very friendly.

<Content>Great Location Stayed at the Hilton Times Square for 5 nights on the last week of our holdiay. We arrived quite late and the only room available was a smoking room (we are both non smokers), the receptionist advised that he would change us the next day into a non smoking room and had housekeeping freshen up our room until we were moved. The rooms were spacious and clean, although found it quite strange that the tea and coffee facilites were in the bathroom!! You are best to request a room on a high floor facing 42nd street which has a great few of the broadway lights at night. the other side has a building site across the street. The hotel is in a great location, just a few steps from Broadway. The bellboys were great, really friendly and helpful. I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone visiting NY.

<Content>Great Room, Great View Just had a two night stay in the Hilton Times Square and loved every minute of it. The hotel is located exactly where you want it on 42nd street and we had a great view of Times Square from our window on the 33rd floor. The room was a nice size and bigger then the average NY hotel room. The bed was very comfortable and we really didnt have any complaints. We had an evening flight as well and they gave us a complimentry late check out. Would definately stay here again

<Content>Easter at the Hilton We stayed at the Hilton from the 12-19 April and would say what a lovely Hotel it was,the bell boys were all very welcoming Robert and especially Henery who really made a fuss of our 8 year old daughter.We could,nt check in because the room was not ready?so we left our bags downstairs at not cost and went for a walk,the receptionist said she would phone us when the room was ready...she didnt.Anyway after about 2 hours a walk down to battery park a drink and some ice cream we went back,and i must admit it was nice to just go for a walk anyway after such a long flight...and what brilliant weather as well!We checked in and had a high floor with a view of times square as requested which was brill as we could see the Hudson as well,36 floor and when the window was shut we could`nt hear a thing below.The room was well lovely very spacious we had a delux double(two king size bed which were comfortable,didnt like the pillows to much they were to soft!The guys brought our bags up,and we kept them sweet with a couple of dollars tip every time they got us a taxi etc...I thought about giving them some gum AKA Macualy Culkin(home alone) but changed my mind :)The hotel location is just right and not as mad as i had read as you walk out onto the street,or a rear entrance if you want a taxi on request.Secruity was ok they didnt always ask me for my card but i made a point of always saying hi to the guys at the front desk so i think they just became familiar with me.We didnt eat at the hotel as we prefered to eat out and about,we still ate quite local though,applebys next door is good for breakfast and also pax`s over the road,also macca d`s next door,there was also a nice place with sold noodles and meatballs which were jummy,along from paxs but i forgot its name,we also ate at various little food joints along the way to refuel,and dont listen to what they say about Mars 2112,we had a fab meal,fab service and its a fab place just a pity there is not a few more aliens around in there as i only counted two!we walked most places which pleased the kids ....NOT but the place is sooooo easy to get aroung,we travelled by bus,subway and taxi.Me and my lad tested out the fitness centre at the hotel its only small located on the 23rd floor,couple of running machines,bikes couple of other machines,free weights and a weights station,fresh cooled water as well,it was not bad at all although the do charge you i think it was about 1.50 every time you go in,i didnt mind though as long as i kept my juices flowing,but if dont want to pay 1.50 the fire escape is ok to goes from 20th to 45 floor it soon gets your legs aching.The staff were all friendly as as long as you give them manners and repect thats what you`ll get in return,the concerige fredrick(think ive spealt it wrong) was a nice guy very helpfull.ON our final day we asked for a late checkout and were not charged for this,i think overall we payed aroung 1,500 sterling for our stay there,which may or may not be expensive,i suppose you could find it cheaper but i booked direct through the hotel,and found it a competive price?we loved our stay in the hilton,we loved new york full stop,and we were ready to book again until the father in law said yesterday he was treating us to a cruise around the Caribean,it was a hard choice?! but New york will have to wait a whilelove to you all

<Content>Terrific Hotel I stayed at the Hilton Times Square with a very large group of high school students and parents from California. The hotel was exceptionally nice. The rooms were clean and comfortable, the location of the hotel for sightseers is perfect and the staff was extremely accommodating. We had an epidemic of stomach flu hit our group and the hotel staff was helpful and understanding. The Applebees restaurant attached to the hotel had a good buffet breakfast ready for us on time each morning, with lots of room for regular travelers, and the security folks, concierge, doormen, etc. were unfailingly courteous in assisting our group. This is a hotel I would come back to.

<Content>Wonderful location My family have just returned from a 5 night break at this hotel and cannot fault it in any way. The staff were alway polite with the security at the 41st /42nd street entrance excellent. No-one could access the hotel without showing their room key. The rooms were spotlessly clean and the turn down service with chocolates on our return in the evening was a nice surprise. The location of the hotel is excellent on 42nd Street just about 100 yards away from the Amsterdam Theatre (where the Lion King is now showing). There are plently of places to eat within a small radiius of the hotel.We would definitely return .

<Content>Fantastic New Year's Eve in Times Square Our family of four (2 adults and 2 children aged 8  5) had a fabulous week in New York and the Hilton made it special. I must admit, our first night was average as we arrived late, had a very rude member of staff check us in and our room (2 double beds which were very comfortable) was near an elevator and did not have a good view and, since we were staying in this property for 9 nights we thought we should have received a nicer room. We did complain (we are Hilton Honours members) and the next morning we were upgraded to a much higher floor (with an apology about the rude staff member) to a room with a view of the excitement and neon lights of 42nd st! What made the room even better though, was our amazing view of the fireworks and the Ball Drop on New Year's Eve. There were many other reasons we really loved this hotel: the Crabtree  Evelynn toiletries, the generous and efficient house keeping staff ( a $2 tip each morning went a long way!), the lovely food and wine at the restaurant, the helpful concierge who shipped our jackets back to Australia for us and recommended a fantastic hairdresser and the amazing night staff who cleaned up after our 8 year old vomitted all over the bathroom floor!!!! This hotel is also in an amazing position.....you are in the heart of everything and the warm welcome we received from the bellhops made it feel like we were very special indeed! I highly recommend this property but would join the Hilton honours programme before I came...it might get you a better room and it will certainly get you good service (and bottled water and newspaper daily!)

<Content>loved the Hilton Just returned from a four night stay and had an incredible time. Cant fault the Hilton..... location great, rooms spacious and very clean and staff very helpful. Had a room on 33rd floor with fab views of the Empire State Building. Our first visit to NY so ther was much to cram in. Particularly enjoyed views from the Rockefeller building. Weather was great which made everything seem even better.Would love to go back to NY and would definitely stay at The Hilton again.

<Content>Great Hotel Better than Expected Just returned from a four day trip to New York. Travelling as a family of four with two young teenagers. Stayed on 33rd floor looking south with view of Empire State Building and Statue of Liberty ( tiny in the distance).The hotel was very comfortable, plenty room, nice furnishings etc-- ( how long do you really spend in your room when in New York?)We received a friendly welcome from the Bellboys, Security Staff on Ground Floor, Receptionist and Concierge.We did not use the bar or restaurant as we wanted to experience the Real New York further afield.Would strongly recommend a new Deli/Diner on 40th St between 7th + 8th Ave called Teleon -really good, clean and friendly for a quick breakfast before venturing off on a days exploring.Also ate at Great NY Noodletown, 28 1/2 Bowery Street @ Bayard St, Chinatown, great if you want to experience a REAL Chinese meal.And Lombardi's, 32 Spring St between Mott and Mulberry St in Little Italy, although a queue to get a table , worth the short wait, which was accurate as quoted - for Fabulous Pizza.

We requested a 'high floor' and were upgraded to a corner deluxe room on the 42nd floor overlooking 42nd Street and Times Square.

<Content>Wonderful hotel with very nice people These were the nicest, largest rooms that I have stayed in visiting NYC. The staff are very well trained and we were warmly greeting by the doorman who introduced himself by name. It is right in the art of the action but after a quick elevator ride you arrive at a large, safe and comfortable lobby removed from all of the hustle and bustle of Times Square. This was our first, but not last visit here. Also, this was my fifth hotel that I have stayed in during the last two weeks so I definitely have recent comparisons.

<Content>OK Arrived to find that the room we'd booked (and confirmed) was no longer available and therefore we could either have a slighly inferior room (but non-smoking as we'd requested) or the original room spec. but smoking. Nice choice i.e. none! Staff came across as disinterested - take it or leave it. Room tired with bits missing (plug for sink, shower head cover) but good view from window (Empire State Building and downtown). And, one cannot deny that the location is pretty good i.e. on 42nd Street. Manage your expectations!

<Content>Centre of NYC Returned yesterday from a 6 night stay in this Hotel. Found all the staff that we spoke to very pleasent, expected to find a certain amount of rudeness within the City, but can say that we found none of that at all. The rooms were large, clean and very comfortable. Iron and ironing board in wardrobe came in very useful, as we were in town for my the wedding of my son in Central Park, and at least I could give my blouse a onceover. I have to say if we were to return to NYC we would personally stay in a quieter part of town, not because of the hotel (if we could, we would move it nearer to Central Park), just because we live in a very rural part of England and the amount of people around Times Square came as a shock to us. There were plenty of eating places close to this hotel, a deli across the road was great for breakfast. All in all can't fault this Hotel.

<Content>Just returned from NYC and wouldn't hesitate to stay at the Hilton again!!! Our first trip to NYC and we wanted to fit as much in our 3 days as we could, this meant staying among the sites. We chose the Hilton for it's location to the theatre (went to see Phantom - amazing!!) and it's proximity to all that Times Square is about. We were not disappointed!!! From the perfect assistance with our luggage (there were 4 adults) to the speedy early check-in, the assistance from the concierge and doormen, everything was fantastic! The room was spacious enough for 4 adults, even with 2 beds, we still had a chair  ottoman, desk  chair...the only suggestions would be a dresser so we didn't have to live out of our suitcases, and an extra mirror with an outlet nearby to help the morning primping go more quickly. A small fridge and microwave would've been nice too but we managed just fine without them. Oh, and the beds!!! Sooooo comfortable!!! It's a good thing there is so much to see during the day because we may have been tempted to stay in!! We would definitely stay here again!!

<Content>great location We had a very pleasant stay at this hotel.Beautiful room. It was a large room for New York City and it had everything you needed apart from a kettle to make a cup of tea.Ask for a room higher up with a view of Empire State Building. On the other side the view is not so good because of construction work.The staff is very polite and helpful.The location is fantastic. You are on Broadway and 42nd Street, next to the subway.We would absolutely go back to this hotel.

<Content>Really very nice I was very pleasantly surprised by the Hilton Times Square. I stayed at the Hilton becuase it was the best rate I could find at a decent hotel, but I expected an impersonal feel (big chain hotel in such a touristy spot) - I couldn't have been more wrong. My room was large, airy and comfortable and was on a higher floor with a stunning view of the Empire State Building and the Hudson. The staff was pleasant, helpful and personable. Housekeeping was great (it may have been because I left tips, but they kept leaving extra toiletries and chocolates).

<Content>Good-sized rooms overlooking 42nd Street Knowing that NYC hotel rooms come in two sizes-- shoebox and matchbox-- I was pleasantly surprised to find myself the occupant of a fairly large-sized room. The decor was modern and stylish (arty prints on the walls) with new blonde wood furnishings (entertainment center, wardrobe, desk, lamp, armchair, two bedside tables) and a king-sized bed with soft white linen and a tube-shaped Asian-style extra pillow. It was even, heck-- luxurious. The clock radio/alarm clock had a jack that I could have plugged my iPod into. Wish I had known about that in advance. When I pressed the pre-set classical music button at 6:30 a.m. I got Iggy and the Stooges bashing out raw power. (Actually, not a bad wake-up song for NYC!) The coffee maker on the desk came with coffee (but, sadly, no tea). The bathroom was spotless and huge, with lots of spiffy toiletry items (would have traded the mini sewing kit for a toothbrush, though). I liked the white cotton robe. The view from my room overlooked the theaters and bustle of 42nd street, and Times Square (or the lights, mainly) could be seen between some office buildings. All this for a $120 Priceline bid ($150 with taxes). My only complaint was a broken shower pipe, which sent a jet of water onto the bathroom floor. I settled for a bath-- a better idea I decided anyway-- and notified the front desk. When I returned later that night the shower was fixed. The Times Sqaure subway hub is just down the street-- which will connect you to just about anywhere in the area. This location couldn't be more convenient to a day of NYC sightseeing. The bottom line-- this was a great stay, especially for the rate I got. I recommend this swell joint to all without any hesitation.

<Content>Marvelous Hotel This was our first visit to New York City and what a marvelous hotel from which to experience the delights of such a cosmopolitan city. The Hilton Times Sq.is welcoming,sophisticated and highly professional. The rooms are spacious,clean and well serviced. The views from our 42nd floor window surpassed expectation even after reading the reviews.So close to the hustle and bustle and life in Times Square yet an oasis of calm sophistication.We will most certainly return to this hotel.

<Content>Great position with fantastic views This was my second visit to new york. this hotel was in a superb location and we were on the 39th floor with fantastic view of empire state building from our window. we asked for a smoking room, and unlike some hotels, the room was fresh with no lingering tobacco smell. the staff were very freindly and any requests were dealt with immediately. unlike the last hotel i stayed at in the city (Milford Plaza), there was no noise what so ever - fantastic!!!! highly recommended

<Content>Beware of Pricing For the past several years I've been staying at Hilton Times Square during NY City visits. My most recent stay was in August 2005. I generally visit Manhattan about twice a year and see 3 to 4 shows during one weekend. I've been returning to this hotel because I can usually count on a decent room in a convenient location at a good price (at least by NY standards). A few weeks ago I purchased Broadway tickets for a weekend in March 2006. I intended to book a room at Hilton as usual, but found that the standard room I last paid about $187.00 for was up to $329. I've paid just over $200 there before, but never over $300. My chosen weekend is not on or near a holiday. I've been watching prices for several hotels and see that Hilton's fluctuate quite a bit. Over the past few weeks their standard room price rose to $329 and dropped to $246. I saw it go back up a few dollars to $249, but a nonrefundable price of $212 was then offered (not available before). I later did back-to-back searches and saw that the $212 offer did not come up every time. Now it doesn't come up at all. This leaves me wondering how many times I've overpaid in the past. I also think of the people who have booked at $329 without following up and seeing the price drop. My concerns have been brought to the attention of Hilton Times Square and Hilton Corporate. I've made a reservation elsewhere for March. I will also take some time from that trip to research other hotels for future visits. I have nothing bad to say about the accommodations at Hilton Times Square. I may even return someday, but not before I can be sure that I am not a victim of price gouging.

<Content>Very Accomodating! I arrived at the Hilton Times Square at 8 AM expecting to check my backs with the concierge. I was pleasantly surprised when I was allowed to check-in! My room was very comfortable and exceptionally clean. The hotel's location is very convenient to the Olympia Trails bus from Newark Airport (1 block away from stop). Inexpensive restaurants surround this hotel, and I felt comfortable walking back alone from nearby theatres late at night. Great location to access two subway stations and the 42nd street bus.

<Content>Great price, pleasant experience We booked this hotel for a Sat. night in January through PriceLine for a bid of $110. Some hotels relegate Priceline bookings to the least desirable rooms, but this hotel did not. We were in a great room on the 34th floor (above and to the right of the Mme Toussaud golden hand) with King bed (as requested). We had a delightful stay. The location is very good. Keep an eye out for the clock marking the entrance, as it is easy to miss. In the evening, a room key must be shown to the guard to gain access to the lobby elevator. We visit NYC frequently; this was the biggest standard room we've ever booked. There was an easy chair w/ottoman and side table, a large work desk with two chairs and a big closet. There wasn't much drawer space. Pillows and linens were of high quality. The bathroom was small with a shower/tub combo. and the coffee machine on the sink. We would have liked brighter lighting over the sink. Towels were fluffy, Crabtree and Evelyn personal care products. Of note, there is some sort of huge air handling unit below our room location, but we were high enough for it not to intrude. I would imagine that a few floors lower it could be a problem.

<Content>A hotel that others may be judged by. In a first class position this hotel exceeded our expectations. Ths staff were exemplary from security to front desk and the housekeeping  bar staff too.We stayed twice, once for three nights the second for four nights over back to back weekends. My son was auditioning for various colleges in studios around the area. The location really is excellent with all the theatres close by not to mention a plethora of restaurants. The bar was comfortable and they carry four Vermont beers on tap!Our room was immaculate a credit to the housekeeping department.For such a large property it was refreshing to enjoy the small hotel attention one received from all employees.We will definitely return and as hotel owners ourselves we give the Times Square Hilton top marks.You will not be dissapointed.

<Content>Great Location Don't know why some people complained about the hotel not being right on Times Square - it's on 42nd Street and takes 2 mins to reach the square - what do they want - knobs on?Good room, excellent location and friendly staff especially on the concierge desk where they could not be more helpful or cheerful. Superb choice for vacations. Only time we needed taxis was to and from airport as it was so easy to reach theatres and restaurants. Subway station right alongside too.

<Content>Great Location I have been meaning to write this review for a while - better late than never. We visited New York in April 2005. We spent a while deciding which hotel to stay in, and eventually opted for the Hilton Times Square based on the reviews on this website. We were really pleased with our choice. The rooms were exceptionally spacious, and very comfortable to relax in after a hard days sightseeing. The location was also great, with plenty of restaurants and amenities right on our doorstep. Because of our close proximity to a wide selection of bars and eateries we didn't use any of the hotels facilities so can't really comment on them. My only complaint would be that as we arrived really late, we did not get the non-smoking room we requested, or the high floor either (i heard the views are supposed to be really good). All in all a good choice for a city where space is a premium.

<Content>Excellent. Loved It!!! Our family of 4 (children 9 and 6)stayed from 30 Dec until 4 Jan. Check in was excellent and Elizabeth was extremely helpful. Although a room was available on a lower floor, we opted to come back around 5pm and received a room on 40th floor overlooking Empire State, just as requested. The rooms are extremely comfortable and with 4 large suitcases still had plenty of room to move. It is very clean and tidy as you would expect for the price. New York was very busy with New Years but when we left the hotel, never (as other reviews have said) found the footpath traffic hard to handle. This is New York. The restaurant food was excellent although a little pricey. The Concierge put us onto the Westway Diner (cnr 9th and 43rd W). Excellent open 24 hours with large selection and great price, 5-10min walk. All staff were excellent and any problems resolved quickly. We saw the ball drop from the iceroom on our floor without having to join the 1 million people in Times Square. Times Square is 1/2 a block away from hotel and only a few minutes walk. This hotel is well placed for all site seeing. We would definately spend the extra money and stay here again. Honestly, you cannot fault the place. This was a treat for our family (as it was expensive New Years) but we did not care it is worth spending the money and we would definately stay again. Thanks Hilton and New York City for a great stay and the day of light snow. By the way, we overnighted to Niagara Falls and returned to Hilton the next day. There was no charge to store our bags with Concierge(some reviews noted a fee). The hotel was happy to do this for us everytime we asked. Email us if you would like to know more. The Graham Family.

<Content>Great Hotel!!!! The perfect place to stay. We went to NYC for the first time with a 10 and 11 year old. We weren't sure how a nice hotel would receive children, but upon check in, they gave each one of our children a complimentary cd holder. The room was great. We asked for a high floor with a view of Times Square and they gladly honored our request. The bed was the most comfortable bed we have ever slept in! Everyone was very friendly. My son is a very active sleeper, so we asked for a rollaway bed. It was perfect and no extra charge! The rooms were large enough that even with the extra bed, we had plenty of room. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. It was very convenient to shows, shopping, and popular attractions. (Right next door to wax museum and a few doors down from The Lion King which we had tickets for) Applebees is in lobby area and a McDonalds is close by. Starbucks is across the street! As we checked out, the desk clerk offered the room keys to our children for keep sakes. Lots of great memories. Extremely clean....had a great time.

<Content>Great stay My wife and I recently celebrated our 40th wedding anniversary in NYC. As this was our first trip to the city, we were not sure if we made a good hotel choice. It turns out it was a great choice and we were very pleased with our 3 night stay at the Hilton Times Square. The staff was great. The room was clean and comfortable with a terrific view of the city. The hotel was ideally located. We had a wonderful time and looking forward to a future visit.

<Content>Fab Hotel Myself, partner and Child stayed here for 9 nights in Feb 2005 and loved it. It's called the times square hilton but its actually on 42nd street and not time square so it does deceive people who havent been to Ny before.Reception is situated on the 21st floor where the staff are v polite and helpful. The bedrooms are lovely and clean if a little on the small side considering the cost. The downside of our stay here was that when we were here there was work going on outside our hotel at 7 in the morning and it was v noisy. I know the hotel cant be blamed on this however they didnt even warn us of this and you would think that as we were staying on the 35th floor that we wouldnt be able to hear it, but we could.Also, the day we checked out the only place we could leave our luggage was on the ground floor with the concierge who will only mind your luggage for a fee but doesnt say how much. i think this is poor show after paying a v high price to stay there.

<Content>Rooms large - crowded streets Stayed here for three nights arriving on the 26th December. Rooms are large by NYC standards and hotel was very comfortable. Problems with check-in - like previous reviewer we booked an non-smoking room with two beds (in fact we paid a little more to be guaranteed this!) However, as has happened before with Hilton, this room was not available again. We protested and eventually were offered a smoking room with two beds. We asked to see it before we agreed and found it to be reasonably odour free. At check-in George was pleasant and helpful and offered us complimentary breakfast for our inconvenience. This was nice but not worth the money if we had to pay extra for it. The other big fault of the hotel was it's location. It's about two blocks from time square but right next to Madame Tusauds and the subway. Each time you exited the hotel you were shoulder to shoulder with people and queues. To travel a block could take 20 minute!!My advise would be to stay a litte away from Time Square for a little more comfort and peace and quite.

<Content>Just Okay for New Years I feel pressured to give a really good review based on the other reviews for the hotel, but I would just rate this hotel as okay.We stayed there for New Years and I thought it would be right near Times Square b/c of its name but it was a good distance away.If you want to go to NYC for New Years and stay with a Hilton brand, I would stay at Double Tree next time as advice.The worst part about the trip was at check-in because we booked 2 double beds and they said I was booked for a king room. When I explained that this room was booked awhile ago and that we requested 2 double beds, the front desk clerk, Valerie was very rude. NOT a good first impression! She said that the only room they had which I didnt even request wasnt available to check into yet so she said she would call our cell phone when it was ready. When we did come back to the hotel when the room was ready, we were checked in by Alexsander, who was a lot nicer and made it all the better to be there.The first impression of the room was average.The view of 42nd was nice. The crisp white bedding looked nice and felt soft but the mattress was uncomfortable. I was suprised the room did not have a safe and the coffee maker was in the bathroom, about 2 feet from the toilet! The room is decorated a very simple,contemporary look.For New Years Eve, we thought we could just leave the room about 6pm and walk the 2 blocks to times square for the countdown but we were in for a nice suprise. When we left the room we were instructed to walk all the way down to 49th `and then over to get to times square.That walk doesnt sound too far but it feels like forever when you are pushing shoulder to shoulder with thousands of other people on the streets. So after we did the walk through all the crowds and got to times square we were too far away to really see much. So leaving the hotel those 6 hours early did us no justice. Guests of ours left the room at 8 and had to walk all the way down to 57th to get over and of course they just came all the way back to the hotel b/c they were so far away from anything. If you want to see the ball drop during New Years, I would suggest staying in a hotel RIGHT THERE or head over to times square early in the afternoon. But I do not see why anyone would stand outside in that kind of weather all day long for a good view. We did it for 6 hours and I dont know how we survived!

<Content>Best vacation ever-Yes New York, New York My wife,son and I visited Dec. 21 to 23. The trip was fabulous. The hotel was in a GREAT location. The hotel staff was friendly, professional, mannerly and very accommodating. Our room was on the 42nd floor and was open and very comfortable. We were a little suprised at how nice the people of New York are. We made many friends and saw many smiling faces, even though we were there when the MTA workers were on strike. There are plenty of places to eat very near the hotel and plenty things to do and see within walking distance. Bryant Park was nice. Subway stations are practically at your front door. The price of the hotel was a wee bit high but for our first trip to the Big Apple, we splurged. We would definitely stay here again. Happy Campers from Wilmington, NC

<Content>Fabulous experience at the Hilton My wife and I had the pleasure of staying at the Times Square Hilton for 2 nights this December. From the moment you enter the lobby on the 21st floor you forget about the hustle and the bustle outside, you get the feeling of being in a smaller boutique hotel. The staff was by far the friendliest and most accommodating of the many midtown Manhattan hotels we have stayed in. In particular Ernest at the front desk and Franklin at the Concierge. We send a special thank you and warm holiday greetings to you both. The room was extremely clean and well kept and oh! that spectacular bed with the down pillows hard to get out of in the morning. We have already recommended this hotel to our friends and family that travel to Manhattan. We will be returning to the Hilton Times Square on our future trips to New York, and by the way the room had a beautiful view to boot

<Content>Luxurious, Accomodating - slightly inconvenient It's a Hilton - so you expect luxury...and that's what you get...Robes, lotions, sound soothing CD/Radio/Clock, chocolates on the pillow, pillow-top mattresses - very nice. You can read all this stuff in their own description.Aside from the expected luxuries, here's what I didn't like: the lobby was on the 14th floor and there were only two (excrutiatingly slow) elevators up/down from there. Then you had to walk across the lobby to another bank of (six high speed) elevators up to the rooms. This hotel has a passageway that opens out onto 42nd Street as well as the street behind so all that is on the street level is a long hallway with 2 elevators up - as well as a bag room.It's staffed well and they'll ask to see your room keys to access the lobby after hours. During the daytime it didn't seem to matter if you had a key or not, but then again, we don't look like the thug variety.Also, upon check-in - they had no rooms ready. Now granted, it was about 11am and we were pretty early, but the front desk said they'd call us when our room was ready. We never did receive that call. We ended up back at the hotel around 5pm and checked in further without incident.They honored my request for a high room (42nd floor) facing 42nd St. So that was very nice. The staff, especially the porters at street level, were extremely friendly.Overall a pleasant stay - especially since it was free - using HHonors points.

<Content>Great Stay Stayed here with my girfriend (now fiancee) for three nights at the end of November, paid just over 拢1,000 for the privilege.We requsted a high-floor room and were given a room on the 32nd floor (rooms are on floors 26 thru 42) so wasn't the highest but the view wasn't bad at all.The room wasn't far from the elevators and out of the window, towards the bottom of the building, several floors down, were two large aircon units. As a result, there was some noise, especially when the second AC unit was switched on for one night of our stay. That said, the noise from the AC and the elevators was a constant, low pitch dull rumble that couldn't really be heard during the day with the TV on and whilst it was very noticible at night we were suprised that it did not keep us awake at all.The room was very clean and well maintained, the large bed was very comfortable. Nice large robes, lots of towels. Desk with two chairs and a very comfy armchair to relax in.On the whole, the staff were very pleasant and helpful. On the day we got engaged, the concierge who arranged to send up champagne to our room added a large plate of complimentary chcolates. We were able to check in early (11am) and check out late (2pm) and left our luggage until 5pm in their storage.Only missives - the bar staff are discourteous, slow and incompetent. Not *great* value IMO although seemed on a par with other hotels we looked at and the porters seemed to have a 'tip' conspiracy going on (when we left, one porter retrieved our luggage from storage, pushed it to the door and then passed it on to another porter who put the bags in the car!).Only other issue, wasn't really the hotel's fault: the location, whilst very convenient in how central it was, it was a much busier location than we imagined - almost too busy when returning from a tiring day sight-seeing.But, these minuses far outweigh the plusses and I would highly recommend this hotel if you don't mind the bustling crowds immediately outside.

<Content>Very Good, but soft beds Overall, a very nice hotel with wonderful service. The only issue I had was with the soft beds, which are much softer than I am used to. Specifically, it was soft not because of the pillow top covering that they place on top of the mattress, but because of the underlying soft mattress, which gave minimal support.

<Content>Wonderful Stay we spent a long weekend at this hotel 11Nov - 14 Nov from check in to check out could not fault anything.Front desk was lovely we had a large room on 36 floor overlooking 42nd Street. Lifts were fast . Security very good hotel room key checked each time entered hotel. Front desk sent me a lovely big basket of fruit for my birthday.Bar staff were freindly and very generous on measures of drink compared to some of the bars we went in New York. Didnt eat in hotel. location of hotel was really great.All in all a really enjoyable stay.

<Content>Pretty Good! My husband and I have just returned from a 5 night stay at the Hilton Times Square. We really had a great stay there.We had a south facing room on the 42nd floor with great views of the city and the Hudson. The room was big and the bed was enormous and very very comfortable. As a Hilton gold card holder we had breakfast for free - I don't think we would have eaten there otherwise as it was expensive (approx $23 per person)! but fresh and tasty if you like bagels, Danish pastries and crispy crispy Canadian bacon. Despite it being free we still ate out for 2 of the mornings just to experience the New York Deli breakfast (chose any Deli in the City and enjoy your food on plastic plates with plastic cutlery - it doesn't spoil the taste at all)! We didn't drink or eat at any other time in the hotel but the bar and restaurant did seem popular with other guests.The staff were very helpful and courteous - we really don't have a bad word to say about any of them. Security at the hotel is pretty good and they do ask to see your hotel key before letting you in the lift to the lobby.We used the gym most mornings - its small but has enough of a selection for both cardio and weights workouts.The location of the hotel is very good - we walked everywhere from there, but if you prefer not to walk, the subway is right on 42nd and you can always flag down a mad taxi driver (they drive like maniacs there)!!All in all a good dependable hotel - look out for cheap deals for it!

<Content>Great location, friendly staff, updated room! This hotel's location and concierge are excellent, and our room was very recently redecorated -- modern, clean and even with down comforters and pillows. A real pleasure!

<Content>what a great hotel We stayed at the Hilton Times Square for our honeymoon - and what a great hotel and location. It is right in the centre of Times Square and the views from the hotel rooms are amazing. We were upgraded to an executive room and received complementary champagne, wine, and truffles because we were on our honeymoon.The staff within the hotel are friendly and helpful. Rooms were a good size and were cleaned and laundered every day. This hotel provides the perfect location for exploring New York city and i would definately stay here again the next time we are in New York.

<Content>Lovely hotel, fantastic location We have just returned from a 4 night stay in the Hilton Times Square in New York. Our room was on the 42nd floor, overlooking Times Square and the Hudson River - a fantastic view by day, even better at night.This was our 2nd stay in this hotel, in a room with 2 double beds (one for my 15 year old daughter). The rooms are spacious and very clean and comfortable. The staff are very friendly and helpful, and the doormen checking your keys as you go in make you feel secure. The location is brilliant - on 42nd Street, right on the edge of Times Square, within walking distance of many of New York's sights and shopping experiences, and with easy access to the subway for trips further afield.We didn't eat in the hotel, but there are so many places nearby that it's not a problem. Applebees next door is ideal for breakfast. My daughter loved Planet Hollywood, and Roxy's in Time Square is excellent for an authentic deli experience - I've never seen sandwiches like them (next time we'll share) and the cheesecake is delicious! All in all, a fantastic city, holiday and hotel. We will definitely go back to New York and to the Hilton Times Square.

<Content>Fantastic What a fantastic location. This was our first time to New York. We had 5 nights in the hotel. Our room was on the 39th floor. It had great views of the Empire State Building and the Hudson River. We did face out onto the construction work, but were not woken by the noise, and you couldnt really hear it during the day. Rooms had everything in you would expect from Hilton and were of a good size. We had breakfast included in our rate. It was very nice but if you had to pay for it dont bother just go to a Deli outside, there are thousands of them. Would definatly stay again.....

<Content>Excellent Location The hotel is superbly located within the heart of Times Square. Given that the rooms area all above the 25th floor noise is kept to a minimum. We had a room facing uptown on the 38th floor and the view was amazing. The rooms themselves are a good size and are comfortable and clean. We found the buffet breakfast limited in its range and unless you have pre paid for breakfast (approx $18) I think that you can do better out of the hotel.The selling point for us was the location of the hotel. The hotel was within walking distance of all the main attrractions and if you needed to go further a field the Port Authority, Grand Central and subway were all close at hand. Even the boat trip around New York was only a 15 minute walk away.The concierge and reception staff were helpful and can give you a free map of the city. As expected the mini bar was expensive and I was aware of a few people that had been charged with items that they had not taken so it is worth checking your bill on check out. The hotel also provides a free luggage storage facility which proved useful on the last day.I found the issue of expected tipping somewhat strange. With the odd exception the service was no better and at times worse than I would expect in the UK. Certainly within the hotel the staff at breakfast were very quick to give you the bill for breakfast, which had already been pre-paid, just so that I could add the tip for pouring me a glass of orange juice. In the restaurants your bill was accompanied by a leaflet explaining the 15-20% rule, although one restaurant just added the service charge. With it being our first time to New York the one thing that did catch us out were the taxes. For our 3 nights the tax added to the bill came to $162 (approx 14%), although our booking mentioned taxes no mention was given as to how much it would be.In short the hotel suited our needs i.e. clean, comfortable and ideally located and I would certainly recommend it.

<Content>Fantastic View! We stayed at the Hilton Times Square in August. We had a room on the 37th floor, with an amazing view. A city view to the front, and a view of the Hudson river to the left.It was our first trip to New York, and we had a fantastic time. The location was great, right on 42nd street in Times Square. We were close to shops, the theatres, the empire state building, and lots of restaurants. The room was lovely, quite spacious with comfortable beds. The service was also excellent.We went on the open top bus tours, which were good, and we got to see everything. On the downside, the traffic is terrible, so the bus takes a long time to get anywhere! Next time we will use the subway!Also did the 3 hour boat trip, which went all around Manhattan. This was good, but too long. Maybe the 1 1/2 hour trip would have been better.All in all I would stay at the Hilton Times Square again.

<Content>Good place if you know some tips My friend and I stayed at this hotel for 9 nights during New York Fashion Week. It's a great location, and although this is not my favorite area in New York City, I must say it is very close to the Tents at Bryant Park if you go there for Fashion Week ! We asked for a high floor room and got hardly any noise from the street on this 39th floor room. The food is a bit poor in the room service menu and very expensive but the wifi connection is h锚lpfus and we have used the room service (what else can yopu do when you are very busy working, writing articles, sometimes at night time ? So we got fed up and poor becquse of the prices but we had some rest which is a miracle when you are a fasion writer attending New York Fashion Week !The concierge was unable to find a town car with a chauffeur for us, he said the reason for this was the UN summit... I believe him but still I found the bellman most of the time efficient with taxis and town cars...The bellman got us a regular small fridge to store drinks we could buy from surrounding shops to avoid buying high price drinks from the fridge in the room. I am glad that he offered this the minute we arrived, but in case he does not, just ask him...I am still looking for the ideal hotel to attend Fashion Week, this one is best for location, the staff can be quite helpful, but still, I would go back there, just in case I don't find a more boutique hotel in the neighbourhood !

<Content>Not bad Just stayed one night at Hilton Times Square. The rooms are nice, comfortable bed etc. However, I would like to warn you that the hotel is located in one of the busiest street of NY, so it is quite noisy. In addition, I think the breakfast buffet is below 4 star standards and the service (especially concierge) could be better.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel and Location! I stayed at this hotel with my sister and it was fantastic.The staff were really helpful and friendly. We arrived before the check in time and were checked in within 5 minutes. After reading the reviews on the construction work on 41st street I asked for a room on one of the high levels facing 42nd street. We were given a room on the 38th floor and the view was great! We hardly heard any noise at night despite the street being so busy.We had booked the standard room and I was very surprised at how spacious it was from previous comments on the room sizes in New York. The room was the size you would expect from a 4 star hotel.The hotel is at a great location as everything is on your doorstep and within walking distance. The concierge provide you with maps and details of tours available. I would stay here again!

<Content>Enjoyed the Hilton We had a great stay at the Hilton in Times Square and will be going again in December. The room was very clean and the bed was very comfortable. I requested a room on a high floor facing 42nd street, having been prompted by earlier reviewers. It was quiet and the location is excellent. The reception staff were also very pleasant.

<Content>A great experience!!! We stayed at this hotel from the 10th to the 13th of August and had a great time! We had stayed at the Ritz Carlton in Battery Park for the first half of our trip and I found this hotel to be quite comparable!After reading many reviews on this site we did ask for a room that wasn't facing the construction and for something above the 30th floor, on the 35th floor we didn't hear a thing from outside! The rooms were clean and spacious in the deluxe catagory and we were happy with the turn down service every night!The continental breakfast was good in the morning, thank goodness it was free with Hhonors points though cause I wouldn't have paid $36.00 american for two people to eat breakfast!It is in a great location, although times square was a bit busy for me! There is lots of resturants available just outside the door and two movie theatres! I would reccomend this hotel for families as it is a great location, and the restaurants all around are family oriented and reasonably priced (applebee's, chevy's).A great overall experience, I would recommend to anyone!!

<Content>Excellent Hotel, Great Location We were there 8/19 - 8/22. Check in was extremely smooth and we were given a room on the 42nd floor facing north. Valet parking and bellhop was very efficient. Quality of the room was good and the room was clean. Cannot beat the location. Saw Chitty which is right across the street. I highly recommend to anyone looking to take kids to a broadway show. My 4  7 year old were kept engaged throughout the show and really enjoyed it.

<Content>Unbeatable location, great views We stayed at the Hilton Times Square from August 6th until August 12th, as first timers in NYC we found this hotel to be a perfect spot for tourists. The rooms were large and clean and there was no problem when we asked to be relocated to the 41st floor. We had breakfast at Strombollis across the street, do visit the Creamery opposite the hotel, the ice cream is fab and the theatre hosting Chitty was right next door - this is a fantastic show. One final good point with regard to the hotel is its bar, it was atmospheric, candle lit at night and a nice way to finish the evening.

<Content>Great View, Large Room, Clean, What Else Can You Ask For I stayed on a Saturday night and couldn't ask for more with a room. It was very large and clean. My room was a standard, with a king size bed. There was enough room at least one cot. The view was just spectacular, it over looked the southern part of New York, could even see the Hudson River. The linens were really nice and the bed seemed new, more fluffy than some of the hotels.The Check In was smooth. I only had a slight problem, I wanted to put my water in the mini bar fridge so I took out their two of their bottles, I then saw on my bill I was charged for two bottles. I was told there is a sensor in the mini bar. So whatever you do don't take anything out of the fridge. The front desk understood and I wasn't charged but it's best to avoid any interaction with the minibar.They give Neutrogena and Crabtree and Evelyn toiletries which are a plus.I stayed on Saturday night so I didn't hear any noise from the construction which probably goes on during the week so it would be best to check about that if you are planning a weekday stay. They have 24 hour bell hops that watch all the guests, come in and out. The location as mentioned in other reviews is really great.

<Content>Great Location - Good Place To Stay I just returned from 3 days in NYC. THe Hilton was clean and nice and the staff was most helpful. The Conceirge is kind and knowledgable. The Hotel is located in a great place. Not far from the subway, broadway,  all the sights and sounds of what makes NYC a great place to be and visit. The security measures of the Hotel were also reassuring and you have to show your room key to gain access to the elevator that takes you to the lobby, which means that not anyone can just enter the hotel and stroll around. We were on the 31st floor which gave us a great view of the City and it was very quiet.I am a big fan of the Hilton brand name and particularly love the Hilton's buffet breakfast. Although the buffet was adequate it was not on par with the ones served at the HIlton in Chicago or Washington D.C. Would definitely stay there again!

<Content>ok, not great, Avalon better We got this cheap (by NY standards) on Priceline, name your own price $125.00. Rooms pretty small, cramped even. Ok location. Everything was a walk or a bus ride. TIP- Get the all day metro pass for $7. Bus is near by. This is not what one would expect for a 4 star or Hilton. Room service was quick and the food good. Easy to find off the highway and parking was a bit more expensive then other hotels. Staff friendly but not great. when we came back to NY we stayed at the Avalon which was a mansion compared to this room!!

<Content>Awesome We stayed in this hotel from July 2nd thru the 5th. It was incredible. Stayed on the 40th floor thanks to everyone's advice. We overlooked Times Square. The views from the room were incredible. The bed, WOW. I wanted to take that bed home with me. The room was HUGE. The service was great. Room was clean and very spacious. Would stay here again and recommend it as well.

<Content>Fantastic time in Times Square!!! (July 3-5, 2005) My wife is originally from Long Island and wasn't sure what to expect. When we arrived at the hotel around 12:30PM on July 3rd we were greeted by a smiling faces that were more than willing to help us. She was pleasant and immediately noticed that I was a Hilton Honors Gold Card holder and asked if there was anything additional the she could do for us, including free breakfast during our stay, which we gladly accepted.When we went to our room and wasn't happy with the view due to construction below, we went back to the reception desk and asked to be moved to a different location and it was done immediately and without question....THANK YOU HILTON!!! We were placed on the 42nd floor from the 29th floor and ended with a spectacular view of the surrounding bldgs and the Hudson River, especially at night.We immediately went to the TCKTS booth and got ticket for All Shook Up and it was fantastic...I strongly suggest it for anyone that likes elvis music but doesn't want to see Elvis impersonators. The music was great and the comedy during the show was excellent....5 STARS!!!!We had friends coming in from LI to visit us in the city and had to find a place to eat for the night. Several places were suggested by the staff (concierce had left for the night) and the operator even went out of her way to call several restaurants for us to see if they had a spot open for us. We ended up going to the Jeckyl  Hyde Clud near Central Park and had a great time!!!!The breakfast buffet in the morning was more than sufficient for the two of us and we were always greeted with smiles and graciousness by the host. The food was delicious with no complaints, we did not eat there any other meals.The hotel was right on next door to The Lion King and 1/2 block from 42nd  Broadway...right next to everything. There's even a McDonalds right next door for those with cheaper tastes and kids that want that Happy Meal. It's also only a 5 or 10 min walk to watch Good Morning America from the front door of the hotel.I would definetely stay here again and again!!!

<Content>Quite noisy We stayed at the Hilton in July. We first had a room on 42nd floor just beside the elevators, which was extremely noisy so we had to change rooms. First the reception staff said that there are only rooms available on lower floors. After telling them that I am a Hilton Gold Member they had one room left on the 40th floor so we changed rooms at 11 p.m. This room was also facing a construction site which was again very noisy beginning with work at about 7 a.m., but view was great with Empire State Building and Hudson River. First we were told that we can keep the room with no charge until 2 p.m., then we could keep the room even until 3 p.m, which was very good! The Times Square area is very crowded so if you are looking for a more quiet place you better look after any other hotel.

<Content>Hilton very average Stayed at the Hilton 7/5-7/8. We reserved a deluxe room because we know rooms in NYC are small to begin with. It was as small as your local Holiday Inn. The beds were very comfy but SMALL. We reserved two queen beds for our family of four. The beds are doubles, not queen-sized. Our two children, ages 7 and 9 were pushing each other off the beds. My husband and I were squished to say the least. The room was clean. NY City as a whole is pricey so for $329 plus tax, you decide. As far as security, there were security guards present before you go up to the lobby but we were NEVER once asked to show our room key or anything else for that matter. Makes you wonder.. We were in the City the day of the London bombings, you would have thought security would have been tighter. You have to take another elevator up to your room. The guard was there however we were never asked for ID or room keys.We had a room on a high floor. We had a view of 42nd street but it wasn't worth paying the city-view additional price. When we travel we always get ocean front rooms, or rooms with a view. In this case, it was a waste of money. We did look out the window on the 41st street side by the elevators. That view was worse. There is also construction going on on 41st street. The front desk told us that the construction noise begins at 6:30A to 7A each day so beware unless you are an early riser.If you are looking to purchase NY sweatshirts all the shops we went into they were $32.99  $34.99. We found a shop called R.A.G. at 1501 Broadway between 43rd and 44th. The same sweatshirts as all the other shops and they were $20. They also had some the other stores didn't have. Nice quality T-shirts for $10. Worth going to!As we said we found the hotel very average so we will probably try a different hotel next time around.

<Content>Definitely will stay here again. Loved it! This was my first time in NY. I had read mixed reviews about the Hilton Times Square and knew to ask for a room high up and not next to the gym as I read it was very noisy.The check-in was very smooth, the room was lovely. I even requested to change a room (because it was adjoining) and they agreed, but liked the initial room they gave us so we changed back.The room was very clean, modern and spacious. We had a lovely view of 42nd Street.We stayed for 4 days and the service was impeccable. All the staff (from the reception, concierge and doormen) were so friendly, kind and helpful. The security staff were so helpful.We were travelling with a small child and the staff were so accomodating and efficient.We will definitely be staying at the Hilton Times Square next time we go to NYC.Thank You Hilton Staff! You were fantastic!

<Content>Location is a plus Times Square is the best place to stay so this Hotel is rated based on that, for the most part. For the full paid price I paid, as I stayed there on business, it was just average. For in excess of $300 there should be more amenities, especially for a gold Hilton member. The door men were just ok and seemed to take too long to get transportation. When you are needing to get to a meeting, time is of the essence.

<Content>Not bad, better choices nearby Not a bad hotel. About on par with most Hilton and Hilton Garden Inns. I don't think it's worth the price, regardless of location. I was a bit disappointed that there are no room upgrades available, particularly since I'm eligible. Bar is nice. Go for as high a floor as possible, the views are the best feature. But for the money, try the Westin across the street, or better yet, try the Waldorf Astoria, which I research to be cheaper.

<Content>Great Hotel! My husband and I just returned from NYC. We stayed at the Hilton Times Square from June 17-20. Great location is all I can say. Rooms on the pricey side but that's to be expected due to the location. We live near San Francisco so we are used to paying $$. Coffee maker and robes are nice touches and the bed was extremely comfortable. Walking distance to everything, subway station is only a few steps. We arrived on a Friday and were able to enjoy a happy hour at the Times Square Brewery - only steps from this hotel. Pints were 1/2 off so two beers were less than 10 bucks. Yes, there is construction but request a room (in advance) facing the 42nd street side. The cabs drop you off on the construction side and then there's the doorman, security guard and the luggage guys. Super nice! They were helpful in explaining where everything was located. It's weird but from there you have to take the elevator to the 22nd Floor - that's where the lobby and front desk is located. Not crowded at all. There is also a nice bar but from what I've read - very expensive. We didn't eat or drink at the hotel - only because there are sooo many nice eating places and bars around the city. We were really here for location, bed, hot shower (plus my hilton points). At night after seeing a show, or going to a bar - you will see a few riff raff hanging around on the streets but that's too be expected once again because this is a tourist area and like any other big city - watch your purse and wallet. We felt very safe and realize why they have the lobby on another floor - it's because everyone is screened by the security guard and doormen, then HE presses your up button to go to the lobby. There you'll find really only hotel guests - not just people milling around like other hotels. Plus, there's another security guard by the elevators. All in all, a nice conmfortable hotel close to many attractions. Oh, ask about the TKTS place (walking distance from Hilton Times Square) for discount tickets to same day broadway shows. We saw a show for 50% off the rake rate. We stood in line on that Friday we arrived (the window opened at 3 p.m.) and there was a line starting at 1 p.m.!! My husband didn't want to wait in that long line but was glad we did because we got 2 tickets for 100 bucks versus over a hundred - each. They only take CASH so hit the ATM before you go.

<Content>Get on the quiet side of Hilton Just returned from the Hilton and a Broadway weekend..(4 musicals in 3 days!) This was our first time staying at Hilton Times Square. To those of you who are going within the next few months be warned of the construction on 41st street. The noise is deafening and it starts early. We were put in a room right above it all. When we called to change rooms we were told that there was nothing available except a handicapped room. This really surprised us as we were there at 2:30 in the afternoon on a Thursday but we grabbed the room and the difference was like night and day. Even though the room faced 42nd street, you would be hard pressed to hear anything and the view was great. From then on it was peace and quiet.The room was clean and a good size, the bed was ok. Because it was a handicapped room there was no large closet and only a small sink in the bathroom but we were only there for the weekend so it was no big deal.The elevators were great, very fast in and out and yes everyone is right, this hotel is in the middle of everything. We had vouchers for breakfast but their so called restaurant is just a continuation of the bar area and was very noisy. The food (we had the breakfast buffet) was just ok. There are much better little cafes (more reasonable too) within a 2 block area of the hotel. We also had room service one night...2 bad hamburgers and fries 1 coke鈥? $60.00. If you are big into room service stick with the Marriott Marquis. The staff was very friendly....Franklin, the concierge is wonderful and will help you with anything you need. There seemed to be quite a few business people staying there and we saw no children during our stay. Oh yes, they also have a small workout room that seems sufficient. We love Broadway and we love New York and we go often. All in all the Hilton did not disappoint us.

<Content>Location, Location, Location I'm giving this a three-star rating based exclusively on the hotel itself - not the location. If you factor in the location, it is raised to a four-star rating.The room was nice - had an adjoining door which I'm not a big fan of - I could hear people talking and laughing loudly in the next room. Fortunately, it didn't last through the night. The room was clean and the bed was very comfortable. I thought the common areas (hall, elevator) where a little unkept - but as long as the room was nice, I consider that less important. Ice was available on my floor, however there was not an ice container in my room. I didn't bother to call for one - and bought bottled water at a nearby shop. My room (on the 29th floor) had a nice view of 42nd Street, very good air conditioning, and was a very nice size.It was a little tricky finding the entrance to this hotel from 42nd Street - it's a narrow entry - very low-key - to an entrance that takes you to two elevators that go up to the lobby on the 21st Floor of the building. The front desk staff were very nice and welcoming. As a Hilton Honors member, I also had a welcome letter upon my arrival.The value was average for NYC standards - I've paid a little less for a better room - but then again, those rooms weren't in the heart of the Theatre District and Times Square.

<Content>Location Location! For first time travellers to New York there is no better location. Staying in Midtown means everything is easily within reach, the subway station is only a minute away, with cinemas, numerous restaurants, broadway shows all within walking distance. The hotel itself is suited to both the business and lesiure traveller. The rooms are a fantastic size and are very clean and comfortable. The bathroom was great although on my previous visit was a little dated. The service is top notch and the views are great. The cost of staying at this hotel is very expensive (as is all of New York) however for all the benefits of staying in such a great location, I keep going back. If you require a fridge please email or ring ahead and request one, I sent through the day before and they send me about 4 confirmation emails from various departments to ensure that my request was fufilled. Now that is service. I have not tried the food in the hotel and really with so many good restaurants so close by why would you pay hotel inflated prices to eat there is beyond me. There is no need for breakfast as there is a place across the road (Pax Food) that's great for breakfast and has salads, sandwiches  pizza for lunch. Highly recommended

<Content>FANTASTIC HOTEL The Hilton Times Square is fantastic. Stayed there in April with our 1 year old son. The staff were helpful and friendly and could not do enough for us. Ten minutes after arriving in our room, the cot (crib) was delivered, completely made up. The room was spacious with a king size bed and the housekeeeping was second to none. Would not hesitate to recommend this excellent hotel. The location is unbelievable and the subway station is very close by.

<Content>An excellent choice in New York At the risk of repeating what many others have already said, we had an excellent stay here. The rooms were large, clean and comfortable and the bathrooms spotless. The staff couldn't have been more helpful especially the concierges and we met with no negative reaction whatsoever when we asked to check in early at 12.30pm. With two teenagers in our party, the location was superb and felt safe even at night, and my partner was over the moon at being right opposite BB King's club. We would, and already have, recommended it without any hesitation.

<Content>Great location, but . . . We stayed at Hilton Times Square April 25-28, 2005. We arrived at 11:30 and they graciously let us check in early. However, in my reservation I had requested a high floor with a view away from an elevator. They gave us floor 23 (lowest floor) and put us next to the fitness room. The fitness room hours are 5AM-10PM. At 5AM in the morning we were awoken by a BANG BANG BANG -- the exercise equipment in use. We didn't notice first morning since we had set alarm to get up early to catch Ferry to Ellis Island, but next morning woke us up at 5AM. We called front desk and complained and the girl said she would talk to the manager about moving us and get back to us. No one ever got back to us. We paid top dollar (didn't get through Priceline but through hotel's website) and felt cheated. Otherwise, hotel is in GREAT location -- can't be beat. All hotel employees, with the exception of that one front desk employee, were extremely helpful and polite. Would recommend the hotel, but suggest if they put you in room 2308 next to fitness room, request to be moved immediately unless you're an early riser.

<Content>New Year's Eve at the Hilton My son and I spent five nights at the Hilton Times Square. What a terrific location, especially being that close to Times Square on New Year's Eve. The view of the Empire State Building was fantastic. The rooms were quiet and very comfortable. We'd definitely stay there again.Everything about the staff and service was excellent. I also ended up getting bronchitis and the concierge immediately found me a doctor. I appreciated being able to know where to go for medical help, especially in such a large city like New York.

<Content>Clean and comfortable Very clean and comfortable. It was not quite the trip that I planned, but the business center was a life saver. Since it was a pleasure trip, I didn't bring my laptop. With the PC in the business center and Logmein, I was able to get everything done. The rooms were immaculate and the food was great. I highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Times Square Hilton - Bang On! The Times Square Hilton is an excellent base to explore and shop in New York City. It's location realistically could not be better, not only are you right in the heart of the Times Square district but at each end of the block there are subway stations to take you just about anywhere in Manhattan.The staff in the hotel (particularly the security staff) are possibly the friendliest hotel staff I have ever encountered and special praise should be given to Umar (security), Raymond (security), Henri (doorman) and Ernest (reception) as these in particular really helped make us feel welcome and valued, which is nice.Around the hotel there is a plethora of chain and tourist trap restaurants (selling decent enough food but at a price), but if you venture west towards eight and ninth avenues you will find some excellent, great value restaurants and diners.If you plan to go to New York City you must consider this hotel.

<Content>Fantastic time at the Hilton Times Square! We stayed at the Hilton Times Square from March 25-29th 2005. Location wise, it cannot be beaten. Right on 42nd street, 100 metres from Times Square. Port Authority Bus Terminal at the rear, is where the Buses leave for the Outlets - Jersey Gardens and Woodbury Common. Subway stops within 50 metres of the door. Staff were very helpful and courteous. King size room was a great size, well kept and well equipped. Stayed on the 42nd Floor with fantastic views of the Empire State Building and the Hudson River. My girlfriend has already booked next years shopping trip and is saying there! Would not stay anywhere else in NYC.

<Content>Excellent Location Just came back from an amazing trip to NYC. Stayed a full week at the Hilton and really enjoyed every minute. The hotel is not 5 star luxury but it is still at a high standard, the rooms are very spacious and the location is perfect. The breakfast is also worth including in your package. The views from the hotel are amazing-try and request a high room at check in. I would definitely reccommend this hotel for every type of traveller. The staff were always very helpful and we were not charged for a late check out. I would definitely stay at this hotel the next time I am in NYC.

<Content>Great time in Hilton Times Square Just returned from fab trip to N.Y. on the 6/4/05. Stayed with my teenage son at this great hotel.After a tiring journey found that tour operator had messed up booking and not booked upgraded room. Receptionist at Hilton went out of her way to find available upgraded room we had requested. Room was on 39th floor with great view of Empire State Building. Very comfortable beds and good sized room, and hard to get out of in the morningStaff very welcoming and friendly especially Raymond from security. Entrance from 42nd Street easy to see, lobby larger than we expected, and many members of staff around especially in the evening. Next to hotel there are cinemas, restaurants and Madame Tussauds. Hotel located near Broadway and only seconds away from Times Square.At end of trip found it difficult to leave!! Would certainly recommend hotel to anyone thinking of staying in NY.

<Content>Spacious, with a great view We stayed here as a 'reward', earned with the Hilton Honors American Express, and found the rooms spacious, particularly for New York. The view was amazing, of the city and the Hudson River. The Lobby was bright and sophisticated, once you took the elevator to get to it on the 34th floor. The location can't be beat for theater, and was close to the subway and Port Authority. The nicest stay in New York I've had in a while.

<Content>Fabulous stay at the Hilton Times Square After reading a few of the negative reviews of this hotel, I must admit I was a little skeptical. However, my stay at the Hilton Times Square March 25-27 was nothing short of fantastic! We arrived an hour or two before check-in time, and they put us in a room right away, on the 32nd floor. While our window did not overlook Times Square, it had a sweeping view of the Hudson River on the right, and a gorgeous view of the Empire State Building at night. We could even see the Statue of Liberty straight ahead! The room was immaculate and had so much room, even more room than some of the hotels in the South! The bed was comfortable and the bathroom towels were big and soft. The hotel staff downstairs in the bottom floor were always nice no matter what time we got in at night. Even the bartenders at the bar in the lobby were very friendly. I've been to New York three times in the past three years and this was the best stay I've had. I'll definitely be staying there when I return!

<Content>Fantastic Hotel Just returned from our holiday in NY, stayed at the Hilton Times Square from 31/3 to 5/4. Can't praise it enough, everything was perfect. Room on 40th floor overlooking Hudson and 42nd St, very quiet. Big room with two double beds plenty of space for us, just as a hotel should be.Late check out as we had a late flight, and then baggage looked after for us while we went to eat and they had a taxi waiting for us as requested to take us to JFK. All staff really polite and helpful. Also in a great position for travelling to all areas, and loads of restaurants within walking distance.

<Content>Great hotel Stayed here from the 28th of March to the 2nd April 05. Had a fantastic time, and didn't want to leave. All the staff were friendly and helpful. The room was large with two queen sized beds. Our room was on the 40th floor with views over Times Square and the Hudson River (Couldn't have been better).My only issue was with the price of the room service, it is very expensive. But with Appleberrys restaurant directly below the hotel, who needs room service anyway. If you do stay at this hotel, then cross the street and but a sandwich from the PAX deli, they are faboulous!!!Have a great time, and I may see you there as I will definatly be going back *********

<Content>Fantastic Stay! My mother and I stayed at the Hilton for 9 nights 15-24 March 05 and had a fantastic stay. I mentioned to the lady at the front desk that this was my first time in New York and she got us a lovely room on the 37th floor overlooking 42nd street, with views of the Hudson. I read alot of reviews and spent alot of time deciding which hotel to book and I am definately glad I chose the Hilton and spent a bit more because I do believe this helped in making my trip to NY fantastic and memorable. I was prepared for a small room (by most NY hotel reviews) but I was pleasantly surprised to find that the room was spacious, with lots of room to move around. Every staff member I encountered was friendly and I appreciated the turn down service. The location was ideal for us exploring the city. I could not fault this hotel one bit and I will definately be returning to stay at the Hilton Times Square in the future. All the other positive reviews were spot on which made me book this hotel in the first place. And to the people who say why spend so much money on a hotel room when you're not even in it, I spent about 10 hours or more each day in my room (sleeping, showering, resting etc) and Im glad I had a nice room to come back to with a great view that I loved seeing.

<Content>Big East Tournament-Great Place! We recently attended the Big East Basketball tournament during the second weekend of March. Decided to book a suite at an extremely reasonable government rate. Couldn't have been happier with the accommodations (king bed plus a pullout queen sofa), the treatment we received from the moment we checked our vehicle, the location right in the middle of Times Square, and the proximity to the Garden. The three of us have already agreed we wouldn't stay anywhere else next year. Bravo!!

<Content>Great Weekend! Absolutely Fantastic. Stayed in the Hilton 17/03 - 20/03. I received an early check-in and an extended check out, a 41st floor room with outstanding views of 42nd and the Hudson. The room was large, clean, tidy and comfortable. The concierge were excellent, as were all the staff. Would definately stay again!!

<Content>Loved Times Square Hilton Nice surprise. On 42nd Street. Times square is at your feet. Enter from the street and take an elevator up 20 floors to the modern minimalistic lobby. Friendly, but not pushy staff. Great furnishing with unique local art in the room. Great views of the city.

<Content>Excellent. Especially w/ Priceline rate The people who complain about this place need to be staying at The Plaza or something.It's clean. The rooms are large. It's central to the theatre district.We had a relatively low floor but still enjoyed a view of the new Westin (with the funky light) and the river.I paid $110 on Priceline. I guess if I paid $250 or something, I'd be underwhelmed.I would definitely come again, even at a somewhat higher price.

<Content>Perfect for what I needed I brought my fifteen year old daughter and two friends to New York for an overnight stay. This hotel worked very well in terms of the location and amenities. There is a parking lot right across the street from the hotel on 41st Street, so self parking is an easy option in addition to the valet. The staff were all courteous and efficient from the doormen to front desk and security. Check-in was fast. Despite being Priceline customers they were very accomodating to my request for adjoining rooms, and gave us access to one room early (11am) so that we could store our things, freshen up, and get on with our day. By New York standards the rooms are large. Facilities are clean and well maintained -- nice bathrooms with marble sinks and ceramic tiled floor and tub. We were not on a high floor, but the view was not obnoxious, and there was zero street noise. Fantastic subway access, and of course proximity to shows. Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Great view! Stayed at the Hilton Times Square with my mother during the New York City portion of our vacation. (We spent a few days in NYC and then went to California to finish out the remainder of the trip.) We stayed 3/4 through 3/6.Check-in started out a bit rough. When I made my reservations I requested an early check in and I called the day before to verify and I was told that it would be no problem. We show up at the hotel and we were very rudely informed that we could NOT check in early. I nicely explained that we had been promised an early check in because we had a business meeting we had to get ready for but the female desk clerk refused to help us. We ended up just taking over the ladies room in the lobby and with the help of a VERY patient bellman (Caesar) we found all the clothes and makeup we needed to get ready for the meeting. Without the help bellman Caesar I don't know what we would have done!Anyway, when we were finally able to check into the room we were on the 37th floor. We had an AMAZING view of the city looking downtown. The view made us forget about the trouble we had checking in.The room was nice, slightly larger than the room we normally have at the Sofitel (the hotel where we usually stay.) The beds were pretty comfortable and the hotel was quiet. With the exception of the desk clerk we encountered the staff was very friendly.There needed to be more vanity space in the bathroom and the only mirror in the room was in the bathroom. There needed to be one in the main room.All in all it was a nice stay and the hotel was nice. I'm sure I'll stay there again.

<Content>Great Hotel Have just returned from a weekend away march 4 - 7th. Our room was on the 37th floor and we had great views of the Empire State building and the river. The room was a good size and the bed was very comfortable.Location is excellent and only a few minutes from the heart of Time Square. Would recommend this hotel to anyone and would not hesitate to stay there again.

<Content>Great stay I stayed here with my girlfriend for 5 nights from 23rd to 28th Feb 05 and had a fantastic time. I decided on this Hotel having read the reviews on this website  I wasn't disappointed. Staff were friendly  our room was very spacious with the bed one of the most comfortable I've ever slept in! Can't comment I'm afraid on their breakfast or dinner as we ate out every day/night. Hotel is in a great location and meant we could walk to a lot of the sights and shops. Only downside (albeit small) was our room was on a low floor so we didn't have a great view out of our window. Having said that we weren't in our room long enough during our stay to really mind and we did go on a helicopter ride over the city which kind of made up for it!

<Content>Awesome with a capital 'A' Recently stayed at Hilton Times Square Feb 24th-26th and had an unbelievably wonderful experience. We actually had a delayed flight and didn't get in until 4:00 AM, but the staff was extremely accomodating, patiently awaiting our arrival, and had our extremely spacious room (by NY standards) warm and cozy when we arrived. The service was top-notch and the beds were extremely comfortable. Both the location and the view of 42 Streeet/Times Square are incomparable. We stayed on the 37th floor and had enough peace and quiet while in the room even though the hotel's location is in the happening district. The Hilton Times Square is definitely worthy of its 4 star rating and I strongly recommend this hotel for anyone looking to enjoy the NYC experience with the convenience of New York at your doorstep. This is an absolute steal if you can score this hotel on Priceline as I was fortunate to do. Anyone who reports complaints about this hotel has truly had odd experience which is a deviation from the norm. I would stay at this hotel again, again, and again. Just Awesome!!!

<Content>Nice Hotel, No Complaints Quite pleased, especially since I obtained a discounted rate through Priceline. Nice sized rooms, well-appointed. Bathrobes in the room. Decent work-out facility. Professional staff. Fantastic location for leisure travelers (and just fine for business travelers). Would stay here again paying published rates.

<Content>Can't fault it We stayed at the Hilton Times Square from Feb 19th to 22nd and thought it was great. The staff were excellent, as was our room. We were on the 41st floor and had a great view of 42nd Street and beyond. Although it's very close to Times Square, we didn't feel unsafe at any time due to the security presence. I must mention one of the doormen who was prepared to lend us money out of his own pocket when our transport to the airport fell through. That's the sort of staff employed there and I would definitely go back.

<Content>Location We took our 13 year old daughter to New York for the first time Dec 6-10, 04. Exellent stay, room on the top floor overlooking Times Square 42nd street. Rooms larger than i thought considering everybody told me that NY rooms are small. Maids came in every day, extra comfy beds, fluffy bath robes and towels and nicely decorated rooms. Just around corner from hustle and bustle of it all. Too much to see and do. Empire and statue of liberty a must, we prebooked tickets on net, so much easier, and go early to avoid crowds. Rockettes christmas show very good and WTC. Overall, unbelievable, had to keep pinching ourselves. Deffinately be going back to the Hilton Times Square, we are really fussy so you can,t go wrong!

<Content>Nice hotel, manic location I stayed here June 04 using part Hilton reward points and paying for the rest. My impression of the hotel overall was good - polite staff, large clean rooms, nice touches like leaving little chocolates on your pillow in the evenings! The hotel bar was small but had a good selection of wines. I can't comment on the restaurant as I didn't eat there. My only qualm was that as another review mentions, there is building work at a site opposite this hotel, which meant that despite being so high up, you were awoken with the sound of drilling - not ideal. Also, personally, I found the location despite being very central and easy to reach most places, just too manic! As soon as you left the hotel, you had to fight the crowds of people to get anywhere! Next time I would definitely choose a different location.

<Content>One of the Best I was wowed by the Hilton Times Square, loved the fact that the lobby was on the 24th floor. The room was great and had an excellent view (except for the fact they must have demolished something right next to it). I can tell you though, at night, the view of the city is breath taking. I wish I would have been higher than the 31st floor though... oh well, you can't have everything. The staff was very corteous and helpful, and security is tight... I don't mind that inconvinience.

<Content>Nice but noisy. We stayed in a room on the 37th floor. The view was very nice - looked across to the Empire State Building on one side and the river on the other.  The room was spacious - a lot bigger than other hotels we've stayed at in NY. It was also nice and bright, with a huge window. The problem we found was the level of noise - there was a huge gap under the connecting door between rooms, which meant that we could hear the people next door. Also, the noise from the corridor was quite bad. The worst thing though was the noise from the flushing toilets - constantly, we could hear toilets being flushed in nearby rooms - by the fifth day it had become very annoying. Another source of noise was the new Plaza Hotel that they were building below our window, which meant that diggers were working from about 7 in the morning. If you like a lie-in, I'd ask for a room on the other side of the hotel. The Pinnacle Bar, next to Reception, provided a nice environment for a light meal, although it took quite a long time to get served - one day it took them an hour to bring us a portion of fries. The quality of the food though was very good. The security at the hotel makes you feel safe - you need to show your hotel key before you can go in the elevator up to Reception.  Overall, a nice hotel but the level of noise I think would prevent us from returning.

<Content>Disappointing The entrance and lobby of the hotel are dull/tired and need an update. Low water pressure in shower. Nice size room.The lobby's bar (the only bar in this hotel) is not inviting; the bartender a bit rough. Close to Times Square - so what? NYC is much more than being close to Times Square. Compare to the general level of the Hilton chain - this particular hotel was a disappointment. Felt like I was in a 2-3 stars hotel. Got this hotel via PriceLine ($100 per night) so at least the cost was reasonable. Last note - In my view Hilton New York (1335 Avenue of the Americas, NYC) is much better.

<Content>Fantastic Me My wife and my parents stayed at the Hilton for 7 nights over the new year and had a fantastic time. The hotel is really nice. Last time I came to NYC I stayed in the Milford Plaza so this was about 100 times better. The rooms are very large as are the beds and the view is fantastic.If your looking for a bit of Luxury stay here!!!!Cant wait to go back..

<Content>Great central location My partner and I (early 20's) spent 6 nights at the Hilton Times Square and realy enjoyed our stay.We booked the room through opodo.com and chose the bounceback vacation package which we got for a great rate considering we checked in on 31/12. The package included breakfast for two each morning and the food was the only downside to the hotel.The breakfast was buffet style but there was not a great choice and the food was the same everyday. We only ate in the restaurant for breakfast so cannot comment on other meals.The location of the hotel was excellent, could not have asked for better. It was central in Times Square with a subway seconds away and everything we wanted was close to hand. Our room was on the 43rd floor overlooking 42nd street and the view was superb.The room was very spacious, with a lovely large comfortable bed. The maids came every day and left the room spotless with fresh towels and bedding.We didnt realy use the amenities in the hotel but there was not a swimming pool which we were a bit disapointed with as it was stated as having one when we booked.The staff were very polite and friendly and helpfull especialy on checking-out. We will deffinately use this hotel on our next visit to NYC.

<Author>Thanks
<Content>Really good, overall We had two rooms at the TS Hilton during the period 21st to 27th December 04. We were happy with just about everything. Even the smoking rooms didn't smell too bad. (We had one smoking room and one non-smoking room). Our rooms were on the higher-up floors so we had a good view also (towards the Hudson River). The front desk clerk on check-in was helpful and very welcoming and fixed up our request for smoking room without any problem. (He might have been called Alexander - I'm not sure - I had thought to remember his name on check-in because he was so nice to us!).Because we left generous tips in our room (non-smoking one) every morning and every night, we got good room servicing and at night we got our bed turned down and a replacement of bottled water and towels etc. This was important to me as we were able to shower or bathe at will without regard to how the towels would hold out - unfortunately probably without regard to the environment. This was better service than our hotels here in Australia (only two towels per room here!). However, the other room (smoking) didn't leave a tip for night-time turn-down and they didn't get any special treatment - although their room was pretty daunting what with all the clothes and things piled up!The security on the street entrance was a good thing. We didn't eat at the hotel generally except for one meal - which was Christmas night dinner - we had thought it might be Christmas oriented so thought we might splash out and at least get a Christmassy-style meal - but it wasn't - it was just the ordinary menu.There was a bit of noise coming from our next door neighbours - mainly I think through the inter-connecting door - and that might cause a problem if you had really noise neighbours.Also, if you are planning on going to a Broadway show or the like, make plans early - as far as I could see you have no hope of getting tickets unless you book in advance.

<Content>room with a view This was our first visit to NYC. Having read the reviews on the Hilton, Times Square decided to stay there for 5 nights from 31.12.04. Requested a room with a view. Will never forget opening the door and there before us glistened a city of lights. From the 37th floor, the Empire State building was on one side with the Hudson river on the other. The rooms are spacious, tastefully decorated with the most comfortable beds to sleep in. Cannot fault security both inside and outside the hotel. The staff are extremely conscientious to ensure that only those staying at the hotel were allowed in. Would definitely recommend staying here and that New York certainly lives up to its name.

<Content>Nice Place Stayed at the Hilton Times Square for New Year's Eve. Great location and big rooms for New York standards. I liked the fact that you had to show proof that you were staying there each time you tried to walk into the hotel. My only complaint is that the hotel didn't have a gift shop or a place inside it to get OJ and a muffin or magazine.

<Content>Nice Hotel in NY Wasn't anything spectacular but the location was unbeatable. Hotel is located on the same block and New Amsterdam Theatre which makes it the perfect place to stay if you're seeing the Lion King. Hotel itself is above average and I would stay there again. Didn't recieve any of the special treatment that I read about on this board. Stayed 2 nights right before Christmas 04. Look for deals. I payed 165 a night by going to their website directly and paying in advance of my trip. Considering the season, I was very pleased with this hotel for 165 a night.

<Content>Fabulous Stay with Great Views Stayed here for 5 nights 25 - 30 December - this hotel could not be faulted. Ask for a room on a high floor - we were on 42nd floor with views over 42nd Street. Rooms extremely spacious and decorated to a high standard and fluffy bathrobes and toiletries provided along with coffee making facilities. No problems with lifts - speedy and efficient. Staff could not be faulted - concierge and reception staff pleasant and helpful as were the doormen. Not keen on restaurant and bar area being open plan but good for people watching - will definitely return here!

<Content>Great location and service Stayed here with kids December 19-20. Rooms are big by New York standards. We had a southern view with a great look at the Empire State Building. Lobby is small, but comfortable. This is the biggest difference between here and the big name hotels, which offer much more presence. Had a great breakfast buffet at the restaurant with smoked salmon and bagels. The concierge gave us a pass to Mars 2112, which is fantastic if you're under 12, but worthless for adults. We have stayed in quite a few NYC hotels and absolutely loved this one!!

<Content>Just returned from my stay (Dec. 18 to 21) I just got back from a stay at the Hilton Times Square. I loved New York and the hotel was in a fab location. Just a few steps to McDonald's, Champs, Applebee's (awful), and Subway. I liked Hilton Times Square but I have had my resevations for over three months and when I got there to check in, at 12 p.m., even though I had requested an early check in I did not get into my room until 5 o'clock which was two hours past there check in time. That left my family and I to roam around New York til then. They did store our luggage until then for us though which made it very helpful. Hotel staff was incrediably helpful and rooms were very nice. Hilton was not in what we think of as Times Square but was just around the corner (literally). Overall I would probably stay there again.

<Content>Treated us like royalty My kids (17 and 13) stayed at this location Dec. 46. It was fantastic. Clean, great location, great staff etc etc. They made us feel special and welcome.We had a room booked at HOJO Park Plaza for about $50 less a night, however that hotel is rated poorly on this site which worried me. So for about $70 more a night we went from 2* to almost 5*. Great breakfast included too.So close to all attractions in mid town.Would stay here in a flash again. Expensive yes, but worth it!

<Content>Fine time but some room for improvement Just returned from a fabulous wknd in NYC. The Hilton Times Square is very nice........not spectacular. The staff was very helpful. The rooms clean and comfortable. The view from the 27th was nothing to brag about and when I asked for a higher floor I was told nothing was available. I was disappointed with the entry. I liked the location but I did not like the hall atmosphere as you entered from the street. There were always people in front of the doors.....not allowing easy access. Once inside the staff was usually visible and secure. The lobby is small and not really inviting. The room was very nice.....big and equipped with all the comforts necessary for a pleasant stay. I'm just not sure if I will return......

<Content>Hotel Great - Room Service Terrible Just returned from a Thanksgiving stay at the Hilton. The Room was wonderful. We used Hilton Points for part of the stay and it could not have been better. Great service, great view -- terrific location - just a good experience. For part of the stay we booked a room that included VIP tickets to MOMA. Problem was no one could find the tickets. After a 30 minute run around I called the Hotel Manager's office and his Assistant located the tickets immediately and had them delivered to the room. Excellent service 5 stars for the assistant!!!I would have given this hotel a 5 or at least a 4 based on the overall experience - however, I ordered the American Breakfast from Room Service one morning. It was unbelieveably bad. I mean awful. I just can't believe that the hotel could serve something that bad. The breakfast potatoes tasted like cabbage -- I mean it was bad.So do stay at this hotel, do get VIP MOMA Tickets they worked fabulous -- just have breakfast around the corner at a diner!!

<Content>Fabulous hotel...no complaints at all! Our stay in November 12-14 could not have been better. From our early arrival (9:30 am) they were very helpful. We gave them our cell to let us know when a room was ready and they stored our luggage for us until we were able to get into a room. By 11 am we had a call that indeed a room was ready for us. When we got back to the hotel, they knew us by name (our representative was wonderful) and gave us our keys to go on up. The room was huge especially by NYC standards. Immaculate, not a complaint at all. It was our daughter's 17th birthday which we mentioned to the desk clerk upon our early arrival while hoping to get a good room. We left again to go sightseeing, shopping, etc, only to return to the room and see a birthday cake set up for her. I thought my husband had done it, but there was a card from the front desk. That is what I call above and beyond! The cake was delicious and such a wonderful personal touch to an already impressive stay. The next morning my daughter went to thank the desk clerk for her thoughtfulness, and she of course called us by name and asked if she had a nice birthday. The staff was very pleasant, the rooms very clean, the beds extremely comfortable. I will definitely choose this hotel again. I highly recommend it. There was no wait time for anything there. Whether business or pleasure, this is ideal. The view was great.

<Content>'Good' though not 'Great' We stayed in the Hilton at Times Square between 16th Nov 2004 and the 19th Nov 2004. I had booked a King Deluxe room almost six months prior to our visit and after reading all the reviews on this website I had probably developed overly high expectations. Good Points:- All staff are very friendly and daily room cleaning service is excellent. Concierge excellent.- Bed was one of the most comfortable we have stayed in.- Location is excellent, right in the heart of Manhattan.- Hotel security very good, you will be safe in this hotel.Bad Points:- The shower had very poor water pressure for a high class hotel, the worst pressure I have had in a hotel of 3 stars or more. Although maybe it was just my room, I dont know.- I dont smoke, my partner does. We took a smoking room. On opening the room door we were nearly knocked flat by the embedded stench in the room, it was like walking into a giant ash tray everytime you entered the room, got used to it after about half an hour each time. Although you expect the smell of a smoking room to resemble some element of stale smoke, this was the worst I have experienced. We stayed in a smoking room at the Luxor in Las Vegas and it was 100% better. - Even numbered rooms look downtown, odd number rooms look over 42nd St, Uptown. Try to get a room on a higher floor, the reception is on the 21st floor, our room was an odd numbered room on the 26th floor. A few floors below our room (on 42nd st side of hotel) were giant fans for the air-con system. If you stay higher up you will get far better views and also be further away from the air-con fans. In summary I can see why all the good review's have been written for this hotel, I think a combination of my high expectations from previous reviewers and getting a room on a low floor with a bad stench of smoke put a dampener on it for me. Although taking a smoking room is a personal choice they need to sort the ventilation out for them. For the price I paid, $1100 for three nights, I dont think it was worth it for the room we had.I would stay there again for sure, but for the price I paid I would insist on a room from at least the 35th floor and up, and preferably non-smoking !!

<Content>Fab! Fab hotel. Everything about it was great. From the minute we arrived the staff were great and instantly made us feel welcome. The rooms are clean and modern and the view from our room on the 42nd floor, where we could see the Empire State Building was brilliant.Originally we were going to stay at a hotel overlooking Central Park but Im glad we chose this hotel instead as the location cannot be beaten. We felt we were central to everything and there is such a buzz day and night in Times Square. It is also extremely near to Port Authority where we got the bus to Woodbury Common (a must for shopaholics)We will definitely be coming back to New York and without a doubt we will be staying here again.

<Content>Loved this hotel We stayed here in September for our first trip to NYC to see the Yanks play the Sox. The location was perfect right in Times Square. Although it is more expensive than most hotels we stay in, we thought it was a good price for New York in the middle of Times Square. Next time I go to New York I will stay at the Hilton again. The rooms are nice and the view is great. We all loved it!

<Content>New, clean, curteous, luxurious. This hotel beats all expectations. My room was big, bright, luxurious, had a great view, and most importantly, extremely new and clean. In Orbitz the hotel doesn't even rate as a four star place, which got me a bit worried --but it's actually as nice as some five star places I've stayed in. I didn't want to leave. What a great deal!

<Content>Terrific Hotel / Fabulous Location! We just returned from a one night stay at the Hilton Times Square. I chose the hotel based upon the positive reviews listed here at TripAdvisor. The reviews were 100% accurate. Our room was clean, large and had a breathtaking view. Our room looked out over 42nd Street, directly above Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum. We were in the heart of the theatre district and within walking distance to most of midtown's tourist attractions. The staff was kind, courteous and extremely helpful. We arrived exceptionally early (approximately 11:00 am) and were immediately given our room. We especially liked that the lobby was above street level. We felt safe and secure the entire time. The Hilton Times Square was a great place to stay in New York City. Reserve without hesitation!

<Content>Reasonbly Priced, Great Location for First Timers This hotel was a great find last minute. With a trip to NYC booked less than 3 weeks out in the fall, there weren't many recommendable options for less than $250-300 @ night. If you've been to NYC before and are interested in more than just the Square, I'd recommend staying somewhere else, but if this is your first time, you can't go wrong with this place! The only negatives I have are not real negatives, rather nit-picky annoyances. First, have to take an elevator up 20 floors from the entrance, to reach the lobby, then you take another set of elevators to your room. (the elevators are fast and there's not much of a wait, but if you get out to the street and realize you forgot something, you gotta go back up an elevator, through the lobby, up another elevator, then vice versa.Next, anytime you come into the hotel there's a guard asking to see your room key. I'm sure this is to make sure only guests use the hotel facilities, though it didn't appear there were many non-guests attempting to get on the elevator.I used the iron and ironing board the first night and housekeeping never put it away, which I thought was kinda strange. Also, housekeeping comes a bit early... 9-ish or so. It's fine if you're up and at 'em, but if you're out till 4 or 5 each night like we were, it's kinda early, so remember to put out the DND sign. Like I said, these aren't really negatives, but may be helpful to know for some folks. The other reviews have all hit on the positives, so I'll just echo those. The hotel is immaculately clean. The staff is knowledgable, friendly and helpful. Especially the guard Sarito. There are umpteen places to eat, drink, shop, gawk, etc within steps of the hotel. There are subway stations on either corner - ACE to the west, BDNQ to the east. If possible, ask for an even numbered room. There are no poor views - the odd rooms have views of the Hudson, New Jersey, Reuters Building and Theatre District. The even rooms have a view of the Hudson as well, but also the Empire State Building and South Manhattan.The only other thing I can think of is the price of the hot buffet breakfast - $18. If you don't have a voucher for it, there's no reason to pay for it, unless you just love buffets. There are too many other places to eat in the City.

<Content>Great stay We stayed at the Hilton for six nights in October, primarily as a result of having read many positive reviews here at tripadvisor. We were not disappointed; the hotel's location was perfect for a second visit to New York with shows and an opera booked.Our twin room was large compared with a previous stay in NYC, with plenty of room to move about. It was well furnished and had great views of downtown; we could even see the Statue of Liberty in the distance in a gap between buildings. The housekeeping service was consistently good, room service was very good (but overpriced as always), especially the chicken noodle soup.The staff were informative and helpful, and in fact we felt the only unimpressive feature of this property was the buffet breakfast, for which we had received free vouchers for a breakfast for two each morning of our stay. Depsite having breakfast at a variety of times the eggs were invariably cold, and there was only a small selection of items, few of which appealed to us.We will certainly stay here again and would recommend it. It was well worth the extra few dollars compared to Sofitel, which is where we stayed on a last trip.

<Content>Minor hitch but overall very good Mu husband and I stopped over for one night in this Hotel on our way back to Scotland after a wonderful holiday in the States. The room, views, service etc. were all we could have asked for except that the reception staff asked if we wanted a smoking or non-smoking room. I had specifically stated when I ordered that I wanted a smoking room. This was not a problem as we were given a smoking room but the next morning, at breakfast, we were asked for vouchers which we had not been given when we arrived. Instead of a relaxing morning which would have rounded out our stay perfectly, my husband had to leave the table and go back to our room to get the documentation to show that we were entitled to breakfast as part of our package. On this occasion the reception staff's oversights reduced our stay from 5* plus to 4*. If they can correct this, I would say that the Hotel, although expensive, is worth every dollar. Other reviews have stated that the food is overpriced. We found it to be well worth the money.

<Content>Superb Hotel We stayed at the Hilton for two nights in December 2003, having stayed at the Mariott Marquis for the first three nights of our trip.The Hilton was absolutely perfect. It's not as glamarous as the Marriott Marquis, but it is located less than a minute away from Times Square, and was every bit as neat and luxurious as the Mariott.The room we had was large and extremely comfortable, with a view that was simply magnificent. The hotel itself had an aura of real luxury, and for the price, it is undoubtedly one of the best hotel deals out there. Special mention must be made of the bed in our room. We had a King sized bed that was so comfortable that we had trouble re-adjusting to our bed at home. If we ever return to New York, the Hilton would definately be our choice for luxurious yet readily affordable accomodation.

<Content>Great Location and Price I came to NY 4-28 to 5-1 with my girlfriend and our college. My girfriend had to book all the rooms for the 30 students who went, and had a great experience working with the management at the hilton. For her hard work, we were rewarded with a suite on the top floor as well as champagne on ice and a gift basket when we entered the room. We only paid about $159 a night. Our room was very nice and clean, the staff at the hotel is very friendly. The location is great. It's one block away from Times Square. ESPN Zone was a great place to watch sporting events and was about 2 blocks away. I would definetly stay here again.

<Content>Refreshing abundance of Quality My wife  I recently stayed in Times Square - Sept 3rd - 7th 2004. The Hilton is in a fantastic hotel tucked neatly away off 42nd street. Great location for NYC night-life, broadway shows, central to tourist attractions, and of course my wife's shopping adventures. The front office staff service was impeccable and the room had tremendous views over the NYC skyline. It is not often I am willing to recommend somewhere, so if you are debating where to stay ... Hilton Times Square is a sure bet.

<Content>Great new hotel, great location, pricier now though Stayed here when it first opened in June 2003. First let me say that I travel all over the world and find that dollar for dollar the hotels in New York are the worst value in terms of how much cleanliness and newness your dollar buys you. In fact I'll go beyond that and say that for the average hotel room price paid in the average big city this buys you what amounts to a dump in my opinion in NYC.Having stayed at one of these dumps during a trade show at the Javitz in June 2003 during the last nights of my stay I searched for any hotel in NYC that was CLEAN and BRAND NEW.This Hilton is all that and then some and is simply awesome. The views are great, the location is great, the rooms are beautiful and the service was good. I only rate it 4 stars because when I was there the lobby was full of people waiting for their rooms and they weren't ready. This was probably because the hotel had just opened recently.Anyways, I thought I'd found the ultimate bargain because I only paid 149 a night!! Well, everyone else in the world must have discovered this place too because it's hard to get a booking there for many consecutive nights now and good luck finding it a rate less than 250, or even less than 450 during peak travel times.But if you can get the room you're guaranteed that it's a real deal brand new hotel, and not one of those NYC places where the lobby looks nice because they spent millions on it but the guest rooms are filthy.

<Content>Just outstanding My son and I stayed there for 6 nights in early August. I can only echo the other reviews. The security was great. It had the feel of a small hotel with the amenities of a much larger one. Location was superb, as we went to the theatre every night, and we could walk everywhere.

<Content>Great Family Hotel Just returned from Hilton Times Square August 13-15th and completely enjoyed our stay. I was accompanied by my husband and 12 year old and 7 year old. The location was perfect; close to everything. I had booked our room first several months ago and then booked tickets for Lion King several weeks ago and was pleasantly surprised to find it located just a few doors down! Room was very comfortable with great big windows for my children to look out into the city at night. Family restaurants very close by - although my husband and I would have opted for more upscale cuisine -- we needed to keep our kids palate's and pocketbooks in mind! I highly recommend this hotel and will stay there again!

<Content>we made an excellent choice We stayed at Hilton Times Square for 7 nights- July 25 thru August 1st. This was an excellent choice as far as location and service. The staff was exceptionally helpful, friendly and accomodating. We were always greeted with a good morning or evening, whichever the case was. Security is great too. The lobby is on the 21st floor and we had to show room keys to get on the elevator that would take us to our room. You do have to take 2 elevators to get to your room, but we never, ever had to wait longer than 20 seconds for one. Most times (98% of the time) one was waiting for us. They were very fast also whisking you up 21 floors in a matter of seconds. Then the second elevator seemed to always be available and we were in our room in less than a minute. There is also 24 hour room service which we did not use because it was expensive. The location was great for sightseeing. There was a subway station about a half block away and it had trains going in every direction. We used subways a lot but also walked a lot. We were out past midnight almost every night and never felt like we were not in a safe area. There were so many people out at that time it was incredible. Anything you wanted was a quick subway ride away or within walking distance. We walked many many places in short time periods. We will for sure stay there again as we plan on returning in a year or two.

<Content>Above expectation My friend and I went to NYC for the Tap Festival, and we stayed in Hilton Times Square from June 30 to July 11. Before we came to NYC, we have done so many researches on hotels in Manhattan, and finally we chose Hilton Times Square due to all the good comments. Upon our arrival, I inspected thoroughly throughout our room (located on the 34th floor) and was totally satisfied. The room is unexpectedly spacious and quiet; our queen size twin beds are very comfortable; and the bathroom is clean. The hotel staff are very helpful, and the location of the hotel is just wonderful. All the Broadway musical show theatres are within walking distance; subway station is around the corner; and an internet cafe is right beside the hotel. As a frequent traveller, I have been in many hotels around the world and for this one, I would rate it 4.5 stars and will definitely come back again next time.

<Content>Great Hotel Stayed in this toel from July 22nd to July 26th, 2004. This was our first time in New York; The room was spacious and clean; Great View; All the staff was very courteous and helpful. There was a torrential rain storm and the hotel provided umbrellas for us to continue our sightseeing. We felt very secure in the hotel because no one was allowed to take elevators to the floors without showing that you were a guest in the hotel. Will stay at this hotel again and will recommend to other people.

<Content>Go to The Marquis Instead Visited NYC on July 8-11, 2004. We got to the hotel and were told by the staff that there were no double beds available because they were expecting a large group who had reserved the rooms. What about my reservation?!?! I am a $239 paying customer, too! They say that you can request a free refrigerator in your room, because you will be charged if you so much as open the open that is in the room! I got the rental refrig., albeit it had dents on it like it had been dropped from the elevator shaft! For much better service, and what you want the first time for the same price and better locale, go to the Marriot Marquis! That's what we did and LOVED IT!

<Content>Cannot be faulted Just got back from New York. Stayed at this excellent hotel. Right at the centre of things but an oasis of calm after the hustle and bustle of Times Square. Very quiet due to lobby starting on 21st floor. Rooms large by NY standards. Security brilliant. Key check on entry, made us feel safe. Don't stay anywhere else.

<Content>School Group I brought a group of middle school students to stay here on June 3-6, 2004. The stay was fantastic. I really appreciated that there was hotel staff located on ground and then again in the hotel lobby checking to be sure that only registered guests were entering the hotel. The front desk staff, housekeepers, concierge, security, and porters were all very nice to the kids. The price of the hotel is on the moderate to high side but the location (1/2 block to the Times Square subway station), experience, and high quality made it worth it.

<Content>A great hotel in the heart of NYC We stayed at this hotel for 6 nights from 13th to 19th June 2004 after reading about it on tripadvisor.com. We listed all the hotels we liked then checked the reviews - the Times Square Hilton jusifiably received the best reports and to be honest we have difficulty in finding any faults. If we really want to be picky we could say that the housekeeping was patchy - like one bed being turned down and not two but this is hardly an issue. The de-luxe rooms were large (and quiet), the beds exceptionally comfortable and the staff friendly and helpful. Our rooms were on the 42nd floor and the views downtown were outstanding. If you are looking for a great hotel in the heart of NYC close to the buzz then this is it.

<Content>Love this Hotel!! We have stayed at this hotel twice in the last year. We were staying at this hotel last summer when the black out hit. The staff was incredible!! Our elevators worked because the hotel has a generator for emergencies. You can not beat the location right in the heart of Times Square. The rooms are large and comfortable. I highly recommend this hotel!!

<Content>Romantic Getaway My boyfriend surprised me with a weekend in the city. Including a night at the Times Square Hilton. The staff was amazing, from the second we pulled up at the curb to checking out everyone was super friendly. The view of time square and the setup of the bar area are awesome. Stop in for a drink.

<Content>Great big rooms Spent a week in April with two other couples in this Hotel. We were pleased with the size of the rooms, plenty of space and great views of New York from the window. The rooms were well serviced and staff pleasant.The buffet breakfast was the same every day and cooked food not hot enough. The hot food needs to be varied. We enjoyed several restaurants nearby, Osteria Al Doge, (great Italian food) John's Pizzeria and Un Deux Trois (great French food).The Hotel is handy to Broadway shows, action of Times Square and close to public transport.

<Content>cannot fault it My husband and i stayed here over Easter for 5 nights with our 3 daughters plus 2 of their friends. We cannot fault the hotel, the staff were very friendly even the doormen, the rooms were huge, we were on the 43rd floor with great views from both rooms.Excellent location and very quiet inside the hotel after leaving the noisy Times Square. We ate breakfast at nearby delis as there were such good value. Cant wait to go back!

<Content>Fabulous hotel! We stayed at this hotel at the end of March 2004. Everything was perfect. We contacted the hotel prior to arriving regarding parking etc., the staff and management were very informative and helpful. Arrival and check in were a breeze - very friendly, courteous staff. The room was spectacular - very neat, very clean and very comfortable. The location was of course, perfect. If you're into walking it's central so you can pretty much walk everywhere in Manhattan (we did), or you can take the subway that's 30 seconds away from the hotel door. We have absolutely no complaints and will definetely stay here again :-)

<Content>Wonderful Hotel!! I can't believe this hotel gets any bad reviews! This hotel is very clean, safe, and quiet! It is in a great location, right off Times Square. The security is excellent - they check for IDs before allowing anyone up to the 21st floor lobby. There is a great place for a quick breakfast right across the street, as well as a Starbucks. We didn't eat at the hotel because we wanted to see more of the city, but the bar area looked very nice. This isn't a super luxury hotel, but it's great for business travel or people who want a nice quiet place to stay. Ask for a room on the higher floors - we were on the 42nd floor, looking right at the Empire State Building. Most mornings, we just sat and stared out the window at the amazing view in awe! We paid $249 per night - ask for a discount when you call, because all of the online places were much more expensive than booking direct. This is BY FAR my new favorite hotel in NYC. We stayed at the W Hotel in Midtown last time, and it was the same price but the room was 4 times smaller!

<Content>Loved it My boyfriend and I stayed in this hotel in February. It was the first overnight in NYC for both of us, and we were undure of what to expect. I found an excellent deal on the Hilton website- $159 a night, no cancellations. Since we had tickets for a Broadway play, we weren't going to cancel.The hotel room was clean and surprisingly spacious. I found the service to be excellent, although we only stayed 2 nights. It was a very convienent location, and since the rooms didn't start until the upper floors, it was very quiet. Nice beds, and a nice decorating scheme. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in NYC.

<Content>Big Mistake Because of many higher rates from the review, we switched our reservation from Westin to this hotel. The bed was horrible. The bathroom was not perfectly clean. The doormen never greet whenever we were in/out. The breakfast was very expensive but the quality was not even standard. (The hostess and server were horrible.) Everything we found in this hotel was nothing more than average, except the concierge. This hotel was not worth for $259/night. I always use Hilton, Westin, or Hyatt, but this one was the worst I ever stayed. Watching the view of newly Westin Tower from our room, I felt we made the biggest mistake choosing the hotel from this site.

<Content>Did Not Want To Leave This was our first trip to New York and we did lots of research on NY hotels. Wanted some place nice, safe and without paying 500 or 600 a night. Booked the Hilton for April 22 - 24 and had a great time. We were lucky enough to be able to go on board and tour the Queen Mary 2 while it was in NY and our room looked right out over the harbor with a great view of the ship and city. Hotel bellmen, concierge, and front desk were all very helpful and friendly (not what we expected from NY). The hotel has a great bar and breakfast area in the Lobby. Our room was extremely clean and very spacious. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. This is a fairly new hotel so everything still looks great. The housekeeping staff will turn down your bed at night and leave bottled water and chocolates if you want them to. Security at this hotel is great. You have to show your room key before you can even get in the elevator to go to the Lobby. At night, you can feel very safe in the hotel area. Applebee's is next door and has good service and food for a very reasonable price. Micky D's is two doors down for a quick lunch or breakfast. Almost everything is within walking distance (if you have the right shoes!). Can't say enough good things about Hilton Times Square and we're ready to go back! We will definately stay here on our next trip to NY. If you have any doubts about where to stay you will not be disappointed with this hotel.

<Content>The Most Comfortable Hotel in NYC I went to New York for my annual Easter Holiday April 6 to April 12, 2004. It is so important for visitors like me who just came in from a very long, long flight to have a comfortable hotel to stay in with. This hotel is simply REMARKABLE. The moment you arrive, you would not even carry your own luggages. There is a bellman who will bring it up to your room. They are very courteous. The front desk is helpful and fast. Everything said here at the tripadvisor is true. The rooms are a bit pricey, I paid about $274/ a night including taxes. But it is worth every penny. The beds are soft and comfortable including the pillows. You are given a bathrobe. There is a complimentary coffee. An ironing board. There is also a safe in the room. A beautiful hotel indeed. The rooms are big. You won't feel cramped. And they prepare your beds at night time, you get a sweet chocolate and complimentary mineral water. AWESOME HOTEL, expensive but worth it. Hotels in New York are expensive so why not spend a little extra and stay in this hotel. I'm a frequent traveller and what I remember during my travels is the experience of my stay and not how much I paid for it. This hotel is simply the best.

I have to say this is by far the best hotel i have stayed in, if i were to go again i would stay nowhere else due to the fantastic location of this hotel. Spacious rooms, polite staff(who even asked if i enjoyed the show when i got back) and excellent security. What more could you want.can't wait to go back.......

<Content>First rate, but you pay for it This is by far the best hotel I've stayed at in Manhattan (there have been 5). It was very upscale and cozy compared to the older hotels, even had a real thermostat, not a radiator and wall A/C unit. It was posh and modern and very quiet. The only noise I could hear in my room were loud people in the hall, the doors slamming and the toilets flushing. I've yet to find a hotel that keeps those noises out. Keep in mind, I DID not pay for this room which was $250 the night I was there. It was a business trip. Would I pay that much if I was spending my own money? Probably not, because I've found the Salisbury to be my best BUY in Manhattan. I've stayed at more expensive hotels than this Hilton, but it was the best value for that price, without a doubt.

<Content>Want To Go Back! Stayed in a Deluxe Room with full American Breakfast  bottle of sparkling wine, cost $229 per room per night (plus taxes). Our room was on the 34th floor and had fantastic views of the Hudson River and Times Square. Lovely modern, spacious room. Had room service dinner (from Hilton's restaurant 'Above'). Delicious! I can recommend the prawns  avocado - biggest prawns i've ever seen. Lovely burger for main course and yummy strawberry cheesecake for dessert. Used the Concierge service a few times as we had never been to NY before so needed advice on how best to get to places, where to go etc. Excellent service, very helpful and SO polite. Cant wait to go back one day!Also went to see Chicago which was brilliant....

<Content>Hilton Time Square Stayed at the Hilton Time Square February 2004. Lovely hotel, with excellent staff. Great views from all sides. Didn't experience the food/room service so can't comment on that but nothing too much trouble for the staff. Great size rooms. Applebees is ok for for somewhere to go when you have't much time to look as it's almost next to the hotel. Roxy's is VERY EXPENSIVE for breakfast. There's lots of fantastic delis to eat at costing as little as $1.50 for an egg and bacon roll. Carmines Restaurant is good but you need to book as it's always busy. However, the portions are humongous so better to buy 1 meal for 2 people!

<Content>Couldn't fault it! My husband and I decided to stay at the hotel on Honeymoon after reading many great reviews on this site and we were not disappointed!The hotel is slap-bang in the heart of NYC and we walked most places as they were easily accessible. It is literally a couple of minutes from the centre of Times Square and there is plenty going on 42nd street where the hotel is located.There is an adjoining door to a bar / restaurant Applebees, where it is 99c for a beer until 7 pm weekdays and the food is reasonable too. Red Lobster around the corner is great too, but give B.B.King's Blues Club a miss - although there is a great atmosphere, it was the most expensive yet worst food and service we had. The Creamery Ice Cream Parlour across the road was fabulous!Back to the hotel, we had a 35th floor room which had great views. The room was huge with a huge bed and the housekeeping was great.An excellent honeymoon due partly to this excellent hotel!

<Content>Couldn't say enough nice things about this hotel We stayed at the Hilton Times Square from 26 November for 8 nights (through Thanksgiving) and couldn't say enough nice things about the hotel. The location is fantastic, right on 42nd street and only steps from Broadway theatres, Times Square and the subway. Our room on the 33rd floor was spacious (with two double beds) and a fantastic view of the Empire State Building. Nothing was too much trouble for the friendly staff and the service was outstanding. As a regular traveller for business, I am often disappointed with my hotel experiences but the Hilton Times Square met and exceeded our expectations in every respect. We hope to return again for Thanksgiving in 2004!

<Content>Absolutely Fabulous! My stay here was from 27 December through to 31 December 2003. Arriving at the back entrance on 41st Street at 11pm was a bit off-putting but as soon as I entered the lobby, then took the extremely fast lift 23 floors to the reception, all my fears dissapeared. My room was spacious, clean, had everything you could want or need (including iron and iron-board for the girls)! Staff were helpful and courteous, room service was fab. The location of the hotel is spectacular, right on 42nd Street with a 30 second stroll to Broadway and the subway so your never far from anything. Although the area remains busy until the early hours I never heard a sound from my 39th floor room, and as a first time visitor to New York travelling on my own I've never felt safer. Couldn't recommend this hotel hightly enought and can't wait to go back!!

<Content>Great but not excellent We stayed here for 2 nights from the 13th of December, and the location of this hotel really is fabulous, as are the rooms! The rooms really are the biggest I've seen, particularly in the heart of the city, and we were lucky enough to have a room with corner windows, which let in lots of light and meant we had a wonderful view of both the Hudson and Times Square. Lots of storage and the bathroom was also lovely. However, what I did feel let this hotel down was the restaurant and bar facilities. Fair enough, when you go to New York, you're not likely to be eating and drinking in your hotel when there are so many other fabulous places to be, but when you've had a long transatlantic flight such as we did, you just really fancy some room service: I found their offerings quite limited. This was also typical of the buffet breakfast. Seating in the lobby area was also on the minimal side, in addition to the bar area. However, this is a fabulous hotel, the staff on the front desk are extremely curteous and although you're right in the middle of everything, don't worry about the noise- it's not even an issue when staying here!

<Content>Oasis in Midtown We have stayed at the Hilton Times Square for three nights in December 2003 and have only the highest praise for it. The rooms are spacious compared to other New York hotels of the same category and the view from the room was just breathtaking. The service was very friendly and professional. Unfortunately we left a brand new sweater in the room when we departed and only realised when unpacking at home. Without any hope, I called the hotel and very friendly Brenda from Lost and Found immediately agreed to send the found item back. So all in all an oasis in the middle of the hustle of Times Square.

<Content>Great Thanksgiving Stay Just returned from a stay here over the Thanksgiving holiday...4 nights. Very impressed with this hotel, wonderful location for the sights, spacious rooms, super staff. Considering that it's on busy 42nd St., this hotel is amazingly quiet. Security is excellent. If you want to be in the heart of things, I'd highly recommend the Hilton Times Square.

<Content>Sales Dept is AWFUL We attempted to host a meeting at the Hilton Times Square. WHAT A NIGHTMARE. They changed our contracted rates, our sales rep changed almost daily and our meeting room rental fee kept going up. They originally tired to say the list price was $4000 per day for a room big enough for 50 people. We cancelled our space due to lack of communication and organization on the hotels part. The hotel has sent multiple bills for $13K in damages, however the meeting was held at their sister Hilton property. I left 6 messages for the general manager--it took him 3 weeks to call me back. The hotel is a nice property- -just make sure you have everything in writing....especially if you think about conducting a meeting here.

<Content>Loved the Hilton Times Square We had a wonderful stay at this hotel over the July 4th weekend. The hotel is amazing, very cozy. The staff was very friendly and helpful, always attentive. Our room had a fantastic view over the lower city. And we were able to watch fireworks played from 5 different locations through our large room window on July 4th evening. What a treat! And it also has a great location, convenient to everywhere in the city. After came back from sightseeing, we were able to refresh ourselves and change dress before went to the Broadway show. I'm so glad that I came across those hotel reviews at tripadvisor which helped me make the right choice. We will definitely come back to this place on our next trip to New York.

<Content>Perfect stay Look closely, or you might miss the tiny entranceway on 42nd. Situated right next to the Wax Museum, AMC Theatres and McDonalds, you'll still feel safe staying here even if the surrounding streets at night seem a little hostile. There are two security checkpoints, and the rooms don't even begin until the 23rd floor on up, so you'll be far from the noise below. Front desk staff, bell staff, and housekeeping were all efficient and courteous. Rooms are exceptionally clean and well stocked, and the turn-down service includes bottles of water, TV guide, and chocolates. Loved the pre-ordered breakfast option as well, the free USA Today and Sunday NY Times, the bounty of good cable channels, and the usage of a robe. While the furniture was a little scuffed in spots (emphasize little), the decor is very bright and pleasant, the beds and pillows unbelievably comfortable, and the blast of cool air conditioning awaiting you a welcome reprieve from the sticky, stinky city air. Rooms were completely soundproof, something that was a little worrisome upon finding an adjoining door in the room. The 41st floor facing south had a wonderful view of the lower city and Empire State Building to the left. There are multiple entrances to the Times Square subway stop both at east and west sides of the block, and there are oodles of restaurants in close proximity (if you're the chain restaurant type, Applebee's is right outside the front door and there's a Red Lobster at the end of the block). The Hilton hotels are just the best and know what they're doing. I highly recommend this establishment.
