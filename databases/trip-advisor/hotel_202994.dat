<Content>unpleasent hotel The Hotel Cellai has a very stylish ground floor with lobby, pool table and small bar. Most sites are within walking distance and it is about 20 walking minutes to the river Arno. Staff is friendly and breakfast comes with a good selection of teas (served in a big jug) or tasty coffee. The rest of the breakfast is simple, but good for Italian standards. Staff is friendly and helpful, but a bit a bit stressed when the breakfast room filles up (2 staff only).The rooms are rather small and the bathroom only fits one person at a time. Sitting on the toilet would be much easier, if they would not have installed that weird additional basin you only find in countries like Italy just in front of it. The shower is extremely narrow. The shower curtain seemed clean, the rest however does not get cleaned properly, leaving brown and black spotts everywhere. The water did not go down the drain properly and within a minute you stood in a few centimeters of water. Hence, taking a shower was not that pleasent. We asked for the problem to be fixed, which however never happened. Cleaning personel was very inefficient and did the job with a cloth in one hand and a cigarette in the other when I viewed them (hotels are non-smoking in Italy). Cleaning did not seem to be defined different than just pulling a dirty wet cloth over bathroom appliances and letting it dry (a 2-year old could do it better 鈥?if he can reach up). The bed has only a thin sheet on the mattress, without a mattress cover as you would expect. The carpet seemed quite dirty and probably hasn鈥檛 seen a vacum cleaner in days, if not weeks. This is not what I expect from a 3-star hotel and a room price around 100 Euros. Rooms are quite noisy. However, street noise has to be expected in a an old building in the middle of town.While checking out, we listened to an American having no hot water and complaining about smoke. They asked to chang rooms for the third time, we only changed once. It seems we weren鈥檛 the only picky ones.The hotel management needs to take some measures and supervise cleaning and maintenance better. Should I go back to Florence, I certainly will pick another hotel.

<Content>The most helpful people ever and a gorgeous hotel ! I have just returned from a lovely trip to Florence and just had to leave a review after a friend told me about this site. The first two days we were there were glorious and then disaster struck when my back gave up on me and I was in desperate need of medical attention. Help came in the form of an incredibly helpful and friendly receptionist who provided us with a twin room and LOTS of understanding. She called us a doctor, was very patient on the day we left the hotel and took so much stress out of the situation.The other receptionist is a lovely scottish lady who wrote a translation of what I needed to say at the AE, called us taxi's etcApart from the low point of our holiday, my partner and I were still wowed by how beautiful the hotel is. It is lovingly designed and a pleasure to stay at. In our 24 hours of need when we needed much understanding, everyone came to our aid, from the friendly lady who cleaned our room to the breakfast waitress who let us have a silver tray for breakfast in our room. In addition to how they dealt with my woes, it is charming and in my favourite city :0) We will definitely return again! Grazie mille to all the staff at Hotel Cellai, we will not forget your kindness! x x

<Content>The Hotel Cellai is a Real Gem This charming art-filled hotel is away from the hustle and bustle of the main tourist drag, but still close to everything--an excellent location. Each guest room is unique and lovely--and very clean. There are two beautiful reception rooms, a gorgeous new bar, and a fantastic roof-top terrace. The staff is extremely helpful and all speak English. The breakfast buffet is bigger and better than most. I have stayed in the Hotel Cellai on six occasions and all have been most wonderful I highly recommend this wonderful hotel.

<Content>This is a nasty little hotel. I hated it. This is a two-star hotel passing as a three-star. It can call itself a three star hotel on technicalities only: the rooms have in-room bathrooms, a minibar fridge, a cheap bedside phone, and an included breakfast. We were deceived upon entry. The lobby and the bar are beautiful. Gorgeous, actually. The hallways are also charmingly decorated with art and photography. There are current and glossy magazines everywhere to read which is a nice touch. It is like they are doing everything they can to keep you out of your actual room and there is good reason. The rooms are sufficatingly small. And I mean that literally. There is no air circulation. You can barely move around your bed. If you do choose to open your window, you are subjected to copious streetnoise and mosquito bites. In our first room, our bathroom was very small with only a shower stall and it smelled of mildew. The underside of our bedspread was stained. We spent one night in this room and I decided I was so uncomfortable I would ask for another room. The staff was friendly and accommodating. Over and over again Italians make up for what is wrong with Italy. There was only one room available because a load of cruise ship tourists was descending upon our hotel. Our new room was marginally better. The room was just as small but the bathroom had a tub and better counter surface. What people don't tell you about Florence and other popular destinations in Italy is that the streets are dark, crowded and loud. The duomos and other things you go to see are ruined with a crush of tourists and tourist trap restaurants everywhere. We really needed a nice retreat and this hotel failed in every way that mattered. It was also the most expensive hotel we booked and we felt a fair price would have been about half what they were charging. I could have put up with this hotel if it was an 70-euro per night hotel. But at the 135-euros we were being charged every night, it was a complete disappointment.

<Content>Disappointing This hotel was not at all what I thought it was going to be,although the location was fine. The rooms looked and feltdirty and in need of redoing. While the bed springs squeakedand the mattress was a bit saggy, it was nothing compared to the dirty bathroom.Even after I asked for them to clean it better, it was still notreally clean. Prior to my going, I read about a beautiful rooftop where theyserved breakfast. Never saw it! They served a so-sobreakfast in a nice enough looking room off the lobby.Nobody ever mentioned a rooftop, for breakfast or otherwise.This was a big draw for me when picking out a hotel.If you like clean rooms and some ammenities, go elsewhere.

<Content>Over priced not as advertised The website shows a wonderfully romantic room...we didn't receive one of those. Candle light breakfast had all the needs of a continental breakfast...nothing more.One of the beautiful things about the hotel is the roof top terrace which we did enjoy. this little gem made us feel better about the price we payed.Location is great close to train station and major sites. You can do better for the money though.

<Content>Excellent hotel in a great location (ignore the American reviews) We've just had a week at this great Hotel. We arrived from the railway station via taxi which dropped us directly to the door. On entry the reception area is cool and atmospheric, classic 18th century with swathes of fabric and paintings on the walls and on easels in the number of reception rooms. We found the staff friendly, attentive and happy to give advice and assistance as per our requests - providing restaurant advice, booking tables and taxis etc. Shona was particularly great with a number of enquiries and requests that we made with regard to the booking of reserved entry to the local galleries - Uffizi and Accademia. The hotel itself is 3 star which through experience has lead us not to expect too high a standard in Spain  Italy, however the Cellai Hotel was excellent. The rooms are not huge, but they have everything you need for your stay, with compact with superbly clean and ensuite facilities with fitted hairdryers. There are shutters on the windows which you need to keep the heat of the sun out, but there are cords on either side of the windows, should you wish to open the shutters outside. The rooms are air conditioned and we found this to be adequate. Each room had direct line telephone, tv and small fridges. The streets outside are quite noisy in the early morning but not to the point where it disturbed me after the first night.Breakfast is a typical European selection of beautifully fresh bread rolls and croissants, cereals, fresh fruit - pears, apricots, apples, plums etc, fruit juices, cheeses, hams and yoghurt. Coffee or tea were served at your table as per your preference. There is a great roof terrace with a range of comfortable furniture which offers views over the rooftops and makes a lovely end to your day whilst you have drinks in the cooler evening weather. We used the free internet service on a couple of occasions and understand from hotel staff that WiFi is in the process of being installed. I am confident that this hotel will reach a 3* superior or higher rating in future, but what I find hard to understand is the American tourists reviews of this and other places that we've been to. I really am at a loss to know what they expect to find - Hotels in many European cities are often hundreds of years old, which does mean they are not the brand new shiny, characterless buildings of many American cities. Anyway, back to my review - the Cellai Hotel offers a number of services including limousine service to local designer outlets - Prada and Gucci to name just a couple. They also arrange visits to outlying villages on request for those wishing to see the 'real' Tuscany. The hotel doesn't offer a laundry service on site but recommended a same day service in the street just a few yards away. The Hotel has a number of courtesy bicycles which you can book free of charge to get you around the city - such a simple but great idea and highly popular with guests at the Hotel.In retropect the Hotel would benefit from a safe being fitted in each room, however they do offer a perfectly serviceable 24hour safe deposit box in reception. This is the only thing that I can think of and I can't find fault with this great hotel. I'd suggest you take more notice of the European reviews than the Americans as I feel that many of them really have little idea of what it is to travel in Europe and stay in some of these fabulous cities.

<Content>Horrific Experience After a long ride from Amalfi (site seeing along the way) my family and I entered the lobby of the Hotel Cellai and was somewhat taken aback. The website that we viewed when we booked, was not what we were realizing. We registered and went to a family member's room. The room was the size of a small walk-in closet and was very old, dark, hot and stuffy. We then went to our own rooms and found double rooms just a little larger than the very small single but equally as dark, old, stuffy, and hot (air conditioning was unable to reasonably cool the rooms). All of the group agreed that we could not stay in this very tired, unappealing, and uncomfortable hotel. Luckily we found a lovely hotel across the street, Hotel Carolus, which was less expensive than the Cellai. To our great surprise, they were able to accommodate us all. The rooms were bright, cool, and tasteful. Thank you Hotel Carolus..........staying in the Cellai was something our group could not and would not have been able to do. Hotel Cellai needs to update their website realistically!!!!

<Content>stay far way from this hotel I had walked by this hotel last year and liked the location - i did not, however, go in - big mistake!!! We ckecked in and within the hour checked out - losing 1 night's cost. The minute I walked in I knew we were in trouble - the lobby and common areas were dark, dirty and very worn. The rooms were tiny and dirty - the windows opened onto dirty shutters and grimmy glass. The air conditioning not so good. The bathroom looked okay although we weren't there long enough for a closer look. There were 6 of us occupying 2 double and 2 single rooms - all of the rooms were the same caliber - old, tired and very worn and not particularly clean. The double costs 169 euros or $270. When we said we were checking out the woman said she had other rooms (we were not interested in seeing any others and why hadn't we been given those to begin with). We weren't told about any of the amenities of the hotel such as the roof top etc. This hotel is definitely not the one in the pictures on the web site - talk about false advertising at its bestFortunately we were able to find another hotel 1 block down the street -The Carolus- that could accomadate us. We looked at the rooms and we extremely happy with the cleanliness, hard wood floors and decor - it was light and cheery with air conditioning that worked well. We immediately checked in and checked out of the Cellai.Staying at the Cellai would have certainly tainted our stay in Florence whereas the Carolus enhanced it.

<Content>Quaint and Charming My husband and I enjoyed our stay at Hotel Cellai . We enjoyed our spacious room, all the lovely hotel decor throughout the hotel (it is fun to explore the hotel). The rooftop garden was especially nice with great views of Florence. The breakfast was also very nice. We took many photos in the hotel.One suggestion: We took the cheapest room which was just okay. Our friends took the next price level and their room decor was so much nicer.

<Content>Smelly in Florence Stayed at this hotel with 35 people as part of a GoAhead tour. I think this was the first time the tour provider used this Hotel. The numerous problems are as follows. Hotel staff was rude and not very helpful. Hotel is old and rooms are very small. Air conditioning is not great. Some persons found black mold in their shower and in the refrigerator. No safes in the room and front desk wouldn't take responsability for storing passports and other valuables. Air conditioning units leaked water on carpeting and smelled moldy. Sewer smell coming from shower drain. Overall location not very close to Duomo or Ponte Vecchio. Breakfast left much to be desired.

<Content>Charming Cellai We booked a last minute room for 3 nights last week via Expedia and thought the price very good for a city centre hotel. The Cellai was everything we hoped it would be. The staff were friendly and helpful and our room was cool (there was a heatwave while we were there) and quaint. It was too hot to use the roof terrace and we did not see a barman although I'm sure we could have ordered a drink if we wanted one. Breakfast was adequate but we expect no more when staying in Italian hotels. We did request a room with bath at the back of the hotel so perhaps we did the right thing, although the street did not seem particularly busy at night.A very pleasing break at a charming hotel.

<Content>Unpleasant room at Cellai I booked the Hotel Cellai for one night after searching for a hotel around the 拢120 mark close to the train station. Upon arriving at the hotel I was quite pleased as the communal areas are really very pleasant. However, when we made our way to the room I was very disappointed. Our room was on the first floor, the first door on the left as you ascend the stairs. It was very small, dirty and had a horrible air conditioning unit that was dusty and full of stale water, and the bathroom was very grotty. The carpet was old and the whole room was in desperate need of redecoration. Certainly not 3 star. The room was very noisy throughout the evening, as the stairs were next to the head of the bed where we were sleeping and you could hear everyone's footsteps. The breakfast was ok, but I was rather upset to find a fly floating in my coffee which took me ages to get in the first place as the waiters ignored us when we sat down to eat. I wouldn't recommend this hotel. Last time I stayed in Florence I stayed in Hotel Casci, and for the same price and very similar location it was much nicer. I'm glad we were only staying for one night this time!

<Content>Pass on the Cellai The hotel was not up to our expectations. The staff was not at all friendly or very helpful.The free bicycles are a welcome perk, but they book up VERY quickly. The breakfast room was very small and crowded and not much of a selection after staying at other hotels in Italy.We had a room in the front. It was extremely noisy every night from street traffic and very loud pedestrians.I did not feel safe walking on the streets by myself as I had other cities, including Rome.

<Content>Forgettable - or memorable for the wrong reasons Okay, so the location is convenient and it's only supposed to be a three star, but I think that's being a little optimistic. We stayed at other three-stars in Venice, Rome and Paris that were much better than this.Travelling with our six-month old baby, we arrived to learn they didn't know we had a baby, which is odd because we had emailed them about a crib and did get a response. Anyway, to her credit, the woman at the desk immediately said the room wouldn't be big enough to accommodate the baby and promised to move us to a bigger room the next day. Okay, but honestly the room they put us in wasn't even big enough for two adults. Seriously, I know European rooms are small but there was no place to even put a suitcase down - except on the bed, which is a little inconvenient when it comes time to sleep.So, next day we moved to a bigger room. All fine, until we came back to find it filled with some sort of foul burning smell. It was like there was a serious electrical fire happening. When we called the front desk to find out what was going on, I kid you not we were told No, not possible. Just wait in your room. Lovely. We tell you it smells like the hotel is on fire and you say wait in your room. When someone finally did come up, they agreed it was a problem and it turned out it was due to some electrical work they were doing. So, again to their credit, they moved us to yet another room.But overall the staff was less than welcoming, the service was not service at all, and the hotel itself was not terribly impressive. It reminded me of Fawlty Towers - a cheap hotel that likes to try to pretend to be something better than it is. There are lots of other hotels in the same area, and I'd be willing to bet that most would offer a better experience than this place.

<Content>Good Value: Small April 08 my wife and 2 friends stayed in two rooms at the Cellai, Florence. The rooms very greatly. Our room was small, theirs large. All together, the rooms were nice, up-to-date, and clean. Breakfast was the normal european bread, jellies, yogurt and cereal with great coffee. It was 75 euro a night for us, but that's because we were walk in customers on a holiday weekend. Still, overall good value.

<Content>Florence, Hotel Cellai, A stay I will never forget I just got back from a trip in Florence where I stayed at the Hotel Cellai.The hotel is perfectly located in the historic center, and the nice surprise was that the hotel provides free bicycles to visit around the city.In the web site I have managed to get all information about my trip before actually being in Florence, and when I called the hotel to get more in depth information about few events, they were ready to help.I like very much the originality expressed in the design of the lobby, the bar and the rooms. It also has a wonderful terrace where you can enjoy a rooftop view of Florence in candlelight.The owner is very attentive to details and spared no expenses for the refurbishment and the decor. Antic furnitures and marvelous cotto pavements are the two features that made me wow.This is a unique boutique hotel which I was lucky to find by chance on the internet.Stay there when you are in Florence. It is worth it.

<Content>Loved Florence Nice size rooms and very clean. Very old hotel with lots of charm.The staff was kinda snotty. A nice walk from the train station, when walking to the hotel you pass lots of cute shops. When we were in Florence it was before christmas and there was lots of special shops all over. Great location for all the museums and places to eat. There breakfast wasn't much we just grabbed some rolls and an apple to get us through until lunch. Also when traveling in winter be pepared with lots of layers. We are from so ca and I can't remember when I was that cold before ha ha.

<Content>Just OK, ended negatively, unfortunately I felt it was not only necessary but my obligation to write a review on this hotel after staying there last weekend. I read the Trip Advisor reviews and read pros and cons to this hotel. I couldn't decide which to really consider prior to going there. The room I had was a double (2-single beds). The cleanliness was just okay, the bathroom was fine, good shower, the beds were just ok, the breakfast in the mornings were ok the dining room was freezing every morning and the food was basic but good. THE STAFF (uggh...here we go...) How do I say this without sounding unreasonable. Firstly, the asian young woman, and an elderly man greeted us when we arrived in the evening. They were pleasant, and easy to speak to. Unfortunately the warm feeling, ended there. The other staff in the mornings, did not greet us as we entered the lobby EVERY time. They did not smile, they did nothing which felt awkward. A male (manager?) asked us to turn in our room key to him every time we left the hotel. When we asked why he said it is to know when we are there in case someone calls for us. He asked me where my key was, I reached in my pocket and held it up. He asked where the medallion/attachment was and why I had the key just by itself. I told him the medallion was too big and too heavy to carry around. (It weighs almost 1/4 lb and was big and bulky and detached easily from the key) He stated that the CELLAI hotel specifically has the BIG HEAVY item to attach to the key because AMERICANS like it that way...they did it FOR THE AMERICANS. I said I wasn't going to carry anything more than I have to when I'm traveling throughout Tuscany. He rolled his eyes and turned his gaze away in disparagement. VERY AWKWARD. We saw this man on 2 mornings following and he never greeted us when entering the hotel from shopping nor when we passed through the lobby on our way to breakfast. Another woman who worked at the front desk (mousy brown hair, heavier woman) was the person who checked us out. When I told her we were checking out and gave her the key she asked if we had anything from the BAR. I said no. She said okay...and proceeded to write on a piece of paper not looking at me. I asked, Is that it? She looked up and said Yes. I paused purposely to see if she'd say at least Thank you...but nothing. No good bye,  no THANK YOU FOR STAYING HERE WITH US, No nothing. RUDE RUDE RUDE. I will NEVER stay at this hotel even if it's the last option in Florence. The customer service was HORRIBLE except for the lovely asian woman and the man that works w/her. I own 2 businesses in America and customer service is paramount. If you are lucky enough to avoid the Morning Man and the mousy brown-haired woman, you will be okay with your stay.

<Content>loved the bathtub We found the Hotel Cellai to be very quaint and comfortable. Our room was huge-a superior double. The bathroom was very large with a wonderful tub which I put to use one evening after a very long day. The staff was very nice and helpful. Breakfast was ok. My husband has some back problems and decided to stay in one morning. He went up to the roof garden and totally enjoyed the experience ! Room was very clean!

<Content>Cellai ain't no 3-star After one night of a planned five night visit to Florence, we left for a different hotel. We were very disappointed; the room was tiny, even by European standards, and the bathroom was not clean i.e. mold in the shower. The woman who checked us in was not friendly and that set the tone for our 18 hour stay with them. Smoking maids in their break room by the elevator was a nice touch. I would stay clear of this place.

<Content>Lovely Hotel in a Ideal Location They were super helpful in booking things, such as the Uffizi, prior to our arrival. The hotel itself is lovely, although the rooms are slightly small. It is decorated with beautiful art and antiques and it has an amazing rooftop garden where you can relax after a day out and about. Highly recommended.

<Content>Do Not Stay in this Hotel  I checked into this hotel on May 14th. I traveled with two of my friends and was shocked how the pictures that are on their site don't look like the hotel in person. This hotel is a dump! All three of our rooms were run down and crapy. The bathrooms were the size of a closet with chiped tile and mold. The beds are twins pushed together and sag in the middle. When the doors close, you can see the light from the hallway from the side of the door (as the door doesn't close all the way). It would be really easy to push a locked door open. They offer an internet connection in the lounge area but no computer. I used my laptop to get a connection to Hotels.com to find a nicer hotel...THANK GOD! The sofa in the lounge had springs sticking out of the bottom of it! This hotel might of been a nice hotel a few years ago, yet it isn't now. My only regret is that I didn't take pictures in the five minutes I was there.

<Content>Living in a Palazzio Well situated. 10 min. walking to the station or to the Palazzio Vecchio.A restored palazzio converted into a pleasant ***hotel with a personal decoration and several comfortable lounges. I noticed a quote by O. Wilde on a pulpit the day we checked in.Standard rooms a bit noisy sometimes because of (noisy) people go and fro in the street. Small clean bathroom with italian shower; it smelt a bit musty.TV and remote control were out or order.Standard breakfast.The price inside the room was 235 鈧?and we paid about 60 through an Internet website.

<Content>I really loved it !!! Me an my wife spent 3 nights at Hotel Cellai from 28 to 31 october and we really enjoyed our stay. Decoration is great, full of lovely details. Staff was friendly and helpful. Breakfast was very good (dont miss their fantastic cappuccino!!!) and served in a romantic conservatory full of candles. Our room was tastefully decorated with style and with a very original touch. We also visited the other rooms and they all looked really very nice. The entire decoration is so beautiful that we asked the hotel manager where we could buy the lamps we saw in the hotel. He was very helpful and gave us lots of great advices. The terrace is really enchanting. Hotel Cellai is the perfect spot for art lovers. We will be back !!!

<Content>Worst price/quality ratio I ever experienced Dear Traveller,I stayed in this hotel from 26th September to 1st October 2006 for attending a nearby conference and continuing with a weekend holiday.The entire room was run down. Everything appeared to be heavily used, not meaning to have a nice glance of patina. The bathroom was tiny with almost no room to turn around. Funnily, the wardrobe was tiny too so that it did not close with my jackets on a hanger (I am not big actually). The TV was ridiculously small and old that I never turned it on. The quality standard of the interior in general was just mediocre maybe. The room faced a street the traffic of which woke me up early as I slept with open windows. Positive about the room was that I had a separate dressing room. The breakfast I tried once at the weekend was quite typical for southern European countries, meaning modest but acceptable, but nothing to be compared with the standards of international chains. The night porter snapped at me as if I was a foreigner when I woke him up at 4 am although he checked me in and saw me several times (it is a small hotel indeed). The cleaners banged at my door at 9 am on two days despite the fact that I left my key in the lock (do not disturb signs were not available). The other personnel behaved alright though. The waiters at breakfast were very kind indeed.The room was worth at most 80 Euros a night even taking into account high prices in Florence. I should have complained about the room but simply accepted it because I wrongly remembered my room rate to be about 120 Euros; it was above 180 Euros eventually. That was my fault indeed.My colleagues I travelled with got much nicer hotels (newly refurbished rooms, excellent breakfast and central as well) for a much lower price (less than 130 Euros).I recommend to all travellers to avoid this hotel unless you exactly know the room beforehand. As it could be a jewel hopefully the owners spend some money in refurbishing the rooms.Regards

<Content>Great property if only the staff was pleasant! Arriving in Florence at the train station, the hotel's own directions have you walking down a main street that is pretty seedy, so one's first impression is a little mixed. The truth is that the neighborhood is just fine, and completely safe, but the first impression to the neighborhood is not.Overall, I would say the hotel is a good one, particularly for people looking for European charm but American-style comfort. Our room was tiny (as was expected for Europe), but our bathroom was new and much larger than we expected. Things Americans have come to expect like large towels, soaps, shampoos, etc., were there in abundance. The staff at the hotel was, for the most part, unfriendly. I understand that European hotel staffs can be reserved, but there was never even a hello from anyone on the staff at any time that we walked in or through the lobby. This extended to the owners and management staff. The exception was the woman who manages the breakfast service, who was delightful!Location is outstanding for visiting the sites. No one in their right mind would drive in Florence, so a walkable location is key. The roof terrace is a great place to nap in the afternoon, or for an evening cocktail. When one asks, he finds out that cocktail service is available; that information is not shared without a specific request, however. Noise was not a problem for us, but I can see where it might be for some. I would recommend that a visitor see the room before accepting it, because the rooms (from what we could see) run the gamut in size and style.One thing to the hotel's credit is a little pamphlet left in the room, with a list of 24 activities to pamper oneself in Florence. We did many of the recommended things, all of which were excellent!Based upon the reviews I read and my own experiences, it seems to be a great little hotel, but the staff consistently turns people off with their indifferent attitude. When pushed for a response the staff was fine, but certainly don't go out of their way to be pleasant or helpful.

<Content>Sooo Beautiful I LOVE hotel Cellai and have stayed there on about 5 occassions. From the buzzing of the Vespa's from the street below ( hey guys, this is Italy and I don't think double glazing will be in keeping with a period building). The roof terrace is also charming, especially in lovely weather - with those views of the Duomo and the rooftops of Florence!I would say that 9/10 of the staff there are very nice - there is one exception - always frosty even when one tries to make pleasantries - and this is what lets the hotel down.On the whole I have found the nice people to be extremely accomodating and the atmosphere and decor is totally wonderful ! I took my mum there and she thoroughly enjoyed the ambience. I will continue to stay there despite the sour reception girl (sorry! but after a 12 hour door to door journey, sometimes I dread her being on reception for me to book in). On the upside, the lady who organises the breakfast is mature and very pleasant :0) They will watch your bags and let you hang out in the lounge area after you have checked out. Which is a great advantage , when you have a few hours to kill before leaving for the airport. 9/10 .... could be 10/10 if it was 100% service with a smile :0)

<Content>Too small, too noisy We just returned from Florence 4/16-4/18 and three sleepless nights at the Hotel Cellai. Our room was in the front on a busy street, the street sounds echoed terribly and the noise continued all night long. When the people in the room upstairs rolled their luggage across the room, it sounded like a thunderstorm in our room. After both the 1st and 2nd nights, we requested a quieter room and were told there were none available. I did not feel the hotel staff was very accomodating. The room, with 2 twin beds, was exceptionally small and the bathroom was as well. I would not recommend this hotel AT ALL!!

<Content>Should have checked Trip Advisor I stayed at the Cellai from 5 April to 9 April, 2006, after requesting a quiet room with a bathroom for under one hundred euro per night at the hotel reservations office at Santa Maria Novella train station.On initially sighting the single room with shower, toilet and bidet, I was taken aback. However, after battling with my luggage to get there and being tired hot and hungry (and knowing that I was not going to be in the room much) I decided to stay. In hindsight this was not a good decision.Whilst the room was reasonably quiet, it was not 3 star (as it purported to be) based on other places I subsequently stayed in Italy and France. I also got some bites on my hand, presumably 篓bed bugs篓 ?The staff appeared to be working in the wrong industry (ie hospitality), with sour demeanours and general lack of helpfulness all round.

<Content>Avoid booking hotel Cellai Florence Despite booking this hotel in November 2005 (and paying then), when we turned up for our two day visit to Florence on Friday 3rd March 2006, there was no room at the inn for us. Alternative arrangements had been made by the hotel staff and we had to spend one night at a neighbouring 4 star hotel. This itself was no great hardship, but the following day we then had to pack again and relocate back to Cellai. As our visit to Florence was measured in hours, the time involved in this tooing and froing was greatly resented. When I suggested to the Cellai staff that we just stay at the alternative accommodation for our two night stay I was informed that this was not an option. To make matters worse, the breakfast served on the morning of our departure,before 8.00am was poor in the extreme. We had to leave for the airport without a hot drink of any kind, none being available .

<Content>Ugh! My husband and I were booked into the Cellai by a travel agent during our honeymoon. I can only assume she did so because she had never stayed there before! The hotel room was incredibly tiny, especially given the $200 dollar price tag at the time. The bathroom was very narrow, and the toilet was situated right next to the shower. It might has well been a shower-toilet (a la hostel style), because thats what it felt like. The bathroom flooded anytime someone used the shower, and the drain must have been stopped up, because one showered generally standing in about 1 inch of water. I recall that the receptionist was rude when we checked in. Even tho the Cellai was billed as having air conditioning (and in May at that time, it was needed), somehow the staff felt that it wasn't time yet to turn it on-- we almost demanded our money back for having an air-conditioned room before the staff grudgingly turned on the AC! We later saw the same receptionist chain smoking on the roof-veranda.The roof-veranda however was the most charming thing about the hotel. We would go there every night to escape our room. In general, i am SURE there must be better hotels in florence for the same or less money. it seems impossible not to!

<Content>Just OK We stayed at Hotel Cellai in Florence for two nights. The location was great, not too far from the train station and in good walking distance from all the sites. The hotel lobby was very nice, and the staff was also very friendly. Breakfast was ok. There was a very nice rooftop garden to relax on.The rooms were average (we stayed in the standard double), small of course, but they were clean. The room didn't look anything like the photos on the website, but I suppose they were only showing the more expensive rooms. The only real complaint we had is that the walls were thin and the noise from the hallway and surrounding rooms were very loud. Overall, the hotel was average, about on par with a Super 8. For 150euro a night I would have expected a little more. During our trip to Italy, we stayed in 6 different hotels and this one was our least favorite

<Content>Distrustful! Please stay away We booked the hotel two weeks in advance. They said that the day we wanted to book was full but there was room available on the next day so we agreed to change our plan to stay there. We called them the morning we will arrive to make sure that they did not mess up our reservation. They said everything is fine. So we drove from Genova to Florence and arrive in Florence about 3pm and found out that they did not have room for us. The reason they gave us was the previous guest did not move out and they can't ask them to leave so they tried to move us to another hotel near by. But we said no. We never believe the reason they gave us and we don't want to deal with distrustful person. So we decide to stay in another hotel outside florence which turned out that it is much better and cheaper. We will advice anyone to stay here to be very careful.

<Content>Wasn't so terrible............................. After a so-so time in Venice, it was off to Florence and the Hotel Cellai. The hotel lobby was a little dark and dreary but at least we were welcomed with a hello (unlike in Venice). The room was small (expected) and definitely smelled of smoke even though the receptionist insisted it was a non-smoking room. The location of the hotel was great. Walking distance to everything. Very close to the train station which was very important for us because of day trips we planned. The hotel staff gave good suggestions for restaurants (must go to Il Latini). If you plan on going on a wine tour, book with Tuscan Trails. Todd is a great host and the 3 stops we made were amazing. Would I stay there again.........possibly!

<Content>Lovely! My husband and I traveled to Florence in July and were hoping for a clean, air-conditioned room at the Hotel Cellai. What we found was a beautiful hotel, complete with cozy lounges, dark wood accents and a pleasant staff. The air conditioning actually worked, unlike our hotels in Rome and Venice. The room had a king-size bed, spacious bathroom and tuscan decor throughout. Breakfast was unimpressive. The staff at the hotel was more than happy to give us directions, suggestions and make reservations for us - never expecting a tip. We couldn't have been happier to find such a lovely hotel for such an exceptional value.

<Content>You can't get more for 99 鈧?#x201d; We stayed 3 nights at Cellai (14. - 17. Feb 2005) and payed 99 Euros a night for a so called Classic Room which is obviously a little bit larger than the average room, however the bathroom is very very tiny.We made the reservation directly via the Hotel麓s website about 4 weeks in advance.Our room (#206) wasn麓t really clean but very dark (no roof lights) and very noisy, the TV is indeed very tiny and not working properly and the A/C could not heat up the room.Breakfast is fine.Free bike rental and internet point available.Location is great (only about 10 minutes walking distance from all main attractions).Staff is unfriendly.This was our 4th stay in Florence (Crocini Hotel, Baglioni, BW Capitol) and I guess one cannot expect more for 99 Euros.Tip: pls. use the garage if travelling by car (25 Euros for 24hrs) - you will not find a parking place anywhere; if yes, your car will be towed away (100 Euros)

<Content>Could be so much better Stayed in December 2004 and was disappointed with the Hotel. The information gives the impression that it is a friendly oasis of tranqillity in the city. It could have been, but the promised classical music turned out to be anything but restful trance/dance music which made using the public areas a trial.Most of the hotel corridors are non-smoking but there was a member of staff who smoked wherever he went - again rendering the seating areas unusable at times.The initial welcome we received was off-hand to rude. This did improve during the week, so perhaps we caught the receptionist on an off day. No excuse though.The impression we got was that the owners were away and standards were not up to scratch. With a little effort it could have been really good. The roof garden is wonderful, the furnishings pleasant and the rooms fine, if small.I hope this was just an off week.

<Content>Hotel Cellai nice location Hotel Cellai is in a good location for the price. The hotel is not in the center of all the tourist traffic. The hotel is only a five minute walk from the Duomo and a ten minute walk from the Uffizi. The San Lorenzo market is close by too. The rooms were small. The bathrooms could use a facelift. The shower was a little moldy. The rooms were also very warm no way of cooling off except opening the window and this was in December. It was nice having internet access in the lobby. The breakfast was good , nice variety. The staff was also helpful. I would stay at the Hotel Cellai again but bring flip flops for the shower!

<Content>A Very Inhospitable Stay.... but surroundings OK The Pluses:Roof Garden was nice to read in between walksThe Lobby room was cozy, but fireplace not onAccessible internet area which made it easy to check ones email...The Negatives : The horrible attitude of staff, except for 1 gentleman who manned the front desk in the evening.... otherwise, all of the staff were aloof, and seemingly not into wanting to answer any of your inquiries.... felt like I was imposing as a guest.....Bfast was OK.... staff let all the dishes pile up and were rather nonchalant about it....Rooms were small, not the cleanest, but to get rid of combination of cigarette smoke and musty smell, I kept the windows open a tad......I can live with all the above but what stood out was the bad attitude of its staff, except this one gentleman who was very helpful.....This will be my last stay at Hotel Cellai.... once is enough...

<Content>Repulsed In Florence People who previously gave this hotel good or better ratings must keep a part time hobby of rebuilding car engines in their living room. The Cellai is quite possibly one of the worst RIP-OFFS of modern day lodging. I know it's Europe, and it's old, etc. But we'd prefer to stay in places where cigarrette stank and visible mold were not the more prominent features of the hotel.The first room with which the (aloof) staff tried to set up us was nice sized, but the moment we walked in the door we were bowled over by a cancerous cigarrette ploom that would have killed us if we attempted just one night in there. Oh, but the room did come with a view: of the neighbors' undergarments hanging from balconies adjoining the building of the hotel.The second room, which we settled on, was tiny, did not possess a safe, did not possess luggage racks, and had a dank odor pulsing through the entire apartment. The kicker: a visible line of mold in the shower. The place was wretched, but we endured one night and the next day moved to one of the best values in Florence: the Davanzati (and at 20 euros less per night!). This hotel must get kick backs from travel agents all over the world, b/c that's the only reason someone would end up at this dung pile. Do not, under any circumstances, agree to stay at the Cellai.

<Content>horrible The Hotel Cellai is horrible. My husband and I arrived in Florence and the Cellai had overbooked their rooms and we had to go to another hotel for that one evening. It was a big inconvience for my husband and I. The next day we had to lug our luggage back to the Cellai. The rooms were tiny. We specifically requested a double bed, we got two twins. The air condition was not working properly. There was no safe in the room. We stayed there two more nights and our sheets were not changed. We complained and our complaints were viewed as a nuisance. I would have cancelled and stayed somewhere else but all hotels in Florence were booked.

<Content>better off setting up a tent in Florence I stayed at the Hotel Cellai last November and I was not a happy camper. The toilets did not work.. you had to beat it to get it to work.. not a pleasant experience. Also, once we transferred out of the room with toilet issues we then wanted to go to our new room after we had dinner. The concierge at the front desk would not give us our key.. I would never go back to this hotel. I would rather put up a tent under the David Statue.

<Content>Such a kind staff We stayed at Hotel Cellai for 3 days. It's a nice hotel, not fancy, but it was very clean and comfortable. The staff at the hotel was truly the gem. Most everyone who worked the front desk spoke English (or there was someone very accessible who did), and they were all very patient with the fact that we most certainly did not. We asked directions to the nearest American Express on our first day, and not only did the woman give us the address, she also gave us a map and marked the hotel and the American Express office on it. The night before we left we called the front desk and asked the best way to get to the airport. The man arranged a car for us that was much cheaper than a taxi would have been. To top it all off, when I called the hotel frantic from Paris because I had lost a piece of jewelry and wanted them to check the room just in case, they immediately sent a staff member to the room to search for it. I called back 10 minutes later to see if they'd found anything, and the man said they'd be glad to express ship the necklace to me in the States. I had it back in my hands 3 days later. Now that's service!

<Content>Wonderful! The Hotel Cellai is the perfect base for sightseeing in Florence. There are interesting pictures throughout the hotel and the sittingrooms look like something out of a museum. The room was cosy and the bathroom was very clean. The staff was extremely helpful and suggested the Restaurant Quattro Amici for good seafood. Good value for money.

<Content>So so We stayed at the Cellai during a weekend getaway in Florence. Staff was friendly although overburdened during breakfast and cleaning hours. Decoration and living rooms original and homely. Room and bathroom were tiny and not very clean. Lots of stains on carpet and stench of smoke I'm afraid. Cold. Overall not a place I would visit again.

<Content>Perfectly fine for the Money Sufficient for my purposes. A clean, small room to sleep in (who is there more than that?), a decent breakfast (except for the coffee) to start the day on, a typical Florentine staff (cool but polite), and a roof garden that I thoroughly enjoyed. I stayed 9 nights for a reasonable price, and would go back.

<Content>Terrible Stay away from Hotel Cellai. The room was not particularly clean, the TV was tiny and had an ancient remote control that was not working. Mosquito stains on the walls. Heating was bad as well.
