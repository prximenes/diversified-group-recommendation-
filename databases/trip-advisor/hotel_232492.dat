<Content>BEST OF THE BEST BY FAR Being a frequent traveller for both business and pleasure, I have to say that Hotel De L'Europe has been one of the very best hotels I have ever stayed at. The location is excellent, the service is friendly and impecable and the rooms are spotless. It is both an architectural and historical monument and for all of us who are smokers it is still offering not only smoking rooms but also a wonderful smoking lounge with a beautiful view.Both restaurants in the hotel are considered to be of the best in Amsterdam and finally special thanks to the Concierge for all their helpful information.N.H. - Cyprus

<Content>Beautiful hotel with friendly staff We stayed at this hotel the last weekend before christmas. We booked it through our membership card of lhw.com. I would like to really emphasize the outstanding approach of the staff that is very rare and exceptional even in similar five star facilities. I believe this could be connected with the fact that the hotel is still privately owned by wealthy Dutch family.First of all, we checked-in early as we took early morning flight from Prague. It was absolutely no problem for the front desk. Secondly, we were upgraded from deluxe room to a beautiful spacious junior suite. And last but no least, we checked-out almost five hours after required time (after previous approval by front desk) and it was againg absolutely no problem and we were not charged any additional payment for this. The staff was helpful also in respect of our other requirements: taxi, reservations etc.The suite itself was very very spacious with beuatiful bed and antique style furniture. On the other hand, it was little bit dark and maybe little bit shabby. Anyway, this was no problem for us and we liked the suite very much as it was very convenient.I can also recommend the hotel formal restaurant Excelsior. The food was outstanding and the view of Amstel river is very beautiful. On the other hand the price was quite high for every day dining and the wine was poor (its my fault as I selected it :o) but it was included in the section recommended wines so I hoped...).Our overall impression was very positive and we will definitely come backy in 2009 as we liked the hotel and Amsterdam itself very much!

<Content>Good Service My parents decided to treat us to a luxury stay in Amsterdam. They chose the Hotel De L'Europe for my four children and I. They had good service and tasty food, though obviously quite expensive. The breakfast buffet was large, but not worth the price. We also didn't like the smoky aroma in the hotel lobby and halls. We had a non-smoking room, thankfully though. The air conditioning was fine. Very spacious bathrooms. Overall, it was a nice hotel, but not for the price that you pay. Also, they have computers in the lobby that you can use to get on the internet and stuff. It is ridiculously expensive though, at 12 euro for unlimited all day. We didn't try it out.

<Content>Lovely, and great location! I was actually a little nervous about booking this hotel, based on other Trip Advisor traveller comments, but went ahead on the recommendation of a travel agent. It was a fantastic stay, and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again! The hotel is in a great location, right on the River Amstel, and our room had a fantastic view overlooking the busy and fun water scene. We had our 8-year-old daughter with us, and the staff could not have been more friendly and sweet to her. The housekeeping staff always made sure to tuck her stuffed animals in when making up the room! The breakfast buffet, while expensive, was great. I can't understand other traveller complaints, because in addition to the table full of eggs, bacon ,sausage, breads, cheese, pastries, fruit, juice, yogurt, smoothies, etc, the buffet also includes made-to-order waffles, pancakes or omelettes. Great food, excellent service. The pool is very nice - it is small, and a little crowded when more than a few kids in it, but the warm temperature was great, and the pool staff very sweet with our daughter. One note: if you have very young children, or those that don't swim well, be aware that the shallow end of the pool is still pretty deep. Bring water wings if that's an issue...Overall a great stay. The front desk was super helpful with changing money, making Anne Frank internet ticket reservations for us, assisting with a window display jewelry purchase, etc. It's a lovely hotel, and we'd highly recommend it!!

<Content>A class act We stayed three nights over the Easter weekend, and had a great time. The hotel has a very luxurious feel. and maintains very high standards of service, including helpful reception staff, and an efficient maid service, with the Bulgari products in the bathroom regularly replenished. As it was Easter, we were given a small chocolate Easter gift on two evenings, and a chocolate bunny on departure.We dined one evening in Le Relais Brasserie, the less formal of the two restaurants, which we were very pleased with. We also considered the choice of food at the buffet breakfast to be reasonably comprehensive.The location of the hotel is fantastic for sightseeing; we walked everywhere. Amsterdam is a beautiful city, and well worth a visit.

<Content>Anniversary present for husband We did not book before we went and this hotel was one of the first we came upon as we drove into Amsterdam. We stayed for 4 days and had a wonderful time in the city and walked miles. The hotel was in a good location and clean. Staff were lovely and always helpful.Found it to be very expensive but enjoyed the luxury. No tea or coffee making facilities. Tea was a tea bag in hot water - no milk.Carpark is an added extra - will fly next time

<Content>Kind of luxury hotel Haven't stayed in hotel myself but booked for close people one night for 2 persons and 2 nights for one. Interior of the hotel is really nice and historic. Check in was quick and without problems. Having chosen run of house option while booking at hotel web site I hoped for the best they have, however as we arrived early (~10 a.m.) we were given quite modest standard room which might be good for 3-4 stars but for 5 stars hotel it needs some cosmetic renovation. There was a small window with view on flower market a bed of good size, a bit small bathroom. Air conditioner was producing sounds as if it was 20 years old. Lift which we used was very original - with soft bench. Another word about hotel's restaurant - we booked a table on the terrace, but without telling us in advance they closed it because there could be rain (there was no rain at that evening) and placed us in the center of the hall (not very pleasant). Sommelier was very helpful and helped us to choose the right wine, pianist was brilliant. Waiters were not so we had to pour that wine on our own. Food was of average quality - that is no bad but not very tasty. For 3 persons we've spent 268 euro. There is a very nice Freddy's bar with always fresh Heineken beer (3,5 euro per small glass). In general experience was more or less positive and in we paid 275 for first night and 268 for next 2 plus 12 euro per day of city tax. Breakfast was 25 euro per person but we haven't tried it.

<Content>Beautiful old-world hotel in prime location This is a beautiful old-world hotel right in the middle of Amsterdam and steps away from the flower market. The rooms are lovely and the service is exceptional. Rooms with balconies overlooking a canal are particularly pleasant. The meeting rooms are a little bit plain but there's nothing to complain about. Overally, my experience here was excellent and I would definitely return.

<Content>My favorite hotel in Europe I stayed at this hotel many times in the 1980s and on returning in April 2007 was delighted to find it as good as ever. Beautiful room, plenty of space, lovely bathroom, friendly and knowledgeable staff, everything working just as it should. And the restaurant is as good as ever -- yes, it should be, for the price. But it does everything well and there is the added delight of watching boats on the canals just below the restaurant window. What a pleasure to visit again.

<Content>Loved every thing about it I was very surprised that I loved the room and the location as much as I did. It was perfect for a first visit. I absolutely would come back to this hotel again. It is the best location of all the hotels to see everything in Amsterdam. I got the room upgrade with American Express booking which was wonderful the room was beautiful, the staff was gracious. It was perfect. I give it 5 star all the way around. I cannot wait to go back.

<Content>Where are my pants? I stayed here on business in June 2006. This is a 5-star hotel with good location in Amsterdam, right across from the Munt Tower and the flower stalls. I don't even want to guess what it cost, but it must have been expensive. The rooms are huge for Amsterdam, with a decor that (is supposed to) resemble Napolenic decor. The staff is professional and courteous, but not very friendly. There is no iron in the room, so you have to send it out. They will iron one item per day for free, then it's $10 per item. One day a pair of pants never made it back. It took forever for them to find the pair - they had been delivered to the wrong room. When it came back, there was a women's outfit with it, even though I was staying by myself. Worst of all, the staff didn't seem too alarmed and did not try too hard to find my clothes - I had to repeatedly bother them, and it took several hours to correct the situation. Unless you are staying here on business or have a large amount of free money to throw around, I would go elsewhere.

<Content>Good Location, Tired Decor We stayed here for 3 nights in July on our way to Turkey. The location is wonderful. It is right on a canal and walking distance to a tramline. I booked this hotel based on tripadvisor reviews and photos I saw on the website. I am thankful we stayed on points and didn't have to pay the $500 plus it would have cost us per night. We booked 2 rooms, one with a king bed and one with twins for our girls. Thankfully, we were able to get rooms which had a connecting door. I can see that this Old World traditinal hotel was a grandly decorated hotel when new, but it could do with updating. It looked like Old World traditional. The bathrooms were marble, updated and a nice size though. We arrived during a heatwave so had to use the air conditioning which was barely passable. I found it annoying that housekeeping opened the windows when they cleaned the rooms, letting in all of the hot air, so we never came back at the end of the day to a cool room. The front desk was diplomatic but not friendly. We opted for convenience over price and ate breakfast in the dining room which was fantastically expensive (about $22 per person for the buffet). We never ate lunch or dinner there since there were much more interesting, and cheaper options nearby. The clientele seemed to be older couples. There were very few families. The indoor swimming pool is a spa pool and tiny - just enough to paddle around in. I did like the small size of the hotel though. It was quiet. In fact, I don't think there were many people staying at the hotel, given it's price, since there are probably much better options at half the price in the same area.

<Content>Quite run down... I stayed in this luxury hotel recently, as it is part of the American Express Platinum hotels, but I am truly disappointed about this hotel. It is a Leading Hotel of the World, but it is so run down and shabby, I could not believe it. The room is very mediocre in its design. All is working in the room but I was hoping for a special experience and did not get that feeling in this hotel unfortunately. The staff is very friendly and apologetic, they must have sensed I was not totally satisfied, although I did not want to tell them their hotel needs a complete overhaul, I am sure they know that themselves even better than me... Trust me, if you want an experience, go to the Amstel Hotel, it is more expensive but worth every penny more in terms of (classic) design, comfort and amenities.

<Content>good hotel As being a Dutchman I was very surprised by reading the negative tripreports about this hotel: De L'Europe does have a great name in The Netherlands. I was booked in this hotel by a client of our company and therefor able to check it myself.The hotel is at a great spot, at the corner of a crossing of busy canals, very close to the Rembrand plein and the Shopping area. The outside of the building is very impressive. This is continued inside. It is all in the same traditional style, which is well maintained. My room was at the Canal side, with a small balcony. What a great view, absolutely super. The room contains everything that it should contain, including airconditioning (which is not always the case in 4/5 starts hotels in the Netherlands!). Also the rooms are in a traditional style, which fits into the expectations of the building exterior. Room was decently sized, bathroom size also. Bathroom is not very modern, but everything was clean and working fine. Staff of the hotel was as friendly as they should be (8 out of a raning of 10). I did not try the restaurant, but it has a great reputation in Amsterdam. Breakfast was ok.Conclusion: De L'Europe is a great hotel, especially if you like hotels that take care of traditions.

<Content>Freezing cold A 2 night stay in a suiye on top floor of hotel, on arrival all heating in the suite was switched off. This in January with -3 C temp !!. The bathroom is heated only by a towel rail so never warmed up and on 2nd day just as the room was comfy housekeeping came in and switched the heating off again. This is unbelievable behavior in any hotel let alone a 5* one. The living room had a view of a dirty terrace with old fireworks and cigarette ends on it. The bedroom no view. Tried afternoon tea in the lounge, the food and tea not great and the service so bad it became a comedy. Good points, most staff were friendly and the hotel is clean, the location is also great.

<Content>Nothing special I stayed at the Hotel de l'Europe for four nights over Thanksgiving weekend 2005. We chose the Hotel de l'Europe largely because we went with another couple, who were able to use points at this hotel to get one night's lodging free. We paid 300 Euros per night and were upgraded to a large, top-floor suite facing the courtyard. While I did not think this was a superb hotel--no way is it in the same class as the Amstel-Intercontinental (nor is it nearly as expensive)--it is not as bad as some of these reviews indicate. The hotel is centrally located on the Amstel River. Almost all tourist attractions are within easy walking distance. While not far as the crow flies, the red-light and coffeeshop districts seem distant. So you don't have to deal with that stuff like you might if you stayed at the Sofitel. Although our room was not ready until 3:00 pm (tough when you're jet-lagged), I found the hotel staff to be professional and courteous. Desk staff, for example, confirmed and requested changes to restaurant reservations I had previously made. Bellhops assisted with luggage and hailed cabs. Our room was almost ridiculously large, with a huge bedroom and separate sitting room, two tvs, and tons of closets. The bathroom was huge but was cold because other than a heated towel rack, it did not have a separate heater. The bed was comfortable and the bed linens were pretty nice, but they were not luxurious. The room was clean and there was nightly turn down service. The bedroom was obviously stylized to be grand. The effort shows. I agree with some of the other reviews that suggest the hotel could use some sprucing up. We sampled the breakfast buffet once--it is a ripoff. We did not dine at the restaurant for dinner. We did have drinks several nights at the hotel's small bar before going out. Nothing to write home about. The fitness room needs to be significantly rethought. It is adjacent to an extremely small pool in an interior space on the first floor. There are no windows. There is one treadmill, one stairmaster, and one bike machine. The way these machines are positioned, you exercise looking at yourself in a mirror. The hotel crammed a whole bunch of idiotic life-fitness weight machines in the rest of this small room, as well as a rack of free weights. Keep the free weights, move some more cardio machines in, and get rid of the rest. Better yet, find a new space for the fitness room. If you have the money and want to splurge, the Amstel-Intercontinental, while not centrally located, seemed to be the place to be if you want a really classic, elegant, and luxurious hotel experience. We went to the Amstel Thanksgiving evening. We enjoyed incredible drinks at its bar and ate a great meal at La Rive, its fine restaurant. Both venues overlook the river. As a result, we went back to the Amstel two nights later to again have superb cocktails before going out to dinner someplace else. Having taken a beautiful walk to the Amstel along the river, we were able to see the Amstel's gym. It has large plate glass windows looking out on the river, allowing its guests to exercise with a prime river view. I think that pretty much sums up the difference between the two hotels. If you can stay in the Hotel de l'Europe for a reasonable price and don't expect to have a special experience, you'll be satisfied. But if you're looking for something special, this is not the place.

<Content>Shabby WE have stayed in Amsterdam several times over the last few years and this time we thought we would try the Hotel de L'Europe. What a disappointment! It wasn't worth the money we paid for the room and and breakfast.Since we were staying here for the first time we booked a river view room expecting something special. This was not the case.The hotel could be something and probably was in its day. Everything from the room to the lounge to the bar was very fadded and shabby.Maybe what the hotel needs is a grand refurbishment.Never again! There are too many grand hotels in Amsterdam that one could choose instead of this hotel.

<Content>never again, money doesn't buy class I picked this hotel because of it's beautiful web site. Next time I will be more careful. Our intentions were to stay 6 nights. The cost was in excess of $500.00 per night. When we arrived we were directed to the room no one helped us to our room. We had to carry our own bags. Half an hour later someone came to the room to describe it to us. The second morning we were there I put on a pair of jeans a shirt and a pair of shoes and went to the lobby at 6:30 am to use the internet. I asked the woman behind the desk for the use of the internet. She looked me up and down and with an arrogant tone asked YOUR STAYING HERE I said yes and after searching for me in the hotel computer finally allowed me to use the internet. Later that day I needed to use the internet again and another woman helped me and was much nicer. When I told her of my earlier experience she replied that in defence of her collegue sometimes people come in off the street. I told her that I didn't come in from the street but down from my room via the elevator, she replied that sometimes the guests bring people in from the street. She did not appologize but had a similar arrogant attitude. I recommended to her that the manager of the hotel should spend a few nights at the Amigo Hotel in Brussels, where I had stayed before coming to this hotel, so that they might understand what good service is like. In a huff she said she would tell him. I went to the hotel next to the de L'Europe a 3 star hotel on the same canal and found although it was a little worn the people were extremely nice and offered a room at less than half the price of the de L'Europe. We had a very nice room, excellent bathroom, over looking the same canal and saved almost $1200.00 dollars. On top of this the de L'Europe had charged us $56.00 for a breakfast we never had. They took it off the bill at the time but when the credit card bill came after getting back to the states they had recharged it. Obviously in this case money doesn't buy class.

<Content>Mediocre and expensive I state here with my busines partner, having boked two double rooms.Both smelt strongly of stale tobacco, and were dated - more like a faded english B and B than a 5 star city centre hotel.The restaurant was poor. Mediocre food, inept, affected service. 20 minute wait for drinks. Wrong dishes being produced from the kitchen. Room service breakfast - without TEA. How can a $450us / night hotel run out of BREAKFAST TEA!!!!!Apparently the place belongs to the Heineken brewery people. Like the beer - mediocre, yet unaccountably popular.Check out the Amstel instead.

<Content>Elegant but not Perfect Spent two weeks at this hotel in Feb. The building is well located and has been remodeled to a very high standard by the late patriarach of the Heineken family. Certainly the type of building one would expect to find in Amsterdam. Quaint yet elegant. For the ten days we had a Deluxe Canal Front Room with a king bed and lavish bathroom that was spacious and elegant. I would highly recommend these rooms and they provide a true 5 star experience. When we had to extend our stay despite being the low season, the hotel was fully booked and we had to move a a standard double room. It was cramped had no view and two twin beds. The worst room I have ever occupied in a 5 star hotel. Highlights include a great gym, indoor plunge pool and very good dining at the main restaurant. The bar is cramped and needs to be redone. The main dining room is superb. All in all, I would recommend this hotel if you are able to get a good deal (not rack rate) and do not stay in the standard rooms.

<Content>Good, but nothing more. First, it must be emphasised that my review of this hotel needs to be put in perspective. Of course, the hotel falls within the luxury category; of course, you will not find dirty linen and neither will you be mistreated by the staff. However, it certainly does not deserve to be one of the Leading Hotels of the World - something which I have grown accustomed to regard more as a sacred text rather than a mere hotel directory. The exterior is mostly unimpressive; indeed, the spectacular night shot splattered all over promotional materials is, at the very least, deceiving. The lobby is equally uncharacteristic - more appropriate in a good 4-star hotels than in a deluxe 5-star property. No specific complaints about the rooms: everything was there and everything functioned appropriately, but this sort of hotels should offer that indescribable additional factor which, in my opinion, was lacking here. Another thing that struck me as belonging to a lesser-standard establishment was the corridors: a mixture of conservative classicism and awful 70s door frames - very uncool. On a more positive note, the restaurant Excelsior is pretty decent and more than reasonably priced.That said, I must acknowledge that I managed to find the rooms at a discounted rate (around 鈧?50 at lhw.com) and, accordingly, these complaints do appear to have a somewhat pedantic tone. However, if you were to pay the rack rate for the rooms, which orbits around 鈧?00 for doubles, my criticism would be more than justified.If you want to go to a true deluxe hotel in Amsterdam, I suggest you head, as pointed out by an earlier review, to the Amstel: a proper establishment, whose restaurant, la Rive, is also superb, though considerably pricier than the Excelsior. If you scout the web well, you may be able to find a room for around 鈧?00, which is more than fair given the standards - surprisingly high for an Inter-Continental. Also, if you are looking for a design/boutique address, and are willing to fork out at least 鈧?00 a night, then the Dylan is the place for you: by far the most stylish hotel in town, its restaurant is also worthy of mention.

<Content>...Not even one complaint! We just returned from a two-night stay at this hotel, and I have to say that the service was fantastic. I have no complaints. We stay in many five-star hotels, and I would rank this in my top five.We booked a deluxe double with a river view, and that is what we received. We were offered an upgrade to a junior-suite, but it would have been without a river view so we declined. Our room-rate included one dinner for two in the hotel's restaurant (Excelsior), and the dinner surpassed my expectations. The meal was multi-course with a different wine with each course. The food was excellent and well thought out, we were not rushed at all, and the service was top-notch and very friendly. As a matter of fact, friendly would be an accurate description for the overall service at this hotel. Every person we came in contact with - reception, waiters, bartender, maid, doorman - was friendly and provided attentive service.The location right next to the canal is just superb. You can easily walk to many of the sights because of the hotel's central location. Or, you can take the tram which stops right across the canal (about a 30 second walk).We will definitely stay here again soon.

<Content>An Excellent Stay I was interested to read the review of March 25, because I stayed at the hotel from the 18th to the 21st of March, 2005 while visiting relatives in Amsterdam. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay: the room was large and comfortable, the service excellent and hospitable in every way. Although I was on the front of the hotel, in fact, just above the front door, the room was quiet and peaceful.  Because this was a family reunion, I made dinner reservations for the 18th at the Excelsior (the hotel restaurant) for myself and my family. The meal was excellent and beautifully served. I would have to agree, however, that the bathroom needs remodeling. The colors were dark and old-fashioned and the bathtub so high and so narrow that it was difficult to negociate. All said, however, I thoroughly enjoyed the hotel and thought the location unbeatable.

<Content>Disappointed; bad value After reading positive reviews, I was surprised of the low quality of the room, food and service levels. Do people who stay at this hotel have low expectations, or was I in the twilight zone? The hotel does not even come close to the level of Intercontinental-Amstel.The room was large (faced canal) but the bathroom design was so bad that it was dangerous to get in/out of the tub. The wall was paper thin. It was impossible to get any kind of service at all, or if given it was extremely slow. At breakfast, the hotel served old bread/pastries and dried up bacon  sausages. On the second day, 2-day old pastry became 3-day old pastry. This is one of the worst value when considering the quality of service/room received as compared to the amount paid. You feel that the hotel is not spending adequate money to upkeep the place/service.That said, location is central - close to everything.

<Content>Wonderful Stay Last week my boyfriend and I stayed at the Hotel de L'Europe. As a travel agent, I try to stay at a different hotel every time I go to Amsterdam, but after this experience I can't imagine staying anywhere else. Juliette and Maarten were excellant answering my questions and getting me oriented after a long trip. They were very friendly and attentive. Every day, the staff said good morning and the doorman was always there to greet me when leaving and coming back. The location of the hotel is PERFECT, and I loved that when I opened my window in the morning, I could here the chimes from the Munt Tower. The room was VERY spacious for a European room, even for the 5 stars! There was an entrance hall, huge main room with numerous closets, cabinets and drawers and the bathroom was modern with duel shower heads, a spacious bathtub (which really counts after a long day of walking around) and a seperate glass enclosed toilet/bidet area. The bed was large and comfy, which some hotels fail to grasp the concept of. The room service was so good that I ordered it two nights in a row. Their lobster cream soup puts most French Bisque's to shame!! I have not a bad thing to say about this beautiful hotel and would highly reccomend it to any of my clients or anybody going to Amsterdam! Thank you for a wonderful stay!

<Content>Royal and Regal When we arrived there was a welcome amenity at the front desk. The doormen were very professional and welcoming. Check-in wasn't as fast as I would have liked it to be, but that was easy to look over because the beauty of the hotel and my suite that I was checked into. Before I arrived I had worked with a fellow named Marcel who was very knowledgeable and through. I had several questions and request as we were staying there for new years eve. He suggested two great party's and was able to get me VIP access at the last minute, we were thrilled! Back to the Hotel: When we entered into our suite we were taken aback. It had cathedral cielings, a huge bathroom and upgraded decor. It was kvery spacious by european standards. The bathroom had dual sinks, a seperate shower (with two shower heads), a huge soaking tub, and a bidet in addition to the regular toilet. The room also featured a doorbell. We got massages in the fitness center which is small. However it does feature a dry heat sauna, and tanning bed. Some of the intenet sites say that the hotel has a spa on site and that is not correct. They do massages on site but for the rest of the treatments you have to go to a seperate salon which I find quite inconveinent. The pool is rather small, but thats to be expected in europe from my experince. The resturant is great with traditional european cusine. Room service however is awful. Every time I ordered anything from room service my order was wrong, late or, not good. Overall the hotel is Wonderful and it is the only place I'll stay when I'm in Amsterdam.

<Content>Great service, great location We had a top floor river view room and loved it here. The service was great and it's in a very convenient area -- close to most of the major attractions in Amsterdam. We'd stay there again in a heartbeat.

<Content>hotel de l'europe Arrived at the hotel de l'europe which was a short ride from the airport in the taxi- take the town cabs instead of the independant ones or you will be paying much more for the ride. The staff were very welcoming, but our room was very small, a suite with a separate sitting room. I asked for an upgrade as we are amex card holders and we were given a superb room. The reason that the first room was small was the fact that I suffer from asthma and asked for a non-smoking room, but to be honest, the second room that we were offered was fantastic, with a view of the street and was huge, the sitting area was in the bedroom. Also the bathroom was much better. The first room had a small bath and one sink with no separate shower or toilet, and did not have a bidet. the second room was a smoking room, but I could not smell the smoke, and on the plus side it had a superb bathroom with a separate shower big enough for two, and a bath- also a separate toilet area with a bidet- bliss! The toiletries were Bulgari 'au the vert' which is my signature scent so I was very pleased. The staff could not do enough for us- the concierge 'Alex' was the most helpful man in the world- he booked us an indonesian restaurant which was fabulous- we had reservations when we entered it as it was small, hot and very busy, but the staff all spoke english and were so friendly- plus the food was exceptional. Also Alex booked us another restaurant and helped us to find places of interest, especially the sex museum! That was a must- located on Damrack- don't bother with the one in the red light district as it was rubbish! Amsterdam does not feel very safe in the red light district in the daytime as there were all sorts of characters offering us drugs, but at night (once I had left my handbag in the hotel room) it felt very safe- loads of tourists and police around. We went into the sex shops just for the experience and saw the ladies of the night- wild or what! Walked for miles in the day, but disappointing to find that the two major art museums were closed. Some of the diamond centres were disappointing but there is plenty to do- just when we were getting into the swing of things it was time to leave- and we stayed for 4 days too. Freddys bar was great, very intimate and the barman was so nice, he looked after us. Check out a canal boat ride as we never had time to do one, but looked good. Very interesting city, dare to see the sex and drug culture even if it isn't your kind of thing- there's nowhere quite like it anywhere else in the world- to be sure I will be going back, when- I really don't know as it was 16 years ago I last went before now!Have fun, be safe and don't take the camera to the red light district or you may find trouble.

<Content>beautifully historical european hotel with mod cons we stayed here on a recent biz trip - whilst I don't know how much was paid we enjoyed our stay. very convenient location and very historical with all the mod cons.admittedly we asked for a non smoking and ended up with a room on the inside of the hotel which was dark but it was very quiet - something which the canal rooms probably are not given their prime position in the city centre.room service food was expensive but nice. staff friendly and helpful. if I could afford to stay 5 star I would stay here again as it compares well to other 5 star hotels in europe although it has more of a historical than trendy feel

<Content>Not worth the prize I decided to book this hotel based on the pics and reviews I browsed on the net. I was disappointed by the small lobby and the rooms that have way less chracter than it seems on the pics (and we booked a deluxe room). Thankfully, we got a discounted rate, but even so, I founded that this hotel was overpriced, even though it is sure confortable and the location is very central. I would definately try another hotel next time.

<Content>Thumbs up for the Hotel de l'Europe visited this hotel in March for 5 days. Must concur with storage closets in suite. Amazing amount of space. Very comfortable accomodations. Toiletries by Bulgari were a plus to me. Excellent service, very clean, close to everything. Concierge was very helpful in arranging for theatre tickets and for changing train accommodations for us. I'd definitely stay here again. The pool does not have a shallow end and it looks a lot bigger in the pictures, but my 8 year old thoroughly enjoyed herself.

<Content>Worth the price My wife and I stayed here for a couple of damp days in March 2001; we were most impressed by the colossal amount of storage in our room, then by the huge bathroom, then by the welcoming flowers, chocolates, and beer (the place seems to be run by Heineken). Very helpful concierge, great location, right in the middle of everything.
