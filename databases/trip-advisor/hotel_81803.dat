<Content>Terrific deal just off Union Square! We come to San Francisco several times a year for ACT and discovered the York on our last visit. The price is a great deal in an expensive town, and the location - ten minutes walk from the theater - is perfect. The staff couldn't be more helpful, and although we had one of the older rooms which hasn't been renovated yet, everything was pleasant, clean and comfortable. We've stayed in many of the high-priced establishments around Union Square, but the York is our new go-to hotel in San Francisco - highly recommended!

<Content>Ideal cheap hotel in San Francisco The York Hotel is a ideal place to stay if you are looking for something cheap and cheerful in San Francisco. It's about 10 mins walk from Union Square and very convienient for riding the trams. It does not have any parking but they have a deal with a local car park. If you take advantage of the valet parking service it will cost you $35 dollars per day. But you drive your car there yourself and it will only cost you $21 per day, its only 2 min walk to the hotel from the car parkThe hotel does need a refurbishment ( I believe there is one planned for Autumn) but its clean, tidy and the staff are very friendly and helpful. So if you are looking for a cheap hotel in San Francisco just to shower and put your head down after a days sight seeing then I would reccomend the York Hotel

<Content>wait for the renovation The staff were friendly and attentive.The hotel is scheduled for an update this fall.Currently, the rooms were tired and dark. The walls and ceilings had many scars.Our room had no a/c and the air circulation was poor. The weather was hot, so the room was uncomfortably warm.The room was cleaned well, but the furniture and carpet were worn and dated.There is only one elevator. It is slow and used by service staff. The only ice machine is located on the main floor.The neighbourhood is okay. There are a few non-chain restaurants  bars in the vicinity that appeared popular.Most Union Square attractions and shopping were within walking distance.

<Content>Won't be going back there ... Stayed in York Hotel for 4 nights. All the staff were extremely friendly and helpful, however ... the hotel needs to be completely renovated. The photos on the website must be from a long time ago. The walls were painted greys and blues ... cold and depressing.The bedrooms were dark and the bathroom teeny tiny, though they were clean.The complimentary continental breakfast consisted of concentrated juices, coffee, mini croissants and muffins ... ok but could've been a lot better.Wireless internet was free which was a plus.The location was poor, not near anywhere, a good walk to Union Square/Market Street, or Civic Centre, and a good cab ride to the Wharf.The bar is closed, permanentlyIt was cheap but not worth it, wouldn't stay there again, no matter how cheap it gets.

<Content>Charming Property, Great Value, Highly Underrated The York Hotel is a wonderfully charming property, that is without a doubt highly underrated and great for the value. I booked my room via Expedia for $89, which included a free breakfast (didn't take advantage of that so I can't comment) as well as free Wifi. The York Hotel is about to begin a huge transformation into the Hotel Vertigo (it is one of the filming locations of Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo), and I was given the model room, which was an already renovated room as a preview of what the new rooms will look like. For $89/night, I was blown away. Service wise, every staff member was kind and courteous, and willing to help with anything possible. The room was very modern, with an extremely comfortable bed, very modern nightstands, and a cool bathroom, as well. Beautiful plasma TV, the only thing that didn't work was the AC/heater. This was not a problem, as the window could be opened and closed and I quickly found a nice temperature. Since I can't comment on the current rooms, I'm not sure how applicable this review is to those visiting in the very near future, but if possible do request the model room and I'm sure you will not be disappointed. I enjoy the decor of places like The Clift of The W, and the room was definitely on a par with those properties.As other reviews say, yes, the walls are paper thin, but are nowhere near as big a problem as other people point out. Definitely not enough to keep you awake. Parts of the hotel that are already renovated are very chic and modern, others still have that old/floral design, but personally I didn't find this bothersome. The surrounding area, while a bit of a hike (let's say a 10 min walk) from Union Square was through a very interesting area (very artsy), I felt safe no matter what time of the day or night.I have no complains at all about this property, and while it certainly isn't a 5-star property like a Four Seasons or Ritz Carlton, it's a great option if you're on a budget but want something nice.

<Content>Fun and reasonable, got what I paid for. I got a $69 rate here and had to pay a $25 cancellation fee to shameful Orbitz to get out of the over-priced ambiance-lacking hotel I had pre-booked. If you like old hotels, get there now because they're about to really remodel it. The Hitchcock film Vertigo was filmed in part there. Breakfast was fine. You are close to Union Square, but not as close as they would infer. Parking is 28.50. No real amenities here, but clean and nice. If you are an adventurous cigarette smoker, you can crawl out your window onto the fire escape to avoid the cleaning charge. Don't ask the front desk about this. The one Elevator is small and slow, but that's the way it works in an older hotel. Funky, fun, but sadly, the Rainbow Room of SF and Vertigo fame is closed.

<Content>OK place if you get a good deal This hotel is decent, but certainly not nice. I was in SF for a weekend in January and got a travelzoo special for $59 a night, which is pretty dang cheap for San Francisco. If you're just looking for a place to sleep that is close enough to walk to most of the sights downtown - this place does the trick. The hallways and rooms kind of reminded me of a retirement home (floral carpets, ugly wallpaper, bad art) and the bed was actually pretty awful. Also, the walls are PAPER thin. Seriously, I've never been anywhere with walls like this. You could literally hear the neighbor's conversation word-for-word when they were just talking at a normal volume. Thankfully our neighbors went to sleep around the same time as us (and they were speaking French which actually makes it easier to tune-out if you don't speak the language). If you had some late-night neighbors, this place could potentially be intollerable.All in all, if you can get a cheap deal on this place, don't mind walking about a 1/2 mile to get to the nearest subway, and don't plan on spending much time in your room - this place is fine. Bring ear plugs though just in case.

<Content>Great retro hotel We had a great stay at The York. Very spacious accomodations and helpful staff. The bed was more comfortable than my own. It has a real charm about it and a movie history! I hear it is to undergo some exciting renovations including a new restaurant. Can't wait to see it on my next visit. The neighborhood is also undergoing an exciting transformation from a quiet one to a young hip artsy one- thanks to the Academy of Art. The best part is the short walk to Union Square restaurants and bars and the affordability! A real gem.

<Content>Parking? A very decent facility in a sketchy Downtown location.Attractive rates. We arrived very late, only to find that their parking garage wasclosed for the night. On-street parking is nonexistent !! Finally(at 1:30A.M.) the night clerk found a garage that would accommodate. Plan ahead.

<Content>Won't be returning The location of this hotel is great, within easy walking distance from Union Square. Upon arrival, the front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. The Lobby is quaint and cute, just like I had seen online. Having said that, our room was less than desirable. The bed was probably the worst I have ever slept on at a hotel in my life. In addition to that, the walls are paper thin. We were at the very end of the hall, so I had hoped that it wouldn't be too noisy, but we could very clearly hear the loud running, stomping, and yelling ALL NIGHT! I guess I shouldn't have expected much, given that the room was only $125. Don't bother booking a room here if you want any type of luxury. We will not be returning.

<Content>Really cute little hotel This hotel is defo worth a stay. It has a retro, art deco feel about the lobby and is in a great location. A 10 min walk to Union Sq and lots of other attractions are easily accessible.The free breakfast is very basic - coffee, tea, muffins and toast but to be fair, is better than nothing!The rooms are a little dated but are clean and have all you need. It is defo a budget hotel but I was please with it. The bathroom was small and need a facelift but if I was travelling on a budget again I would defo go back.

<Content>Nice, clean inexpensive hotel in San Francisco Although this hotel could use a new coat of paint (which it appears they plan on doing in the new year), our room was clean, quiet, comfortable and inexpensive. I think the age of the hotel added to its charm and set it apart from most of the hotels I generally stay in - giving it character. It was definitely unique and the staff was very nice. They even upgraded our room upon our arrival. I definitely recommend this place if you want a location that is relatively close to downtown/union square without paying for the price of a downtown/union square hotel.

<Content>Nice place to stay First off, the staff was friendly and helpful. The main areas of the property were a little shabby, but just enough to be charming. The room itself was simple, clean, and pretty quiet. The bathroom was spotless, and the bed was comfortable. Drawbacks would be that it is something of a hike from the Powell St. BART station, but if you don't have a lot of luggage, it's fine. And although we could hear the music from the club in our room, it wasn't loud enough to keep us up. I'd recommend this hotel to anyone who doesn't need luxury when traveling, likes to support local hoteliers, and prefers hotels with a little charm.

<Content>Below average We stayed in the York hotel for 3 nights at the start of our honeymoon.We where not very impressed with the standard of the cleanliness room. On arrival we discovered a toenail on the floor, lipstick marks on the sheets, and some of the towels appeared to be stained. We complained  some of the above was sorted out.The breakfast is a total waste of time, plastic plates  cups, sliced bread  toasters for you to toast the bread in, some fruit, coffee  juice.On a positive the staff where friendly  helpful. And the room was comfortable, if a little unclean at first.

<Content>Great service We stayed at the York hotel for three nights in early October. We had booked three rooms for our party and it was a little frustrating not to be able to get into any of the rooms when we arrived at about midday after an overnight flight. However, the rooms were spotlessly clean although a little small and they were all we needed as we were tourists and not too interested in hanging out in the rooms anyway. The young ladies who worked the front desk were polite and accommodating and nothing was too much trouble. The gentlemen who covered the evening shift were equally helpful and friendly. This hotel is located about six blocks from Union Square and great shopping and an inexpensive taxi ride to wherever you want to go. The staff will even find you a taxi within 5 minutes of your request.Breakfast was provided .... a little sparse .... but enough to start your day, and, although the rooms need some upgrading they were perfectly adequate. I would recommend this hotel to budget travellers.

<Content>A hotel with character This was our first stop in America. I was a little apprehensive because of the reviews I had read so didn't expect a great deal. There was a great welcome for us, very friendly staff, huge room, good size bathroom but overall a little dated and could do with doing up.There was the odd mark on the carpet and the curtains could do with a little attention but our room was very quiet (which I requested) and the bed was large and comfortable. The location is great - about a 10 minute walk to Union Sq - plenty of bars, cafes to stop at on the way. Yes, agree that if you turn the wrong way in the evening you may be in less desirable areas.Breakfast is poor and plastic plates and cups I don;t think are appropriate. We had breakfast out for 2 of the 3 days.Overall, good, comfortable, reasonable in price and ideal for us in terms of location.I think the bar is pretty cool though - great cocktails!

<Content>Surprised at the good reviews...not good at all! There was blood on the curtains in our room. I probably don't need to say more, but I will.I booked this after reading the positive user reviews and expected a small, quaint, vintage-ey hotel...and it is that. But its also dingy and dirty, with windows that don't close, horrible old beds and paper thin walls. We checked in for a three night stay in early August. At first it seemed cute...but when we got to our room, I kid you not, there was a decent size smear of blood on the white curtain sheers. Grossed out and not sure what to make of that, we asked to be switched to another room, which we were. Since it was late, we stayed the night, but checked out the next morning and went elsewhere. To be fair, the staff was very nice and accomodating. But, make no mistake, this is a run down, bare bones place to crash...nothing more.

<Content>Nice hotel, old fashioned This hotel is old, as many things in SF, but we found it charming and comfortable enough. Our room was large and quiet, staff was nice and helpful and WIFI is free. Breakfast was OK, what you can expect from an 3*. The location is very central but you should be advised of some homeless/drunk people hanging around at 1-2 blocks to the south. We never had problems with them, but it could result frightening for older people.

<Content>Perfect for tourists exploring the city As a first time tourist in San Francisco, I enjoyed the location of this hotel during my 4-night stay:- easy walk to Union Square (the topography is rather flat), convenient trolley lines (2, 3 and 4 inbound on Post St and outbound on Sutter St, so they come quite often) and California St cable car up the hill (nice to use when coming back to the hotel).- the neighbourhood is very safe. I expected so many vagrants after reading SF reviews but I actually didn't see any around the York Hotel.Staff is very nice and very helpful.The hotel itself is fine if you're simply looking for a place to sleep. Most of the rooms overlook the very small central courtyard, so you'll just see a wall. It is so narrow I couldn't get cell phone network while in the room, even by the window. Cleanliness is okay, rooms and beds are small, furniture a bit old and worn, TV and clock radio take you back to the 80s, but overall my room was convenient and looked nice. Their was a strong, unpleasant mildew smell in the bathroom coming from the drain.Nice simple, continental breakfast: good choice and served in an original place. Free wireless Internet.If you happen to have a car - DON'T USE their parking! It is so overrated. It is located in a public car park one block away on Sutter St and they charged $28.5 (25 + tax) for self-parking. The normal rate for the parking is actually $21 (tax included, and no restrictions). If you use their valet service, it's $10 more!Since accomodation, rates and location are fine, I would recommend this hotel for tourists.

<Content>York Hotel in San Francisco The York Hotel is located 4 blocks from Powell Street (Union Square and cable cars) and 5 blocks from Market Street (Civic Center and every sort of mass transit). It is a lovely hotel, very helpful staff and in a safe neighborhood. The rooms are fine. Wireless IN works great and is free. I visit San Fancisco often and this is a super hotel for ease of getting around the entire city. Park your car and use MUNI to go anywhere in the city.

<Content>A Real San Francisco Experience Loved this hotel. Obviously it's not 5-star, but the rates are good ($320 for 3 nights twin room in August), the rooms clean, the staff friendly and the location great. The place has character, with it's slightly faded grandeur, Hitchcock connections, cool bar and Empire Plush Room. It's a great place to begin a days sight-seeing, especially if you like exploring on foot (the best way to see this city). Only a short walk away from Union Square, Nob Hill, Chinatown, Japantown, The Fillmore, Little Italy, and no more than a $10 taxi ride from North Bay, Marina, Haight Ashbury.OK, so the walls are a little thin and the breakfast basic, but there are great places to eat nearby. Highly recommended unless you prefer a sanitized chain hotel that's the same as the one in your own town.

<Content>Great for a large group in town for a wedding Stayed three nights at the York Hotel for a family wedding. We were a large group (30+) but the hotel's spacious  elegant lobby and inviting bar area made convening and planning daily activities a snap. Hotel is walking distance from many eating/shopping/sight-seeing destinations, and cabs/public transportation are available for city trips further out. Rooms were basic, a bit worn and shabby but also clean; I was told by the front desk that they will be refurbishing them later in the year. In addition to its central location, I absolutely recommend the York for its helpful and courteous staff  concierge---they were young and energetic and genuinely wanted to help us have a great stay---which we most certainly did! Definitely after the upcoming room renovations, this hotel will meet all your lodging needs for this fabulous city at a good value.

<Content>Surprised a little at area The hotel was that used in an Alfred Hitchcock film. The staff were very efficient and helpful. The rooms were more than adequate and clean but when we walked down the street to eat I had never expected to see so many vagrants. They did not trouble us mind you but gave the area a very run down appearance. Parking was handy and not too expensive and all arranged by reception. With the supurb transport system here we never used the car again whilst in SF. It was 4th July and the bar was shut for staff holiday? Can this be so on a holiday? Otherwise good and had we turned left as we exited we would probably have gone to a more salubrious area of the city. We will go back there

<Content>Location and price were the drawing points for our stay... Location and price were the drawing points for our stay at the York. The hotel matched the Orbitz price that we found online. The hotel was very clean. The breakfast was adequate (muffins, toast, bananas, apples, juice, coffee and tea). The walls are thin as stated in an ealier review, That could be a problem. One night we slept with the radio tuned in to classical music station. We asked for extra pillows right away as they were quite thin.My daughter (in her 30's) and I stayed there for a girls' trip to San Francisco for five nights. We were only at the hotel to sleep and did not expect it to be a five star hotel. So it worked out just fine. It was an easy walk to Powell Street ,which is on the main cable line. On arriving from the airport we took the BART in to Union Square (rather than a cab), the Powell station, for $5.15 a piece. That was a bargain! Now, we did have to walk and drag our luggage quite a few blocks up Powell Street and across Sutter Street. But we knew we would have other things to spend our money on. The hotel is only blocks from Dottie's True Blue Cafe, an easy walk for a wonderful treat for breakfast. Our wait was only 30 minutes. Not bad! A Walgreen's is at the corner of Powell and Sutter. That was a convenient location!One night we enjoyed a Cosmo in the adjoining Plush Room before retiring to our room.All in all, staying at the York Hotel added to our fun vacation to San Francisco!

<Content>Not a 3-star hotel Don't be fooled by the 3-star AAA rating for this hotel. We stayed there for one night the last week of June 2007 and it did not measure up to that rating. The room was quite shabby and the rugs were very worn. The windows were covered with a thin piece of fabric (not a curtain) which was frayed and hung down from a bar. Also, it was chilly in the room and the heater in the room did not work. The 2 windows in the room were pushed open to the side and were not even on the track, letting cold air in the room. The windows were stuck and I could barely close them. Since we were only there for one night, we didn't demand a change but would not stay there again. I should mention that, there is a decent breakfast included with the room, and it is served in what looks like an old ballroom with a stunning stained glass ceiling on the first floor behind the front desk. However, this wasn't enough to make up for the deficiencies in the room.

<Content>Pleasant hotel It's a pleasant hotel, maybe rather old aged but very well kept. The staff was very kind, smiling and willing to help us. The rooms are clean and quiet. Breakfast was not very rich: let's say essential!!.It's in a quiet area but not very near the main touristic attractions. However a not too long walk got us to the cable car and the bus and in the evening we went back by taxi as the staff suggested: you can get back here by taxi with not more than10 bucks!

<Content>Good Hotel for the Price My friend and I stayed here last week for 3 nights. The hotel looks a little different in person than on their new website, however it was still an OK property. Rooms are on the smaller side, however clean and bathroom was nice size. Walls are pretty thin, as the last night we were there, we had people check in next door and could here everything they were saying and could even listen to the music on their radio pretty clearly.Location was fine. Little grocery mart and restaurants in walking distance.Breakast was a little slim but, adequate none the less.

<Content>Hit and miss, it seems We stayed in a room with two beds. The room was clean enough but very drab and in need of renovation, especially the bathroom. There is a large walk in closet. They advertise free wireless but there was no access from our room and staff did not have the knowledge to give advice on connecting. The exercise room is not in working order. Breakfast is self serve toaster, muffins, orange juice, coffee, and bananas, and is not well maintained by staff. It is in a good location.

<Content>Often A Great Deal We have stayed here several times between 1999-2003, booking it through Priceline. We often got a great deal and really enjoyed this smaller, European-style hotel in the heart of Union Square. I'm not sure if you can still get the great deals we did, but it's worth a try.

<Content>Good location Had read very mixed reviews about the York Hotel but we found it perfectly acceptable. It is an old building but the room was large and the staff were always pleasant and helpful. We had a problem with the toilet blocking up a couple of times but each time it was attended to immediately. We did book a king room. We didn't find the place particularly noisy even though we were in a front facing room. It was very handy for the shopping district and for the cable cars especially considering the price. Breakfast was limited but we knew that in advance and it was adequate. They only provided paper cups and plates which was unusual but we weren't there for the food. I'd stay there again if we were in San Francisco again.

<Content>Nice, but no A/C or room fans This is a lovely hotel, to some degree. I heard about it thru the Academy of Art, which has special rates for prosepective students and their families, though only for rooms with 1 queen bed or 2 twins. A queen sized bed is too tight a fit for my husband, at 6'4, if I'm also in the bed. But we booked in anyway for the great rates. We upgraded to a king bed for us for only $20 more and kept the twin beds room for the kids.However, if you plan to be there in the summer, like we were, there is no A/C, room fans, or ceiling fans in any of the rooms! After 1 night, we moved to a hotel that did have a/c, as we were unable to sleep due to the high humidity and heat combination (and my hot flashes). Late in the evening, I called down to the front desk to ask for any sort of fan, but none were available. The hotel tried to convince me that the sea breeze would be enough, but there wasn't any breeze to speak of that night to cool the rooms down. I ended up taking a cool bath instead, several times that night, and still did not sleep much. With globally warming becoming more of an issue, one must take this into consideration. At other times of the year, this would not be such a big problem. It was my mistake that I did not think to ask about this a head of time, and I was not informed of it either at time of booking, nor is it mentioned on their website, so now you know. The York was kind enough not to charge us for the other 2 nights.

<Content>Hitchcock's Hidden Hotel Gem Just got back from a lovely holiday in San Francisco where we stayed at the York Hotel at 940 Sutter Street, just 4 blocks from the central Union Square area and only 2 blocks from the major transport stops at Powell Street.History:Built in the 1920s, the hotel still has many of its original features, including Bakerlite electrical fittings and ceramic solid baths. It also has a history. If you're a Hitchcock film fan you'll love the fact that Vertigo was filmed here and you will spot the square white hotel staircase used in the film as James Stewart suffers an attack of Vertigo. Also perseved are two of the rooms associated with the film (rooms 301 and 501, also referred to as the Vertigo Room and the Kim Novak room respectively) both of which can be rented for an additional cost and contain posters and photos taken from the original film.Cost:I booked the hotel on-line through Opodo at 拢42 per room per night (almost half the cost of many other 3 star hotels in this area). Your credit card holds the booking and the total due is payable upon check-out after your actual hotel stay.To book direct you will need to call the hotel up - the rates are exactly the same. The price of the room includes a free continental breakfast each morning.Breakfast: The self-service breakfast was available in the PLUSH ROOM between 7-10am each morning. The drinks consisted of fresh coffee, vast selections of Pickwicks Tea Bags (herbal, black, green tea and fruit teas), orange juice (not freshly sqeezed though).The food consisted of fresh bananas, a stack of fresh mini croissants, brown and white sliced bread (with several toasters for you to toast your bread if you chose), a selection of butter and jelly (jams to us in the UK), a tray full of chocolate muffins and blueberry and choco-chip muffins. The supplies were always served fresh and frequently topped up as soon as they ran low. It was a bit of a shame there was no variety each day (a different fruit say, or a yogurt instead of muffins one day) but, to be honest, it was great to have such a bountiful and tasty breakfast selection waiting for us each morning as it is not that common in the States to have breakfast included with the room rates. Having breakfast included was another definate advantage of staying at this hotel.Location:Located in the heart of San Francisco makes this hotel an ideal location to do your sightseeing from. The York Hotel is only 4 blocks from the central Union Square and 2 blocks from transport stops for the famous cable cars (and buses) at Powell Street. The number 2,3 and 4 buses also run along Sutter Street and stop right beside the hotel. Although located on a main street, the road gets pretty quiet at night time and is not noisy. There are some small shops (like a grocery store and a coffee shop) alongside the hotel which is handy if you need a phone card or some stamps or water etc...Rooms: My room (Room 219 on the 2nd floor) was large at approx. 18 ft x 13ft and having an en suite bathroom. The bedroom contained a central window with both nets and heavy outer curtains (looking on to the back of another building some 15 feet away). It had a phone, two bedside tables either side of the large kingsize double bed. It also contained a sideboard with TV on it, a coffee perculator / kettle with a selection of free tea and coffee. There was a large comfortable 'round' chair and a writing desk with tall chair. All in all the room was well furnished with matching bed covers and curtains (though the floral designs of the linens did seem a little dated but they were clean and quality material.The bathroom measured approx. 8ft x 6ft and contained a bath, a tall fixed shower head (not as handy as the removable, flexible ones I must say). The floor tiles were large plain white ceramic tiles and the wall had small one inch mini white tiles. The tapware was all silver and a plentiful supply of clean white towels were always available. The hotel's environmental policy stated that only linen and towels left on the floor each day would be washed - so th choice was yours as to how frequently your room was laundered.Service / staff: 24 hour service was on offer (though not for food and drink).Staff were always VERY helpful and knowledgeable and put themselves out to provide an enthusiastic service.Facilities: The Plush Room: This was areal treat - a small caberet type room with deep red velvet chairs surrounding little round black shiney tables. At the back of the room there was a small raised stage lined with heavy blood red coloured velvet curtains. A really exclusive little club where famous local jazz musicians come to play from time to time. A bar: near the lobby / reception area serving alcohol and soft drinks until about 11pm each night.An exercise room (just a small room with 3-4 bits of sport equipment in it really).Lift (handy for the 7 floors that exist). Staircase (as used in the Hitchcock film, Vertigo!).Internet access: for $2 for 15 minutes - it's pricey to use but availble if you need it in the lobby area.Other: Managers at the hotel told me that the hotel would be closing during the summer for 2-3 weeks whilst some major refurbishments were carried out to the Reception area and lobby and the hotel will be under new management before this time also. However I was assured that the original features of this 1920s hotel would be preserved and its history protected.I hope so - it would be a shame to have this little gem of a hotel spoiled. Go there whilst you can.

<Content>Excellent Hotel...... The York Hotel in San Francisco is one that I would not hesitate to recommend to anyone.Stayed there for 2 nights in early Oct 06 over a Friday and Saturday. Probably picked the best weekend possible to visit San Francisco as the Red Bull Air race was on, coupled with the Fleet being in Port, a 49ers/Raiders game and a Music festival in Golden Gate park.The Hotel is located in Sutter Street within a few blocks (10 minute walk) of the cable cars at Powell St. The rooms are typical SF style ie not large but roomy enough for all your needs. Bathroom well equipped and neat and tidy. Gym reasonably well outfitted and privately located. Parking is typical of SF again, in that it is off site and quite expensive, but you just accept it when you stay in SF. An Italian eatery (pizza and foccacia) is a couple of doors up the street, Mexican is over the road and a convenience store is only about 4 doors down.The real bonus of this hotel is the location of the Empire Room (a cabaret style entertainment location) right next to the reception desk in the main foyer. Seating approx 110 people, we saw Paul Williams for $25 without leaving the hotel.....Bonus. Add on the delightful charms of Whitney in the bar adjacent to the Empire Room and the York becomes my hotel of choice whilst staying in San Francisco.

<Content>Excellent Hotel, loved it and will return Stayed at the York Hotel with my Mother on the 16th November 2007 for 10 nights. Was somewhat concerned after reading many of the reviews, however, pleasently surprised. Firstly, for the excellent price this hotel comes second to none, I wonder if most of the poor reviewers actually stayed at the same hotel as us!!!! Secondly, location was good, not in a bad area and plenty of public transport about. (what people must understand is that San Fran has a very bad homeless problem, they are all over the city, but predominantly in the tourist areas of Market Street and by all the big shops such as Macys. We did not walk the streets at night, mainly because too tired but also a little apprehensive because of the homeless. The homeless are not by this hotel-we didn't see any, but were by others, just be wary) We got the bus each evening from Market Street, where all the shops and restaurants are, to either outside the hotel or to one of the adjoinging roads, at a cost of approximately $1.75, get a transfer if changing buses. Therefore very eay to get to and from hotel. Thirdly, hotel staff were very helpful, the hotel was secure with the front desk manned at all times. The rooms were clean and quiet. What more do you want? If you want more, go to the Hilton or elsewhere and pay $200-$500 per night.I had an enjoyable stay at this hotel, and would definately stay again. It ticked every box.Finally there was a free breakfast, and yes it was only toast, muffins, biscuits, fruit, coffee, tea, orange juice..................BUT again it was a stop gap before lunch, i enjoyed it, as many other people did because they were all eating it too! In relation to the brakfast room which everyone seems to make a big thing about in their reviews, yes it was a little dark, because no windows, but hey we were eating breakfast, a whole 30 minutes, not spending the entire day there!!!!!!!!!!!Do not be put off, the hotel is very european, clean, safe and an excellent base to see San Francisco!!

<Content>A Euro-Style Gem in the City Stayed at the York for three nights...only negative was that it wasn't a long enough stay! Really loved this Euro-style boutique hotel. Our room overlooking the courtyard was roomy, quiet and suited our needs perfectly. The walk-in closet was an added bonus as it stored all of our luggage perfectly. Comfy terry robes and towels too.The breakfsast is basic but there are plenty of cafes nearby for a more substantial experience - i.e. the casual Cafe Bean or the Grand Cafe - a Parisien style brasserie.Across the way is a family-style taqueria which is delicious and great value. For a nite cap, try the Red Room lounge down the street or the hotel's famed Empire Bar for a martini. Do note that it closes by 10 pm some nites depending on patrons. When open, the bartender Mark makes a mean Lemondrop - as tart as you'd like it to be.

<Content>What a Blast! This hotel is perfect for singles or young couples who want to have a fun vacation! The hotel is located in a good section of town, where it is easy to get to the city's attractions easily and quickly. The Empire Plush Room vaudville act is a MUST SEE! The bartenders are great! The rooms are not luxurious by any means, but who wants to stay in their room in a great city like SF anyway?? Overall, a great experience!

<Content>The Price is Right at this Chic Hotel If you want to avoid the chain hotels but can't really afford the trendy hot spots ... this is the hotel for you. I loved my stay here. The staff was friendly and the hotel had a historical yet trendy feel that was just what I was looking for in San Francisco. The central location was perfect for touristy activities and still far enough away from the tourist crowd to relax. The low-key but plush hotel bar was a also a great spot to get away from the crowds. I recommend the Vertigo room. It received it's title because the movie was filmed in that room. It has a great view and two classic movie posters.

<Content>The Poor Tired York My wife  I came up to SF for a night, and stayed at the York. I had pleasant memories from an earlier stay 20 years ago. It doesn't appear that the furnishings have been upgraded since then. The furniture in our room, and its decor were very subpar. The curtains were very old and torn. For some reason we were given a handicapped accessable room (# 402), which resulted in a larger bathroom, at the expense of the closet (which was approximately a foot deep). The bathroom itself seemed industrial in quality. Zero charm. The rate was good. But it felt like a residence hotel. I wouldn't stay again unless I knew that it had been thoroughly redone.There is a neat little nightclub downstairs (The Plush Room). I'd like to go back there.

<Content>More than adequate, but not exactly great There are many charming aspects to The York Hotel - it's got a great location near Nob Hill and Union Square, an impressive history, a cool bar/nightclub, decent rooms and a friendly staff. It's not expensive, especially when you use Hotwire, as I did. That being said, when you're traveling for business, you expect things to be right. And on my stay here, some things weren't. I could forgive the aging, peeling bathtub. And the missing mini-fridge didn't really bother me - I didn't have anything I wanted to keep cold. The carpet wasn't perfect, but these days, what is? One reason I booked this hotel, though, was because they have a fitness room. When I'm in SF, I like to exercise in the morning before work without leaving the building or having to pay a fee. But the fitness room was pathetic. The treadmill was completely out of service and the exercise bike didn't work right. The elliptical trainer was the only functioning piece of equipment. (Yes, I used it, and the bike, too.) No mats for stretching. No weight machines of any kind. No incline board for sit-ups. The breakfast is a little lame as well. Toast and muffins would get awrully tired after more than two days. So I wasn't blown away. I'm not gushing. I would possibly stay there again, but I wouldn't particularly look forward to it.

<Content>Very Pleased! We got a great deal at the York (including airfare) via Expedia.com and we were very pleased. The room, while basic, was clean and spacious. We had two very comfortable twin beds - which was fine as we were two single women traveling together. The tub was great - a real soak off your aching feet kind of tub. The showerhead was kind of wimpy, and there was mold imbedded in the tub faucet, but otherwise, it was a great room. The York's front desk staff is FANTASTIC, especially Greg Bland, but we really liked them all! There's also an included continental breakfast - basic, but good -- we supplemented it with yogurt, available at the little food market two doors down. The location was also excellent - easy walking distance to the downtown and/or public transportation. All in all, a great stay - we'd stay here again for sure!

<Content>Great atmosphere at the York The welcome the staff gave us when we arrived in the morning - quite confused - we will never forget. We had a room upgrade from something we didn't knew, to a big room on 5th floor to the street. SF is noisy and we had noise from the street, but really didn't mind. The brakfast could need an update (seen from a Danes pow). But all in all, a good choice. We wouldn't hesitate to come back. But we missed Kim Novak! We saw her room on 4th floor.

<Content>Fantastic stay at the York We stayed a total of 10 nights at the York in the summer and we loved it there. We got a real bargain as we booked very early so we bagged a king room on the top floor for $99 per night and the room was perfect. I would definitely recommend this if you are staying for a longer period as it is perfect for staying in if you don't fancy going out some nights. The location is really good as well and within walking distance to loads of things, not least the excellent shopping in Union Square. Contrary to other travellers on this site I found the staff an absolute delight. They were really helpful and nothing seemed an effort. They helped us sort out car hire, kept our luggage while we were waiting for our room and generally they were just happy to help with information.The room was clean and, given the top floor location, very quiet and had a lovely view. No complaints whatsoever about this place. The only minor thing I would mention is the breakfast which is quite a let-down. It wouldn't take a lot to improve it and I would expect that most people would welcome some cereal and yoghurt in addition to the toast and muffins currently offered.Would definitely recommend this place as it is execellent value.

<Content>Loved the York hotel Stayed at the York Hotel in Sept for 4 nights. Got upgraded to a refurbished room on the 6th floor. Lovely room and very helpful staff. Spent 3 weeks in US and this was my favourite hotel. Great location, walked everywhere. Loved the boutique feel of the hotel.Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Needs Updating If you can get a great deal on a room ($100) or less this would be fine but it's need of updating pronto. Rooms are small and dark lighting and several cracks in walls and broken tiles. Location isn't that great unless you don't mind walking, i don't mind so i don't care. If you come bring flip flops for walking on very old and dirty carpet.

<Content>Couldn't have asked for more!!!! Well what can I say but what a great hotel. As soon as we arrived we received the best service. The two guys in reception couldn't do enough for us. We received complimentary drinks and discounts to some of the best restaurants. including the great Mexicana take away over the road. Best burritos in town. The hotel was spacious, clean and friendly. The bar is a great place to visit for a night cap plus the plush room nightclub has some great caberet acts but I would advise to book in advance as it is a popular venue. Overall it is a boutique hotel with great character and great service. I would recommend and re visit.

<Content>Personality at it's finest!!!! We were VERY nervous after reading the horrible commentary about the bed bugs. We found the location to be a bit unnerving, as we were unfamilar with the area. Turns out these fears were for naught. The hotel is a bit off the beaten trail--about six LONG blocks from the Cable car--but once there we had access to the entire city with our Rail pass. (Gotta get this--saves money and gets you on about anything in the city.) We took the Cable Cars to down town and Fisherman's Wharf. We took the Trolley Cars along the Waterfront. The hotel wasn't The Ritz-but neither were the prices. It was clean, the hotel desk was fantastic in their help and support. They were extremely knowledgeable in their surroundings as far as restuarants. I called from the Boise Airport with a question, and they gave me directions to the hotel on the Shuttle rather than BART or Taxi. This hotel is used a lot by travel groups from France, Japan, and Austrailia. It was great fun to share breakfast with 60 people and find out you were the only American.We were in SF during Fleet week--completely unplanned and there were hundreds of thousands of people on the Wharf. The Trolley's and Cable Cars were busy--but the bus system was explained a bit by the YORK desk, and all made easy to understand. Would I stay there again? Yes. Again, it's nothing fancy, but certainly has personality, a feeling of 'home' and character all it's own.

<Content>A Great Value in San Francisco! I highly recommend the York Hotel. . , especially for those on a tight budget who are looking for a nice hotel. Though it's not located in the thick of things, it is 4 blocks away from a trolley line and 3 blocks away from Chinatown (which is kind of cool). The rooms and property are extremely well-kept and the staff is friendly.

<Content>Fully recommend The York After reviewing a lot of hotels we decided on the York Hotel and was very pleasantly surprised. Our room (612) was at the back of the hotel and very quiet. The room was very comfortable and although the hotel was old, this only added to the ambience. Staff were very helpful (in fact service during our entire holiday in California) was excellent. Breakfast was basic, continental style but this was what I expected. The hotel is in the Theatre District and easy walking distance to restaurants and coffee shops.I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Impressed We felt that we got a good deal with this hotel. Decent sized rooms, friendly staff in a safe neighbourhood and a location nearby key attractions. What more can you ask. The bathrooms were on the smaller side, but they did the job and were clean and well stocked. The bedrooms were of a good size and well decorated. The hotel is of walking access to everywhere in San Fran, in fact that is what we enjoyed most about the holiday was walking rather than taking buses or cable cars. The staff were approachable and friendly. The walls are thin, as mentioned in other reviews, but that is not surprising due to the age of the hotel. We only found it a problem on one occasion, and it was quickly dealt with. Bear it in mind if you stay here and be considerate to those in the next room! All in all this was a good find, and I would return on my next visit. We liked that this hotel was not just another chain hotel, but had a little character.

<Content>Great Bargain !! easy access to most places Just returned from a 3 night stay; great bargain for the price!! The hotel lobby is very clean and updated..and welcomes you in with jazz music playing. The rooms and bathrooms are clean. The hotel staff very friendly and helpful. Very fun fact that a part of Hitchcock's Vertigo was filmed here.The York Hotel is right down the street from the Trolley system which makes it very easy to head to Fisherman's Wharf, Lombard Street, Chinatown, North Beach etc. Walkable distance to the F Market rail train for access to Castro and Mission area. BART system is also about 5 blocks for getting back and forth from SFO airport.Great place for the price!

<Content>Good value My husband and I stayed here for a few nights in June and thought it was a good value for the neighborhood since SF can be so costly. It is a bit far away from the other hotels and attractions though. The front staff were very, very helpful and accomodating. The room was clean enough but needed to be updated. The bathroom had this VERY noisy vent that you could not disable and the shower kept stopping up so you would shower in pooled up water if you were in there long enough. Since the hotel is so old the walls are thin, too. The continental breakfast was nothing to speak of but these days I don't expect much.. it was toast, muffins and coffeee, and bananas. The did offer internet but for a fee.

<Content>Brilliant Hotel This is the best little hotel you will find. I cannot say enough about this place. This may sound biased but one little feature made this aussie enjoy his stay..........wait for it, Customer Service!!!!!! The level of CS in the US is appalling to say the least. I assume it has to do with minimum wage etc but still!The staff at the desk here are genuine and friendly. Something I just havent found anywhere else in 30 days here. In particular the asian girl(I think her name was Chiemi???) was a pleasant and warm face to be greeted with in the lobby. Also the African Amercian fellow with the glasses, just a nice person. The place has a really warm and welcoming ambience. The lift is old and slow but so is the buliding. If you are one who enjoys vintage and retro things, you will love this building. The rooms are very reasonable and more than adequate. Some of the decor might be deemed a little past it by some but for these prices I am coming back next year. Any minor annoyances(like shower pressure etc) were quickly forgotten because I didnt feel I was bothering the staff with my presence. It amazes me that more hotels in the US have not focussed on getting the staff to be polite and helpful. It's a simple thing and one that will keep this tourist coming back.Highly recommended!!!!

<Content>Great Value! We stayed 3 nights at The York Hotel between April 14th-17th, We were very pleased with our choice of hotel which we booked over the internet at a reasonable $99 US.The room was clean and the bathroom was spacious enough for two peole.The bed was very comfy after a 13hour flight and the continental breakfast was limited but just as nice.The only negative was that the shower water pressure was a little low.Would definately stay again!

<Content>Very Safe My son and I stayed the York Hotel while looking at Colleges in April 2006. Not ever going to San Francisco before and hearing all kinds of tales, I found the York hotel to be very safe. Our room was very comfortale and quiet. The hotel staff was tremendously helpful in regards to where to eat, shop, etc. The staff helped us book a tour of the city and the tour bus picked us up outside the hotel. Very convenient. Plan to return someday!!

<Content>Not so great I stayed at the York bc the hotel that we usually stay at was booked. I can say that the staff was very friendly and that they were willing to help us. However, the room was another story.We were placed in a room with a court side view. Our window looked out to a brick wall with a sliver of what was suppose to be th court yard....a small area with a tuff of grass. The room was old and a bit run down. The carpet was old, did not take our shoes off, the bed was boasted to be a king size bed, but in fact it was just two twin bed stuck together. The mattress was hard and you could feel the gap between the two beds. The TV looked like something from the 20s and the bathroom was had crakced tile, a shower that I wouldn't want to use and a toliet who's seat would not hold still when sitting on it. Great staff, but the room needs improvements.

<Content>Good value for money The rooms were big! Everything was in working order but the room was kind of - lacking in style. Very old-fashioned. The staff were friendly. The hotel bar is really nice and the cocktails are great. All in all, good value for money if you want to stay in the Nob Hill area of San Francisco.

<Content>The San Francisco Plush Room, former speakeasy, is booking top performers. On my last visit to the Plush Room I was impressed by the wonderful cabaret singer Paula West. The show was a 10th anniversary. I'll go back for singer songwriter Susan Getz who is on the bill for the last weekend in March, 2006. Everyone says she is fantastic.The plush Roomis not cheap, but worth the price of admission. Beautiful room and good sound. Not too loud.

<Content>Good for the Money We have just returned from a week in San Francisco staying at the York Hotel. Location is excellent, just 4 or 5 blocks to Union Square and the staff mostly friendly, some offering excellent and helpful advice whilst others were a little indifferent. The hotel has a slightly shabby air and the room, though large, smelt very damp for the first day, but soon cleared once the window was opened, however, even though freshly painted, the wallpaper was coming away in some places. That said, the room was well cleaned and serviced daily, with the bathroom being spotless and very comfortable towels/basic toiletries provided. The carpet, however, was truly dirty and in desperate need of deep cleaning, therefore, I did not walk bare foot. The large walk-in closet, coffee maker and fridge added to the comfort of the room. We emailed ahead of arrival and asked for a quiet room on a high floor and received a very pleasant reply confirming our request. Upon arrival the room was made available to us and the first night we were woken early by conversation noise from the room down the hall. These guests must have left the next day as, for the remainder of our stay of 7 nights, we had no further disturbances, however, on the morning of our last day we could hear someone in the next room coughing, therefore, I think the walls must be very thin and the reason we were undisturbed for the most part was due to the hotel having few guests. The complimentary continental breakfast of muffins, toast, juice and coffee, the occasional piece of fruit, etc., though repetitive, was a pleasant way to start the day with everything being very fresh. Overall, for the price we paid, the hotel afforded excellent value and acceptable standards. Similar accommodation in New York, for example, would be at least twice the price. Additionally, there is a small grocery store a couple of doors down from the hotel which is friendly and useful for snacks and drinks and further along an excellent Japanese restaurant. San Francisco is, of course, full of superb restaurants, far too many to mention, but for a tasty, authentic American breakfast, go to one of three Loui's Diners located throughout the city or for a superb burger, the best I have ever tasted, go to the Baghdad Cafe at 2295 Market St at the intersection of 16th St.

<Content>What luck! In January I shared a holiday in San Francisco with my two daughters and a son-in-law. I had laboured over choosing a hotel from a web site, but with the help of ( Hotels) other travelers reviews, we picked the York Hotel on Sutter and couldn't be happier! One daughter and her husband had come from New Zealand for their Canadian Christmas and this trip was a perfect way to end their visit and get a vacation for all of us.The staff were very accomodating, letting us into the room hours early, very friendly, helpful and courtious. Rooms were spacious, lovely toiletries, and plush robes heavenly! ..rooms often cleaned while we had our Continental breakfast which was more than enough to get our busy days started. We didn't know the City and were concerned about location but I can tell you this for us was perfect... bus out front of the hotel..a few blocks walk to the Powell-Hyde cable car route, a local grocery , diners and coffee houses and fine restaurants right on Sutter. We had a sence of going home to our neighbourhood, after each busy day! It was clean and safe! My daughter and her husband rented bikes and toured the Embarcadaro, parts of the Presidio, and cycled over the Golden Gate to Sausalito to catch the ferry back to join us for coffee at the Buena Vista !!Sights galore to make you in awe and food to make you AAAHHH! A must for a fine dining dinner is McCormicks  Kuletos...absolutly mouthwatering ! Ask for Peter to be your waiter! I can't wait to go back to soak up more of the atmosphere of the City by the Bay!!

<Content>We are going back next year! When we visited SF for the first time last year, we took pot luck and booked the York off the internet. We were not disappointed.True, it is not a big corporate hotel, and it isn't glossy and 'manufactured', but it is intimate, warm and friendly. The history of the building is evident, but that didn't mean it was uncomfortable or falling apart.The staff were the most friendly we have ever met, the hotel was clean and in a great location, very central to everywhere on the tourist route.We are back in SF next year, and the York Hotel will be the place where we stay again - if you want a clean, central hotel with character, then this is great value for money.

<Content>Moved out after one night I pre-booked and pre-paid for a single room at The York from 18-22 October, 2005. On arrival, I found rather an old building with dim lighting in the lobby and tired furnishings. All this would have been OK as I knew it was a boutique hotel with some history. However, I could not tolerate the following and moved out after the first night:- lumpy faded mattress, stained underblanket, perished rubber backing to the curtains, noise from adjoining room, no bedside lights. This room was on the first floor, overlooking the inner courtyard. I think it was rated as a Standard Room with a double bed. Breakfast was supposed to be served in our sun-washed lobby but was actually served in what had been the night club the previous evening - very dim and uninviting. The York has a 3 star rating and a brochure full of glowing descriptions but unfortunately I found that these images just did not live up to the reality. At 拢60 per night, it was a total waste of money.

<Content>Serviceable We stayed one night at the York Hotel on the last day of our SF vacation. The price was about the same as what we would have paid to stay at an airport hotel.The staff were friendly and helpful. They also offered a car service for us to get to the airport.The hotel is worn around the edges. We had requested a renovated room, and found that renovated meant wallpaper that had been painted over and a room makeover a la Trading Spaces. The furniture is a bit chipped and the linens worn and thin. The walls are not at all soundproof. We woke up to the angry voices of a bickering couple next door. If you are not a picky hotel guest, and are traveling on a budget, the hotel is clean, safe and serviceable. If there is any bit of hotel/design/diva snob in you, this hotel is not for you. Pay the extra hundred bucks and stay at the Hotel Monaco.

<Content>Certainly not another bland place This hotels offers character, not luxury, and if this is what you're after you'll be satisfied. The rooms are a bit basic and the bathrooms focus on the historical aspects of plumbing, but that's all within the theme of the place - and everything works! The staff are friendly and helpful, the location is both convenient for sightseeing and offers a glimpse into aspects of life you would otherwise miss. The rustic (ie, continental) breakfast is a welcome start to the day.

<Content>dont worry its fine!!!!!!! Hi guys, me and my wife stayed in The York less han three weeks ago and whats all the fuss about. Granted its not the best hotel in sanfran but its certainly not the worst, the staff are all very friendly, curtious and will help you as much as possible.The rooms are basic but very clean, the tv,s may not be plasma, but they all have the latest cable stations, but hey your in sanfran how much tv do you want to watch!!!!! The breakfast is quite basic but its complementry and is enough to see you through to lunch time which is all you could ask as you havnt paid for it.San fran is like New York its set out on a grid system so its very easy to find Union Square etc, its only a 15 minute walk away, thers a bar called the Red room not far from the hotel which i can recomend for a late night, but take id with you as my wife got asked her age and she's 32!!!!!!All in all the hotels location, staff, rooms, tvs, bars are fine so if you have booked dont worry and have i great time, i wish i was back there!!!!!

<Content>Loved the York Hotel The staff was courteous, friendly and helpful. More of a family type atmosphere. I booked three days there for a HS reunion with threeclassmates from back East. We all felt a warm welcome right from the start. The accomodations were exactly what I had requested.

<Content>Great Hotel we stayed at the York for our wedding on Sept 7th (travelling from England ) after contacting the hotel Manager Jacob Miller. I contacted him direct and he couldnt have been more helpful. Infact when we arrived all the staff were great.we stayed in a King Suite on the 5th floor and we loved it. The Hotel is old but that just adds to the character of the Hotel. It is in an ideal spot. The parking is on the next block down but come on you are in san Francisco what else can you expect when even the residents cant park beside their homes. The staff at the parking garage were also most helpful and nothing was a problem to them so dont be put off. I would love to go back to san Francisco and would def stay at the York againThe only downfall was we didnt get to meet Jacob as he was on his honeymoon.

<Content>Average Tourist Class Hotel I am not sure who has been writing some of the other reviews on this hotel, but this is a very average, tourist class hotel, nothing more. You can hear the hallway noise very easily, elevator is slow, and parking is expensive ($25). The room and bathroom were clean and well kept. The location is good, about 5 blocks from Union Square and the trolley line. I booked this through Last Minute, and there were no hitches.

<Content>York Hotel was just great ! We hired 2 rooms - a double and a twin. Both were great. Room decor is not new, but it's just fine and both rooms were very clean. Bathroom suites are old, but again very clean.Staff at the front desk were very helpfulGarage car parking within 100yds is a good deal - arranged via the front deskBreakfast in the hotel was OK - several coffee shops within a few yards if you need something extra.I had an issue with the room next door's loud music system - a quick call to front desk resolved it immediatelyLocation is excellent for Union Sq shops and cable cars.I'd certainly stay at The York again.

<Content>Great Bargain, but pick your room We stayed at the York for one night this summer because we liked the location and the very reasonable price. My husband and I were very satisfied with our room which faced the courtyard, though we could hear noise from the hall and other rooms. However, my brother and sister-in-law had a room that faced the street and found it to be very noisy. My advice: bring your ear plugs and enjoy the bargain.

<Content>Fabulous honeymoon at the York My husband and I spent the first few days of our honeymoon at the York in January '04. The staff was wonderful and offered great restaurant suggestions. We stayed in the Kim Novak room, which is where she stayed during the filming of Vertigo. The room had nice touches like fun photo stills from the movie on the walls. The continental breakfast was good--nothing too fancy, but a good selection of fresh fruit and teas in addition to standard breakfast fare. And you can't beat the charm of an older hotel. We'll definitely return.

<Content>Great hotel!! Just got back from SF after staying three nights at the York. I too was a little hesitant after reading some reviews, but I would definately stay here again. The staff couldn't have been nicer and more accomadating. My sister and I had room 221, which was away form the street, and we both slept soundly. The continental breakfast was very good, toast, juices, coffee, muffins, fruit... We did a lot of walking but bus access was so easy, and the staff was so helpful in giving us directions. Please, give this hotel a chance, you won't be disappointed.

<Content>Average Hotel We stayed at the York Hotel for 3 nts after flying in from the UK and enjoyed our stay there. The hotel is in a good position for Union Square - however also close to the Tenderloin area, which isnt too nice after dark - we made the mistake of heading that way for dinner (and after about 100yards turned back!) The 1st night was noisy, we were in a room overlooking the inner courtyard area and the music from the Jazz club did keep us awake, so if you are arriving from a long flight / want to sleep before 1am, ask to be away from that area!Breakfast was included and was good - croissants / toast / muffins and fruit.Would recommend staying there again, the room was clean although could do with a little updating.

<Content>Great place with caracter. Not the place to go if your looking for the Ritz but great clean safe hotel with caracter. Breakfast every day is the same but concidering san frans prices for a cup a joe and a muffin it is nice for the wallet. If you call ahead for info be thorough. We called to ask if they had internet and they told us yes but neglected to tell us it was 20 bucks for 15 min. Free internet at Pier 39 if you really need it.Booked with expedia without any problems. we were able to check our bags with the hotel after check out so we could tour the city a little more before our flight. Friendly staff. All in all great place!

<Content>Stay away from the York This place was terrible. My wife and I were visiting San Fransisco on vacation and we arrived late at night and quickly found out that the toilet didn't work in our room. Instead of moving us they wanted to send a repairman to come look at it. After several minutes and water spraying from the bathroom onto the bed we told the man to come back in the morning. It was about 1:00am and we were to tired to deal with it. The next morning the man came very early to fix it and got it working. I can't believe they didn't offer to change our room.The complimentary breakfast was nothing more than muffins and orange juice. It was a real disappointment. The king size bed was two twins pushed together. The shower had no water pressure and the bathroom was very small. The hair dryer didn't work in our bathroom and the carpet had large stains on them. The T.V. was about 20 years old. The walls were paper thin and you could hear word for word conversations from people in the next rooms.The only good thing I could say is that they had two very large closets in the room. If closet space is the only important thing to you, I still would not recommend this place to you. It was that terrible. We were planning on staying two nights but we left quickly after the horrible breakfast.

<Content>Loved the York Hotel! I was a little apprehensive after reading some reviews on this site of the York but I have to say we were more than pleased with this hotel! We stayed for a week in April, 2005 and this hotel went above and beyond my expectations. We ended up paying around $85/night, very reasonable for the area. We upgraded to the king room, I think this was worth it. The room was very clean, had a huge closet and a flat-screen TV. We were on the 7th floor and our room was street-facing. The traffic noise did wake us up sometimes, but I think that would be the case in any hotel in that area. If you don't want the noise, don't stay in the city. The hotel was about a 5 block walk to Union Square and the cable cars. There's also tons of great restaurants right around the hotel. The staff was so helpful, they answered all of our questions. The room was clean and we felt very safe in the area. We also checked out the show one night and it was great!Our only complaints: the continental breakfast definitely needs to be upgraded. The only choices were muffins, bread, and bananas and apples. Also, we had asked for wireless internet (available for $4.95/day) but it wasn't working. The guy at the front desk told me that they had some problems with it, and took the charge off our bill. I wouldn't book at this hotel if you definitely want wireless. Other than that, everything was perfect. We would definitely stay here again, it's a great bargain in a great location.

<Content>Great find for the price. We spent three nights at the York. We had a front room on the 6th floor. Traffic was a little noisy, but you will have that problem at other hotels in that area. The room was clean, but not fancy. The staff was friendly and helpful. The walk to Powell was not too bad, about 5blocks. We booked on Expedia, and paid only $83/night. At that price, it was a great find. If you are looking for a fancy place, this is not it.

<Content>York Hotel...San Francisco's Best Kept Secret (Until Now!) My wife and I just returned from San Francisco after celebrating our 30th anniversary. On most occasions I would have booked with a well named hotel, but since this was a very special occasion I decided to go with a boutique hotel and selected the York Hotel. Am I glad I did!First, the accomdations were excellent and clean. We had a two room suite and could not have been happier. The room was tastefully appointed and clean. I rate hotels on criteria including cleanliness, attention to requests, friendliness of hotel staff. While we were staying at a hotel, we might as well have been staying with friends, that's how nice the staff was. The hotel's general manager, Jacob, has done a great job in putting together a staff of folks who make their guests feel comfortable. The hotel staff was friendly and accomodating, offering their insight into best places to eat and the best routes to take to where we wanted to go.The continental breakfast each morning was a nice way to begin the day.I have already told our friends in the Bay area that if they're looking for a place to stay after a day of shopping they have a hidden gem centrally located near Nob Hill. My wife and I look forward to a return trip to San Francisco and a stay at the York Hotel, quite possibly San Francisco's other great treat.

<Content>York Hotel Recently stayed at the York Hotel and would rate it an average hotel. The room was nice enough, but the nightclub and theatre downstairs made for some very noisy nights (not great when we had jetlag coming from Australia). Found the location pretty good, ie. could walk most places but the cable car stop was about 10mins brisk walk away, so if you want to spend most of your time around Fishermans Wharf, i would not recommend staying here. I would probably look for an alternative next time.

<Content>SPECIAL SERVICE AT THE YORK HOTEL To celebrate our second anniversary, my wife and I, leaving the pups with a sitter and heading out to the city on the bay. To make the trip all that much better I called the York Hotel to see if there were any special services or events they would recommend for our special weekend. Much to my surprise the front desk staff and the management had lots of ideas and were enthusiastic about helping.Tammy in particular went over and beyond our expectations. She suggested having Champagne and flowers to be placed in the room for our arrival and that we might like the upgrade to the King room since it was not that much more. I took her idea about the room and asked if we could get port instead and fresh fruit with chocolates instead. Too picky, yeah just maybe; but not only did the staff search out the grocery list but they even called me back a couple of times to make sure we would be happy with the selection. Not only did we get a nice port and the right glasses for it, but the pears were soft and the strawberries ripe. I makes us wonder how many other hotels could possibly provide this level of personal attention and execute it so flawlessly and all on the day of our arrival too!I highly recommend the York Hotel on service merits alone.

<Content>Great place to stay! We stayed at this hotel from 16th-24th March. The location is good, about 10mins walk from Union Square, cable cars, and there is a bus stop very close by. You don't have to go as far as Union Square though to find some great restaurants, and there is a well stocked convenience store a couple of doors away.The room itself was clean and comfortable. The bathroom was small and basic; I have to agree with other reviewers that the water pressure of the shower was a bit low, but that really is a very minor problem. The twin room we requested was not available- we knew it wasn't guaranteed, so we had been upgraded to a King bed. It was massive, really didn't feel as if I was sharing it at all! There was a walk in wardrobe, which was big enough for all our clothes and one of our suitcases. We had a large screen tv, a coffee maker and a cooler. The lobby was clean and spacious; this is where we enjoyed our complimentary breakfast each day. Breakfast was nothing fancy, but more than enough to set you up for a mornings sightseeing. Internet access is available in the lobby. There is a fitness room there, can't say I even peeped in at it though. There was cabaret most nights in the Plush Room. We were on the 3rd floor, and although we could hear it, it wasn't obtrusive. We caught a show there, which was fun and the room had a nice intimate atmosphere, with friendly staff. Like the rest of the hotel, it is non-smoking, a plus in my mind.The thing that really stands out in my mind about this hotel is the staff. Everyone at the front desk was friendly and helpful. They gave great advice about where to go and what to see. The hotel had a good atmosphere, perhaps because it is not too big and impersonal.We thought it was great value for money, and would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Overrated, not a great value for money ! my husband  I just got back from San francisco, which we think is one of the loveliest cities in the world, not to mention the great weather ! all that actually nullifies my complaints bout the york hotel!some reviews here were too good ,but its overrated ...the only reason i guess being that its staircase featured in Alfred Hitchcock's 'vertigo' ! located in heart of downtown, close to the cable car route,luckily ...(ther are a whole bunch of other hotels close to it on the same street), good food joints around,one worth mentioning is'tappes bar  grill'.getting to the point, york hotel seems to be very old with only 1 vintage elevator, the rooms were small with thin walls, old sheets (worn out edges) and curtains...not worth the money you pay for. staff was friendly though BUT york hotel should have been a much cheaper place ! u could get a better value for your money elsewhere.

<Content>Great location, shower not so great The location, on the edge of Nob Hill, is excellent (the hotel's best feature). The hotel has a somewhat tired feeling, from the lobby to the tacky drop ceilings in what must have once been lovely halls and stairways. The shower was one of those very low-pressure ones where the water is either scalding or freezing, and only a millimeter turn of the knob separates the two extremes - but our room in general was adequate. The Empire Plush Room downstairs has loud weekend entertainment that might keep you awake (like it did my husband). If you're an Alfred Hitchcock fan, portions of the movie Vertigo were filmed in room 501 (the door of that room is identified The Vertigo Room with a gold sign) and room 301 is identified as the Kim Novak Room. The staff are friendly at the York, and if you have a rental car, you might be able to nab free parking nearby, as we did, rather than pay $25 a day through the hotel itself.

<Content>Great value, decent location Hello,Just returned from a 4 night stay in San Fran. Our stay at the York Hotel was satisfactory. I had read many mixed reviews about the hotel, but the price was hard to beat so we decided to chance it.The lobby is spacious and nicely decorated. The room itself served our needs well. It had 2 spacious walk in closets and a mini-refrigerator that came in very handy as the water in SF is not very palatable. We bought bottled water to keep in the fridge. The room was clean and the beds were firm, which I personally favour.The bathroom had a full size tub and a good hot shower, although the water pressure was lacking a little. Staff at the hotel was helpful with getting us cabs, and various questions that we had about navigating through the city.There are 2 convenience stores within half a block of the hotel. There is also a small Mexican take out restaurant directly across the street. We had tacos from the restaurant, I would recommend the spicy chicken, it was tasty and inexpensive! I would not hesitate to stay in The York Hotel again. Please consider it if you are on a budget.

<Content>Great Hotel! We stayed at the York Hotel for 6 nights from the 11th March '05. We LOVED IT! The staff are very friendly and always very helpful, the rooms are alwyas clean and the facilities are more than adequate. We were not expecting much as the price was so good, but we got a great hotel. We will definately be staying there in the future. The location is perfect being only 4 blocks from the cable car line and Union Square. There are lots of places to eat locally and the transport system in the city is first class. We were at the back of the hotel on the 5th floor and it was always very quiet... Only thing to be heard was the occasional fire truck. The continental breakfast in the morning was much more than expected with a selection of food and drinks available. Always a good start to the morning! We will be back as its the best holiday we've had in a long time!

<Content>Fabulous Accomodations! It's been a year since I stayed at the York Hotel, and I still can't stop thinking about how much I loved it. The staff was friendly and willing to help with all of the questions my boyfriend and I had about getting around the city. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was clean. We walked everywhere and thought this was a great location for starting out. The neighbors in the area are pretty noisy on weekdays, but apparently they think the hotel patrons are too loud on the weekend, so it all equals out. Also, if they are still there, I highly recommend checking out the coffee shop across the street and the pizza by the slice on the corner... both were EXCELLENT.

<Content>Friendly staff, Afordable prices We stayed 2 nights in the York. The staff were very friendly and helpful in giving the first time visitor a helping hand. The rooms were very clean and comfortable. You have to remember that this is an old hotel and every thing is not perfect. The only real downfall is that the walls are very thin, or at least they were on the 7th floor, we could hear there keys rattling and people talking in the room next door like they were right in our room. You can turn on the fan on the heater and you wont hear a thing.Over all we slept very well and were treated well. If you are going for the sights and not the just the hotel this is the place to stay.

<Content>Loved it, loved it, loved it!!! First of all I have to say that the staff at the York really made the stay worth while. They were always extremely kind and VERY helpful for a first time visitor to the city. The staff was always able to give you great tips on restaurants, attractions and the best way to get there and back. Always curteous you felt as if you were coming home instead of to a hotel. They were always eager to hear how your trip was going and how your stay at the hotel could be improved, if needed.It was such a charming hotel and had a lot of character to it. It was nice to be able to spend a little less money and still know you are going to get the same kind of service (if not better) than some of the more expensive hotels in the area. I would recommend this hotel to anyone on a budget that doesn't mind staying in an older hotel with a lot of character, an INCREDIBLE staff, and at such a great location close to many of the wonderful things the great city of San Francisco has to offer.

<Content>we liked it lots. We recently stayed in the York Hotel, and will definitely stay there again. The staff were friendly, the lobby was attractive and the room was decent. Very reasonable rates for a hotel such an unbeatable location -- close to cable cars, North Beach, Union Square and Chinatown. And the martini bar downstairs was an elegant place to grab a drink or meet friends. We had no view to speak of and the bathroom could do with some touch ups. But if you like hotels with personality and don't want to break the bank, we highly recommend the York.

<Content>Give the York Hotel a try We stayed at The York for 5 nights, and we were very pleased. I just moved to the city of SF and stayed at the York as I was getting settled in. The hotel matches the prices on orbitz.com, so we were able to get the room for a very low rate. The York is in a safe neighborhood, which is a bonus. We had a queen sized bed in the room which was very comfortable, but the pillows were as flat as pancakes. As another person mentioned in their review, the rooms are very cold as the windows are not sealed all the way. I would definitely recommend this hotel, but the only complaint I have is that the continental breakfast lacks in variety, as another person mentioned in their review, and the coffee isn't that great. The only things they have at the continental breakfast are muffins, bread, bananas, and croissants. If you enjoy a decent cup of coffee in the morning, I recommend walking down the street (1 minute away) to Cuppa Joe Coffee House -- it's definitely worth it. The staff at the York were very nice and helpful when we had questions about where things were in the city. There is also a great little convenience store two doors down from the hotel if you need a snack or bottle of water, etc., since there is no vending machine in the hotel.

<Content>The York is NOT worth the savings I stayed at the York because the price was cheaper than most places. It was not worth the savings. The walls are very thin, you can hear your neighbors and doors slamming. The sheets were not clean, there was some unknown substance on the sheets. The shower was not functioning properly - the water would not drain fast enough.The staff is extremely nice, that is the only good thing about the York - everyone that worked there was very helpful and nice.

<Content>Cheap and dirty FIrst let me say that the staff was very friendly and I do not want this review to reflect on them in any way--Everybody I talked to was EXTREMELY helpful--the two young guys who work in the Plush Room Lounge in the hotel were fantastic--personality plus and offered to give me advice and savings at many local attractions/restaurants...so no complaints there AT ALL.NOW--the reason for my terribly low rating of this hotel. ABSOLUTELY FILTHY. The shower was molded. The drain in this hideous shower would not properly drain the water. My sheets were NOT clean. It is embarassing to say, but shortly before I left I closely inspected my single flat white sheet and discovered a crusted flick of snot of some sort that almost made me nautious. The room was very tired and beaten. My morning consisted of hearing the closet door of my neighbor being opened and slammed several times--as the walls are paper thin.PARKING is a bit annoying. You are asked to park a block down at the Butterick Garage on Sutter Street. They want to keep your keys--which I would not allow. Luckily my attendant was kind enough to allow me to keep my car keys. You must lug your luggage down the block. But this is understandable considering the structure of the city--The York has no property to facilitate a parking garage...I just want you to know what to expect...All in All I can safely say I do not intend to stay at The York again. I liked the people there--but the aged and filthy conditions of the hotel really disgusted me. The reviews that claim this hotel to be clean must either live like rats or be VERY forgiving. I am just being honest here.

<Content>A decent option if you are not fussy I recently stayed here for four days on business. Pros: the location is good as is the price for the location, the staff are helpful and the rooms reasonably well equiped. The cons: it wasn't as clean as I would like, the rooms a bit worn, breakfast was limited and I found the staff a bit distant. If you want a good central hotel at a decent rate is a good choice, but if you are looking for an experience / a bit extra, then I would look elsewhere.

<Content>Simply Adequate The York hotel was centrally located for us, and within walking distance of our favorite lounge -- The Red Room at the Commodore Hotel -- but the hotel itself was merely adequate. The lobby is comfortable with adequate seating for many, which is nice in SF. Free continential breakfast was a tray of pre-packaged store croissants and muffins of no bakery-quality whatsoever, whole bananas, and a tray of bread for toasting (which is recommended as the entire tray goes stale when left sitting out), juice, and dismal drip coffee. The rooms were clean, but old and tired. The tub was not suitable for bathing as the paint was peeling off the bottom and the drain was rusted. Not pleasant to imagine soaking in that. Showers were taken, instead. The room was advertised as having an in-room fridge, but this turned out to be a cooler box of some sort with a warning label which read that cold items could be put in the cooler box and kept cool, but it was not to be considered or treated as a refrigerator. Thus, no cold water was avail in the middle of the night as it lost its chill. The windows were broken in the seal so that they could not be shut tightly. I like the room cold so this was a benefit to me, but would not be good for someone who likes a warm interior. The bed was probably the single hardest mattress I have EVER had the misery to sleep on. It was a white sheet covered cement block, but the pillows were wonderful. Would I stay here again? If it came up on priceline I'd take it for the price. But it's not a destination hotel by ANY means, unless you're a die-hard Hitchcock fan and want to see the Virtigo Room.

<Content>Great Memories A quaint beauty with a great location. Botique hotel with a great history and a friendly staff. Treat yourself to a tour of the hotels fine bar and great shows. Centrally located if you like to walk the city and only a few blocks from the cable cars. Union square just six blocks away. Locating at the York enhanced our trip and gave us many good memories. Loved the York and the San Francisco people!

<Content>Good value for the money This hotel delivers what it promises ... a moderately priced, clean and reasonably convenient property to Union Square. If you don't mind the college-dorm lobby, the rooms are clean and spacious (we upgraded $10 to the king-sized bed). The breakfast (breads, juice and coffee) is OK; the shower is like mist in the jungle, but that is a common shortcoming of many hotels these days. It's not the Mark Hopkins, but at half (or better) the price of same, it delivers good value.

<Content>Classic hotel, with unique nightclub I had a wonderful stay at the York Hotel. Stayed in a room 408 which faced onto the courtyard/lightwell. No view, but very quiet. I arrived at 10am, and was lucky that they had 1 room available so I didn't have to wait until the afternoon to check in. Contrary to what some other reviewers have said, I found the staff to be friendly and courteous. In fact, when the shuttle to the airport that I had booked didn't arrive, the hotel ordered and paid for a private car to get me to the airport in time (which turned out to be a stretch limosine!). The continental breakfast is fine, although not extravagent. I often ended up having my morning coffee in the Cuppa Joe cafe just 1/2 block up the street as they have espresso there and free high speed wireless internet (whereas the York is dial up and you have to pay for it). I ended up booking directly through the hotel and was able to get rates as good as Expedia or hotels. If you look at the hotel's web site, they state that they will match any price of any internet re-seller, so I found a great price on hotels then called the York directly and they matched their prices, and I was able to specify what kind of bed (ie. a queen versus 2 twins). The advantage of doing this is that you don't have to pay up front, and if you need to cancel, you don't have to pay a $25 fee. The York is home to the Empire Plush Room which is one of SF's better nightclub lounges -- on friday and saturday nights it hosts the Va Va Voom Room an old fashioned burlesque/vaudeville show. I went to see it on it's opening night - absolutely hilarious! I highly recommend it. On other nights the Plush Room has lounge singers, and jazz singers sometimes quite well known ones. Check the hotel's web site for upcoming shows.

<Content>The York is a good value... Just returned from 7 nights in San Francisco. Stayed in a standard no-smoking room at the York - 7th floor rear - as recommended by other reviewers. Apparently this is one of a block of rooms reserved for Orbitz. Room was very quiet - even with windows open (heat wave - see Cons). Orbitz prepaid rate was as low as $60 a night Sun-Weds. $72 Thurs. $83 Fri. $95 Sat. plus taxes. Pros - within walking distance of Union Square - Market Street, cable cars. Rental Car not needed. Buy a $20 7-day Muni Pass at the airport information booths (not good on BART - but good on Cable Cars, Streetcars, bus and Metro subway). Small Self Park lot 2 blocks away charges $20 for 24 hours. High ceilings - oversize bathtub. Clean. No mold or cigarette smell. Room cost includes continental breakfast (see Cons). Very firm mattress on twin bed. Room had a small frig that worked well. Cons - Staff was cordial but could be friendlier. Is making an effort to get to know the name of a guest staying a week asking too much? On checkout, I got the impression we had stayed at an Orbitz Hotel - not the York. Did we enjoy our stay? No one asked. Did they hope I would return and stay there again - one will never know. When I asked for a fan - San Francisco was having a rare heat wave - I was told there were none left. And no effort made to get me one later when available. BTW - the rooms are not air conditioned - which normally wouldn't be an issue. Continental breakfast was meager. Banana and juice were highlights. That and walking up all those hills meant at least I didn't gain any weight! Ice and soft drink vending is on first floor only. Only one elevator - and it is slow.I would stay there again if I were able to get a similar rate. Comparable hotels nearby (albeit with air conditioning) were over $100 a night.An important caveat for booking on Orbitz: When I called the hotel a couple of weeks before arriving, they had no record of my reservation. I had to call Orbitz - and they seemed nonchalant. They offered to fax the details to the York - and an hour later all was well. Note: I had prepaid the booking a couple of months prior! The Orbitz agent said it sometimes happens that their computer doesn't talk to the hotel's computer!

<Content>Overall, a good stay After reading review after review on the Net of where to stay in San Fran, we decided on The York for 7 nights on a trip from Canada down through Washington, Portland and California in early August 2004.We are both 21 but probably represented the slightly younger end of the hotel's clients which averaged around late 20's-early 30's.Pro's* Very helpful and friendly staff. They were always happy to help with sight-seeing guidance, transport information, directions, everything right down to which baseball team to see! * Clean and well decorated room (we stayed in room 609 - I think!) Decent size bed for a Queen. Nice selection of TV stations. Clock/radio and drink making facilities included with small sink and adequate size fridge.* Daily cleaning service was very good. Regularly re-stocked complilmentary toiletries and towels.* Reasonably priced room telephone.* Nice central positioning. Union Square probably 10 minute walk at most. Bus stop about 150m from lobby. BART station about 15min walk. Cable cars about 5 minute walk. Don't think would bother with car - buy a multi-day MUNI transport pass instead ($15 for 3days) and get unlimited travel.* Free breakfast (see con's!)* Reasonably priced for a central location* A good, safe neighbourhood. Even late at night we would walk back from having been out feeling completely safe.* Good selection of resturants and eateries in vicinity.Con's* After reading review's of other users, I requested an upper floor room when booking online. This was honoured (helpful staff!) and I had a top floor room. So the street noise etc was not a problem. However, on Fri/Sat nights the hotel's show in the Plush room is incredibly loud. I think because of the age of the building the club has not been sound-proofed. The show starts at 11pm and ends by 1:30am so the noise is only for a few hours but still, very audiable even with the windows closed.* The room walls are made of paper and biscuits. Not literally, obviously, but they may as well have been. Unfortunately for 3 nights the occupants of the adjacent room had a small baby that cried and gurgled and made baby sounds. That didn't bother me. What did bother me is that because of the thin walls it sounded as though the baby was actually in my room. As with the club sound, shouldn't be a major problem but when you fancy a lie-in after a heavy night, its annoying.* The free breakfast isn't exactly great. Served in the lobby between 6-10 (I think!) we had the choice of: OJ, coffee, croissants, blueberry muffins, bananas, white/brown bread for toasting and a selection of jams. Although not awful, would have been nice to see a little variation in foods, especially due to having the same 8days running.* Quite possibly the slowest elevator in the world. Pretty self explanatory. On the whole however, I enjoyed my stay at The York, although my only *real* gripe is the noise level. Despite this, I would probably return but with more ear plugs! However, this may have just been a personal opinion as my girlfriend didn't seem to find it as distracting.Summary: Nice hotel, great staff, good safe area, thin walls.

<Content>recommend When you are from out of town its always a drag to find somehwere half decent, the York was a OK choice, we were travelling for three weeks so we did not want to spend too much for our city centre hotels the York represented good value for its location. I would echo previous comments about not needing a car, we arrived with our hire car and never touched it for our 3 day stay until we checked out for our return to the airport, that cost us $120, if you do need your car don't get them to valet it for you as the garage is one block down and the valet charge is $35 per day v $17 per day if you self park and dont take your car out or $25 if you do take it out +tax. We bought our Muni travel passes at the market a few doors down but he didn't have the 3 days passes which are much better value than the 1 day $9 one's.We stopped in room 303, it was noisy from 6am onwards with trash trucks etc, the room was large with kitchenette, ok bathroom, mini safe, no air, just a weedy little heater, even though it was the end of July, we found S.F. was cold and damp (and I'm English!). The inclusive breakfast is just coffee, juice and a bit of fruit  pastries we went a couple of block down Sutter to a little Dutch coffee house / cafe called the ''Bean ??'' nice pancakes and cosy. The staff at the York were helpful, I would stop there again but ask for a higher room.

<Content>Good place to stay Stayed at this hotel for a week and was very pleased. Rooms are small but adequate. Staff is very helpful. Don't bother renting a car if you are staying here. We rented one the first day at the airport and returned it the next day. Cabs and public transportation readily available. I concur with the previous review that a visit to the Overflow down the street is a friendly experience where we picked up good information on what to see and do in San Francisco.

<Content>Many Happy Returns I have stayed in the York Hotel for new years eve for the last 3 years, I stay there every time I go to S.F. We used to stay out of town, (Pleasenton or Walnut Creek) to save money, then we found the York and have stayed there ever sence. The location is great, $6.00 taxi can get you most anywhere and BART (rapid transit) is a 15min walk. The bus system is also very easy to use, we never rent a car in S.F. any more, parking to expensive and public trans is cheap, enough said. Gregory is one of the best valets I have ever met in any price hotel and the staff is very accomodating. Last year the cont. breakfast changed, they no longer offer fruit  cereal. The rooms are always clean, there is always ice in the machine, and the thing I like the best- when you walk out the front door you are already in the heart of the city, you can walk or catch a bus anywhere.

<Content>Great Location/Wonderful Staff April 13My partner and I have just returned from a four day mini holiday in San Francisco. We chose the York based on location and price. We were pleased with both. Having read in Trip Advisor about noise issues, we had requested and received a room on the seventh floor in the back. The room was quite adequate, very clean and quiet. The desk staff was extremely helpful with our tourist questions, and always willing to answer the myriad of questions we had. The lobby is under construction, but not an issue, the breakfast is skimpy, but San Francisco has plenty of restaurants. The hotel is easy walking distance to many attractions and on three bus lines. We WILL not hesitate to stay at the York the next time we are in San Francisco.

<Content>A Cinematic Triumph Forget the bad things you've heard about the staff at the York - the reviewer must've caught them on a bad day. Entirely helpful with tourist issues during our visit, they even offered us a discount on our next trip due to some minor construction going on in the lobby that wasn't even an inconvenience to us.While a bit old, the rooms were clean and a good size for the price. Lobby and bar were beautiful and in top condition.The only complaint we had was the noise from the Cabaret on Friday and Saturday nights. If you have a room on the open space on the inside of the building, the Plush Room is at the bottom and not well insulated. Nevertheless, turning on the heater/fan unit pretty much drowned it out.

<Content>dilapidated charm I just returned from a weekend at the York. I was pleasantly surprised, having read the reviews. It is an older hotel, solidly 3 stars and it does show its age in places. But my room was clean, the furniture comfortable. As a single woman traveling, I did not feel uncomfortable walking around at night. The staff, as mentioned before, is extremely friendly and helpful. I will say, though, that the walls are thin and that the Cabaret was loud enough to hear clearly in my 3rd floor room. All in all, I would return to the York.

<Content>York Hotel On March 3-7, 2004, I stayed at the York Hotel in San Francisco, California. The York is a nice old victorian hotel, but that big water/mold spot on the ceiling in the lobby needs to be taken care of. It's the first thing you see as you come into the hotel. The rooms are clean and adequate, although a rotor rooter company was servicing the hotel on my arrival and therefore there was no water available for several hours. It could be a bit of a wait to catch the elevator to the floors, as there are eight floors and one elevator servicing the hotel. The staff were friendly; the continental breakfast was adequate. The fitness center is really an exercise room. There are only three pieces of equipment in the center; a stationary bike, treadmill and elliptical trainer, and no TV. All in all, I would consider staying at the York again because of its location in the downtown area.

<Content>Love It Or Hate It - It Seems Based on previous reviews the York is either a love it or hate it accomodation. I spent 4 nights here in March of 2004 and found myself being in the love it section.My room on the 4th floor was large enough for the 2 of us for the limited time we were actually in the room. San Francisco has so much for a 1st time visitor to see that there is little time to spend just hanging out in the hotel. The room was very clean, the bed comfortable and the furniture was of good quality.The lack of air conditioning could be a negative but even with 80 degree days and somewhat cooler nights we had no need for air conditioning. The free continental breakfast could be deemed a negative as it was limited daily to breads, store bought muffins and croissants, fruits, jellies, coffee, tea and juices. At the bargain basement rate we paid it should have been anticipated that breakfast would not be a strong point.The staff we found to be outstanding. Front deskers Jack and Michael and concierges Kyle and Gregory were as outgoing and helpful as any staff at any hotel in which we've ever stayed (even the top end ones). They ensured that we were very much at home while we were away from home. Our specials thanks to them.Would we return to the York should we return to San Francisco? Most assuredly so.

<Content>Exceeded Expectations After having read some poor reviews of the York on this site, I was pleasantly surprised. The room was spacious, clean and quiet (it was a weekday that we stayed), and it provided an excellent location from which to explore San Francisco on foot. The nearby parking at $15 wasn't too bad either, and it has to be remembered that this hotel is in the middle of a city, and guests can't therefore expect free parking and total peace! The staff were very helpful, providing us on request with the location of a half-price theatre ticket booth, from which we obtained very good half-price tickets to see Mamma Mia at the Golden Gate Theatre. To sum up, don't dismiss this hotel - it really is rather good.
