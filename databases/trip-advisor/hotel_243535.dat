<Content>Great Location - censored internet access The location is just awesome for shopping and to discover this great, great city of San Francisco. Rooms are simple, modern furnished, not too spacious but not too small. No air-con which was not a problem in December.The staff very friendly and helpful.So why only 3 stars? Believe it or not, we live in San Francisco in 2008 and those guys censor the internet access. Now you might say, to hell with all such adult sites - but their sonic wall stops you as well if you are looking for a nice place where you want to sip your whisky sour. Why? Because you may not visit sites promoting alcohol/tobacco.I just hat such invasion of my privacy - so I will definitely NOT return to such a narrow minded place.

<Content>Great Location - But that's the extent of it! Let this be a lesson...check to be sure air conditioning is provided before booking any hotel. Normally, in San Francisco, A/C is not an issue, but we happened to be there during a heat wave. There was a small fan in the closet, which did little but move hot air around. Our window looked out into an interior shaft and there was no cool air to pull into the room. The blinds were broken and the room was very, very small. We could barely walk around the bed. The hotel is in a great location near the BART station, but we would never stay at the Hotel Fusion again. Very small (non-existant) lobby and the continental breakfast was pathetic..

<Content>Best little hotel on the block We were needing a place to stay for 6 nights in San Francisco and our travel agent picked this one. I can honestly say it was the best choice he could have made!This place is modern, clean and the staff are ace. Our room was furnished in a simple but modern and stylish way. It was more than adequate for our needs. The staff gave us useful tips on getting the most out of our stay, including the best tips for getting around the city and what to see that shouldn't be missed. When we stayed there the manager threw a weekly meet and greet with wine and nibbles for his guests where he mingled with everyone and sought their opinions on the hotel. This was a nice touch and a good way to get direct feedback.Great little hotel for a city break. Try it - you may like it!!!

<Content>Excellent Value I am torn betwen 3 and 4 rating , somewhere in the middle i guess Yes the room was small and it is slightly noisy (from the 5th floor), but it was extremely clean, very nicely refurbished, and excellent location. And the price certainly justifies staying here.

<Content>Lovely Hotel but vey noisy Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights (room 504). The room was very nice but no aircon. The surrounding area is very noisy especially after midnight. Could not sleep with windows open and the electric fan that was provided was very noisy. Breakfast not worth mentioning, see other reviews.Location excellent. Very close to the cable car and the BART.Staff very friendly. Our room was very clean. If you stay there I suggest you take ear plugs to block out the noise.Would stay there again if I could get a good deal.

<Content>Good value for San Francisco All I wanted was a cheap, clean, safe place to stay for three nights in San Francisco. Hotel Fusion more than met my needs -- and it's also in a great central location.It's a low-frills place, but the decor is nice. Rooms are tiny, yes, but I paid about $130 per night including taxes, and that was about the best deal I could find in SF. Other hotels anywhere near that price were in out-of-the way locations, had bad reviews, or had doors that opened to outdoor walkways (which I avoid as a woman travelling alone).I asked for a quiet room, and got one on the 2nd floor facing the interior walls, so my view was of the room across the way, but that was fine; I just kept the shades down.The bathroom was large and very nice.The continental breakfast was on the low end of what seems to be standard these days -- a pile of bages, bread for toasting, muffins, oranges, two kinds of juice, and coffee. Not great but again, my main criteria were price, safety, and cleanliness.My only issue was that the room was stuffy -- sounds like others had this problem too -- and my window didn't open. But I'd stay there again because the staff was nice, the location great (a couple of blocks from Powell and Market), and the price was right.

<Content>Great value but a couple of tips.. The Hotel Fusion is a great choice. It is very centrally located with the cable car just around the corner and the trolley cars in market street which will take you to the Ferry Building for $1.50. There are plenty of shops and department stores close by. The hotel has been refurbished and the decor is tasteful. The facilities are basic but clean and in good condition.My room wasn't fantastic in that the only window opened into the central area of the building. I was on level two and this was the roof of the central area space (gosh that is hard to explain). So, if I was so inclined, I could step out of my window walk on the internal roof to the next room and step into theirs. There is no airconditioning in the building. Being a woman travelling solo this meant that I didn't feel secure enough to sleep with my window open hence I had a very hot and stuffy night. The fans provided are very noisy and are pretty ineffectual unless you sit them on your open window sill.Saying that, the pros of this hotel far outweigh the cons and I would stay here again. I would request a room on the higher floors facing the street and I would be very happy. Really great value for money, fantastic staff and excellent location.

<Content>average at best This hotel has a good location, but not a lot else, it took the staff three goes to get us to the right room, including giving us the key to an occupied room, and keys that did not work. We were then allegedly upgraded, from what I cannot imagine, the room was tiny, and not air conditioned. The continental breakfast was a complete farce, a few stale bread rolls in a converted bedroom, which had then to be carried back to the bedroom, where there was no where to eat but on the bed. The staff apart from the initial difficulties were pleasant and helpfull, and the hotel seemed clean.

<Content>Great deal!! We stayed at Hotel Fusion Sept 13-20. The location could not get any better! Just two blocks from the Powell St. BART station and the cable car turnaround, just a short walk to all the shopping/restaurants in Union Square. The room itself was pretty basic, but clean. The rooms were kind of small (we had a queen room), but very functional, had lots of storage/closet space, and the bathroom was large. Nice plasma TV, too! It was very clean and the staff were very helpful and friendly. No A/C but you really don't need it, it gets cool at night in SF.We didn't spend a lot of time in the hotel (too much to do in the city!), but our room at Hotel Fusion served it's purpose well, we felt comforable and we would definitely stay here again. For the price and the location, this place is a steal!

<Content>Friendly staff, room tried to be nice but had flaws Hotel Fusion is located in the heart of San Francisco's downtown tourist area, a couple of blocks from the cable car turnaround. We had no trouble parking (they have two passenger zones), checking in, or getting help with our luggage from the hotel staff. We booked a king bed room. The room was spacious, clean, and recently updated. There was a snack basket and stocked refrigerator in the room. Most hotels gouge you on in-room snacks but the prices here were reasonable for an urban hotel鈥?2 for a soda, for example.There were some problems with the room layout. The strangest problem was with the free wired Internet. (There is no wireless in the rooms, although we were told there was wireless in the lobby.) The Ethernet plug was next to the bed, and the desk was across the room. The front desk provided a long Ethernet cable but it still wasn't long enough to reach the desk. The only phone was also next to the bed. The bathroom was very small with a glass-enclosed shower that leaked terribly. There was almost no room to store toiletries in the bathroom.The chairs were not very comfortable.The bed was on a platform and it was very hard鈥攊t basically felt like a futon bed. Not surprising for an urban hotel, the room was extremely noisy, especially with the window open. I could hear the cable cars going by half a block away, with their bells ringing, and lots of traffic noise, pedestrian noise, and police/fire sirens. I thought this was kind of fun, but your mileage may vary.The free continental breakfast wasn't very exciting but there was a coffee stand half a block away where you could get a breakfast sandwich and espresso drinks. There were many restaurants nearby.We opted for valet parking. The hotel staff let us know that it takes about 20 minutes for the valet parking service to respond to a request to pick up or drop off a car. I would not stay in the same room again at this hotel, because of the tiny leaky bathroom and layout problems, but I liked the location and the staff, so I might consider staying in a different room.

<Content>Good location FUSION was a decent hotel on the same block as the APPLE flagship store and right on union square shopping. The location was good it you exit the hotel and turn left.the right hand side of the hotel houses loads of homeless beggers who are completly harmless but may not work for families with children. the room was small but nice and clean. the free breakfast was a plus. concierge was nice enough. the hotel is pretty well located for all other sites as SF is pretty small in size and you can cover it all with a city tour. you can then go back to the places you liked. overall, not bad, but there are better hotels around it which may offer a bigger room.

<Content>not great but not awful... We stayed at fusion for 3 nights in July 2008. The stay was ok. On the good side the room was clean and big enough with a comfortable king bed. The bathroom was clean, no bath just a shower which was fine for us. The location is great as long as you turn left as you leave the hotel as to the right there are some dodgy characters lurking about. The cable cars are just around the corner and all the shopping areas and good restaurants and nightlife are close by. On the bad side, the desk staff are soooooo rude. They seem to hate their jobs and treat the guests accordingly with one guy in particular saying he'd rather stay in hell than stay here as we were checking out! not exactly a nice touch. The rooms are extremely noisy. the lift makes a great deal of noise and rings it's bell loudly on each floor so if your room is opposite it you'll hear it all night. The street noise is horrendous too with fire engines going by al the time. I didn't hate staying at the fusion but don't think i'll stay here again.

<Content>Great overall experience Stayed at fusion for 4 nights and would reccomend this hotel to anyone for the following reasons: The price is affordable based on what you can pay in San Fran.Excellent location right in the heart of union square - you can take a quick cab ride, trolly, or even walk to the pier if you have some time and want to see the City. (It was bit of a walk, but there are great sights, and plenty of pubs/cafe's on the way to stop in for a little rest and a drink).Close to great shopping.Spotlessly clean and modern decor in the rooms. Flat screen TVs, treat baskets, mini fridges, comfy beds and pillows. Very friendly and helpfull sfaff.There is a lot to spend your money on in San Fran, but this hotel is very affordable and is so amazing, that you don't feel like you are missing out on anything at all! Very nice experience!

<Content>High Quality hotel, Outstanding location! I stayed two nights at the Hotel Fusion (Thursday  Friday) and found it to be an overall excellent value. I paid $124/night for the room, which was a bargain considering it was summer in San Francisco. The hotel looked like it had been recently renovated and the room was small but really really clean, which to me is way more important than size. But the best part for me was the location. It was so centrally located, right there in Union Square. It was right around the corner from Macy's, Market Street, etc., with the BART trains and cable cars nearby. I could not have asked for a better hotel location, especially given that I am a young woman who traveled alone to the city simply for a convention. The only reason I didn't give the room an excellent rating was for a couple of reasons; 1) like I mentioned, the room seemed really small to me. Perhaps I was expecting something bigger, but in the end it didn't really matter because I didn't stay that much in it anyway. The second was that the room had no extra plugs. I had to unplug things just to charge up my phone, which I thought was weird for a hotel that seemed to market itself towards business travelers'.

<Content>worst in the city My new wife and I reserved a room at Hotel Fusion a good time ago to capitalize on a good rate - well, it is true, you get what you pay for. We left after one night, we had anticipated a 4 night stay as part of our honeymoon. Firstly, the hotel is in a pretty terrible neighborhood, the Valet parking was poor (there was a massive dumpster up front of the hotel that impeded your parking) The hotel was awkwardly layed out. These are the nice things I can say about this dump. I guess the main problem we had was the website they had showed these very nice, trendy rooms.... not so. What you get at Fusion is a tiny, tiny room, no A/C (not a problem in SF if you have Cross Ventalation (we had a stale smelling alley ajoining our room) A queen size bed that was closer to a twin, uncomfortable with (only) 2 pillows. No glasswear in the room, just plastic dixy cups. A 3/4 bath, (just a stand up shower, no tub) Paper thin walls, a seal on the door that let light from the hall in. Basically, when we opened up our 2 suit cases it took up the whole room. It was a pretty negative experiance in a pretty great city. I would avoid at all costs.... pay an extra 50 and stay somewhere else!!!!

<Content>Great hotel and location We stayed at the end of June-first week July. Great location right off the BART and in the middle of the shopping district. Hotel staff were very freindly and house keeping was perfect. They have a breakfast room on the 5th floor which had what you needed to start your day and hold you until lunch. They are going to open a sit down area for breakfast during the winter of this year. I did read the reviews and bokked and internal room and did not have any problem with noise. You can not beat it for the price. feel free to send me a note if you have specific questions

<Content>Excellent location! My husband and I stayed at Fusion for 2 nights and loved the location! the staff was very friendly and helpful. since the hotel is located in a busy shopping district, it is advisable to ask for a room that doesn't face the road.the only complaint I had was that the breakast was served in a tiny room on the top floor and we had to pick it up and take it to our room since there was no place to eat there.other than that, a great hotel and will definately stay there again!

<Content>Great hotel in centre of town My wife and I are in early 60s from Australia. Booked hotel in conjunction with Extranomical tours. The room was quiet (ask for internal facing) but rather small. Staff and housekeeping v friendly and accommodating. B'fast was help yourself to toast, danish and coffee etc. Fabulous location for touring city, just stones throw from cable car terminus and right in Union sq shopping precinct. Recommended.

<Content>Great Hotel for the Price I stayed at the Hotel Fusion for five days booking through Hotwire for only $69 a night. I got much more for the $69 than I expected. I found the Hotel had been newly refurbished and very modern. The rooms are small but nicely updated and all have high speed internet that worked great. They offer a mini breakfast in the morning that consists of toast or bagels and jucie and coffee. There is no air conditioning but in San Francisco that really isnt much of an issue. The rooms do get a lot of noise from the streetcars and traffic but was no more than I would expect in a busy city. The location is excellent, being in the heart of Union Square. Overall this was an excellent value in a City where rooms can easily cost three times what I paid. I would stay there again without hesitation.

<Content>Great location for short stay, a little bit on the noisy side... Stayed here for one night prior to an Alaskan cruise from SF in mid May. Weather was nice in the high 60's-70's Hotel is conveniently located short 5 minutes walk from BART ( less than $10 pp) Powell exit, though we took shuttle (Lorrie, about $30 for 2) from airport since we got 3 big piece of luggages, didnt want to lug them around even for 1 block.Hotel is centrally located closed to Union Square  across from Parc 55 which I also stayed years ago, a different class of hotel. Since this is just for 1 night and per TA recommendation I though I gave it a try. Hotel reception is fine, staff are friendly and efficient. I didnt need much help from them since I've been to SF many times but they are there when one does need help.Stayed on the 3rd floor, room was slightly stuffy when first entered which immediately opening the window helped since there was cool breeze. Kept window opened all night and a fan in the room helped circulate air, so no problem there. Only problem is for the night we were in, there were some night owls on the street making strange noises, plus some garbage truck or street cleaning vehicle were making noises that was kind of annoying but can get used to it. For those who are noise sensitive can be a problem.As others have mentioned, free continental breakfast on 5th floor and free internet use on 3rd floor. Within 10 to 15 minutes walk, one can cover Union Square, Westfield Mall, Chinatown, access to cable cars, buses, BART etc. A fine 2-3 stars hotel that cost us about $145 (tax and fee included).Also if one likes Chinese food, Tian Sing is in the same building on ground floor. I understand one of the chefs from Yang Sing (which I've been to few times) opened this one. They are both quite good for dim sum.

<Content>Thin walls but otherwise fine. This is evidently a former SRO hotel that has been refurbished and dressed up with modern art paintings on the walls. The rooms are small and the walls ominously thin. One aspect I liked is the Fusion鈥檚 stairwells. Fully open to viewing on each floor, cheerfully lighted, carpeted, and clean, they attract usage. The desk staff was sometimes overbusy, but this was during the Memorial Day holiday. I rate the Fusion as a good 2-star.

<Content>great location... thats all! I was not 100% sure of wether to book this hotel, but as I was on a budget and needed something central in SF I decided to give it a try... location is excellent.. minutes from Union Square, the tram/muni etc rooms are small and soo noisy. I could literally be woken in the morning by next doors alarm going off!!! It was really warm (very noisy aircon) and impossible to open the window as noisy at night. Bedside lamp NOT WORKING and after 3 days, TV was NOT WORKING too.The blonde receptionist when checking in was very chatty and warm but only there that 1 day.if budget is a priority this is ok- i would rather save some extra 拢拢 and enjoy my hotel/room a bit more next time. I felt lucky I was out most of day.

<Content>ideal location You can't beat the location of this hotel-2 mins walk from Powell BART station(30 mins direct link from airport)and 2 mins walk from Union Square with every major dept. store-Macy's, Saks, etc-loads of top end shops and a great place to sit and get some free WiFi! You also catch the cable cars up Nob Hill/Russian Hill etc from Powell St and there are loads of places to grab great food nearby. The hotel itself was very clean and my room on 5th floor had no problem with noise from outside or neighbouring rooms-there is no restaurant but they provide toast/croissants etc and coffee/tea/fruit juice self service for free from a room also on 5th floor-pretty handy to take back to your room-especially for single travellers-there is also free use of computers/internet(small charge for printing)on 3rd floor. Room itself very clean-shower was good-LCD tv with DVD player-room pretty small but how much space do you really need!? Only small issue was no air-con-didn't bother me particularly I just left window open constantly and the fan on. San Francisco is great city-loads of brilliant and different ares to see-this hotel provides ideal base to explore all of it by walking or public transport and I paid 拢35 a night through Expedia-really can't be beaten

<Content>Great location but noisy. The hotel is in a great location right beside Union Square,all the major shops and at the cablecar turnaround.We booked a queen room which overlooked Ellis street but the problem was it was very noisy outside with sirens,bin lorries and bells from the cablecar.The breakfast was very basic and you have to go back to your room to eat it.There was no air con in the room which may be a problem in summer.On the other hand the room was very clean with a good tv and cd player and coffey making facility.The bed was comfortable and the bathroom good.Overall not a bad hotel if you have a budget.

<Content>Better than expected! We stayed here for 2 nights having booked after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor.Even though we thought it looked good we didn't expect much due to comments on room size, noise etc.We were pleasently suprised by the size of our king room. We had loads of room, a small table and chairs and plenty of storage in the bedside cabinets, chest of drawers and double wardrobe!The bathroom was great, really modern and clean and the room was immaculate.Yes, there was a lot of street noise but what city hotel doesn't suffer from this?Good location (about half hour walk to Pier 39 but easy to get trams etc), friendly and helpful staff and clean, modern rooms.

<Content>Excellent location, but bring ear plugs! My husband and I booked a Queen room with a baby bed for a 1 week stay. Upon arrival - we were put in a teeny,tiny double room with absolutely no room for a baby bed. The front desk people were absolutely excellent in fixing this problem by upgrading us immediately to a king sized room (apparently the qn. rooms were overbooked). Unfortunately the hotel does not have cribs so we had our 22 month old sleeping with us for the entire week. (no explanation given as to why we were promised one when we booked!) The location is fantastic as all other reviewers have said. If you are in an outside room the noise can be a bit much (depending on your tolerance for street noises)... garbage trucks every night at 12:30, sirens ALL the time, car alarms etc...We seemed to get used to it by the 4th night and were able to sleep a bit better.Housekeeping is excellent, rooms were immaculate, and service was always friendly and helpful.Breakfast is nothing to get excited about - handy to have something in your stomach before leaving for the day... can't say much more than that!Overall, I would recommend this hotel for the price and location. I would stay here again as long as I had a room that faced the inside of the building.

<Content>Location is great! Good for short stays... We stayed at the Hotel Fusion for 2 nights as soon as we got to San Francisco.The location of this hotel is great! It's only a short walk to Union Square, Westfield on Market St and Powell St cable cars (route to Fisherman's Wharf).The staff manning the reception desk was friendly and the concierge was helpful! He recommended the Chinese restaurant next door which we agree, was a great feed! The Irish pub (Johnny Foley's Irish House鈥? around the corner was a nice stop after dinner.The downer for us was the size of the room. We stayed in a King bed room, which was quite small to the point where we had trouble moving around and it took awhile to find spots to put our suitcases down. The bathroom was almost the same size of the bedroom!! Would recommend this hotel to the budget conscious traveller, who isn鈥檛 after anything flashy

<Content>excellent location we chose fusion hotel over its excellent location. during the chinese new year, Most of the hotels were running full house this time. Usually, as a airline staff, I could easily get an attractive hotel discount but not this time. After carefull selection, we found hotel fusion could offer us the superior location. Everything was within walking distance. The surounding was reasonably safe too. The hotel itself has a very simple reception but that was all we needed. The room itself is clean, reasonable size but not huge in anyway. as many of the previous comments, the layout the room is a bit odd and it could be quite noisy due to the thin wall. you could be rest assured that the traffic noise was minimum though. THe so called complimentary breakfast could be quite a scene in room 507. It is a very tiny room. It could be quite crowded . Breakfast includes selection of bread rolls, juices, coffee/tea.

<Content>Unsure about this one I am unsure about this hotel. We booked it after reading the great reviews on tripadvisor, and we've never been let down by any of the properties that we've found this way, until the Fusion.Ou main issue with the property was the noise. Not from the street, but the people in the rooms next to us. The walls sound like they are made of paper. We could hear EVERYTHING from the other rooms. Talking, tv's, phones, people using the bathroom ( and I do not mean the hotel plumbing!) nothing was left to the imagination. On top of that the noise from above rooms sounded like elephants were racing round and round.The weather was warm while we were there so we wanted the window open, ( we had an internal room) but the noise from the other rooms with their windows open meant it wasn't an option. We ended up having to use ear plugs for the entire stay.We were offered another room, but when we went to check it out, the tv next door was blaring, so it wasn't a viable option.The other issue we had was the house keeping. When we checked in the room was immaculate. However after that it went downhill. We re-use our towels so didn't want them replaced every day, however some days they would take towels and not replace them at all. The floor wasn't vacuumed for about 3 days, breakfast crumbs stayed for the whole weekend. On the plus side, the location was brilliant. You could walk to shops, the cable car, restaurants, the information centre and transport.I'm not sure if we just got them at an off time, as previous reviews have been excellent, but I would struggle to recommend the hotel to to family and friends.(Sorry for the late review, we have been travelling since then)

<Content>Great location, small rooms This hotel is good. Great location only 2 blocks from Union Square, nice modern decor and friendly staff. The hair products they provide are Rusk - good stuff. The mini-bar is stocked with great items including energy drinks and they are decently priced. Parking was my only concern - $35 a night. Unfortunately, that is the cheapest you will find unless you walk miles. So be sure to include the extra $35 ($40 with tax) when you are budgeting for your trip. Overall, the hotel was great. Small rooms

<Content>Great place to stay!! Got a great rate on this hotel by contacting them directly - WE STAYED A WEEK!!! Had slight problem on checking in with the room type we had requested, but staff more than helpful and they actually did contact us to apologise again the following day.Hotel was excellent, centrally located, helpful and friendly staff, really clean with complimentary breakfast. Would definitely stay again although there is no airconditioning which might prove a problem in really warm weather - we stayed in late October.Rooms aren't massive but have everything you could possibly want and really you don't spend that much time in them! Overall, excellent hotel in great location. Highly recommend

<Content>Great Stay at the Fusion I spent 6 nights at the Hotel Fusion, San Francisco and would highly recommend it. Being my first trip to San Fran, the hotel was located right in the downtown area, easy walking to shops, restaurants, bus, rail and tram services. The front desk staff were extremely helpful and friendly. We had a twin and a queen room, both were very clean, good sized and had complimentary tea/coffee making facilities. Breakfast was available in a seperate room, which was fine for us, lots of toast, muffins, mini crossiants, juice, coffee etc available.I would definately stay at the Fusion next time I visit San Fran.

<Content>Excellent Hotel for the right traveller! I read all the reviews before coming, and found them overall good, with a few exceptions I thought I could live with for $65 a night. I booked the 7 night for 5 night special and looked forward to it, cautiously. I was pleasantly suprised. Being a boutique hotel and not a bland and boring chain, it has a small but stylish lobby. Since I'venever once spent time in a hotel lobby while travelling I couldn't care less. What really blew us away was the absolutely perfect location of this hotel. When they say it is 2 blocks from the BART, streetcar and bus, they mean the two tiniest blocks in the world. The trolleys are 1 of those tiny blocks away. It is surrounded by excellent restaurants, coffee shops, and all the shopping and amenities a person could want.It neighbors very expensive hotels and is by far the easiest location for getting to Chinatown, Alcatraz, Fisherman's Wharf, the Castro, Haight, Financial District, and the Mission. There is no better location for a vacation to San Francisco! I love the Fusion and will definately stay here again.The entire hotel underwent an extensive 2 year renovation that completed just last year and it shows. There is beautiful granite everywhere, a very modern elevator with little tv's to watch while youwait (though it never took more than 2 minutes). Our room was tastefuland comfortable with a comfy bed, clean and well lit bathroom with an exhaust fan, and a flat screen TV with a DVD player built in. Our roomwas one of the smallest in the hotel, judging from views of other rooms as we saw them cleaned, and I wished for a dresser instead of a desk, but I did find the furnishings comfortable and nice and I was able to put our suitcase on one of those stands and live out of it. I wouldn't come here expecting a room the size of a football field, but I would expect it to be very nice.The hotel offered a continental breakfast of fruit, toast, coffee, croissants, muffins, milk and juice, and an exercise room we never used. Every room has a fan, ironing board, and iron, fairly affordablesnack bar (that we never used because the Walgreens drugstore was 1/2 a block away), a coffee maker, hair dryer, nice towels, shampoo, conditioner, lotion, and soap. If you are used to staying at bland chains you might find the possiblity of a smaller room in such a greaturban setting odd, otherwise, I woud recommend this hotel for your next trip to San Francisco.As a note too.. the hotel doesn't HAVE air conditioning, so the compaints about it's not working and it's noise are puzzling...check out the weather and maybe avoid the hotel if you require air conditioning in the hottest months of the year.

<Content>Great value Fusion Stayed 4 nights at the Fusion Hotel. Very comfortable and relaxed atmosphere. Don't expect elaborate, but do expect courtesy and helpfulness and a very pleasant stay. Rooms are clean and comfortable with coffee machine and snacks available. Stayed in room 503 which gave us more than sufficient room (after all, you don't go on holiday to stay in your room). Free coffee available at reception 24/7. Adequate breakfast included in room cost. Perfect location, far preferable to Fishermans Wharf. All modes of transport within one block. Minutes from Union Square. Felt very safe in this area of the city. Staff very polite and helped in every way possible, even searching the internet to find tickets for the Raiders football game. We stayed at the Fusion as we had very little choice, due to a convention in the city. How lucky we were. Next time, the Fusion will not be a lucky choice, it will be the first choice. What value for money.

<Content>Clean, stylish and in a great location, but a few problems Sorry for the late review...I was a little put off by the rave reviews.I reserved 7 nights via expedia.com, as the site offered a book-7-nights-and-pay-for-5-nights deal. Paying about $66/night was a great deal, considering the location. Staff was friendly, continental breakfast items were basic but abundant (we had to take it back to our room because they do not provide an eating area...no biggie), and we snagged a few extra items to snack on during our days. For the price I paid, I think got the smallest room available. I did see other rooms as housekeeping were making rounds, and I envied the larger spaces. Oh well, right? It was only me and my husband. The room was really clean, it had a nice large flat screen tv and mini bar/fridge which we used extra space to stash drinks and leftovers.Here come the however's...-There was no fan in the bathroom and its window was painted shut, so it was really stuffy. -The air conditioning made strange sounds when we tried to turn it on, so we didn't bother.-There was no screen in the window, and we had to keep the window open the whole time for some circulation, so we had to accept any spiders and other crawlies that wanted to cohabitate with us. Hoped the big pull-down shade and curtains could help.-Despite our location and knowing that there would be street noise, there was another unidentified and strange noise coming from outside our window, which didn't face the street, the first night that kept us up (maybe another malfunctioning air conditioner?) We would have asked for another room if it continued through the night, but we end up falling asleep because we were exhausted.-The one elevator in the hotel didn't work for one day, which was one day when we really needed it. Being on the top (5th) floor, my legs were screaming for mercy after the last trip up to the room.We're not picky people, and we've stayed in worse places, so we never complained. There are a lot of good things about this hotel, but considering the things that didn't work but should because they offer it (elevator, air con), I would probably stay somewhere else next time. I'd give up a little style for a bit of comfort after a long hot day.

<Content>Definitely will return Chose the Fusion having read the reviews on Trip Advisor. The entrance was a bit of a disappointment - I had expected something slightly bigger. However the staff were excellent, the setting was perfect and, as I had an inside room with a rather dull view of a courtyard, it was very quiet. Food in the on site Chinese restaurant was good and good value. Not super luxury, but perfectly adequate, great value, safe and friendly

<Content>Never Again Although the Fusion is close to cable cars, Union Square, and Market St., I would never stay there again. The rooms (not just mine, but it sounded like all of them) were consistently at least 85 degrees day and night...even when the outside temp was only 65. They have fans in all the rooms, and the windows open so you can set the fan in the window for relief. But that's assuming you can stand all the noise from the nearby cable cars, streetcars, taxis, and general traffic. The hotel staff had no explanation and showed no sympathy or concern, just generally had a deal with it attitude. The front desk staff was unfriendly and seemed put out by any request whatsoever. Rooms were clean, but very small. Then they charged my bill for taking snacks that I didn't take. All could be forgiven except the heat in the rooms made it so intolerable that I was miserable the entire week.

<Content>Great location We stayed at the Hotel Fusion for 4 nights in November. The hotel is in a fantastic central location. You can walk to the BART, trolley and cable car within 5 minutes. The rooms look like they had been renovated fairly recently and while cosy had a good size bathroom. We received complimentary breakfast each day. It wasnt' a full continental breakfast but was an alright start to the day. Overall, I would recommend the hotel to others looking for a comfortable, central place to stay in San Fran.

<Content>Loved the Hotel Fusion We have just gotten back from our stay at the Fusion and loved it. We stayed for 6 nights. The location is really great, right near union square and everything is within a short walking distance. The staff were very friendly and helpful and checking in and out was very quick and easy. The room we stayed in was great. We were on the top floor so we had quite a nice view. The beds were very comfortable and the decor very nice i felt very at home in this hotel. We also had a nice flat screen tv, fridge and safe. The bathroom was a good size and the complimentary toiletries were very nice. Complimentary breakfast consists of muffins, crossants, toast, fruit and juice. In the lobby there is a great selection of useful guides on getting around san fran and information about tours, restaurants and shopping. I would most defitnetly stay at this hotel again and recommend it to others. This hotel is also great value for money.

<Content>European feel We stayed at the Hotel Fusion with my husband and another couple. We loved it! The hotel is in a perfect location, the interior has that European feel to it - small but comfortable rooms, clean, lots of art hanging on the walls. Very well priced too for waht you get. A place we would stay again - for sure.

<Content>Love the location/staff hate hearing next doors noise Cannot fault the staff, the location and room condition.Downsides:- small room- noisey due to paper thing walls. We constantly were woken up by people just talking ( not their fault - fault of having no noise insulation at all ! ) or playing TV/musicIf you are not bothered by constant noise then would recommend otherwise avoid.

<Content>On the Pulse For price and location this hotel is very hard to beat.When you exit the front door turn left....Then..at the end of the street turn right for the jump on point of the main cable car route..turn left and you walk up to Union Square which is the main starting point for all your adventures to be.Staff are anxious to help and a continental breakfast is centrally served each morning.Rooms are clean well kept and there is a safe built in above your room fridge.Anyone complaining about this hotel either lives in a mansion/doesn't do enough walking or is just not happy with life anyway.At the end of the day 2blocks up on Geary Street they serve an all day carvery dinner for about $12 in O'Douls Irish bar.So a great place to stay...a full belly....What else do you want?Thoroughly recommend the Fusion.

<Content>Great Stay at the Fusion Ejoyed my stay at the fusion. This was my first visit to San Francisco and the Fusion was a great base to explore the city. The city does have a major problem with homeless people but the area round the hotel is always busy so we had no problems. If we had our time over again we might have stayed further north, but it is still a good hotel. But it may be one to avoid if you are a light sleeper cause the heating system is very noisy. Also the room was hot all the time even when it was cold outside so maybe one to avoid in the summer months. All in all a good, clean hotel in an excellent location.

<Content>The Fusion is the place to stay when in San Fran! I booked a vacation trip to San Francisco in the middle of September, and I was desperate to find a nice place to rest while visiting. After reading horror stories of hotels in the vicinity, The Fusion stood out from the rest. Since my apartment was being sprayed for bedbugs, the last thing I wanted to see was anything crawling in my hotel room, other than myself. I was not disappointed. The Fusion was prompt and courteous during check-in, and I was in my room no more than 15 minutes after my arrival. The room I got had a twin bed in it, and was on the 2nd floor. The bed was clean, smelled good, and had clean sheets. That was my first concern. After sitting in the room for about 30-45 minutes, I didn't notice a single thing wrong with it at all, nor did I see anything else in the room with more than two legs. If you are staying for more than a couple of days, I would advise putting the Do Not Disturb sign on the door immediately upon entering the room, and keep it there until check-out, to avoid anything mysteriously coming up missing in your room. I am just paranoid like that, but believe me, it works! Check-out was just as prompt and courteous, but as a note to fellow travelers; please consider doing your own research on where to go and what to do ahead of time, to avoid being disappointed, or disturbing the nice employees at The Fusion. While i'm sure they'd be more than helpful, the internet is the most valuable resource for the out of town traveler. Do yourself a favor, and print up an agenda of where you're going, along with plenty of maps, and you will enjoy yourself 100 times more!!! I love The Fusion, and I will be coming back again.Derek Jordan

<Content>We loved Hotel Fusion! We stayed at the Hotel Fusion for 2 weeks during August and September 2007. The Hotel was ideally located for exploring the city on foot. It is right in the middle of so many restaurants and shops, especially a wonderful icecream shop across the road called Coldstone Creamery. The Hotel itself was very clean and tidy with wonderful friendly staff who were happy to answer any questions we had and gave us lots of helpful advice about how to travel round the city. The free breakfast was scrumptious, offering toast, muffins, crossiants, juices, fruit, tea and coffee. Also free internet access was provided as well as access to a small gym! The Hotel was a two minute walk away from one of the main shopping centres as well as it being a one minute walk from the BART station which we used as transport from the airport instead of paying lots for a taxi! Pier 39 was a 45minute walk which was good offering lots of shops, attractions and you catch the boat here to Alcatraz. We also went on an amazing helicopter ride which was brilliant and i would advise everyone visiting the city to go on! The BART station was also linked to the MUNI which was ideal for visiting San Francisco Zoo where you can see the famous Gary the grizzly gulch and Wilbert the wonderful Warthog! The Hotel Fusion made our holiday perfect and is an ideal place to start exploring the fascinating city of San Francisco from.

<Content>Not a good experience No air conditioning, no sink in bathroom (sink was actually outside the bathroom). Smell was terrible (room 518), couldn't figure out if it originated from humidity or some leaking structure. There was only 1 elevator - when I checked in there was a bus full of tourists arriving so I had to wait for over 15 min for the elevator to the 5th floor.

<Content>Reasonably priced hotel, could be great Hotel Fusion has a great location in San Francisco. In general the rooms were nice. The first two nights we were in a room with a queen bed, and the third night we were in a full-sized. In fact the room with the full sized was nicer than that with the queen, and cheaper! Most of the rooms are centered around a court yard and a few face the street. Because there is no air con, you really need to keep a window open. However, in the room opposite ours, the couple was having some late night fun :-) and their screams could be heard reverberating around the courtyard. Otherwise, there were a lot of sirens from ambulances and firetrucks.Once the breakfast room is expanded and you can actually sit down, that will be a plus. The free internet at the business center was a real plus. Almost everything was new in the hotel, and general this is a great value. Especially good for younger people, perhaps not so good for families.

<Content>Great location and incredible SF price! Room: stayed in a King bedroom. It was just the right size and the bed was the most comfortable I've every slept on. The bathroom is a bit small and the sink has no vanity so you got to get creative with spreading out your stuff. The shower is a glass stand in shower that is cool BUT it leaks through the door crack so be prepared to mop that up so you don't slip. There is no air-conditioning which is usually fine for SF but there was a fairly warm day and our room got a bit hot. They do put a fan in the room and we cracked a window at night to keep the air circulating. There is some street noise coming from the hotel but the fan can drown out the sound. The location is awesome. Just blocks from Chinatown and Union Square which has the best shopping next to NYC Park Ave. in my opinion. We rented a car and it is a whopping $25/day to have your car parked. There is very little street parking. We needed the car to travel to wedding events and wine country but one does not need a car to enjoy SF. It is across the street from a great Sushi restaurant that is open until Midnight so go! It was yummy!

<Content>Excellent location, excellent price We were hesitant to try this place, considering it was only $114 a night for two people. Being San Francisco, we were thinking you'd get what you paid for but we were so wrong. This place was a steal! Very clean, newly refurbished and best of all an awesome location - Union Square is right around the corner with some very good shopping and Westfield Shopping Center is literally a two minute walk away. We were upgraded to a king bed suite (which would have cost even more) and were plesantly surprised by the room. Sure it's small (by American standards), but who cares - it was spotless and newly refurbished with a plasma tv, a stereo system on the wall, and very comfortable bedding. The continental breakfast was very simple - coffee, juice, toast, muffins, crossaints and some oranges and apples. Richard, the concierge, was especially helpful when it came to restaurant choices and the front desk staff were all very friendly.Should we ever go back, we would certainly stay here again!

<Content>cramped with good location My dude and I have stayed in and around SFO for a couple of years now and this is our 3rd hotel.  First the Pro's: Great location, clean, good decor, coffee maker in room, and breakfast (see also cons)Cons: REALLY small room that doesn't seem meant for 2 (yes, we do have a double). luggage space is slim, as is walking room. I've hit my shins on the pointy corners of the bed too many times to remember. No hooks in bathroom (or anywhere) and a minimal amount of places to stick toiletries makes the bath a hard place to share with 1 other person. Breakfast is really continental (i.e. bread products and coffee), but at 7:45 (45 minutes after it had begun), they were already out of cream and were not replacing it (that's that!).We paid $119 for the room and think its' pretty alright, though in comparison to the Carlton hotel we stayed at last year, I would suggest staying at the Carlton Sutter, as the price is about the same, you get a little more room and the place is better thought out.

<Content>All you need... I stayed in hotel fusion for 8 nuits. While my twin room (single bed) was really small, once unpacked, it had everything one may want: very clean, practical bathroom (shower), flat screen tv with dvd player, mini-bar, assortment of snacks and sufficient storage. On the down side, my bedroom window opened onto a wall, but it was ok since not spending too much time in the room anyhow. Location is perfect; as a few minutes from Union Square, shops and restaurants; Bart and tram lines. 10 min tram from Pier 39. Breakfast was ok but unoriginal (bread, coffee, muffin) but there's a great dinner around the corner. The concierge was very helpful in organising bus tours and arranging pick up as well as an airport shuttle service ($15), much cheaper than a taxi. Overall i would recommend the hotel.

<Content>ABsolutely Wonderful! This has to be the best hotel in San Fran for its price. I booked this hotel for three friends and myself. Two of my friends decided to book another hotel because they didn't recognize the Fusion name (yes they are hotel snobs). After their first night at the other hotel, the next night they were staying at the Fusion and wished they had never changed. The staff here is incredible. The location is unbeatable (great shopping, restaurants and the best of public transportation practically outside of the door). The price was very sensible. The rooms were small but very clean and neat - almost like a European hotel room. I definitely recommend the Fusion and will be staying there in my future trips to San Fran.

<Content>Great Deal Great place to stay...good 7 day package under 700 for room on the street....a little noisy at night....you might want an inside room less noise and cost less...great location/shopping and etc...buy a 7 day pass for transportaion...you can go anywhere....we did I saw: Golden Gate Bridge, and Park...Persidio, North Beach, Fishermans Wharf, Haight Asbury, Saucilito, and just about every neighborhood in San Francisco. Being from Chicago and a little bias, I thought they should clean up the city. Too many homeless, too many beggars, too much trash. C'mon mayor clean up this place...do not go out at night alone....these homeless are not nice...one lady said she was going to cut me if I did not give her money...I told her to go away or I would kick her [--]....be careful they are Reagans street people and crazy. None like this in Chicago...clean and etc...

<Content>Great hotel! Hotel was really nice and clean. Staff was also friendly, especially one guy at the front desk. He told us all the cool spots in SF and helped us a lot. The hotel doesn't have a air-condition so the rooms are VERY hot. Location is near Tenderloin which is bad area but everything is fine as long as you don't walk right from the main doors. :)

<Content>Miss San Francisco My wife and I stayed in Hotel Fusion during summer from 3-June-2007 to 17-June-2007. Perfect 2-week stay. The room was always kept clean and tidy, the staff was always friendly and helpful, the shower was strong, no complains from us at all.The free internet was very helpful to do our research for our holidays. The LCD/plasma TV had many nice programs.Initially we were skeptical about no aircon in the hotel but this didnot affect us at all during our stay as San Francisco is always cold,even in summer.This is the most value-for-money hotel I can find for its excellent service, convenient location and comfortable rooms.Thanks for making my stay so memorable.

<Content>Great Location, Great Hotel We stayed at the Hotel Fusion just a few weeks ago and I couldn't recommend it enough. The rooms are on the small side but perfect for couples-- who wants to stay in the room when you're in San Francisco, anyway? It is one block to the cable car turnaround, two blocks to the BART station, and within walking distance of at least a dozen bus stops. It was in a safe location and there is someone on duty 24/7. The front desk staff is super friendly and helpful, especially Mindy. When we wanted a late night meal one night, she immediately got on the phone and called several restaurants for us to make sure their kitchens were still open. The breakfast is quite good, although not hearty (muffins, toast, juice, etc.) There's free internet access in their business center. Basically this hotel gives you everything you need, and nothing you don't.

<Content>The Fusion was a great choice Stayed at the Fusion from June 9-12. Loved the hotel and the location. Rooms are on the small side, but there are larger ones. The most quiet ones are the ones facing the inside court. The continental breakfast is minimal, but that is to be expected with the price you pay. Hotel staff is polite and informative. Would not hesitate to stay there again or to recommend it. The best feature? Its location, one block away from Union Square.

<Content>Great Hotel, Grast Price I stayed at the Hotel Fusion for 8 days taking advantage of their extended offer rates. The hotel was fantastic value for money. The location was perfect, the hotel was recently refurbished which meant everything was new and clean. My room was small although it had everything I needed. Other guests complained it was noisy although this was never a problem for me (ask for an internal room). I would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a small inner city hotel.

<Content>fantastic location-definite stay!! Hotel fusion is a trendy hotel that's a bit on the small side but the location makes up for it. I went with my boyfriend but if I ever go back for a girls trip, I would feel safe staying here again. There a numerous restaurants just outside and loads of shopping (FCUK and HM are all stone throws away). The only complaints are that the walls are thin and the room smelled a bit musty. These in my books are minor issues.

<Content>average place, not all bad First the positives - handy location and good price. Clean and tidy.The negatives - no airconditioning which made a 90F evening uncomfortable. Lots of early morning sirens, ambulances and police cars, seem to pass through this area. Service variable quality - some good and helpful, some of it was surly and unhelpful. Breakfast room a bit sad (you can't sit in, you have to take your breakfast back to your room), and food very average.Also was shocked to be presented with a HUGE phone bill for some pretty limited calls, which they soon knocked back after I complained and compared it to bills in other cities in Europe, Japan and USA I had travelled through.On balance I wouldn't recommend

<Content>Great Stay, Near Everything This hotel is great for the price and location. My husband and I stayed for 2 nights in May. The room is small (think NY or Europe) but had enough room for the 2 of us. We didn't spend much time in the room anyhow. The room itself was very clean and modern with a flat screen TV. I even liked having the sink in the room and not in the bathroom. I was more convenient to get ready. The staff was very helpful but if you want something late at night you may or may not get it. We needed extra pillows at around 11 pm when we checked in and were lucky enough to get them. There was only person on staff at the point and the guy wasn't sure he could leave. I guess he worked it out. We didn't have the free breakfast so I can't comment on it, but there is so much great food around who needs it.The location is so convenient. It's right near BART and the cable car stop. It is also near all the fancy shopping in Union Square and many other sites (MOMA and ATT Park). Depending on where you walk it can be dicey. There are a lot of homeless people that will ask for money I supposed because of all the tourists around.Overall the stay was very pleasant and we would stay there again.

<Content>Hotel Fusion San Francisco Stayed in the Hotel Fusion for one week, by myself. The hotel location was excellent, five minutes walk from Union square. It is located in the heart of the city. The hotel itself was clean well furnished, and the staff well what can I say, they were just so professional and helpful. They gave me assistance whenever I needed it, and if I ever go back to this city, would have no hesitation about staying in this hotel again.

<Content>Unbelievable value for money - Stay at this hotel! This hotel is amazing. It is in the best location in San Francisco - right by Union Square, a stone's throw away from the Bart, tram, and bus stations - absolutely perfect for seeing San Francisco, shopping and eating.I stayed in twin room (American-speak for a single room) which was quite small, but perfectly clean and newly refurbished. The bathroom was enormous and spotlessly clean. There was a flatscreen TV with DVD player, broadband internet access, an iron and ironing board and coffee percolator. Unfortunately, there wasn't a minibar - but I made do by keeping things in the icebucket filled with ice from the machine on the 4th floor! This was one of the budget rooms - the pricier ones (from peeking in during cleaning time) were much larger, more luxurious and had minibars.Breakfast was the worst aspect. Food was provided in a small room on the top floor, and there was nowhere to sit so you had to either eat standing up or take your breakfast back to your room. There was tea, coffee, juice and weird bakery items consisting of toast, muffins and croissants but it all tasted a bit like plastic to me. However, there were plenty of breakfast options in the street so perhaps that's usual for American hotels.The staff were exceptionally friendly, helpful and knowledgeable.Excuse the plug, but just by this hotel were two great restaurants - Kulitos and the Daily Grill. Really classy food for not very much money.Stay at this hotel! You'll be amazed at the price (contact them direct). Really really good.

<Content>Great Place, Great Price... This is a GREAT place to stay. It is right in the center of town, and it is walking distance to all major hot spots. In 20 short minutes (walk) you are at the Fisherman's Warf, and in 3 short blocks you are in Chinatown. The Hotel is very clean and the staff could not be nicer. The rooms are a tad small, but they are kept up. There is no, diningin the hotel, but that is OK you are surrounded by great places to eat with in walking distance from the hotel. I would stay here again, no questions! Front Desk amazing and our bellman was very helpful!! Love it!

<Content>Great place, good SF price I stayed here with my boyfriend for 7 nights. we loved it. It was clean, and compact. Our room had a fridge, desk and tv as well as hanging space which was great. The location is good. It's close to Union square, and powell station. The staff are friendly and very helpful giving great restaurant, bar, and gig recommendations (and assisting in late night room changes, see below). Our first night here was very noisy. We arrived home close to 12am and realised we were in a room (facing the inside) near an air unit that was making a lot of noise. We went down to reception an hour later (around 1am) to request a room change for the next day and were given a new, larger room on the spot for no extra charge by the friendly man on the front desk. We remained in this room (205) for the rest of our stay and have no more complaints.The breakfast is a good starter. Nothing amazing, but the brown bread, croissants, coffee, orange juice and fruit make for a good (free) start to the day.I would definitely recommend this place (and if you are not happy with your room just request a room change).

<Content>Great location, clean, great price...But bring your ear plugs Great location, located right near all the shopping. Book through the hotel they will match expedia's rate (109 for me). The rooms are nicely sized, not too big not too small- for two people. Bathroom is TINY. No room to do anything. Walls are very thin, if you dont want to hear your neighbors then stay somewhere else.Also, no insulated windows so the street noise comes through like you were outside. If you are a light sleeper find another hotel. Our room faced the street and there was nothing but noise all night. New York City is quieter!Overall, the hotel is nice, the linens are nice, room is clean, staff is friendly, location is great. Valet parking is $30 a night. The hotel is right on the corner and can be easily missed. If you are looking for a good bargain with a great location then book this hotel...Just remember to bring your earplugs.

<Content>Great hotel, cannot recommend highly enough My husband and I stayed at Hotel Fusion for a week in March, and we could not have asked for anything more. The hotel is located, as many have said before me, a block from Union Square and is brilliant for public transport as well, less than a 5 minute walk to the infamous cable cars. The staff at the hotel were wonderful, and always on hand for anything we needed (which wasn't much!) and the internet access was brilliant - we got a cable for $2 and had no problems at all with accessing the net in our room.Room wise, it was perfect for us, and given that my husband is 66, there are not many people taller, and he had no problem with anything. The rooms may not be as big as many American hotel rooms, but when compared to most European hotel rooms, it was on a par with most of them I've stayed at (having stayed in many in England, France, Holland and Belgium). We had no problem with noise what-so-ever, but we did have an inward facing room, so that could have had something to do with it. We also had no complaints about the lack of air-con, but it didn't get over 80f while we were there - I can imagine it might be a problem in the height of summer.The only real draw-back with this hotel inflicts every hotel in the area - the number of homeless people that constantly ask you for money whenever you step out of the safety of the hotel or a shop - but we never felt in danger, just a little embarassed at times, as I felt terrible saying no - but I was told not to give in as they'll never leave you alone if they see you again...I cannot recommend Hotel Fusion highly enough, and would happily stay there again and recommend it to friends and family alike.

<Content>Fusion=Fantastic! My husband and I stayed at the fusion the second week in March (rainy , but still very nice). We arrived later in the evening and had some trouble finding the place, but we didn鈥檛 use the hotel鈥檚 directions, we used yahoo driving directions instead鈥istake. We had no trouble checking into our room and we were upgraded to a junior suite at no charge. The room was great. It had two flat screen televisions and a nice sitting area with writing desk. The closet space is very limited however. The bathroom was large, but counter space was minimal, but I was able to put my makeup on and get ready at the writing desk- large mirror there as well. Beds were comfy. I noticed that some of the other reviews mentioned noise鈥 didn鈥檛 hear any. If you are worried about that, request a room on the inside of the building. Oh, and the rooms are very clean, which is a HUGE deal to me.The vibe of the hotel is young and fresh-very trendy. The hotel鈥檚 location is great and close to great food and shopping. It鈥檚 in walking distance to just about anything and if it鈥檚 not, SF public transportation is great. One minor problem, parking. We had to valet our car at $31.00 per night. All in all, a great stay for the $$$$.

<Content>Excellent Location......Great Price this hotel is close to every major san francisco must see spots, CHINA TOWN, UNION SQUARE, THE B.A.R.T., FISHERMANS WARF, NOB HILL, NORTH BEACH ETC. ETC. it is a great hotel for singles or couples who want to do a weekend getaway. the hotel is an older hotel built most likely late 1800's or 1900s but san francisco is an old city so lots of old buildings.....the hotel is brought up to 2007 standards...flat screen tvs in the rooms, free internet access. the standard rooms are very small so be prepared for that if you get a standard room, we upgraded our standard room for $20.00 more per night its worth it. if you are a business traveler or a family, you might not want to stay here just because of the room sizes. you can make it word if you are not too picky. business travelers this is not your hotel.....everyone else is WELCOME.........WE HAD A GREAT TIME.

<Content>Noisy... I must admit the Hotel Fusion is a great bargain in a great location.My room was large but basic. My only compaint is that while they went to great lengths to renovate the hotel they overlooked one detail, insulated windows. I was on the 4th floor and the street noise penetrating into my room overnight was almost unbearable. I am not a light sleeper and if you are I would recommend staying somewhere else.

<Content>We loved the Fusion We stayed 4 nights over President's Day weekend and loved the Fusion. It has a great location, near Union Square, the Powell St. cable car and the BART station.We booked their Climb Halfway to the Stars online, which is a great deal because it includes a pass valid for all busses, streetcars and cable cars (but not BART). It was a bargain.We arrived after midnight and the desk clerk asked if we had a room preference. We hadn't stayed there before, so we just asked for something nice and I think we got the nicest double room in the hotel #528. It was a corner unit with extra windows and was a great value for the price we paid ($109 weeknights/$119 weekends). The rooms are not particularly large, but it was fine for the price.Their free continental breakfast was nothing special, but it was convenient.The room was very clean and the shower pressure was superb. Oh man, I miss that shower. The room faced the street, but was not noisy. I loved that when we opened the windows we could hear the clang, clang of the cable cars one street over.The staff was uniformly friendly. We're fairly independent travelers, so we don't ask for a lot from a hotel staff, but these guys seemed to be giving other people good advice.We'd definitely go back.

<Content>Great!!! My friends and I had a wonderful stay at the Hotel Fusion. The hotel is new and nicely remodeled. The people that worked there were helpful and friendly. We stayed in Rm 405. It was on the 4th floor, but the city noise is still pretty loud. It was surprisingly warm this weekend so the windows were open. I don't think the noise would have been so bad if the windows were closed. I would highly recommendthis hotel. Thanks!

<Content>Basic, but a true bargain There is no question but that Hotel Fusion is one of the best bargains in this trendy part of San Francisco, in very easy walking distance (four blocks) to the Moscone Center. The staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and very good at problem solving.The downside is that Hotel Fusion is an old apartment building or hotel remodeled into small, very attractive, hotel rooms. Thus the bathrooms are what you'd find in a tiny house -- quirky. Postives: The bed was new and comfy; the internet connection was fast (you need to bring a long cable unless you want to sit on the floor next to the wall) and the room was spotlessly clean and well-maintained throughout my stay. The hotel was also quiet, even though it seemed to be booked full.Negatives: The bathrooms have standalone sinks with NO counterspace whatsoever. There was no full-length mirror -- a problem on a business trip when you need to make sure you looked pulled together. The lighting in the room was extremely dim. Poorly controlled heat was a problem during my January stay: a modern interface had been attached to an old radiator, so even if you turned the heat off, the pipes gave off enough heat to make the room like a blast furnace, requiring that you open the windows. (Obviously, this would not be a problem in the summer.) When I complained, the staff graciously moved me to a slightly less toasty room.So, a mixed experience. I'd be more likely to stay there for a one-night visit than for an extended business trip.

<Content>Location  I have stayed in many hotels in the Union Sq area over the years and this is one of the better ones available today. Its been renovated, I mean really done up well! Everything seems new and clean. The flat panel TV's are a nice touch. The rooms themselves are on the small side, buy laid out well and are extrea clean and well furnished. Depending upon which side you face, it can be a bit noisy, but considering the age of the building, no real problem. Get a room on the highest floor possible. Staff is very friendly and helpful. As everybody has already stated, the location one block off Powell is hard to beat. Very easy to grab a cab right outside the front entrance. Definitely a bargain in todays SFO hotel market!

<Content>Nice Hotel for the $ We stayed at the Hotel Fusion during Fleet Weekend. The hotel is near union square and the Powell St cable car. The location couldn't be better. Check in was uneventful. Our room wasn't ready, but we were there at noon. We left our bags and went to lunch and when we returned our room was ready as promised. The rooms are small but nice. Ours had a king bed, fridge and a nicely redone bath. No air conditioning and because it was very warm we needed to have the window open at night. The street noise was pretty bad, but I knew that would be the case when I booked the room. Overall I would say we got a good value for our money.

<Content>Trust the concierge All other reviews are right on regarding the wonderful location. Certain rooms face into the building and are quieter, but smaller, so decide what is most important., Our room was tiny but well-decorated and noiseproof -- far away from the elevator, too, so not a lot of hall traffic. The bed was firm yet comfortable. But here is the best part: Concierge Rick knows his stuff when it comes to restaurant recommendations. Dining is very important to me when I visit, and he really hit the mark. Do not miss Farmer Brown, an organic soul food restaurant, just a couple of blocks away. He also had a list of places in the Mission District I'm dying to try. Everyone on staff here is superb, but he was outstanding.

<Content>great location, inexpensive, close to the action without being noisy having stayed twice before in SF, I wanted something close to the action without being too noisy or expensive and despite being very new, I gave this a go.No regrets - good value, friendly staff, large room (set up for disabled?), only problem was with the shower which was fixed, could have done with more storage for my shopping and don't worry about the continental breakfast - go up powell to the diner and don't have to stop for lunch!Quieter than being closer to powell with the cable car bells, but close enough to get off the cable car or metro and traipse home without going too far up the hill or past too many winos.Very recommendedfor things to do - try the USS Hornet aircraft carrier in Alameda especially on a damp day when you have lots of energy for walking and steps! Great knowledgable crew who even gave me a lift from the ferry terminal!

<Content>Hotel Fusion - More Bang than Buck Great Location - Staff is superb - full of energy and great restaurant recommendations. The location is around the corner from Public Trasport, around the corner from Union Square, across from great restaurants - and the staff - they are so kind and fun to chat with. They remembered my name and welcomed me anytime I had a question. The room is cozy about 15 x 15. But but I wasn't there to stay in the room even tho it was nicely decorated - great water pressure in the shower  great toiletries.

<Content>Clean, pleasant and a great location I thought my room was delightful. The room had a twin bed and was small but well laid out. The room had a fridge, there was a hair dryer in the bathroom and an iron and ironing board in the closet. The closet was large enough to accommodate all my stuff, but it works best if you keep your clothes and toiletries organised. The room was fresh and clean and the decor was soothing and relaxing with a contemporary feel. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was spotless, I loved the big fluffy towels, and the shampoo and soap that had been put out. The staff was friendly and helpful, the only downside was that my wakeup call came one hour earlier than I had requested. The concierge was very helpful and arranged for an airport shuttle for me, which came promptly. The location is excellent, close to great shopping, Chinatown, the cable car and the BART, and while the immediate area is safe, one should be vigilant as there are some unsavoury characters wandering around. The breakfast was nothing great, but there is a microwave in the breakfast room so you can bring back a doggy-bag from your favourite restaurant and reheat it later. I would definitely come back again. I booked through Expedia and was well pleased with the price and felt that I received good value for my money.

<Content>You Cannot Do Better For The Price/Location In S.F. We were a little concerned and scared booking this hotel because the price was so reasonable, and the location was so great. We had a Queen room (Standard room), and the rate was $109/nt. The hotel directly was willing to match any online price we found, so we just booked it directly. You will pay $33/day to Valet for the day, but you are allowed to take your car in and out as many times as you wish. That is really the only parking option, as street parking is limited by both time and availability. The hotel is in a GREAT location. Right in the heart of Union Square. The cable car is about 2 blocks (Right outside the GAP), as is tons of shopping, i.e. GAP, OAKLEY, MACY'S, PUMA, etc. The area is very nice and safe. There are plenty of restaurants, etc. in the vacinity.Now for the rooms. The hotel looks like it is brand new. It is seriously as if it opened a week before we were there. The ONLY drawback to the rooms is the size. They are slightly smaller than the average room, but not a big deal at all. Flat screen TV on the wall, very clean and nice overall. Don't expect a nice breakfast. Just muffins, toast, OJ, etc., but totally sufficient. I am not kidding you, this place is great, and you won't find another hotel in this area for the price. People mentioned on the reviews it was noisy. We didn't find that at all. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone, and I am very picky when it comes to hotel rooms.....Feel free to e-mail me with any questions you may have. jonrhanson@hotmail.com

<Content>Not worth it Kinda' bummed because I paid top dollar to stay here for a week ($225/night). I did get a top floor room but there was nothing very special about it. There was no adequate work space for a laptop. Also, there was no wireless, you need to hardwire into a network jack that's located behind the bed(!), AND they charge you a few bucks if you don't have your own cable. The bathroom was small and not very accomodating. No counter space or table to place your toiletry items. Ugly colors in the bathroom too. The gym, and I can barely call it a gym, is in the basement. It's one crappy treadmill, an even crappier eliptical, and a few dumbells, all in the room the size of a large walk-in closet. Perhaps the most laughable part of my stay was the included breakfast. It consisted of Sam's Club-purchased muffins, croissants, and white sandwich bread that you could use to make toast. Probably the stalest breakfast foods I've ever tasted. To wash down these tasty morsels was watered down OJ dispensed from a machine.As for the good, location I suppose. Within walking distance of Union Square and some key shopping. The concierge was very good, always suggesting good places to go and quite friendly. Also the king size bed was very comfortable.If you're looking for a good place to stay in downtown San Fran, keep looking.

<Content>I Must Be Missing Something We just returned from a 2 night stay at the Fusion and will not be staying there again. Check-in took forever since there was only 1 person working the front desk and there were 3 other parties ahead of us. We were told the manager had instructed the front desk to give us an upgrade to a suite because they were out of the type of room we had reserved (a deluxe double which we booked 2 months in advance). The elevator was not working on the way up to our 5th fl. room so we had to walk up the entire way. We just figured this has got to be a temporary thing and we'll overlook it ...as it turns out, the elevator was broke off and on all weekend and our suite turned out to be a regular size hotel room divided in half. One half had a daybed which was only good for putting your luggage on seeing that the closet was the size of a gym locker (about 12 inches wide). The room with the bed was totally claustophobic. After returning from dinner we noticed an incredible noise that sounded like a helicopter was on the roof directly above us. We called the front desk to request a room change and they moved us to a room directly below the last room we were in. Same problem ..tons of noise. Called the front desk again and they were finally able to come up with a regular room (which is what we wanted all along and what we had booked originally). This room was much better ...bigger room, bigger closet and no noise from the roof. Only problem was it faced the street and and in teh middle of the night you could hear bottles being thrown in a garbage truck and lots of late-nite revelers.At $225/night we expected more. I know you don't get much for your money in a big city but I'm sure we could have done a lot better for the money.

<Content>great hotel A friend and I stayed at Hotel Fusion Sept 26 for 2 nights. It has a great location - very close to Union Square and the cable car turnaround, near the Visitor Centre and BART. The rooms were clean, a bit small though, but very nicely decorated. The staff was friendly and helpful. The free breakfast was on from 7am to 930am - they had muffins, bread to toast and crossants, as well as juice, coffee and tea. We had a great experince at Hotel Fusion and highly recommend it!!!

<Content>Good price, excellent location Room was small, but clean and comfortable. Didn't try the complimentary breakfast.Location was great, very near the Powell Street cable car turntable and BART station, which made getting to the airport really easy.If you arrive late and can't be bothered to go wandering around looking for somewhere to eat, you could do a lot worse than try the Italian restaurant opposite, Puccini  Pinetti.If you are sightseeing, I also highly recommend getting a 3 day or 7 day MUNI passport, which allows you unlimited rides on all Muni vehicles, including the cable cars and historic street cars.

<Content>Great Value for Money After reading the glowing reviews here, I decided to take a chance on the Fusion and was happy with the experience overall. The front desk staff and the concierges were extremely friendly and courteous. My room was impeccably decorated and immaculately maintained, and even contained some of the little flourishes you find in top properties (like the way the towels were laid out, one of them in a flower-like shape). There was a sizeable flat panel TV in the room, and to my surprise, free high-speed internet access (according to the offering description on Hotels, internet access was supposed to be an additional charge for me 鈥?I did have to pay $3 for a connection cable since I didn鈥檛 have my own, but that covered the entire 7-day stay I was there). The hotel is located in prime tourist area and extremely convenient to public transportation (be careful about wandering just a few blocks to the west though, as you end up in the notorious Tenderloin -- its proximity isn鈥檛 really a concern if you just don鈥檛 go there). Now here come my gripes: The internet connection jack was right behind the bed鈥檚 headboard, which means I had to use my laptop on the bed instead of at the desk. This got fatiguing after a while.Another thing: Sometimes there was a humming noise in my room. Not sure if it was the pipes or what.Also, the maid service left something to be desired. One morning, around 8 AM, one of the maids tried to enter the room without knocking first. Granted, I didn鈥檛 have the DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door, but I think they should always knock before entering, especially at that hour.On another day, I placed a tip for the maid on the pillow then left for a few hours. When I came back, the room still was not made up but the tip was gone. I found that really weird.On another day, one of the maids disturbed my afternoon nap to ask if she had left a cell phone in my room (she hadn鈥檛).The real kicker came after I checked out. While checking out at the front desk I was asked if I had drunk any of the bottles of Evian in the room. I answered no, but thought to myself 鈥淲hat Evian?鈥? as I had never seen any bottles of water in the room (and even if I had, I wouldn鈥檛 have been stupid enough to consume them, given the ridiculous prices of mini-bar type items). When I got home, I checked my credit card bill and found an extra charge from the Hotel Fusion for $7.90. I called the hotel and got put through to the manager, who explained to me that the charge was for Evian bottles. When I told him that there had never been any Evian in the room, he contacted the housekeeping staff, who insisted that there was. I reiterated that there wasn鈥檛, so he told me he would remove the charge immediately, but did so in a manner as if to say 鈥淚鈥檓 not sure if I believe you鈥? I suppose he has no way of knowing who is telling the truth in this situation, but that just added insult to injury. It certainly made me regret tipping the maids as much as I did.However, these negatives don鈥檛 even come close to outweighing the positives of the hotel. I booked my reservation through hotels.com and got an excellent weekly rate. Really, it鈥檚 hard to believe that this is only rated as a 2* hotel, since it is just so nice. Okay, so the breakfast consists of synthetic muffins, but I don鈥檛 care about breakfast anyway.

<Content>Great location, Great time We took a trip to San Francisco over Labor Day weekend and wanted to post a thank you to all the people who have written such great reviews of Hotel Fusion! Your reviews are right on; in fact, throughout our stay, I kept saying to my husband the reviews mentioned this or they mentioned that. The street noise and meager breakfast were our only complaints, but we expected them because of the reviews! This is a wonderful place to stay at a decent price in the heart of the city. It was so close to BART (We flew into Oakland, did AirBART then BART to Powell Street). And we were right on a bus line to our daughter's new pad - couldn't have been easier. The lack of air conditioning should not be a problem now that the warmest part of the season is over. You can request a fan as we did - my husband needs white noise for sleeping, so it drowned out most of the 3:30 am garbage truck noise. If street noise will bother you, I highly recommend requesting an interior room. (My husband returned the following week for a convention and had an interior room, which he said was much quieter.) We enjoyed watching the neighborhood go to sleep and wake up outside our window too much to worry about noise. Great shower, great towels and linens, cool TV. We were very comfortable each night after long days of sightseeing. Thanks everyone!

<Content>Never Ever Want To Come Back I usually stay across the street at the Monticello Inn, but since they were booked and the Fusion was a new hotel I thought I would give it a try. From the very beginning (at check in) it seemed that no one really knew what they were doing. The check in process seemed to last for days. The room that I was assigned to was an accessible room. Which was also located next to a storage room little did I know that it also meant that there would be a constant loud motor humming sound/vibration to my room. Although there is free high speed internet, it's not wireless...so remember to bring your own cord or else be prepared to be charged a fee.The bed was hard, and the room was warm (no AC) so I had to make do with fans to cool my room off. The shower head was broken so a sit down shower was my only option.The valet parking is not actually with the hotel. They work with another company, so they can only guess what is going on with your car. I tried to fit my car into their valet area, I told the bell captain/concierge who then said that my car would get ticketed if I left it there. Instead of moving the car himself he asked me to move it because he didn't know when the valet service was going to be picking up the car. I had to get back into my car and move it myself...why was I paying over $30 a day for?It doesn't feel as though many of the workers at Hotel Fusion have a clear understanding about what their job is or what customer service means. I really do suggest paying more to stay somewhere else.

<Content>Comfortable and modern Surprisingly modern. It feels like a small hotel, but the rooms are perfect. Very clean, very modern, great shower. Helpful staff. Only stayed one night, but it is a really good location.

<Content>Nice Hotel I paid $132/night--a good rate for the Union Square area. Hotel was very nice and rooms were clean. Pros: Hotel staff very friendly and helpful, room was nicely decorated and spotlessley clean, location was convenient to BART and lots of shopping.Cons: No in-room movies (as advertised on the hotel's website), continental breakfast was the cheapest I've every seen. A staff member did tell me they plan to upgrade it in the next few weeks, air conditioning did not work, location is noisy (any hotel in this area is probably noisy).Overall, I liked it and would stay again. I don't think you can beat it for the price!

<Content>Loved the Fusion - Great Hotel Hi,My girlfriend and I stayed at the Fusion June 26th - July 3rd.Arrived early afternoon, and had no problem checking in.All the staff we encountered during our stay were very curtious, friendly and helpful. Everyone from the front desk to recetion to the cleaning staff.Had no problem with street noise - you're in the middle of one of the most popular areas of the city, and noise is to be expected.The hotel is 2 minutes away from Powell Street turntable/BART station/Market Street (they are literally just around the corner), and only a few more minutes away from Union Square.The hotel has recently been completely refurbished, and is a real gem.The room was on the 5th floor overlooking the street. A great room - a fair size with all new furniture, fixtures and fittings. Extremely comfortable bed, and a nice large LCD TV on the wall at the end - perfect to watch the World Cup whilst laying in bed (8am in the morning remember).Nice bathroom.I would without question stay at the Fusion again, and would whole-heartedly recommend that you do the same.5/5. Cheers,Shane :-)

<Content>Clean and Friendly We just got back yesterday from our trip to San Francisc(July 16/06). Want everyone to know our stay at the Fusion was great! Staff was very friendly and suggested great places to eat. It was very clean everytime the maid came to clean it looked like the first time we got there. Everything was in it's place. Although the rooms were small they were very cozy and we had a flat screen tv too. We would recommend this hotel to all of our friends and anyone who is still deciding where to stay. It is also close to all the great shopping and restaurants. We will definitely consider staying there again. We want to thank the staff at the Fusion for making us feel welcome especially Rich who recommended we eat at Boca and Peppe. Great restaurant for kids too. Hope to see you again.

<Content>Nice Little Hotel for the money We take monthly weekend trips to SF to escape the Central California heat in the summer, and thought we knew most of the hotels in the Union Square area, but had walked by the Fusion before (we've stayed at the Monticello Inn across the street) without ever noticing it (until this time, when we saw the big sign outside - duh !) We booked it due to their low rates compared to the competition for a Friday night stay, and we were very pleased at how well the building had been renovated - literally everying was in near-brand new condition, and in great shape, from the lobby, to the elevator (there are still a lot of old ones in many of the smaller budget SF hotels), to all the carpeting, windows (which actually open easily), to the furnishings, including a nice wide flat screen tv. Our only minor complaints were that the room was on the small side, as are most SF boutique hotels, the sink is not in the bathroom, but outside it, and we got a full size bed (for 2 of us), where we'd rather have had at least a queen, and the parking was not very convenient (the valet parking was $33, which we though was too high, so we ended up parking at the Union Square garage and paid about the same - duh on us again - ). The staff was very friendly, and the location is great - just a block from the cable cars, and three blocks from Union Square, and it's a safe area to be in at night. We'd definately stay here again, and would recommend it to singles or couples (but not to families, due to the smaller size rooms).

<Content>A good boutique hotel Decided to stay at Hotel Fusion with my partner on the basis of decent reviews in expedia through which we had booked a 2-nights' stay in late June. The recently revamped hotel pleased on most accounts - location was perfect, the room was bright, furniture was new, staff were friendly. The room rate included buffet breakfast - well, free flow of juices, coffee, muffins and toasts - which meant that we did not have to scurry out for food in the morning. We even managed to tap into the wireless connection of a neighbouring building and free internet access.It would have been a dream stay for the price except for a little - or for some, a rather major issue. As the rooms do not come with air-conditioning, leaving the windows opened - it was summer after all, meant that we had to put up with the street noise along Ellis Street all through the day and night. This included the occasional screaming drunkard and blaring fire engines as well as car alarms. Closing the windows, on the other hand, led to sweaty sheets. Must say that the 2 nights there had not been very restful.For this reason, a 3 rating (well 3.5 score would have been more appropriate) has to be awarded. Would still happily recommend the hotel to budget travellers who want a clean and functional hotel next to Market/Powell and Union Square.

<Content>Great little hotel in Union Square I was a little skeptical because the price was so much less than the big hotels around Union Square--I really thought I was going to be in a sketchy neighborhood. I couldn't have been more pleasantly surprised by the location. It is kitty-corner from the Renaissance Parc 55--right in the middle of restuarants and an easy block away from shopping.Yes, the rooms are small and basic. But, they are impeccably clean and well-appointed. Towels were soft and large, bed linens were new and of high-quality, and bathroom was stocked with generous amounts of Rusk products. And surprisingly for an older building in San Francisco, the hallways did not have that musty old building smell. Hard to find ice machine (there is only one on the fourth floor) but the front desk was easy to reach and helpful. The free breakfast was really only bread with a super-slow toaster, muffins, coffee/tea/hot cocoa, and juice--nothing very exciting. But with such great restaurants around--who wants to eat at the hotel anyway.....I felt that for the price paid, I couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. I will stay here again next time I'm in SFO.
