<Content>Good Location My husband and I stayed 4 nights in a King Room. The first night the room (facing 5th on Level 9) was unbelievably hot - the room aircon could not be regulated. It continued to pump out hot air, very noisily, all night. Very unpleasant. Next morning we complained and immediately were offered another room on Level 14 - with a nice view of the water - where the aircon was perfect.We had a small problem with the shower - the water kept re-diverting to the bath, but that was fixed no problems.One very annoying thing was with the bed - very comfortable - but the bottom fitted sheet seemed to be too small as every night it came off the mattress and my husband ended up laying directly on the mattress and thee bottom sheet and mattress cover was all bunched up- they need to invest in better bed linen. Free wi-fi was good. Great location and we would certainly stay there again.

<Content>Great Location The hotel is very near everything. A quick couple of block walk to Pike's Place Market and Puget Sound. Loved it and would definitely go back. Our hotel room was a corner room with a view of the water. Very nice.

<Content>average hotel advertised as upscale...pffft terrible television and channel selections. It cost 30.00 to park per day which should be considered fraud. They don't tell you about the parking fee until they get their mitts on your credit card. I know a good hotel and price for a hotel when i see it. I would recomend Comfort Suites on Roy st.....Save your self 40% and get a great hotel and more friendly staff. I have stayed and numerous Red Lions.....They are off my list.

<Content>Excited about the location, neutral about everything else... The downtown location of the Red Lion is hard to beat: you're in the center of shopping, there's plenty of restaurants, and Pike Market is just a few blocks away. The hotel itself, however, is on the bland side. Rooms are spacious, but generic. The lobby is an odd mix of living room and ski lodge (the fire place in July seemed a bit unnecessary) and a bit too hectic to actually be a place where guests would come down to relax.Agree with the other reviewers that the elevators can be painfully slow, but disagree with those who found the staff unfriendly/inattentive.

<Content>Decent hotel, minor issues My husband and I came here for a few days to visit his company headquarters. I worked for two solid days in the hotel. Generally the stay was better than expected, given some of the reviews on Tripadvisor.Pluses1. Rooms were pretty clean, lots of space, and had appropriate amenities.2. I was in the room when housekeeping came each day and they did a good job cleaning quickly and quietly (I was on the phone most of the time).3. Hot breakfast buffet was included each day, although choices were relatively limited. We opted not to have breakfast the second day.4. Room service for lunch was fast and hot. Menu has some good choices.5. Customer service was generally courteous and friendly.6. Fantastic location downtown, just a few blocks from Pike Place and one block from Westlake. Lots of great restaurants and shopping around here.Minuses1. We had problems with outbound calls. First night we tried one phone and had to have the front desk release the line for outbound calls. Second day I tried another phone and had to call again to get it released. This one never worked, so I usedmy cell phone the entire time I was here.2. The room is not really set up for working. No speaker phone or mute capability.3. TV didn't work one morning; all the channels were snow.4. Pay movies didn't work; got a message that the movie had to be ordered at the front desk. Called to ask them to order it and they said they'd take care of it. Movie never started.5. Water pressure and heat are acceptable but lower than we'd like.6. We were two doors down from the elevator, so we could hear people noise when they were waiting outside. Fortunately not too much noise from neighbors (although the headboards rattle anytime you move on the bed).7. Within a few blocks of the hotel you can find a lot of vagrants and other people at loose ends. When we had dinner last night just a couple blocks away, two bike cops were frisking and interrogating two young men right against the window where our table was situated.8. Pike Place Market shuts down at the end of the day, so don't wait to see it at night.I would consider staying here again if the rate were right ($250-300 seems steep).

<Content>Homeless People in an Upscale Hotel Nice hotel, great location, decent service, terrible security. I was staying on the 15th floor and went to walk down the stairs to use the vending machines on the 15th floor. I ran into several homeless people sleeping in the stair well. Where was security?This is a first tier hotel, with equivalent rates. This lack of security is frightening.

<Content>Rocks for pillows My wife and I stayed at the hotel during Aug 08 for 6 nights. The pillows were like rocks, the beds were hard, and the sheets were a rough poly-cotton blend, and the towels were like sandpaper. We stayed on the 20th floor, executive tower, Bay view side. We checked in on a Sunday afternoon and the Fire Alarms sounded at about 2:30 AM Monday morning. We evacuated down the stairwell to the lobby. After the 'All Clear' was announced by the evening / night Manager I inquired as to the cause of the alarm. His comment was someone was smoking in one of the rooms on the 20th floor; he just was not sure witch room. A multi-million dollar hotel and they don鈥檛 know which room - that is frightening!We returned to our room and the alarm went off again about 1/2-hour later. By the way; parking is $30.00 per night.

<Content>Great Hotel in Downtown We stayed here for 5 nights in July 08. We were on the 18th floor with a great view of the Sound. Everything is within walking distance and you can take advantage of the free bus in the downtown area...this made life much easier after a long day of exploring. Also you can get the bus 174 from the airport which drops you right around the corner. Not bad for $1.50...instead of a $30 cab ride. The room was nice and the service was very helpful. I wouldn't recommend the pub downstairs for dinner as the food wasn't great...but I'm sure for a drink or two very enjoyable. Overall we would stay there again!

<Content>Super comfy beds!!! It is a 20 floor hotel in the middle of Seattle's financial district. The hotel itself has a small lobby with fireplace and four elevators to access the rooms (with one elevator to access the underground parking garage). There is a hotel restaurant on the 5th floor, which also boasts a large garden terrace overlooking the Sound. It's a great place for a drink and apps. There is also a restaurant you can access from the hotel (The Elephant  Castle), but it is not affiliated with the hotel. Also, there is a gym on site, but no pool. We were warmly greeted upon check-in and we asked for the 'best room'. We had a corner room on the 20th floor, away from the elevators and ice machine. It was spacious, quiet and clean. The beds were the most comfortable beds we've ever encountered in a hotel. Pillow tops!!!The bathroom was a bit on the small side, but large enough to do what one needs to do in a bathroom. The room also had a small 'fridge, separate bar sink and a couple of cotton robes for our use. :-)The hotel was smack-dab in the middle of everything. It is a couple blocks to Pike's Market, Nordstrom's, the Monorail, shops, restaurants, etc.... It is in a great location.The only negative thing in the entire week was poor maid service the last 2 days of our 6 night trip. The 5th night we didn't get any toiletries (ie..toilet paper!!!) and the 6th night our room was never made up, despite us being gone from 10a - 5pm.If you need a taxi, work with the Bell Captain. It's not easy to find a free taxi in downtown. They are super helpful. They even arranged a private car for us to get back to the airport - at the same price we paid for a taxi to get to the hotel!!!I would recommend this hotel to anyone, without doubt!

<Content>Great locatoin, comfortable bed Great location, close to pike place market, space needle, public library, monorail and major department stories. We got it less than $90 per night from priceline in late June. Comfortable bed and decent service. Beth  body works toiletries. Parking was $14 per day. We traveled around town via foot and public transportation no problems. Free wireless made us very happy guests.

<Content>Good value! This is a good hotel for the price. The staff was friendly. The girl provided me a free upgrade upon check in because they did not have any more rooms available at my rate of about $120 per night from Hotwire.The bed was comfortable and the room was clean. However, a little remodeling and a pool would be nice! Anyway, I would recommend this hotel if paying a modest price.

<Content>Great Hotel and Great Location! I was lucky to book The Red Lion on Fifth Avenue and pay only $60.00 total through Priceline! The room was very large, had robes, coffee pot, etc. The beds and pillows were very, very comfortable. We ate at the Elephant and Castle Pub below the hotel and the food was reasonably priced and very good. Location was wonderful. Only a 5 block walk to Pike Market Place - which we went to a few times. Only a 3 block walk to the monorail to the Space Needle. The staff were very nice and helpful on check-in and when one of our suitcases was delayed. My husband lost his cell phone and we returned to the Red Lion after our cruise to Alaska and his phone was in the lost  found and never used! Staff were efficient and friendly. This was our first trip to Seattle and we enjoyed it even more by staying at the Red Lion on Fifth Avenue!

<Content>Very good location Off the 3 starts hotels possible on a hotel bidding site, this was the most closest to the city center. Rooms were surprisingly large and clean. Rates are excellent when we bidding (I recall $67/ night). Good usable gym and proximity of all downtown shopping. An added bonus was that I could pick up a free wifi signal. Parking is expensive ($27per night) which isn't unexpected for downtown. Beds were very good. Rooms were quiet.

<Content>A nice place to stay in Seattle This property is in a great location for downtown Seattle, and within walking distance of several shops, lots of restaurants, and even the Pike Place Market and the Monorail to Seattle Center. The hotel is set back from the street curb, so if it is raining when getting out of a cab, be sure to have an umbrella in hand. Rooms are very nice, and the rates are reasonable but parking (which we did not do) is expensive - $28.00/day for self-parking. We take taxis when downtown! There is no safe in the room, but the front desk has safe deposit boxes available. The concierge was helpful, and all in all it is a very nice place to stay.

<Content>Great location, good value, dated decor I stayed in this hotel for 5 nights to attend a conference. The Seattle Convention Center is just a couple of blocks away, and so is everything else in the downtown area! including Pike Place Market, the water front, hundreds of restaurants, stores, and of course coffee shops! The hotel is probably one of the best 3 stars I've seen. The decor is dated and looks tired, but the rooms and common areas were clean. The lobby is big, with good lighting and a comfortable sitting area near a fire place. The staff was friendly and checking in was a simple process. If you have a car there is on-site parking. There is a restaurant on the 5th floor where I usually ate breakfast most days and lunch once, but only because my company paid for meals consumed at the hotel only, which was fine, but I would avoid eating there if you had to pay for it. There is also a pub / restaurant called Elephant and Castle in the lower level that connects with the hotel, but you cannot charge your bill to your hotel room there. I had a beer and Thai grilled chicken salad there for dinner once and both were good. There is a small but well equipped fitness room, also on the 5th floor. The only real negative aspect is that the walls are paper thin and you can hear EVERYTHING that's going on in the room(s) next to you, and I assume they can hear what is going on in yours as well.

<Content>As expected...... This hotel is in a very nice location, central to restaurants and shopping. The check-in was quick and efficient. The front desk clerk was professional. The room was quite nice and the bed comfortable. There is a lot of noise from the other rooms and the hallway as others have noted. The decor is a bit outdated. The restaurant is on the fifth floor and looked nice but I did not eat there. I reserved the room through priceline. I would stay there again if I needed a solid 3 star room but I dont htink it is worth the rack rates quoted on their website.

<Content>Great Hotel (avoid the restaurant though) I too was worried when I got this downtown hotel on priceline ($60/night - probably could get it for $50/night, I was doing 4stars and just dropped it down to 3 without changing the price), but was surprised at how well we were treated (not labeled as priceliners and banished to a basement room near the water heaters). We checked in at noon and the lady there was really nice and put us on whatever floor we wanted. When we entered the room it was still messy and it looked like people were still staying there - luckily no one was in there at the time so we just slowly backed out. Anyway, when we went back down to mention that the room was still occupied the lady at the desk upgraded us to a water view room for free and was just really nice. The water view room was nice because you could watch the ferries come and go at night and you could see pikes place and the sun (when it was out) was really nice on the water (there was a lot of construction in our view too, but hey..free upgrade?). Other nice things that lady did for us: gave us change for bigger bills so we could use the bus, found out which bus to take when we wanted to get to other areas or the airport (the 194 to the airport was only like $2 and it stops 2 blocks from the hotel), printed our boarding passes and was just really nice. I'd stay here again, but just if I got it through priceline - hey I'm cheap. Do avoid hotel dining though: we decided to try it out since we were soaked and freezing one night and didn't have time to change and get out to another place - overpriced and gross (rubbery chicken, tasteless sandwiches, overpriced hot chocolate (a swiss miss packet tossed into a cup of tepid water). If you don't want to stray far just go across the street to palamino's (good italian food for less than the hotel). The food was my only regret.

From the front desk to the room and location I could not have been any happier! I have no complaints! If you are looking for somehere nice, comfortable, friendly, and in a super location, this is the place. I would definitely stay there again!

<Content>What a Great Find! The Red Lion Hotel on Fifth Avenue has many features you'll seek when visiting Seattle. It's smack in the middle of the city's terrific shopping district, so Nordstrom, Macy's, and many other popular specialty shops and fine restaurants are within walking distance. Just down the hill is Pike Street Market. The hotel itself is comfortable and looks recently updated. My standard room was excellent, with coffee maker and refrigerator included. The lobby has free cookies and coffee (for December, hot cider is served). Downstairs is a pub with reasonably priced food. I wish the hotel had a gift shop, but Walgreens and Rite Aid are within a block of the hotel. Every Red Lion Hotel I've stayed in has offered great value and the Seattle location is no exception. I highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Room with a view Booking this on priceline and never before staying in downtown Seattle we were a little worried. Our price for a three star was accepted and we could not have made a better score with the Red Lion. We had a view of the water and the mountains, a beautiful spacious room and great service. Very clean, comfy bed, free wi fi, nice lobby area. The only down side was the $26.00 per night parking fee. No need for a car and next time we won't bother to rent one especially if we are staying in the downtown area. This hotel is very centrally located. As we were checking out the couple next to us commented that they had stayed at the Hilton the night before and paid considerable more than they paid at the Red Lion and felt the Red Lion was as good if not better.

<Content>Fine hotel ... not "great" by any stretch of the imagination. I recently stayed at the Red Lion in downtown Seattle for three nights. I read the TripAdvisor reviews prior to checking in and knew from what I read that the paper thin walls would probably be an issue. Believe me, the notes about the walls are not exaggerated. They are incredibly thin. I couldn't believe how well I could hear everything (*every* thing) my neighbors did. It made for restless nights.Beyond the walls made of balsa wood, the hotel has a bit of a dated feel. Colors are the typical golds, ruby, and forest greens. The polyester bed spread seemed cheesy, the bath towels seemed too thin, and the bathroom fixtures themselves were quite poor. My bathtub filled with water when I showered and drained very slowly. The toilet took 3-4 flushes to get everything taken care of ... oddly enough, since it made quite a stir with its mighty sucking action ... which seemed to do little. The iron in the room is cheap, cheap, cheap and left brown smudges on my company shirts I needed to wear to the tradeshow I was attending. The ironing board was quite stained and burnt.The front desk staff are quite nice and helpful. They are every bit as helpful and friendly as you would expect at a finer hotel. The hotel's fitness facility is fairly good. There are treadmills, elliptical trainers, free weights, and a few machines. Towels and water are provided there. My only issue here was that it was very stuffy in the room. They need some fans in there. The hotel also provides guests with the option to purchase a pass to a full service health club nearby for a nominal fee. As noted in many previous reviews, the location is superb. But Seattle has many fantastically situated hotels with much better room facilities and upkeep. Personally, I'd shell out a few more clams and choose the Mayflower Park, the Andra, or the Hyatt.

<Content>Great Hotel, Even Better Location! Never heard of Red Lion prior to this trip. We were suprisingly happywith the hotel. The bed and linens were great, and the room was extremely comfortable. The hotel is located right in the middle of the shopping district and only a few blocks from Pikes Market. Again,great hotel in a great location.

<Content>Great place to stay My wife and I spent 3 nights recently at the Red Lion. The hotel is very centrally located in downtown Seattle, close to all tourist attractions. The hotel itself was very comfortable. Our room was spacious and clean. Any staff we dealt with were very friendly and helpful. This is a great place to stay if you want to be in the downtown area. We do not hesitate in recommending the Red Lion on 5th and would stay here again.

<Content>Great Location Stayed here 1 night over Labor Day weekend. The room was clean and comforable, parking was pricy ($26) but close, safe, and most important, available. The location was great, walking distance to everything we wanted to see (Pike Place Market, Art Museum, shopping, etc.) The front desk was very helpful, providing recomendations and reservations for dinner. The only downside was both a the time we checked in and the time we checked out no one was available to help with our luggage. At check in we waited in our room until they called with someone available. At check out in the morning we wanted to get started early and all the luggage carriers in the lobby were full so we hauled our own stuff out.

<Content>Make it a yearly tradition Go to a Huskie and Seahawks game every year and make it a point to stay at this hotel. Room always great and staff nothing less then gracious. The bar down stairs has the best employees I've witnessed. Work in a customer service atmosphere myself and the times we've stayed they have had some conflict with customers. Delt with the situations very perfessional. Left comment cards with management to let know what great employees they have. Went to a mariners game and stayed in a competitive hotel close by but returned to visit the bar downstairs. Left a seahawks jacket that we had purchased there and did not realize until we got home. Called and talked to manager and they kept it there until the next yearly visit. Obviously I can't say enough. I highly recommend this hotel. With out a dought.

<Content>Pleasantly Surprised by the Red Lion. Booked a 1-night stay at the last minute through Priceline and was pleasantly surprised. Room was spacious and beautifully furnished -- the most comfortable mattresses that we've slept on in a long time and 4 big pillows on each bed. Good quality bed linens. Nice bathroom amenities from Bath and Body Works, plus tea/coffee station. A bit of a drag to have to pay for parking. Bell captain loaned us umbrellas for strolling down to Pike Place Market and over to the Bell Town neighborhood (very cool). Well positioned for shopping and exploring on foot, although there is a large # of street people between the hotel and the market. Still, would definitely use the hotel again as a base in Seattle.

<Content>Happy stay at the Red Lion I stayed at the Red Lion on business. The location is great, close to shopping and restaurants and right in the thick of things. My view was wonderful, I could see the space needle and the water. The staff was courteous and efficient. Parking cost 26.00 for the night and was good until 4pm on the day of checkout. The bed was comfortable and the hotel was very quiet. The toilet didn't work, but they sent someone to fix it immediately. The restaurant is OK, the price is reasonable but other places like triple doors (next to wild ginger) serve much better food. The room was typical hotel: adequate but nothing fancy. The Crowne Plaza in downtown Seattle had a bigger room, better furnishings, more TV channels, and a better exercise room. I stayed there the previous night and would have extended my stay at the location, but they were full. See my review of that property for comparison.

<Author>Light7Sleeper
<Content>Walls are Paper Thin! I could easily hear the people in the next room regardless of what they were doing (talking, moving stuff around, etc...). The doors were very loud when people entered / left their rooms. I could hear doors shutting way down the hall. This made it very difficult to sleep as people were coming and going up until 2:00 AM.If you are a light sleeper, I do not recommend this hotel. As far as noise levels, this is the worst of all the hotels I have stayed. I travel a good bit for work. I will not stay here again.If you have no troubles sleeping or don't mind doors slamming, everything else about this hotel was good.

<Content>Convenient and Attractive Downtown Hotel We arrived for a four night stay during the fourth of July holiday week in 2007. We were quite pleased with the attractiveness and cleanliness of the hotel. The front desk and bell staff were very friendly and attentive to our needs. We were a little disappointed with the concierge staff, never received a smile or greeting when he was seated alone at his desk as we passed by. The room was very nice and had a very comfortable king bed with 6 comfy pillows. The bathroom had great soap/shampoo amenities and look forward to buying them for my home. The restaurant was the most disappointing experience. During happy hour we ordered a couple drinks, and was served a cosmopolitan in a chipped, leaking glass. The server didn't notice it and quickly left as he set the drinks down. We had to go search for him to let him know about the broken glass. The service was very slow and there was no reason for it either. Nobody was dining in the restaurant and there were 3 waiters who were handling about 8 tables. On our second adventure to the restaurant/bar, we were acnowledged when entering but were completely ignored when we were seated. After 5 minutes, we got up and left and went outside the hotel for our dinner.Housekeeping did a good job for the most part. However, we didn't receive any service on our last night and I had to contact the front desk. They sent somebody who did a haphazard job of restocking the towels and soap amenities, but didn't clean the room in the same style that we had experienced the previous three nights. Hotel has a convenient location in downtown Seattle and is just steps away from world class shopping and dining.

<Content>Great View and Great Shopping Location We had a room higher in the tower facing the water and boy did we have an amazing view of the city and Puget Sound. It was nice waking up with a cup of coffee watching the ferries come in, plus the sunset we had the night before was absolutely gorgeous. The location is good for shopping - It's on a main drag and if you are in town for a show, it is across the street from 5th avenue which houses many musical plays.The restaurant attached - Elephant Castle- is okay if you like English food. I would suggest going next door to Rock Bottom. It's a fun brewery type of place with good appetizers. Also, just walk a few blocks down and you're in the main shopping area with a bunch of places to choose from, many quality restaurants. Pike Place Market is like a 5-10 minute walk away. Our bed was not very comfortable but we are extremely picky. Sheets were clean though. Large room with desk, lounging chairs, t.v and drawers and fairly sized bathroom with tub. Our room came with a breakfast buffet which was good with eggs,potatoes, fruits, cereals - typical stuff. Very Friendly staff and helpful too!

<Content>Tired, Worn and Needs Attention Although I had a wonderful view of the water, this hotel needs a face-lift. The rooms need to be re-done, the carpeting is old and worn. The bed was not as bad as I had read about being on a hammock, but the hotel as a whole needs attention. The main restaurant is very disappointing, with very slow service and not a great menu. Not that it is key, but it would be a plus if more television stations were offered, such as HBO, as well. It is very well located and has a nice little pub under it. It could be so much more with a little work.

<Content>Slept in a Hammock The bed could be likened to sleeping in a hammock.The fire alarm was accidently set off at 5 a.m. It took an incredible amount of time to resolve the issue. After the ear piercing room alarms were finally turned off, the front desk after making their announcement, FORGOT TO TURN OFF THE INTERCOM. Resulting in 5 more minutes of front desk chit chat about the entire ordeal and how one's voice sounds on the intercom. No hot tub or spa. The shower sends out spurts of scaulding water followed by cold water. Other tenants experienced the same thing. Management was unable to resolve any issue presented.To call the exercise room or room service a number of 1085 isgiven in the hotel guest book. However, any number you dial takes you directly to the front desk... go figure. Your call may or may not be directly directed! Fortunately, the location is superb.

<Content>excellent Was booked at the Red Lion Hotel for a conference after the original hotel I had reserved had construction delays. Stayed for two nights, and had a spacious corner room on the tenth floor with two queen beds and a wet bar area with refrigerator. Free wireless internet access in the room and the hotel, which worked fine. Room was clean, good beds, no HBO but an above average cable channel selection. Wasn't bothered by noise from other rooms (I think the noise problem is worse if you have a door to an adjoining room). Parking $25 a night, but with in/out privileges--occasionally crowded and needing valet assistance. Staff was friendly. Great location an easy walk to PIke Place Market, two blocks from the convention center. Would stay there again.

<Content>Weekend trip to the 5th Ave. Theater We stayed here overnight and everything was great. Comfy beds and pillows. Right down the street from the theater. Easy walk to a restaurant nearby. Pricey parking, but we could keep our car in the garage until 4pm the next day after checkout. Easy walk to Pike Place Market on a sunny spring NW day. Front desk - very nice. Bell hops and conceirge - friendly. Asked for a high floor to avoid street noise and could still hear cars, but slept like a baby. Clean room. Would stay here again and recommend.

<Content>Worst hotel ever I've been travelling for more than fifteen years between three and seven days per week. This is the worst hotel I've ever stayed in. We all know mistakes happen or things don't go exactly as planned, but this hotel's response to their own problems was unbelievable. - Checked me into an occupied room- Free internet does not work, they told me to stand by the door of the room to use computer- Bed and bath linens did not look or smell clean- I was moved between five rooms. Was there for business and got virtually no work done. - Walls are paper thin, could hear conversation from next door room loud and clear- Room was very cold, heat does not work.- They offered me room service to make up for the problems. The room service menu was out of date so everything I tried to order was not available. I recd a $38 charge for room service. - Staff was very rude on check in and made a big deal about me being a 'priceline' customer. - Was denied request to speak to manager while there. Spoke to manager after trip, she was not nice. Everytime she asked me a question, she would talk over me as I tried to explain what happened. I see where her employees get their non customer service attitude. I've requested to speak with Red Lion corp HQ four times with no response.

<Content>great place to stay in the city! We stayed here for a weekend get away. I was pleasantly surprised the hotel was right in the middle of everything! The location is awesome but parking was rediculously high (24/night). I actually just parked a block away at a meter (free after six and six dollars for four hours (starting at 9am mon-sat), enough time to walk and shop around downtown). The room was a good size for two people. Had a comfortable queen size bed w/lots of down-filled pillows. The only downside was the semi-clogged drain in the shower. Didn't call to complain, just took quick showers. We would definitely come back again!

<Content>Nice place, great location. I was pleasantly surprised with this hotel, especially since I got a great deal through priceline. The rooms were clean and the staff was friendly. The hotel is in a great location in downtown Seattle. You can walk to tons of restaurants, shops, bars, etc. The hotel is on in a main area, so you can feel safe knowing you're not on some deserted side street. There is parking under the hotel, which is $25/night. It seems expensive, but we didn't see anywhere else to park. There is a small loading/unloading area right in front of the hotel. But, if you plan to keep your car there, you should go straight into the garage. The rooms have a small fridge, coffee maker, and a bar/sink area. We stayed there for 7 days, and one of the nights there was a fire in the kitchen. So, at 4am we had to evacuate the hotel. The hotel has an intercom system that the fire dept used to let us know to evacuate (plus there was a loud alarm). We got clear directions of exactly what to do through the intercom. The hotel provided coffee and food for us while we were waiting for the 'ok' to go back up to the rooms. Even though it sucked having to be jolted out of bed b/c of a fire alarm, you should rest assured that if something was seriously wrong with the building, you would know about it and be able to get out. My only complaint would be the expensive parking. Other than that, I had no complaints.

<Content>Good hotel, if you're not paying too much My wife booked our stay through Priceline, and we (luckily) ended up with the Red Lion Hotel on Fifth Avenue. Located on Fifth Avenue (who knew?) between Pike and Union, this properties biggest benefit is it's location. Only 5 blocks from Pike's Market, and surrounded by shopping and places to eat. Oh, and if you like coffee, be careful, there are only approximately 3 coffee shops per square inch, so you may have to stock up between footsteps.The room was on the small side, but not unexpected of hotels in big cities, where room count is a question of economics. The other bad part of the room is that it had thin walls. The wireless internet access was free and decent, but had sporradic issues at times.Parking in the underground lot is $25.00 per day (plus a couple bucks in taxes), and you are free to come and go as you please. Just make sure the front desk is aware that you will be using the parking garage so they can get you the proper tags.If you book through an airline that you print your own boarding pass, be advised the business center charges $4.95 for 15 minutes, and $.49 per page to print. (I think it was $1.49 for color).The pillows were understuffed down pillows, something I'm not a big fan of, but even my wife thought they were too soft. The bed was medium firm. The room had adequate heating (we didn't try the A/C, it was cold enough as it was). The blackout curtains did a pretty good job. Water pressure and flow was pretty good. We didn't note any draining or filling problems. The Terrace restaurant was closed for remodeling while we were there, so I can't comment on it's quality. There is an English styled pub called the Elephant  Castle that is attached that was good quality. (Though they were lacking in a good selection of English brews at the time)All in all, it was a pretty good hotel at the price we paid ($80.00/per night, plus fees/taxes). I was really satisfied with the hotel at the price, but the normal price seems to be around $180/night, which I would have been furious at, as the value was nowhere near $180/night, especially when you have to add parking.

<Content>Nice room but beware of phony telephone charge! I stayed here on business trip for several days. The room is pretty nice and clean, but I when I checked my bill I found that there was a charge for a long distance telephone call that I never made. When I called the front desk to inquire about it, they gave me a number (--) and a time that the call was made. I never made such a call. When I called the number on my cell phone to check, it turned out to be an invalid number and the call could not get through. When I called the front desk back to tell them that, they quickly told me not to worry about it, and they would take care of it. Sounds a little fishy? So if you stay here, check your bill for any fake telephone charges!

On the top floor, there is no air conditioning and all the hotel does for you after you have been up all nught is give you a free breakfast.They admit the system is old and does not work. I would not recommend staying there.

<Content>some good and some bad The good: 1. location,2. location,3. location.The bad: 1. The supposed wireless Internet access did not work in my room, which was a serious problem because I was there on business, and I needed to stay in touch with the office during my stay. When I told the front desk staff (multiple times, because it never got fixed), each staff member told me a slightly different story about how to access it. They all guaranteed me their way would work, but it never did. Eventually, a manager told me to call tech support to report a problem with their wireless coverage. Why it was my responsibility to report their problem, I don't know, but I just didn't have the time to call. Tip: go to the Juan Valdez coffee shop right next to the hotel if you need to get online. Access is free, and the environment is nice.2. Upon checkout, the front desk did not split up the bill the way my roommate and I asked to have it split up. They split it up their own way without asking us how to do it, and then told us they couldn't change it because it was already done. To make a long story short, my roommate ended up spending about $150 more than me (even though we wanted the bill split up evenly), and she will not be able to get reimbursed by her employer for that extra amount. 3. The shower drain was very slow. Minor compared to #1 and #2, but I just don't like wading in a pool of dirty water while I'm trying to clean up.4. Noise, both from the elevator shaft and from the rooms sharing walls with our room, made it difficult to sleep, at least for a light sleeper like myself.

<Content>Great Location, A Little Overpriced My wife and I stayed at the Red Lion for an extended Labor Day getaway. The hotel was in a great location downtown. The room size was fine and generally clean but the bathroom could use updating and an good cleaning. If you can find this hotel for an extremely well discounted rate it was fine but I felt the discounted rate we rec'd from the hotel's web site was a higher price than I would ever pay again for a similar property. Have fun in Seattle, it's a great place to visit.

<Content>So So Experience Visited Red Lion on 5th Avenue for a one night stay. Whilst the hotel is in a great location for visiting Pike Place and the shopping areas and the rooms are quite nice, I have to agree that for the price this hotel was really not worth it. We paid $199 US per night plus taxes.The person we dealt with at check in ( Ryan ) was very miserable and impersonal. Really needs some customer service training.This is the noisiest hotel I have ever stayed in. The walls must be made of paper as the people in the next room REALLY were enjoying themselves, if you know what I mean!!!!!!The elevators were close by and were also going all night. The showers made a very loud vibrating sound when switched on not tonly in our room but all the rooms above and below us. Needless to say we would never stay at this property again.I did not sleep at all that night which did not make for a very restful start to my Alaskan Cruise.

<Content>Great Location, Small Rooms, Uncomfortable Beds I will probably not stay here again. Even though it was a business trip (and this is certainly a business hotel), most business hotels now offer some level of comfort or try to make you feel at home. The service was patronizing, the rooms were tiny, the beds were awfully uncomfortable. The rooms weren't cleaned by 2:00 p.m. Even for a business hotel, it was pretty expensive for what you get. There were a couple of things that did work: the location for business at Pike Place Market and downtown/CBD is great. Free wi-fi is also nice.

<Content>Excellent value. Large room. Great location. I'd stay again. I lived in Seattle for 12 years and, trust me, the location is just fine for downtown sights. You're walking distance from the shopping areas, Pike Place Market, and the ferry boats/Ivar's. You can walk to the monorail for a ride to the Space Needle, or take a cheap cab ride there. For business, there are a number of hotels that are very close to the financial district. This one is one of the best in that regard.I stayed here one night on business then my family arrived for two more nights. Very nice (eggs, waffles, etc) free breakfast buffet. Good happy hour. Service was very slow. Ditto for the front desk. Poor on answering calls for information. Management needs to focus on this, but I find that this is a problem at all but the most upscale properties in cities.The room was excellent. My wife and I both commented it would be a $500 room in New York. Very roomy, clean. Free high speed internet. Bathroom was a B; totally functional, a bit in need of updating, but well above average. Sadly, when they converted this former bank building to a hotel, they didn't put any sound insulation in the room walls. Maybe a bit worse than average among better business hotels in this regard, but still not bad. Paid $129 on a corporate rate. Incredible value.

<Content>Nice hotel, great location Can't complain as long as you get a reasonable price. Clean and much less hectic than neighboring hotels. Room was bigger than average.

<Content>Mixed but mostly good Just stayed 3 nights at the Red Lion Seattle. Plus points are location - very central location, excellent for shopping, safe area to walk around if a lady out and about shopping alone. Breakfast nice, clean, good complimentary wireless Internet access in room. Negative points, reception staff need some customer service training, at this price you expect a higher standard of customer care (got the impression they were happy to do what you wanted but didn't really go out of their way to be friendly, attentive etc) and also for the price, I would expect a better choice of TV channels in the room. Would go again if staying in Seattle but only if on business as couldn't justify paying the price out my own pocket. Paid $256 per night + tax - Internet special rate apparently...

<Content>Excellent all around I expected to get a leftover room since I booked through Priceline, yet not only did I receive the type of room I requested (with two beds), but I was given one on a high (11th) floor with a view of Puget Sound and the Pike Place Market without even requesting!The room was very spacious and had nice touches to make one feel comfortable: pillow top mattresses, four down pillows per bed (!), a pair of bathrobes in the closet, nice toiletries (basil/lemon scented), granite sink, additional sink outside the bathroom, TV discretely placed inside an armoire, and one wall a floor-to-ceiling window with several attractive layers of drapes. The climate control worked beautifully regulating the temperature in the room. Everything was perfectly clean. The beds were very comfortable. Newspapers delivered in the morning included two on Saturday morning (the Saturday Seattle Times and the Sunday edition).Attendants were polite in every encounter we had -- at the front desk and with housekeeping.The only flaw in the room that I noticed was that when people showered in adjacent rooms there was a sort of rumbling sound that came through the walls. Another negative: The Elephant  Castle Pub downstairs may fancy itself to be an English pub, but it does not at all have the atmosphere of one -- way too sports bar-ish and dull.All together, an excellent hotel that can be booked at an extremely reasonable price.

<Content>Excellent Service We had a wonderful experience. Hotel was very clean. Location was great. Within walking distance to Pike's Market, the Pier, good shopping and restaurants. Contacted the Concierge before arrival and she had set up dinner reservations and limo service with Salty's on Saturday night. We had the best table in the house! Would highly recommend the Red Lion on 5th!

<Content>Mixed feelings Me(21) and My little sister(19) stayed there for 4 nights and paid for a half day rate on the fifth day, Our thoughts on the hotel were as followed: The hotel was nice. It was clean and had a great ac. We had a good window view. The location was great. We wanted to up grade, but since we booked with priceline we couldn't do it over the phone nor could we make any request, we would have to wait till we got to the hotel. The lady over the phone told me since we booked with priceline we kinda get the leftovers with rooms and what not. When we got there they already sold out on upgrades. Front desk agents were semi rude especially with the whole priceline package ordeal. Several comments were made about priceline. Their restaurant on the 5th floor was nice and had a great server (his name I can not recall, but he was a younger sweet boy that catered to our requests). The bellman was extremely nice, so were two of the hotel operators (Terry and Goldy). The male concierge was also very nice and extremely friendly. The front desk didn't really cater to younger people, their first priority was their convention guest and older couples. Overall Seattle was amazing. The hotel was nice. Some of their staff should definitely work on their customer service skills. We may or may not stay there again. CM- Las Vegas, Nevada

<Content>great location good hotel We stayed here after a 7 day cruise. The location was perfect - across the street from an upscale mall, walking distances to Pike's and Piers. The hotel was very clean and the service was good. The lobby is perfect for lounging. There's a pub downstairs that has good food and two happy hours.

<Content>Great location! Just got back from a 3-day stay @ the Red Lion. The location of this hotel is perfect! Right in the downtown area and blocks away from Pike Street Market. Great shopping around every corner. The room was fair, my only dissappointment with the room was the bathroom. There was a large area of mold on the ceiling above the shower/tub. A little bleach and some paint would have resolved the problem. The front desk staff was ok, but the female Concierge was unapproachable and rude. I would stay here again just because of the location.

<Content>Great value, consistent comfort, overall nice place For the price, especially with government/military rates, this is one of the nicest places to stay in Downtown Seattle. The rooms are extremely clean, good shower, comfortable beds, and pretty spacious. Location is right off of Rainier Square, which makes shopping at places like Brooks Brothers extremely convenient.

<Content>Very good hotel with great location and value I will give the Red Lion an excellent grade. Location is fantastic, dead-smack downtown and you can walk to all major attractions in the city. Rooms are nice, average-sized, clean and well appointed.As mentioned in other reviews, the staff is for the most part, surly and I really couldn't figure out why.Got it for US$60 a night++ at priceline so I was very satisfied with the value.Parking is a stiff $23 a nite but in line with all downtown Seattle parking.All in all I had a very good comfortable stay at the Red Lion.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel We stayed at this hotel after our Alaskan cruise and what an end to a wonderful week...Hotel was clean and the staff were very friendly..we got there early and they took our luggage and kept it for us while we walked down to Pike Place market and spend an excellent afternoon shopping and wondering around the market..We had never been to Seattle before, but we would love to come back and spend more time at the Red Lion Hotel and explore more of this wonderful city..

<Content>Nice Hotel, Surly Service This is a nice, clean place to stay in a great location, however, when I told them I checked out and mention the shower had no hot water the woman at the front desk was unresponsive. They also tried to double bill me and their accounting department was snotty and rude. You would think they would have bookings through online services pretty much figured out. I would stay there if you get a good deal but be very clear about how you've paid and ask exactly what they're putting on you card, because the staff in fairly incompetent and kind of rude.

<Content>Great Location, Great stay! I was pleasantly surprised with this place. The place is nice. They try to give it a high end look and feel. The room was huge considering this was a big city. The football and baseball stadiums are within walking distance. So is the Space Needle. The Pike street market is a short walk. It's a great place to stay if you're in Seattle.

<Content>Great Football Weekend!!! I am an East Coast person. I have been to Seattle three times now. Have stayed at the Sheraton and the Marriott on previous occassions. But let me tell you this...the Red Lion is really great. My boyfriend was dying to see the Seahawks so we were looking for a good centrally located hotel. I was having a hard time finding a room and stumbled across the Red Lion Hotel (not too familiar with this chain being from the East Coast). First off the reservation manager (Steve S) and reservation agent (Susan W) are absolutely great. They ensured that we had an wonderful stay. We had a great room...(water pressure is a little bad...but hey we were on the 19th floor with a spectacular water view of the Sound!). The room is modern and clean. The hotel is located within a few blocks of everything including excellent shopping, great restaurants, Pike's Market, the waterfront, and yes within walking distance of Qwest Field.There is a cool bar in the basement of the building. The in-house restaurant was ok too. We had the breakfast buffet there during the weekend...was definitely adequate for a quick breakfast before heading out to do stuff.Would I return again...for the price we paid you bet (less than $130 a night)! I think I have seen others getting rates much lower that this. Hey it is not a 5 star but this hotel is very nice and a great place to stay. Overall very pleased...now if they can just make sure it doesn't rain next time.... ;^)

<Content>wonderful staff I was a woman travelling alone, and booked at the Red Lion because of its central location (right in the heart of the major downtown shopping area) and reasonable price.T he room was spotless, with a great bed,lots of pillows. But the best thing was the desk staff; although quite busy at times, they were helpful and polite, and went out of their way to make my stay terrific.

<Content>Great Location A great place to stay in downtown Seattle. Clean rooms. Great restaurant and outdoor patio. But don't believe it's rooms with a view advertisement. After repeatedly requesting a room with a view I gave up. There's a building right in front of the bay so in reality there are no rooms with a view. All in all Seattle is a wonderful city and the Red Lion was a great place to stay.

<Content>Great value for us at Peak season Booked through Priceline once I saw the exhorbitant rates for all the Downtown Hotels of anywhere near decent quality. We wanted downtown because we love to walk to where we're going as much as possible  only had 3 nights there. Got our Double Queen for $90.00; when we checked in they gave us the high floor I requested (14th) and I was hoping for a water view. The 1st room we never went into (hence dunno what the view would have been)--someone's luggage was still in there! So we backed out quickly :) I went to the desk  was pleasant about the situation; they were surprised and a little embarassed but none us became rude, etc. We even joked about my not wanting to share our room with some new friends. Well, we got another room on the 14th floor with a sweeping nearly unobstructed view of Puget Sound with gorgeous sunsets to boot. The room was lovely; not large (we had our 17 year old and 11 year old  we were just fine). I do have the feeling this room was not ordinarily one that would have been assigned to Priceline, Hotwire, etc. but who knows? I'm pretty sensitive to noise and experienced no problems. I also NEED AC (hey I'm from Wisconsin--we don't live here for the heat)  experienced no problem with the AC altho outside it was in the mid to high 80's. We all loved the convenience of the location so much [walk over to Pike's market but go very early or late: midday it's madness altho we still had fun. The bouquets are to die for].Service was very good but we checked in a bit early (1:30) and just missed this HUGE group that came in around 2:15; check out was fine. Spouse  I sat outside at the Pub two evenings and found it very relaxing and fun to people watch. Didn't try the food at either place. My go get 'em husband, determined not to pay the $22 a night for hotel parking (for our rental), found free street parking a ten minute walk away. We only used our car about 40% of the time when we wanted to go outside the Dowtown area.Bring COMFORTABLE shoes if you intend to walk at all and don't already live in a place like San Francisco--it's hilly but SO scenic.The favorite restaurant we all voted the best Italian we've eaten outside of Rome is La Dolce Vita over nearish the Space Needle. I'm not even the hugest lover of Italian restaurants but this was amazing and authentic. Mouthwatering -- go a bit earlier for a leisurely paced meal (save room for real gelato) as it's an intimate restaurant, albeit my kids were treated like royalty: e.g. my 11 yr. old daughter who weighs 68 pounds soaking wet is an amazing pasta eater. As she scraped the bottom of her fettucine bowl the Manager who helped our waiter brought her a 2nd steaming bowl FREE.So, I really liked Red Lion as did the whole family--my daughter missed a pool [a little bit] as she is an avid swimmer; for us budget types breakfast is not included but you can find a bite to eat all around this hotel.For those who complain about parking not being included this is the case in most large cities -- we go to our neighbor Chicago a lot: some hotels there are pushing $30/night. Nearly all hotels in downtown N.Y. and Boston charge as well...Try bidding on Priceline -- $90 a night in Seattle's only month of guaranteed sunshine (we had it!!) is a steal!

<Content>Bad service When I checked out, they first gave me a wrong bill with extra charge on it. I told them and they changed it back. But later I found out they still charged me as the first bill. They always forward my phone to someone who is always unavailable when I called them and the front desk persons are not so nice and patient.

<Content>Enjoyed our one week stay at the Red Lion We just returned from our first trip to Seattle and we stayed at the Red Lion on 5th Avenue. The location could not have been better - a very quick walk to Pike's Market, the piers, Monorail, and downtown shopping. We were very pleased with the hotel and our room - clean, all the amenities that we needed. It was nice having the more casual English pub and the nicer Terrace Restaurant, in case you didn't want to go out, you did have choices. My only complaint was that when your neighbor in the adjacent room was showering, the shower vibrated and was noisy. Other than that, I was very pleased with the hotel - you really can't find a better location and I would certainly stay here again. Concierge was also very helpful with tours and dinner choices.

<Content>Very nice for price paid Some reviewers are forgetting that this is a much less expensive hotel than others in the Seattle downtown area. For the price paid, it's a good deal.Room (811) was recently renovated and was small. Perfect for one person. All upscale hotel amenities were included and the room and bath were both spotless.Some parts of the hotel (hallway doors, etc) are a bit dated but it's not a new building so that's to be expected.Overall, good value and I'd stay again!

<Content>Good location at Convention Center for mediocre 3-star We stayed in this central Seattle location two nights June, 2005. The room was comfortable, but not extraordinary. However, the beds were very comfortable with soft pillow-top and many down pillows. We didn't want to get up! The Air conditioner was flabby -- we were too warm. No way to open windows, also. Continental breakfast buffet was very good. Staff was very pleasant and helpful all around. Room service failed to restock our coffee. For the price, we will probably choose a 2-star in the future, or seek another option. It was not worth the rack-rate, in our opinion. Parking fees were $22/ night.

<Content>Nice hotel The redlion hotel is a very nice hotel in the centre of downtown seattle. We thoroughly enjoyed staying there: the hotel is smart and clean and the staff prompt and helpful. Food-wise there is a nice restaurant within the hotel, but it isn't particularly cheap. This is unlikely to be a problem however, since just about any food is available within a block. The hotel gym is standard (i.e. rather basic) but there is a very good private gym within 2 blocks ('the epicenter') which the hotel sells day passes to at $10 (they claimed this to be discounted, but I observed the price being offered to anyone who walked into the gym).The hotel has free WIFI which worked around 80% of the time we were there.Try to get a room looking out towards the space needle and Macy's - the view is fantastic. The room was small but didn't want for anything other than more space.

<Content>Feeling hot,hot,hot. We stayed at the Red Lion May 27th. It was the night before we cruised to Alaska. Check in was slow although the clerk was very nice he was just not very together. I found our room to be very small, but with a nice view of the city. It was clean and the bed was comfortable. I wish I could say that I slept well, but I did not. It was to hot. We called the front desk and reported to them that it was to hot and their reply was  Well its 92 degrees outside and we've got it on 72 this is the best we can do. I was glad when morning came because going outside was a much needed breath of fresh air. Some people that I saw in the hallway were also complaining about the heat and they had been there several days. Their complaints were also disregarded by the staff.

<Content>good but not quite 4 star Fabulous location within a block or two of almost everything.....parking expensive at $22. Feels like a 2.5 to 3 star place. Noisy corridors, can hear the neighbors farting, and we had distinct body depressions in the beds. Lousy and noisy showers, in a bathroom that needs some updating. Good price thru priceline but I wouldnt have wanted to pay rackrate. Spent the night at the crown plaza the week before and it was much, much more comfortable. Would recommend this place if you get a good deal though becuase of its location.

<Content>great location, great price! Stayed at Red Lion 5th Ave. on 3/18  3/19. Very clean, quiet, well appointed rooms. Beautifully decorated hotel. Efficient service -front desk, bell staff and housekeeping! Highly recommended for the price. Easy walk to Pike St. Market, aquarium and Piers. Would definately stay here again! The only slight downfall were the fact that there are only 4 elevators and were always busy! Hotel was full though, so maybe it is not always that bad. Still had a great time!

<Content>Walk to everything in downtown Seattle. Staff treats you like the solid 4-Star+ facility that it is. Standard rooms are a bit on the small side but well appointed, extra clean, designer's touch. Request a room with a western water view as high up as possible. Irritating for guests to pay $12 parking (but this is a typical practice for hotels in major cities). Can't beat the location - just a couple blocks walk to everything. Don't miss the new Seattle Public Library. Restaurant is OK but nothing special for the $.
