<Content>Brouwer Hotel - A true Gem of a Place! Excellent location, charming canal house, spotlessly clean and with the friendliest of hosts. What more could you want?I'll definitely be telling friends and family about this gem of a hotel which is situated on the Singel canal overlooking one of the beautiful bridges. You'll not need a tram, bus or metro pass from here as the major sights are all within walking distance and walking in Amsterdam is great. The substantial continental breakfast with wonderful coffee set me up for much of the day - so that I could enjoy all Amsterdam's wonderful museums, sights and happenings. Cannot wait to revisit this wonderful hotel.

<Content>Brouwer - Amsterdam's Best Kept Secret! Read all the TA reviews before going but was still a little apprehensive until arrival. The website and photo's no way do this lovely wee hotel the justice it deserves. We stayed in the Rembrandt room and the views over the Singel Canel were a joy to wake up to. It is fabulous and the staff are so friendly. Breakfast was a delight every morning in the quaint breakfast room as were the chats with the lovely hostess and the other guests. Hotel Brouwer is faultless and we will never stay anywhere else now. Best value for money, spotlessly clean and most of all, fantastic location. Amsterdam's Best Kept Secret! 11/10

<Content>A+ for the Brouwer! Great hotel in a very convenient and quiet setting. Super clean room and entire building. Stayed on top floor (Escher room) and the stairs are a bit dizzying but there is a small lift. Great views of canal from every room. Breakfast served was excellent and hostess was very friendly. Very traditional canalhouse with 8 rooms and right on the Singel canal. 2 minutes walk to Damrak and less than 10 to Central Station. Also walking distance to Anne Frank House (10 minutes), Van Gogh Museum (30ish minutes), and everything else you could want/need. Convenient restaurants, bars, and coffeeshops within one minute of hotel. Free internet also a bonus. Excellent choice in Amsterdam and for the rate of 95 Euro I don't think you could do much better.

<Content>Tons of character, a little short on comforts Really atmospheric hotel in a very convenient location. Especially in the breakfast room, it almost felt as if we were staying in an old Dutch painting. The small, 2 person elevator was interesting (not for claustrophobics) and the breakfast was very good. I found 95 Euro was a bit steep for this place, but it seems there is very little value for money in Amsterdam. It is so far the best place I've stayed in in the Dam.The only real complaint I'd have is that the beds are all single (the double room is just two singles pushed together) so you or your partner could end up falling between the beds. Not ideal. I noticed the smallish red-light area near the hotel I saw mentioned on here, but thought nothing of it. I figure if you're really prudish or conservative, you have no business being in Amsterdam!

<Content>Great value, great location, friendly staff and loads of character Stayed for one night at the end of a business conference. Brilliant location right on a quiet canal but just minutes from central station. Lovely old character Dutch house. Room simple and small but immaculately clean, flat screen TV and fabulous view over the canal. Nice breakfast. Highly recommended.

<Content>Top Location, Clean and Friendly The Hotel Brouwer is a small hotel in central Amsterdam, about a 5-10 minute walk to the train station. It is located in a historic building facing the canal.We arrived in Amsterdam early in the morning, prior to check-in. The hotel let us store our bags there and fed us a delicious breakfast while we waited for our room to be cleaned. The breakfast room is perfectly-sized, and allowed us to meet the other guests staying in the hotel.All of the rooms have a canal view. Since this is a central location, you will probably hear some noise from the people below or the scooters passing by. If that bothers you, bring some ear plugs or don't get a canal-facing room.The room we stayed in was Breitner. It was quite large, clean, had a comfortable bed which smelled fresh like clean laundry. It had a bathroom in the room with toilet, sink and shower. It doesn't have air conditioning, but you can leave your windows open if you don't mind a little noise.There is a free internet terminal there, which was great. The hotel staff was extremely friendly.It is located near everything...walking distance to the train station, Joordan district, Dam Square, Anne Frank House, even the red light district. The hotel is in a safe neighborhood.Overall, I recommend that anyone stay here.

<Content>Great Central Hotel! This hotel is located within 10 min walking from the central railroad station. All rooms overlook the Singel canal. It is at the edge of the red light district with a few display windows within 100 feet of the hotel. My wife and I stayed in the Rembrandt room and were very pleased about our stay. The room was furnished with antiques, was quite large, had a comfortable bed and a nice bathroom. Each morning a breakfast of several breads, cheese, jam and coffee/tea was served in a comfortable downstairs setting. The proprietors were helpful, nice, and accommodating. The hotel has the tiniest elevator I have ever seen. Two people have to stand nose to nose in order to share it, it was an experience, especially if you had any baggage. However, the elevator worked and was quiet!I can highly recommend this hotel to everybody. It is quiet, comfortable, safe, and provides easy access to the central shopping areas and the railroad station.

<Content>Wonderful!! This is not the Hilton but a small local owned little gem! My husband and I loved this hotel. It was very small and quaint. It was wonderful, we found it in one of Rick Steves' books. If you want something a little different then for sure go for this!!! You'll love it. It is in walking distance to the train station and many restuarants etc. There was a nice breakfast each morning and the manager was there we were able to visit with her a little. LOVED IT!!!

<Content>great, quirky little hotel We really liked this hotel. It was very clean and comfortable. The location was great. I stayed there with my two young teens (one of the other reviews mentions some of the windows close by--my kids didn't notice, nor care when I tried to discuss it with them). The breakfast was substantial enough to keep us going well into the afternoon.The staff was polite and somewhat helpful (that is where the quirky part comes in).I have no qualms about recommending this hotel.

<Content>Characteristic of Amsterdam Based on reviews from this site, I booked the Brouwer way back in November, and I was glad I did. It is a short walk to and from Amsterdam Centraal Station and so was convenient for coming and going from the city. It is right near Dam Square and is about a 15 minute walk from the Museum Plein, Anne Frank House, etc...we walked everywhere from here easily. They had a nice breakfast that was not a buffet, but rather was served to you. It included bread and a soft boiled egg. The rooms are accessed by a narrow spiral stair case (or small lift) and the hallways and narrow, but slope and lean wonderfully. It felt so authentic staying here. We had the Breitner room and it was great---canal views. There are a few places to eat literally steps away as well. If you want to stay in an authentic canal house with just enough classy amenities, then this is your place.

<Content>Loved the place We loved this place and the location was perfect. Walked to the hotel in 8 minutes from the train station. Place was clean, free internet, great coffee, and wonderful staff. We did wonder when booked as they kept telling us they were full, we just kept emailing and finally ended up with three nights each for two couples, so don't be put off by the first no. I think they are selective. Stairs and lift are small and steep. But I would go back in a minute.

<Content>just what you'd expect Just returned back from the Brouwer and thought I'd write a few comments. Party of two couples all in our late fourties. The hotel is exactly what you would expect from this part of Amsterdam.....it's charming, very clean........... close enough to the night life but certainly not to busy, yes, sure there are girls in the windows close by but isn't that what you would have expected. We had a good walk round and we thought this area was by far the nicest, busy if you wanted it and laid back if that's what you wanted. I can certainly reccommend this hotel and this part of Amsterdam........would I go back ????? of course.... in a flash, pardon the pun.

<Content>Excellent experience We have just returned from our daughter's wedding in Amsterdam. We booked the Hotel Brouwer almost a year before and it was well worth it. The owner and staff were very accomodating and the hotel suited our every need. Location was so great. We could walk to and from Central Station which was our transportation to the airport and the meeting place for wedding guests when they arrived in Amsterdam. Breakfast was great, just loved the coffee and fresh baked goods. Security was never an issue. E-mail access was helpful with other family members because none of us had cell phones for Europe. We were there for Queen's Day, unbelievable experience.I could go on and on, however I just need to say you won't be disappointed. I would love to stay there again.

<Content>Like Coming Home I stayed at the Brouwer just about a year ago, and I loved it! I flew in from Venice, and (don't ask) missed my flight, so I arrived quite late at night. My hubby had called, and the owners were expecting me, and took me right up to my room.The room was tiny (I was alone, so it was perfect) and very charming, with a comfy bed, nice desk, and clean bathroom with shower. Great view over the canal!I really liked the breakfasts, fresh croissants, jam, cheese, eggs, juice, and really excellent coffee with thick, wonderful cream. Oh, yeah. Seriously good coffee. The location was great, close to Central station, and convenient to trams, buses, etc.(The lift....well, it's tiny. But it does the job. I have a stair phobia, so I did not attempt the stairs. Maybe next time.)I only had three days in Amsterdam, so I spent most of my time at museums, etc. but I'm going back this fall, and will certainly stay at the Brouwer again.

<Content>great location, good value and just what we expected We spent three nights in the Vermeer room in late March 2008. We were not disappointed. We arrived before our room was ready on the first day but leaving our luggage there was no problem. Similarly on our last day, they stored our luggage until 6pm as we had a late flight home. We found it a friendly and relaxed hotel. The stairs were fun and the room had character and excellent views. It was clean and the location meant we walked absolutely everywhere. There were a few red-light 'businesses' close by but really they were not a problem. You shouldn't go to Amsterdam with a closed mind. We found everyone laid back and friendly and there was a good choice of restaurants near the hotel. We rate the Brouwer as very good value for money, and it exuded the charm of a genuine traditional canal house. Our only suggestion might be more choice, eg fruit , at breakfast, but otherwise, no complaints whatsoever.

<Content>indifferent staff, red-light next door Positive aspects were central location, comfortable older rooms with 3 to a floor, and rate.Negatives were several red-light windows/rooms on the street including ~next door, which we had not heard about in previous reviews and can make the location difficult with children, the staff was indifferent and breakfasts average. If staying there also ask for a high floor away from street noise.

<Content>Perfect Amsterdam Inn My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Brouwer for one night last December and were so happy with our choice. The hotel is clean, warm, and welcoming. We stayed in the Escher Room on the top floor - the tiny elevator was very helpful in getting our bags up the many flights. The room was bright and cheerful, the bed was comfy and the bathroom huge. The staff was helpful and friendly and the location of hotel brouwer is a reasonable walk from the train station and to all the attractions, restaurants, pubs, and coffee houses you could possibly want to visit. Highly recommended.

<Content>Like the earlier man said -- you get what you pay for. I have no idea how this hotel got rated so highly but, to tell the truth, the entire experience has caused me to doubt the ratings process of tripadvisor.com. For the money, I suppose it is fine, but it is nowhere near the top 100 in Amsterdam, let alone 20. The floors are so slanted (at least in the Van Gogh room) that my roommate and I had to leave after 2 nights of a planned 8-night stay because of her vertigo. There are no TV's or radios and, I know, I know... you don't come to Amsterdam to watch TV, but every so often it is nice to hang out at the hotel. At the Brower, all access to any common area is cut off at 6 p.m. You must go to your room, where there is not even a comfy chair or writing table... just a couple of hard backed chairs and two not-quite-twin sized bed which particularly slide apart (as noted in earlier reviews), especially when the the floor is at a slant. The management is courteous but not particularly friendly--we experienced (and we are fairly kind people in our sixties) very perfunctory, almost New York-rude service.... not the family atmosphere we had been led to expect. There is no wi-fi Internet service, even if you wanted to pay. Bottom line... if you are looking for a basic youth hostel, the Brower is great. If you want a hotel with any amenties... keep on looking. We ended up at a 4-star just down the street for only 10 euros more a night on a great special. Also, and none of the earlier reviews I read mentioned this... the Brower is right next to the red-light district and right next door, there are a couple lovely women displaying their wares -- something families not interested in this part of Amsterdam culture might not all enjoy. Just telling the truth here--the Brower is okay if you want bare bones hostel, but there is no way this is a top hotel or value in Amsterdam.

<Content>Love the Brouwer This is the second time we've stayed at the Hotel Brouwer. We stayed there in May 2007 also. Both times we stayed in the Vermeer room which I really like. The location is great and it's very easy to walk almost everywhere. Love the breakfast - it's a soft boiled egg, tasty dutch cheese, some breads with jam and butter, OJ, and a big pot of french press coffee.The staff is great and the dog that roams about is very sweet.We have stayed in another hotel in Amsterdam and the charm of the Brouwer is hard to beat.

<Content>good for a B Well, you get what you pay for - this is absolutely right.Brouwer hotel has a good location, a reasonable price and good (though with the low ceiling) rooms. Breakfast is almost nothing, but there are lots of little cafes and restaurants in this area, so it's not a problem. They have no TV in the room, but this is also useless - you don't go to Amsterdam to watch movies, do you?I wasn't very impressed with the hotel - this trip convinced me that I need more comfort (not lower than a 4* property). But I do understand why other surveyors love Brouwer - the small family-run hotel in an old traditional building right in the heart of A'dam is a good choice for this city.

<Content>Interesting small hotel with a great view We stayed here for one night on a brief sightseeing trip to Amsterdam. We were not disappointed. This is a small hotel in a really old building with lots of character and rooms with a view over the canal. The beds were comfy and bathrooms rather large. We didn't spend a lot of time in our rooms, but the hotel is convenient to the rail station. You can walk to most things. Breakfast was adequate as everyone said. We found the person at the desk to be helpful and friendly.It is on the edge of the redlight district. Actually in the same block you could see women in the windows, but I never felt unsafe at any time.We were on the top floor and walked the stairs whenever we were in and out. The lift was tiny.I'm not sure we'll return to Amsterdam, but if we did I'd be glad to stay here again.

<Content>A real find in a busy city Several couples chose the Brouwer during a recent visit to Amsterdam. We were all there to celebrate my wife's 40'th birthday. We chose the Brouwer based on many online recommendations (including here). We were not disappointed.The Brouwer is quaint, quirky (in a good way), convenient, clean, and affordable. It is in a good location close to the main train station, Dam Square, red light district, and good shopping. Note that it is somewhat distant from the museum areas and the main nightlife area (Leidseplein) but it's a very quick tram ride away from these spots. The actual area is quite safe but note that it is in the same row as a mini-red light district and you'll see some of the women who work the windows near the hotel. Also, this area has a lot of the coffee shops that Amsterdam is notorious for. On the bright side, it is close to Ann Frank house and the general Jordaan area that has a lot of cafe's and restaurants that the locals go to.The rooms are spacious and have just enough antique touches to make it not feel like yet another cheap hotel. There's even a small lift to help you get your luggage to your room. An accessible free internet terminal is also a big plus. The staff was universally friendly and helpful ... though, oddly enough, it seemed that the staff changed virtually every day. All rooms had great views of the Singel canal. In the evening, we were not bothered by rowdy street noise from late nighters. Breakfast was simple but very tasty.Our group was all 40-somethings used to traveling and have all experienced budget places and grand resorts. All of us agreed that the Brouwer was definitely worth the money and would return.

<Content>Charming old hotel We stayed 2 nights at Hotel Brouwer. It's a small, old hotel with lots of personality (and a very small lift!). Definitely no frills but very clean and charming. Great downtown location at edge of Red Light District but never felt concerned or uncomfortable. A lovely view of the Singel canal from our windows. A tasty breakfast was served in a quaint breakfast room. We definitely enjoyed our stay and recommend it.

<Content>Hotel Brouwer - I actually miss it! I stayed in the Brouwer's 55 euro/night single room (the Hals room) for four nights in August and I loved every night of it. Here are some specifics:ELEVATOR: It's tiny, but they have one! My Belgian friend was amazed by this, as most older historical hotels and even new ones) make you walk up thin, twisty stairs. ROOM: It was small, but normal by European standards. I never felt cramped. The bed was a very comfortable twin; it had a desk, a few side tables and a thin closet. It did have a phone, but no TV (which was fine). Local calls are cheap; calls to European cell phones are not - check before you call!BATHROOM: The shower is basically a third of the bathroom sectioned off by a shower curtain and a small dip in the floor, so it was a little tricky to shower without getting everything wet, but I did it. Otherwise the bathroom was very modern. VIEW: Spectacular. The room faces the intersection of two canals, which are lit up at night. NEIGHBORHOOD: The hotel is on the edge of a red light district, but I (as a single girl in my 30s) never felt at all uncomfortable or in danger. And the hotel is VERY central... I could walk to almost everything. BREAKFAST: YUUMMY, and included in the rate! Tea/coffee, juice, fresh breads, cheese, ham and an egg. When I wanted to go to the Anne Frank museum early, they even made me a little ham  cheese roll to eat in line. STAFF: Really lovely, helpful people. They told me where to rent a bike nearby, which I used my entire trip. And they shared loads of stories about previous visitors and the incredibly history of the Brouwer. Overall, the Brouwer is not a luxury hotel, but I can't believe it's only a one star. One of the staff members told me they don't actually want more stars because the hotel is so popular now, he's having to come in and reject dozens of people every day. I loved, loved, loved it and would stay here again in a heartbeat (if I can book early enough).

<Content>Great place to stay in Amsterdam Stayed in the Brouwer for 3 nights in July, the beginning of a 13 day visit to the Netherlands. We loved it! The location is perfect - easy walking distance to everything in Amsterdam, including the train station. The hotel staff were wonderfully accomodating and friendly - we looked forward to chatting with them during breakfast every morning. The breakfast itself was delicious and substantial enough to carry us through most of the day - at least until the mid afternoon beer break! We stayed in 2 different rooms during our 3 nights there, and they were both perfectly comfortable. We loved the quaintness of the furnishings and the view of the canal from our rooms. The spiral staircase wasn't an issue for us, and in spite of its location, the rooms were blissfully quiet at night, even during the weekend. Can't wait to return to Amsterdam, and I'd stay at the Hotel Brouwer again in a heartbeat.

<Content>view of the singel We loved the Hotel Brouwer. We stayed in the Rembrandt room which was roomy (esp. compared to our Parisian hotel) with an understated Dutch style. We had two walls of windows that made the room very airy and bright. We loved opening the windows and looking out on the canal-- at night the heavy curtains are perfect.. The room is basic, but just what you need when most of the time will be spent walking around Amsterdam. The only complaint is something common in cities and old buildings, it was a bit noisy outside.Unlike most European breakfasts, this one is very filling. As others stated, each person gets 3 types of roll, cheeses, a freshly medium boiled egg, coffee, juice. The people are VERY friendly. We found the hotel easy going and relaxed. The stairs are narrow, but unless you go to a big hotel its going to be the deal in most hotels in the area. There are red lights on the back of the hotel, and two down the block...but really we found the area to be quaint and lovely. If you don't want to see red lights you don't have to do, but it is Amsterdam so thats part of the deal. Definitely walk from Centraal Station, its about 4 blocks on the left of the canal. Also, for vegetarians there is a GREAT place 3 blocks down called Green Planet. My meat eating husband even liked it!Over all, we will definitely stay at the Brouwer on our next visit.

<Content>The Brouwer was perfect I just stayed at the Brouwer for a week and it was perfect. I stayed in the Van Gogh, a double on the 2nd floor. There was a great view overlooking the Singel canal.The room was clean, the beds comfortable. At 90 Euros a night including breakfast, it can't be beat. Wonderful coffee, warm croisant, rolls, etc, cheese and a boiled egg.There is a very small elevator that worked fine (used it going up) and to move the luggage. The hotel doesn't want you to use the elevator after 11PM, and the other option is very circular staircase. For those into heavy partying and staying out late, the staircase might be an issue!There was a bit of street noise but I welcomed it, being from NYC!The hotel staff was very helpful...would recommend this place to anyone who wanted a clean, no frills room in Amsterdam.

<Content>Just perfect! This was spot on for us. We were an eight people group looking for a nice long weekend in Amsterdam. Hotel Brouwer was a perfect base for us. First, the location is great: it's by Singel canal avoiding the busy noisy streets. Yes, it does have some red lights close by and by-passers may be a bit noisy during the night.We had a spacious top floor corner room (only eight rooms in the hotel) with a stunning view. The bathroom had been renovated a short while ago. The bed was comfortable and room clean. There was no TV or minibar in the room but we actually liked that. One block away there is a convenience store where you can find food and something to drink if you want.The breakfast room was small and cosy and very nice breafast was served between 8.30 and 10.30. Rolls, croissants, coffee/tea, boiled eggs, and juice.For 90éˆ§?this hotel is a great deal!

<Content>Dissatified by the Brouwer We stayed at the Brouwer for 4 nights in late April. At first we were charmed by our room overlooking the canal. It was spacious by European standards and looked clean on the facade. Trouble began when we returned to our room after our first full day at the hotel and it had not be serviced at all- no linens, cleaning, garbages emptied, etc... We had arrived back at the room after 6pm, so there was nobody there to help us. We left a note at the front desk; when we returned, fresh towels were left, but nothing else had been done. In the morning, the manager?? apoligized, said it was an oversight, but did not immediately offer any compensation for the issue. Returning to our room after breakfast, I was disgusted, when I leaned down to get my shoes and spotted a used condom under the bureau!! We went back downstairs to complain, the staff person we approached actually laughed when we told him this, not taking our disgust seriously. We expected that our room would be spotless when we returned later that day, and perhaps a bottle of wine etc.. to apoligize. To our disapointment, it was not!! While our bed was made and towels changed, nothing else had been done. The floor, toilet, and sink was still dirty. I contemplated raiding the maid's closet to clean myself. Again, there was nobody at the front desk to help so we left another note. In the morning the manager came up to look at our room agreeing that it was filthy and promising to clean it well that day. The remainder of the trip the room was kept clean. At the end of our stay, they gave us a 15 euro discount on each night of our stay.That being said, I don't think this is the ordinary for this hotel. Plenty of visitors seemed perfectly happy there and this may have been a temporary issue with cleaning staff. It absolutely could have been handled more professionally by staff- the reputation of the Dutch being easy going people proved itself here. The room we stayed in was large, with a beautiful view. Central to most attractions; however, it straddles the red light district (there are several red lights on the homes next to the hotel). Despite the issues we had here, we would consider staying here again, however, if any issue arrised, we would be very firm on how we wanted it rectified. Hoping the staff would handle things well did not go far...

<Content>Hotel With a Special Ambience Hotel Brouwer is high up on Tripadvisors list of the most popular hotels in Amsterdam, and having spent two nights there, I can confirm that it certainly merits this position. It's very reasonably priced, centrally located and provides the guests with a cozy ambience (gezellig is the Dutch word for it, I guess). A nice breakfast room with a large shelf of guide books and a nice lady ready to help anybody asking for advice. My single room was miniscule but adequate for a short stay. The bed was good and so was the bathroom. Some noise from the outside, but I guess that's just something one will have to accept in the center of Amsterdam. Would certainly come back to this hotel for another stay.

<Content>Keep this place a secret..... I am really reluctant to praise the Brouwer too much in case it becomes too popular and somehow spoiled. I needed a room in Amsterdam at the last minute for just one night and after reading the reviews of the Brouwer on Tripadvisor and checking their web site I called them directly and booked the only room they had available - a double for 75 Euro including breakfast. My whole experience right from the booking call to the lovely relaxed breakfast before I left was excellent. This is probably as close to staying with a Dutch family in their own home as I will get. I was given the 'Mondriaan' room right up at the top of the building - great bright space that would have made a perfect artist studio. Windows onto the Singel canal which was stunning at night when lit up. I think the official rating is 1 star and the facilities strictly reflect that - no TV ( brilliant peace and quiet) and no other usual in-room extras. However the room was neat, clean and furnished almost in a Shaker style. I would love to have been able to spend some more time relaxing in it. Great to have a hotel room which lends itself to reading. The bathroom was spacious with a great 'wet shower' area and also a really good bath. One slight downside in being in the roof was that the plumbing for the building talked to me most of the night - but even with that I got a great night's sleep in a very comfortable bed.The reception area has local paintings and family memorabilia everywhere - this has been a family run place for years and has an interesting history. The dog's bed was beside my table at breakfast although he/she didn't make an appearance.The location is also perfect - a few minutes walk to Centraal Station and sandwiched between the centre of town and the Jordaan district. There are loads of good eating places all within 5 minutes walk - the owner or any of his staff are happy to point you in the right direction.I most definitely would re-visit the Brouwer - in fact I would not now stay anywhere else in Amsterdam - a real find and under æ‹¢50 for a room for two people in the centre of Amsterdam,overlooking a grand canal in a lovely neighbourhood - what else can be said.

<Content>Not bad I stayed at this property mid January and found it to be good but nothing special. The Hotel and all rooms in it overlook a canal which is quite picturesque. Rooms are very simple, two twin beds pushed together, desk and chair, cupboard and bathroom. There is a fair bit of street noise but thats to be expected being right by the canal. Breakfast was good- selection of breads with cheese, butter and Jam and a boiled egg. This did not bother me, but the hotel is located within a small red light district. Overall, we were just there for one night and it was fine but I really felt they could make a few improvements and charge more per night and make a better hotel.

<Content>Excellent I'm not going to repeat all those reviews that have gone before. Enough to say, this is a great little place, fantastic location, good value and very helpful. We didn't see the mouse !One slight minus point; the thin alley that runs along the side of the hotel isn't the best area, it can be a little scary is arriving back t the hotel late at night.

<Content>Fantastic Place! The hotel is situated very centrally on the Singel canal and in my opinion was worth every penny. I only stayed for one night but the room was spacious and clean and had an excellent view of the Singel Canal. The staff were very polite and friendly and served an excellent breakfast in the morning and also very happily stored our bags for us the next day. I would recommend this hotel to anyone and would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Nice location but that is all Hotel has a nice location on the canal but unless you are looking out the window, you can't enjoy the view. Also there is construction currently on the canal and it is loud in the morning.We had the Vermeer room. We were told we could take the lift to the floor the room was on but when we went to take it, a man working on the building was quietly telling us to not use it. We wondered how safe it is.Room has a strong flowery smell and the tiny beds are hard and pillows are lumpy.The walls in the hotel are paper thin. You can hear everything people are saying/doing. I could even hear someone zipping up their bags.There is no tv, no radio and the phone was broken in the room. Although we advised the staff that it was broken, it was never fixed. No internet either.There is only a tiny closet for you to hang clothes. No dresser.One morning at breakfast I noticed mouse poop on the table. They also leave the eggs unrefrigerated in the kitchen. I would stick with just the coffee.There is noone around in the evening and early morning which may make it difficult to check in or out early/late.Security is dicey as one time we came in throught the back (as directed by staff) and a man followed us in (holding up a key). We had no idea if he worked there.Staff is nice.This hotel is inexpensive but I cannot recommend it soley on the price and nice location.

Only downside we found was no tea or coffee facilities in the room. But the view from the window was nice and offers some quality entertainment at night

<Content>Lovely! Great location and city views. Lovely hotel right in the centre of things. We stayed (as many other people writing reviews here) in the Escher room on the top floor. The hotel only has 8 rooms, so booking ahead is a must.The views from the Escher room over the canal and city are great. Breakfast was simple but well prepared and really nice. The staff were all very helpful and friendly. The only thing i could really critisise is the climb up to the room! If you dont fancy going in a lift the size of a shoebox (which can't be used after 11pm) you have quite a climb in front of you, up a very narrow and tight spiral staircase. Would definitely stay again (even with all those stairs to climb!)

<Content>good experience at Hotel Brouwer I can't recall the name of our room but it was in a corner, on (I think) the second floor. There is a photo of it posted by a previous reviewer (the one that did Best 400 year old hotel ever). It was a nice room, although the floor was noticeably slanted. Had a lot of windows overlooking Singelgracht, so that was nice. Windows aren't soundproof and we had trouble sleeping on a Saturday night due to noise (and our jet lag). It is very convenient to A'dam. We were closer than we thought to the Anne Frank house. Took a bus to Van Gogh museum for that exhibit as well as Rembrandt and Caravaggio. I recommend this. Also did Heinekin experience, emjoyed it. Ate at Restaurant De Rigeur near Anne Frank house. Very good. Very enjoyable stay at Brouwer *breakfast was standard that we had all over Europe - pastries and jam and coffee or tea and hard boiled egg). Didn't have too much interaction with the staff but they were friendly. Would stay there again and recommend. Easy walk to train station. Was very easy to make reservations and reconfirm via email.

<Content>Possibly the best hotel in Ams I have nothing but praise for the Brouwer. From the tasty breakfast (suprisingly good croissants and terrific coffee!) to the spectacular views, this hotel is the best deal in Amsterdam.We were in the Van Gogh room, which is a corner room with views on two sides. I fell in love with the views, and the location. We were central to everything. Yes, you are in a red light district, but that's easily ignorable, and you are just a couple of blocks from the main shopping area where you can find anything you might need. This is so much better than those big chains around the corner!

<Content>Fantastic Hotel We spent 4 nights over new year in this hotel. I cannot stress how fantastic it was. Our room was the Escher, it had so much character! The beds were very comfy though they are two singles pushed together, there is also a little seating area and a very big bathroom with separate shower and bath and two basins. The views were amazing - especially as there was so much snow while we were there. The heating worked very well - thankfully!The only grumble I had was having to walk up to the top floor after 11pm as they would rather you didn't use the lift after this time - but this was me being lazy and probably the worse for wear!Breakfast does get abit monotonous - but filling and generous nevertheless. All in all this hotel beats all the others as I feel you really do get a true taste of what Amsterdam is all about without paying a fortune.

<Content>Great stay, great location I stayed at the Hotel Brouwer for 8 nights at the end of October. There were 3 of us and we had a double room and a single room. We have no complaints at all. I am very happy I chose this hotel over a big chain hotel. The staff that we dealt with were very friendly and helpful. The breakfast does get a little redundant(soft boiled egg, rolls and cheese) but its still good and gets you some fuel to start your day. The location was very convienent, about a 10 minute walk to Central Station and right on Singel Canal. I stayed in the Mondrian room and it was great. Terrific view, very roomy, high ceilings, and a large bathroom. The Hals room which is a single was much smaller but more than adequate. You can come and go as you please, as you are given a key to the door to use, they lock up later in the evening. The street noise was loud on occasion but nothing that ruined a nights sleep. The only problem was the stairs. There is a tiny lift that fits maybe 2 people. When we checked in we actually sent our luggage up via the lift and walked up the stairs to meet our luggage. It a narrow spiral staircase and if you are on the 3rd floor it can get to be a bit much if you make the trip several times a day. But it's a small inconvienence compared to everything else. I would definitely stay here again in a second.

<Content>Old Amsterdam in a nice hotel Stayed in the Hotel Brouwer for a long weekend and was charmed. I've stayed in A'dam many times but only learned of this place. It is a GREAT value for the money, but don't expect business-class level services. That is not what this place is about. The Hotel Brouwer is about settling back and not rushing. The breakfast doesn't start until 8:30 and is delicious. The coffee, bread basket, eggs and cheese were very tasty and filling.While there is no TV (unless you ask for one but why?), limited phone service, and modest toiletries, the rooms are a good size, the bathrooms are good size and there was a lot of hot water for the shower or tub. The views over the Singel canal are much better than watching TV and you get a friendly family atmosphere that is a throw back 15 years. The non-smoking policy and friendly staff makes it very family friendly. The only warning is that if you come in after 11pm, you are asked not to use the elevator -- this could be difficult if your room is on the top floor unless you are in decent shape.All in all, this place is a winner and I will stay again.

<Content>Great hotel, great llocation Just recently stayed at the Hotel Brouwer for 2 nights and found the hotel. location, and staff excellent. The hotel was clean but simple. If you are looking for a fancy, 5 star hotel, best to stick with the Marriott. However, if you are looking for a place with character than this is it! The hotel is the house of a merchant that was built in 1650-something and overlooks the Singel canal. It is a quick 10 minute walk from the central station, but the street is quiet and yet close to much of the old section of Amsterdam. We stayed in the Mondrian room, a double according to the website. The room was huge and had a private bath with both shower and bathtub. The beds were very comfortable. Breakfast each morning was simple but delicious and filling for a full day of sightseeing in the city. The hotel did not seem to have A/C, but this is not a problem in October. I could see how it might be warm in the summer. Overall, great value for the money. I don't know when I will return to Amsterdam, but I would stay here again without a second thought.

<Content>Great little hotel We stayed for 2 nights in August 2005. A truly authentic hotel, right on the Singel canal. Unfortunately the lift was out of order when we arrived (Sunday) so carrying our cases up the spiral staircase was interesting. It was fixed first thing Monday morning.Our room was great - a corner position, with 2 beds pushed together, large bathroom and a fabulous view over the canal. The floor sloped a little, but to be expected in such an old place.Breakfast was more than adequate. We wanted to stay a 3rd night, but they were fully booked, so moved to the Hotel Singel up the road.Only negative was the noise all night from scooters accelerating along the canal roads.

<Content>Honeymoon in Amsterdam We stayed at the Hotel Brouwer on our honeymoon in May 2005. The room we had was double aspect and very roomy. Although we had a shock when we arrived as the downstairs seemed so shabby. Also, its no good going there if you have walking difficulties as the only way upstairs is either by the spiral staircase or a rickety old lift which only holds one person. Having said all that, the bedrooms were lovely and clean and the beds were quite comfortable, although it was very cold. The breakfasts could have done with some variation as it was just eggs eggs and more eggs. The owners were a little dour as well, but apart from that, it was very authentic and very cheap. We would definitely stay there again. PS Not a sign of a mouse anywhere!!!

<Content>Great Value - Great Hotel For once a hotel that looks as good as it does on their website! We stayed at The Hotel Brouwer on 24th and 25th of July (Fri  Sat) and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. I have never visited Amsterdam before but my UK based brother and his fiancee had (4 times) and they believe it to be the best value and best quality hotel they'd visited. Considering they'd stayed at hotels up to twice the price (and none cheaper) they really thought it was great find and one that they will return to. The rooms were clean and comfortable with and authentic Amsterdam charm in a building that is 350 odd years old. You are situated right on one of the inner canals (Singel) with a short walk to the central train station, dam square, the red light district, the park, markets, coffeeshops, pubs, food, anne frank, bike hire etc. Breakfast was served consisting of fresh crumpets, multi-grain roll, crossant eggs, coffee and orange juice and was a great start to the day. We will definitely return to this hotel and recommend it to anyone who wants a good honest value for money hotel with the personal touches from an ower who really cares about the guests. Budget conscious travellers will find this one hard to beat. The location is nice and quiet but close enough to the hot spots that you are not left out of anything. You even get a beautiful view of the canal from your room.Trip tip - hire bikes and cycle around amsterdam - especially, check out the little butcher shop below the hotel - he served hot pork sausage that was simply awesome!

<Content>Fantastic place to stay. My wife and I stayed at the Brouwer for three nights in mid-June 2005. The weather was unusually hot (in the mid-80s) but our top floor room - The Escher, was very comfortable. It is a corner room and with the windows open, gets a good breeze. Street noise was not a problem, maybe because we were so high up or maybe because I've heard one too many rock concerts! The tiny (and I mean tiny) elevator is a big plus though the stairs are not as bad as most restored canal houses.Room was spacious and had a very generous private bathroom. Room is a double (by pushing two twin beds together) and they kept separating, especially during heavy exercising ;) Towel allotment is a bit stingy but not a problem.Owners were very gracious and the breakfast was adequate (good semi-hard boiled egg, cheese, coffee, juice and a good assortment of bread). And the location - in a word - Fantastic.

<Content>An absolute gem This is a lovely 17th century canal house that has been converted to a hotel. The first floor has a large breakfast room, kitchen and the owners' study. The owners live on the second floor. The 8 hotel rooms are on the top 3 floors. The rooms have recently been completely renovated in 17th century style. The rooms are very simple - hardwood floors, low beamed ceilings, and simple rustic (but good quality) furniture. All rooms have a large bathroom (by European standards), and all rooms have a wonderful canal view. No TV, no AC. The hotel is a 10-minute walk from the train station and is situated on Singelgracht, the innermost canal in Amsterdam. Breakfast consists of a fresh hot croissant, roll, muffin (or bagel), hardboiled egg, coffee and OJ. The doubles have 2 twin beds (85 euros); the singles (1 twin bed) are 50 euros - cash only. (The doubles are considerably larger.) The location, value and character can not be beaten. There are a few red lights in the area, but the area is generally quiet and residential. I have stayed at several extravagantly luxurious hotels in the Ritz and Intercontinental chains, but this is the most memorable, enjoyable hotel I have experienced.

<Content>Perfect location I was almost tempted not to write this review, as this hotel is becoming so popular it is necessary to book well ahead. We spent 5 nights there during the Queens Day holiday and it is the best value we have ever had. Friendly, immaculately clean, very atmospheric and placed ideally for most of the attractions, especially the Jordaan area. Excellent breakfast, served at our table with warm rolls and a freshly boiled egg. we will always try and book this when we go to Amsterdam. Incidentally, prices the same for this week-end which is a major Dutch holday ,as the rest of the year. Other hotels please note !

<Content>A little gem What a find! Three generations of our family spent 6 nights here and all agreed it was perfect. Only 8 rooms on the Singel Canal it was clean, quiet, and restful. Each room is en suite. A tiny elevator took those of us with creaky knees to our floors, breakfast was huge and delicious. We were welcome to check our email daily, they even provided a laundromat for guests. Fluffy comforters on our cozy beds were splendid. The tram stop is 3 minutes away, you can walk to the train station, there were many small restuarants serving fabulous meals all around the hotel. A fabulous find. Singles 50 Euros, doubles 85 euros. Book early, it is always full.

<Content>It's as good as they say - just book well in advance! Very central (close to the station) and excellent value for money. Has real Dutch character to it with sloping floors, tiny antiquated lift (which you feel scared to get into) and tiled breakfast room. But as people are spreading the word it is getting booked up months in advance so get in there quick - this is not a last minute deal place!I will return!

<Content>Great for the price This is a great little hotel in a fantastic location. Cosy, warm, pleasant rooms, friendly staff, comfortable beds and not expensive. Breakfast was good and hearty, although a little repetitive (there's only so many boiled eggs you can eat without tiring of them!). Most rooms have a great view of the canals below, a good spot for just watching Amsterdam go by. A very central location less than 10 minutes walk from Centraal and a tram stop less than a hundred yards away. Also convenient for The Pancake Bakery and Anne Frank. Unless you're after a luxurious stop-over, this should suit most people fine.I read the 'mousey' review and I have to say we didn't see any evidence of mice - hopefully this was just a one-off.One final thing though - the reviewer who didn't see any red lights didn't look too hard, because there was one less than 5 doors away !
