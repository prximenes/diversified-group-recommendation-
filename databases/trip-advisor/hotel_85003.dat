<Content>One of the worst hotels EVER Do not stay at this hotel. The customer service there is pretty horrible.1st I had to wait 30 minutes before I could get checked in becuase they couldnt find my reservation. Then when they did find it, I had to wait an additional 10 mins becuase there system was down. 2nd The room smelled like mold and the floor was very nasty. There was even a huge stain on the floor near the bathroom. 3rd the room had no microwave or any real amenity (the pool was dirty).4th IT WAS LOUD ALL NIGHT. The hotel is situated right near a highway and all night I could hear the sounds of cars passing by.

<Content>DIGUSTING Disregard the online virtual tour. This place is nothing like they advertise. We had two adjoining rooms when the doors were opened, there was black mold on the inside of the doors. Wallpaper was peeling off, the baseboards were loose, the outside banister was so flimsy a child could've pushed it over and fallen down five floors to the concrete walkway. Carpet was so dirty the bottom of my feet were black within seconds. This place should be condemned. You would think being so close to the hospital, it would be a relaxing, clean environment. Air conditioners worked half the time, no vending machines worked, none of the ice machines worked. We will never stay at this motel again.

<Content>A Nasty Place Bad smell, bad lights, plastic yellowish filthy bathroom. It was so smuggly dirty that I had to sleep with my clothes on and not inside the disgusting sheets. I was so fightened of the place that I left the poor lights on all night. Besides, there was an ice machine on the corridor outside making noise all night. I wonder why the authorities of health, if any, dont close the rotten place forever. And this is a place suppossed to be there to allocate people for a hospital !!!!. Shame on the States for places like these.

<Content>Gross  We arrived and went to our room, which smelled. Asked for another room-that smelled. Went on to view 3 more rooms and said, we aren't staying here. Took a cab down to the waterfront and checked into a nice Holiday Inn. We lost our deposit, but it was so worth it to leave that dump!! Hotels.com should have warned us. Plus the security guard there told my husband that the area was not safe. That was enough for us!!

<Content>Travel Inn/Crack House Ok my girlfriend and i decide to travel to Florida to see the Keys we came with a limited budget. I found this dump on the internet and thought coool I am saving money! BAD MISTAKE!!!! it started when I went to the front desk to check in there were bums on the front porch you would have thought the soup kitchen just cut every one loose. I started to check in when I noticed what looked like a pimp and two whores. I asked to see the room before I checked in, the girl at the front desk acted as I asked her to part the Red sea when I asked this. Her response  I already checked you in (rolling eyeballs). So I just said screw it whats done is done it was a bed right? WRONG!. I opened the door and holy crap! the rug was peeling from the floor the room smelled like a NY subway station the furniture looked like it came from the dump the bathroom door didn't close the bed just about screamed clean me! and it was not comfy at all the floor was NASTY! no hot water no water pressure but there was some sort of scientific experiment growing on the shower floor. When I checked out the morning staff was pleasant and nice. If you and your frat boys are looking for a place to have a kegger and trash with no remorse then this is it you don't have to worry about damaging much here. Don't bring your wife,girlfriend here for a romantic getaway unless you are trying to get rid of her.

DO NOT THINK ABOUT STAYING HERE. !!!!Because of the Miami Boat show, hotels/motels closer to the beach were totally booked.We needed one night not far from Little Havana.this property is directly across from a VERY LARGE hospital complex and from what I gathered, most of the guests needed something close to the hospital to visit or precheck in.Out GPS showed DAYS INN....

<Content>The people under the stairs. This hotel, well if your planning on staying here make sure your armed C J lives around the corner. read every review because every one is correct this place is a complete [-] hole. It's over priced, they should pay people to stay here, Norman Bates out of phsyco would love it here.FOR GOD SAKE DON'T STAY HERE, and don't even think about paying to stay here. It is convienient for nothing and as for the area if you wanna get mugged this will be right down your street, that's if you got the guts to walk around at night time. If you have kids dont put them through this phsycological trauma.

<Content>The filthiest "hotel" I have ever stayed in Giving this dump a one circle rating was 5 times too many but that was the lowest rating possible. Roaches, dirty towels, filthy floors, dirty sheets and pillows, live and dead roaches in the room, hair from previous guests (victims) all over the bathroom and in the bathtub, constant noise from the freeway that's right next to the hotel. I have stayed in hostels and hotels all over Europe, in hotels all over the U.S., Canada, Mexico and several countries in Asia and NEVER in my entire life have I ever stayed in anything that was anywhere near as dirty as this sorry excuse of a hotel. I'm surprised that the Health Dept. doesn't shut this dump down.Also, while I was in the lobby using the internet, they were quoting people calling in a rate that was $35/night less than the outrageous $109 they overcharged me. I talked to a manager and they said they'd refund the difference but never did even after numerous phone calls to them, most of which were never returned.

<Content>Worst POS money can buy I do not know where to start. The minute we walked into our room we noticed that everything in it was wet. The ceiling was black and the wall paper was coming off the wall. We were shocked that we didn't find a dead body under our covers. The toilet did not flush, our tv remote did not work, and our air compressor in our air conditioner was broken so it just blew moist air (not to mention the rust all over the A/C unit). The room smelled like a middle school locker room. The vending machines took my money without giving me a soda. The only thing i enjoyed was the nice bartender and the 3.00 drafts in the bar. If you have children do not take them here unless you want them to contract aids, sars, or any form of hepititis.

<Content>Bad, bad, bad. For me, their hospitality included two bites on my back when I awoke in the AM that I did not have when I went to bed the night before. Room was not the cleanest I've seen, bathroom door wouldn't close, there was no hot water, wires hanging out of phone door in elevator, prostitutes hanging around in front, no security there during late night and early morning hours, restaurant closed. Video of this place on computer must have been taken when it was new. PLEASE DON'T STAY HERE. Even those at Jackson Memorial say not to stay there. One night was enough of a nightmare I checked out the next morning although I had planned on staying for a week..

<Content>I Got Lice Staying Here! The roundtrip shuttle is not worth it!! The round trip shuttle from the airport, to the hotel, to the port, and then back again all inclusive with the price I thought was a deal. NOT THE CASE!! I got LICE staying at this location. I couldn't believe it! I'm 32 years old! with Lice Bugs! have never had Lice in my life. I alerted the nonchalant clerk of this, but called Miami Health Department as well. Don't stay here. Besides after all the tipping for this, tipping for that you actually spend more- I recommend you to stay at the airport hotel if your visiting Miami as a layover for a cruise. In retrospect we found that to be the best bet!

<Content>A Dump! Stayed for a night prior to cruise...Shuttle service was pathetic. Waited for 2 hours while constantly calling the front desk to confirm. The rooms were filthy while the pool was temporarily closed. I believe they even lost their accreditation as they are now called Travel Inn. Will say no more because they will never see us again!

<Content>Oh my god!!! This is the hotel where they film all the murder scenes in CSI Miami, or they could. There was mold growing up the walls, the bathroom was so filthy it could not be cleaned, the stucco on the ceiling was falling down, the carpet was sticky in places. Ugh. We stayed there the Friday night before the Superbowl (cruise the next day). They charged us $350.00 USD!! YES, THAT'S RIGHT! Worked out to $428.79 CDN. DO NOT STAY HERE. PLEASE, SAVE YOURSELF!

<Content>Do Not Stay at Days The room had not been cleaned. When the maid had came to change the linens, the mattress was soiled. The bathroom looked like it had been used by a group of construction workers. There was grime everywhere.When we asked for another room, we were treated as if this were a giant inconvience and we were a problem.The new room had a cracked mirror in the bathroom and lightswitch blew when you turned it on. There were no towels in this room.

<Content>Worst Hotel in South Beach!!!! We were suppose to get a free shuttle from the airport,did not happen. The driver drove slowly past and left us at the airport.He claimed his van was full, but the whole back seat was empty. Called a cab because the hotel stated they did not know when the next van would be available. Got to the room,it smelled awful. Toilet was clogged so we reported it to the front desk on the way to South Beach(phone not working ).When we got back 6 hours later, toilet still clogged and room smelled a lot worse. Went down and report clogged toilet. Took 15 minutes to get a response. Fixed toilet, then I discovered a used condom on the floor next to the bed. If the maid hadchanged the sheets, she would have seen this on the floor. Went back down stairs and reported what I had seen, took another 15 minutes to reponsd. By this time I called another hotel and booked it for the night. Went back to the lobby and explained that there was no way I could stay in this disgusting room and was refused a refund.DO NOT STAY IN THIS HOTEL.

<Content>Terrible guest relations, filthy rooms, misrepresented We booked the Days Inn Civic Center Miami based on their website description and pictures, for a 5 night stay during Super Bowl week. Of primary importance to us was the availability of in-room internet access, as my husband is a sports writer and would need internet access throughout our stay.When we entered our room the first thing we noticed was water damage on the walls and ceiling and watery evidence on the carpets indicating the moisture problem was ongoing. The furnishings were old, worn and decidedly dirty. The bathroom was moldy and looked as if it had not been cleaned. We were willing to overlook these problems as we knew we had booked a relatively inexpensive hotel ($90 per night). However, after 20 minutes of frustration at trying to access the internet, we contacted the front office informing them there were no wireless connections within range. They told us to keep trying. We called again 10 minutes later, at which time they told us they would 'reboot' the system. 10 minutes later we called again and were told there was nothing they could do about it.We took our laptop and walked the property, looking for a wireless signal. The best signal we found was rated 'poor', and was right next to the lobby. Hoping for the best, we asked to be moved to a room closer to the lobby. Aleida at the front desk told us she would not move us to any of the several rooms we knew were empty (we saw them as we were walking the property). We had not used our room in any way, but she assured us nothing would change her mind and that we could check out if we didn't like it. We asked to speak to a manager and she refused, saying she was 'in charge now' and she wasn't going to call the manager. When we asked why she could not move us she said, 'Other people made reservations'. We reminded her we had also made a reservation for the exact room type we were asking to be moved to, and that our booking was based on the fact they advertised in-room wireless access. She told us we could sit in the lobby and pay for access using their computer if we wanted to use the internet.After many frustrating attempts at getting moved to a room that might have a wireless signal, and Aleida's smirking refusal to accommodate that request, we checked out of the hotel. Happily, we found a gorgous suite in South Beach for only $9 per night more than the horrible Days Inn Civic Center, so I suppose Aleida did us a favor. Her attitude convinced us this was not a hotel worth giving our money to, and I was truly relieved not to be spending even one night in that filthy room. Potential guests should be aware they may not get the services Days Inn's website claims are included, and if they are not happy with something about their room, well...in the words of Aleida, 'too bad! If you don't like it, check out.' I'm so glad we did.

<Content>VERY BAD The bedroom walls were so damp you could see water running down the walls.We stayed two nights prior to a cruise.Our clothes were damp when we unpacked on ship.Our bus driver from the airport advised us not to walk outside hotel, it was not safe.We took his advice.The plus points.. free bus service from airport was very good,free bus service to Bayside was also good.Hotel reception staff helpful.Breakfast room/bar although decor awful staff and food quite good. I would not stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Bad, Bad Experience As a TripRewards member we stay at numerous Days Inn and other like places during the year. However we have changed our mind based on how bad this place was. I pray that no one else EVER books this place and Days Inn removes it from their properties. Returning from a Key West trip, we needed a place to stay for 1 night before a morning flight out of Miami. Driving into the hotel, we realized we were in a BAD area based on the activities outside the place. We checked in and walked past 2 rooms with police tape outside them from who knows what. The room was old with wallpaper falling down, dirty floors and a broken safe I was charged for. There was a large crack between the floor and the door so on 3 occasions we had a pizza menu shoved under the door. I did not sleep all night as I did not feel safe as there was activity outside the door all night long. We left in the morning and felt lucky we made it out alive.After getting home I complained to TripRewards who gave the standard it's a franchise answer, which I would not accept. After multiple threats to never stay at any of their sponsered properties again, (their records show how many stays we have) I was sent a $40 check. No amount of money will make up for the experience we had at this place and I hope no one books this location. Mr Day should be rolling in his grave that his name is on this location.

<Content>Days Inn should be ashamed The service was terrible. They claim to have a free shuttle service from the port of Miami to the hotel, but after waiting 2 hours for the shuttle to show up and many phone conversations with rude hotel staff, we were forced to take a taxi in order to not waste our whole day.Don't be fooled by the pictures, the pool area was dirty, the rooms smelled, its in a bad area and there are no resturaunts or stores nearby.Oh yeah, one thing they fail to tell you is that they have rooms available for rent on a weekly and monthly basis. This is never a good sign.

<Content>The worst place I have ever stayed. The hotel has cockroaches everywhere. Rooms are filthy, the hotel staff is rude, the shuttle service is free only if you want to wait over two hours to get it. Slip the driver $20 and he will take you anywhere. Mold everywhere, no free coffee makers, pictures in the ad are very deceiving. We were charged for a safe that hasn't worked in years. Website says the hotel will refund your money for it if you do not use, staff refused. Railings on upper level are unsafe. Do not stay here what ever you do!!!! It is in a very bad part of town. Very unsafe unfriendly, and dirty.

<Content>NEVER EVER stay in this hotel It was my worst stay ever in a 3 star hotel. First of all, the room condition was extremely poor. The carpet was very dirty. The mattress was worn out. When I sleep on it, it sunk all the way to the bottom which gave me a back pain after sleeping on it for 3 nights. Also, I don鈥檛 know what is it, but something bit my back when I was sleeping in this hotel. It is now 5am in the morning at Washington DC and I am awake because my back is very itchy and painful. The web site said there is wireless internet at the place but it was not available when I stayed there. The elevator was out of service on my last day of stay and I had to lug my luggage down a multiple flights of stairs (I was on the 5th floor). The certificate of inspection of the elevator expires in 2003 ( I have a picture to proof that). This makes me wonder if the elevator is safe at all. This Days Inn is the worst Days Inn I stayed ever!!!! I would never recommend or ever return to this Days Inn in my future stay in Miami. I believe it just destroy the image and reputation of the company.

<Author>A TripAdvisor Member
<Content>Was this a nightmare? I have never stayed in such a terrible place in my life. Our group of 19 selected this hotel for us to meet before leaving on a cruise. While we realize that Days Inn鈥檚 are privately owned, we believe Days Inn should be ashamed to have their well known and respected name associated with this hotel. We chose the facility because of location, price and shuttle service. We didn't realize it was the Hotel California or the next thing to hell. Days Inn ended up sending us one $50.00 gift certificate for our inconvenience. This is just another nail in the coffin. As we all continue to travel we find oursleves shying away from any Days Inn. At the airport we proceeded to the courtesy phones to call for a shuttle. This hotel was not included in the listing so I called using a cell phone. This should have been clue # 1. It was roughly 2:30 PM. I was told the shuttle was on its way. We went outside to wait only to join another party that had already been waiting an hour. They were told check-in wasn鈥檛 until 3 PM anyway. When the shuttle did show up the other party had been waiting 1.5 hours so we let them go first. We were told another shuttle would arrive in about 5 minutes since there were two running. Another 45 minutes passed and the same, loud mouthed driver returned. By the time we got to board a shuttle it had been 1.5 to 2 hours. The female driver was on her cell phone talking loudly in Spanish all the way to the hotel. On arrival, check-in seemed normal. Four of us proceeded to our pre-booked room of 2 double beds on the third floor. When we got to the window we could see it was one king size bed. We went back down to let them know there was a mistake. The young clerk (a female who had no customer service skills) said our group did not have any rooms with 2 double beds booked and there were no vacancies left. After some discussion she bumped someone else and gave us another room on the 5th floor. By that point the elevator was out of order and everyone had to lug their luggage up multiple flights of stairs. As some of our other parties arrived and checked in we compared rooms. Two of them had rooms with 2 double beds, exactly what we had requested when booking early in 2005. I went back to the front desk to let them know that the rooms were booked correctly, and that the incorrect parties were assigned the room. It would just be a matter of switching. I was told that everything was our or the travel agents fault and they were not allowed to let guest switch rooms. Frustrated and searching for a solution I asked if they had roll away beds since one room had 3 people. They said yes and I figured the problem was solved. Then they let me know it would be an additional $10.00 charge. Again the blame was placed on us and they were not responsible. When I returned to the lobby to greet family members from around the country, instead of happy greetings we were instead greeted with more like 鈥渨hat in the world is going on here?鈥?One of our couples related their room number with another couple of our group. They had both been assigned the same room on different credit cards and again they returned for more poor service. During all of this time other guest were coming in and facing poor service, requesting refunds, and others who had confirmations did not even get a room. The staff did not show any empathy and simply could not care. They only spoke to each other in Spanish making guest feel even more inferior. Even an extremely reeking bum came in the lobby begging for money. We went to the desk early the next morning for towels since there were only two towels for four people. They said they would send some right up. After an hour, they never arrived. I ended up without a shower to start my day. When it was time to go to the cruise ship, they only ran one shuttle because it was Sunday, the busiest day of the week for them since cruise ships arrive and depart that day. We chose to hire taxis at our own expense to make sure we arrived on time. Most others waiting since early morning did the same. The same shuttle driver as the one who picked us up the day before walked around like she had all day. You would think she would have been moving guest as fast as possible to get more tips. Again, she simply did not care.Online description 鈥?Miami Days Inn Civic Center is a three star hotel. It has complimentary shuttle service to the Airport, Port of Miami, Downtown Bayside Shopping. (It sure sounded appealing to guest who don鈥檛 know any better!)Problems and observations we experienced as a group were鈥?br/>鈥ockroaches in the rooms鈥levator not working鈥o room service for towels when requested鈥he laundry room is absolutely disgusting with mold and filth.

We have yet to figure out what the role of the outside security guard. He arrived in the morning with his boom box and sat in the outside security booth. With the traffic and congestion of taxi鈥檚, shuttles and busses, he never moved from the building to assist with the safety of the guest.

<Content>If Hell had a hotel....this would be it! We were given room # 243. Room was very dirty. Carpet filthy and stained. Marks all over walls. Phone was so dirty I didnt want to touch it. I used toilet paper to hold the receiver since there was no tissue provided in my room. We killed 4 cockroaches in the bathroom upon arrival into the room and flushed them down the toilet. We realized we didn鈥檛 have enough towels. We called down to the front desk to ask for additional towels but were told the hotel did not have additional towels. So we made the best of the situation and shared. We never did get additional towels; even the next day we had to use the same towels.  After dark, the cockroaches really started to come out. Crawling on the walls, on the desk area, on the bathroom vanity, on our bedside table, just about everywhere. We were horrified! I called down to the front desk and asked to change rooms. I was told I could not as nothing was available. I started calling other hotels in the area, at my expense; however, because of cruises going out everything was sold out. I called down to the front desk again. I asked for some raid or even a fly swatter. Days Inn had neither. The desk clerk said nothing could be done until tomorrow when I could talk to the manager. I was stuck! We killed 19 cockroaches before retiring that evening. We could have killed more, however, many were too fast for us. I awoke at 3am. I killed several more cockroaches. Several crawling on the phone, radio, my water glass, and the bedside table. I killed as many as I could but they would just run behind the bedside table. I killed one crawling on my headboard. I shuttered to think my head was just there! At that time my mother woke up because she felt something crawling on her. Sure enough...............there was a cockroach in her bed!!! Needless to say we didn鈥檛 get much sleep that night. At 8am I immediately went down to the front desk to speak to the manager. I was told no manager would not be on duty until 4pm. I again asked if I could change rooms. I was again told nothing was available but after 3pm something might become available.  I went to talk to the manager at the front desk at 4pm. I was told, sorry I was given wrong information and that the manger would not be in till 4pm the next day, Sunday. I again told the desk clerk I needed to change rooms because of the cockroaches. Again this was denied. I implored him. I told him the room was infested with cockroaches. He didn鈥檛 say a word. He just shook his head and shrugged his shoulders. Apparently my request that morning to change rooms when someone else checked out was denied. Again I was stuck! I went back to my room and killed all the roaches I could find. I also found several dead ones on the floor between the bedside table and the bed. So much for vacuuming. It was another rather sleepless night. The next morning I was never so glad to check out of a hotel!  At checkout the lobby was full of people complaining and waiting in line. They complained about not having enough towels, dirty rooms, incorrect and extra room charges, etc.  How much would you pay to stay in a filthy hotel room infested with cockroaches? $89.00? $59.00? $44.00? By the way, I got the last two rates from poeple who were in line with me at the front desk. They stayed the same night as I did in rooms with, reportedly, much fewer roaches. On the nights I stayed in this room I would look down into the parking lot from the window. I would wish I could sleep in one of those cars parked there instead of that room. At least they would have been roach free. We slept with all the lights on in the room hoping this would lessen the cockroaches from coming out. Judging from the amount of cockroaches, I don鈥檛 think this did any good. I always wore flip flops on the carpet in the room because I knew it was filthy. My mother walked on it with her bare feet. After a few minutes I noticed the bottom of her feet were black with dirt. She went and washed them in the bathtub. The water turned black and so did the soap. The toilet seat was broken. It kept slipping off the base. My disabled mother actually fell off the toilet because of this. It is a good thing she was not hurt. I also fell off the seat but I was able to catch myself in time. We requested a wake up call at 7:00am with the front desk. A few minutes later they called us back reconfirming our wake up call. He said he was talking to someone and forgot the time we requested. We told him again 7:00am. We received no wake up call. It is a good thing we woke up ourselves that morning. If I am expected to pay $89.00 plus tax for this hotel room, Days Inn should put on their web site, -plenty of roaches -no towels-unreliable shuttle, may be cancelled at the last minute -Clerks will tell you that management is available but management will never be available-Wear shoes because carpets are filthy-You can request a wake up call but you wont get it Everyone waiting in the lobby agreed when I suggested that Days Inn get their name off of this hotel. After returning home I contacted the hotel directly and Days Inn. Days Inn was no help at all and told me to contact the hotel directly. The hotel's response was to offer me 10% off on my next stay there. They couldnt pay me enough to ever stay at this hotel from hell again.

<Content>Do not stay at this hotel! There were way too many problems with my stay to produce a complete list. This hotel was no great savings over others in the area but it was a very bad experience. Among the problems I had: room not clean (esp. carpet), no towels, safe had no instructions, not insulated whatsoever from highway road noise, front desk did not answer phone any time I tried it. When I went down to the front desk at 11:30 PM for something, there was a crowd of angry guests waiting for service. I got the impression this was not an unusual situation. I had no idea the Days Inn brand included such a poor hotel operating in its chain. I wish I had checked here (tripadvisor) first!

<Content>Very scary!!! Everything about this place was scary! I was lured in on-line by the free shuttles to/from airport and to Port of Miami.....BUT, like all the other reviews, do not stay here! People were milling around outside our door at all hours of the night. The workers were all rude. I slept (barely) with my purse under my pillow. The safe that we were charged for was broken. I did have that charge removed. This was by far the worst hotel experience our family of four has has ever had. When the hotel has a laminated sheet of safety tips on the table that stated not to answer the door, that's a big red flag of how bad the neighborhood was.

<Content>Run Away As Far As You Can!!! This is the absolute worst hotel anywhere I have ever stayed. First off, we had a credit card reservation for 15 rooms for 1 night before our cruise with a guaranteed rate of $65/night, but when we checked out the next morning, they tried to charge us over $100/night for the --- we stayed in, but they didn't get away with it. My room had blood stains smeared on the back of the door. The place smelled horrid. We called 5 times for towels, and they kept saying they were on the way, which was a total lie. They finally gave us a few towels and 2 wash clothes for 4 people at 7pm at night. ---. They were rude. Oh, don't forget the fact that a few people in our party were propositioned outside the hotel by male prostitutes and offered drugs. I felt like we were in a foreign country. I wish I would have known about this website too, because I would have paid more to stay somewhere nicer and safer. You would think that a national hotel chain would have some standards, but that is not the case here. The restaurant cracked me up because you are in Miami and when you order fresh fruit, you would think you would get some, but they gave us canned fruit! Someone already said this, but the only good thing about this experience was that our cruise that left the next day was the best.

<Content>Stay away from at all costs I wish I had looked at this website before I stayed at this hotel. This was the worst hotel experience I have ever had. We were just staying here 1 night before a cruise. We didn't need anything fancy, just a place to sleep. We barely got that. I'll make this quick, shuttle service was very late. It took an hour to check it. The workers were rude. The room was dirty. The toilet didn't work, I had to fix it myself. The towels looked dirty. The sheets looked dirty. The shower had this very high pitched whine that about drove me crazy. The motel is right between the interstate and a very busy street. You couldn't pay me to stay at this place again. Pay the extra money to stay anywhere but here.

<Content>Run - do not walk away from this hotel! We stayed in this location (3 couples) for one night before boarding our cruise ship in early Feb. 2006. The rooms were shabby, the front desk staff rude and unresponsive and the restaurant staff had the attitude that they were doing you a favour by serving you. We were happy to leave. Unfortunately at the end of our cruise a bad snow storm closed down the Philadelphia airport and we were stranded in Miami for 2 more days. Rooms were booking up fast and we did not want to sleep in the airport so - you guessed it - the downtown Miami Days Inn had vacancies (what a suprise) and we ended up booking 3 rooms for 2 more nights. Three couples checked in together, 2 couples were charged $85 US per night and we were charged $125 US per night. No one was able to answer our questions on why we were charged a different rate. We have sent numerous e-mails to the hotel and head office and have had no reply. Our room had no heat (it was unseasonably cold when we were there) and one had to literally chase the chamber maid for towels (none were provided in the room). Other guests were seen in the lobby in their pyjamas waiting while their room was cleared of cockroaches and an elderly couple was told to put up with it it being soaked carpet from the toilet overflowing. Days Inn corporation should be appalled with the physical condition and lack of cleanliness in this hotel, the surliness of the staff both on the front desk and in the restaurant. I repeat run - do not walk - away from this hotel. It makes me wonder what other Days Inn properties are like.

<Content>Save yourself the trouble and rent a car and sleep in it! my friend and myself had planned a cruise and decided stay in Miami the night before we set sail. Hotel rooms were not so easy to find but to my surprise the Days Inn/Civic Center had rooms with transportation from the airport and to the Port of Miami. I was thinking Jackpot!. From the airport things started going down hill. It started with calling the hotel and letting them know we needed picked up. They asked what airline we came in on and told us to go the 2nd floor and wait. After 45 minutes I called back to make sure things were okay. The lady answering the phone spoke little English and told me we were in the wrong spot and needed to be at a different location which was not near where we were. I asked to varify which location and was hung up on. So, my friend and I with luggage in tow ran to the other spot to catch the van. Feeling better once the van was in sight, started to get a better feeling about this place. Then driver said we ran for no reason, he stops when needed and not just at that spot. So that was a bit confusing. As we arrived to the hotel we asked what places were around there that we could go to. He told us shouldn't walk anywhere that the jail house was near and that it was dangerous. No big deal there is always delivery. As we waiting inline to check-in the people behind the desk looked very annoyed and were not friendly at all. We finally got our room and couldn't wait to get to it, to relax. Opening the door we were met by a nasty smell, the wallpaper was coming off the walls and the beds were pretty much sitting on the floor. While taking this all in I had to tell myself the it was just one night and we could leave early. As we sat in our room that night watching TV my friend noticed something crawling by the TV, as you can guess it was a cockroach. We called the front desk and they sent housekeeping up to spray. The lady arrived spoke no English and sprayed around the TV and in the corners. This made matters worst, after that we saw about 5 more. Enough that I didn't want to sleep there not even for a night. Once again called the front desk and young man said he would get us another room. After going through our luggage and shaking out all our clothes and stuff, we went to the front desk. The young man asked what we needed and we surprised to see us, like the first time he has spoke to us. We waiting in the lobby for an hour to get another room. Finally, other roon seemed much cleaner but still we checked everywhere for bugs. Pulled the bed away from the wall and we found someones nighty. By this time I was much to tired to go the front desk and tell them, I thought I would just speak to the manager in the morning. As we were checking out the next day( a few hours later) I asked to see the manager and was told there weren't in and they didn't know what time she would arrive. We weren't the only ones asking to see them, there was a group of 4 asking the same thing. I would not suggest anyone to there, even if it was for one night. Please save yourself the trouble and rent a car and sleep in it.

<Content>Stay far, far away! I've stayed in some bad places, but this was the worst. Tired beyond being able to do anything about it, my brother and I arrived due to a family emergency. We opened the door to a strong bad smell. While the sheets were clean (I think) the bed was tired and very old. We stayed for just 4 hours of sleep, but if you can, find another place. Bad, Bad, Bad.

<Content>Enjoy Days Inn with Roaches, Rats on Much More........ I stayed in this hotel for one reason.... It's near to th Bascom Palmer Eye Institute. ohh Good...... BIG MISTAKE! The front desk clerks were rude and unprofessional. No managers on duty. We booked this hotel with plenty of time. When we arrived to the hotel after a long driving, the clerk told us that we didn't have any reservation. That was no possible because I had a conf # for that reservation. Anyway, we just wanted to stay. They gave us a different rate of $99+ tax. We were given the hospital rate $62+ tax. What a day! My wife and I checked -in and guess what! we had guests in the room, YES! ROACHES were hiking the walls and walking under the pillows, It was so disgusting.. what a repugnant experience.. No to mention that there weren't enough towels, the so-called HIGH SPEED INTERNERT was down, Tv didn't work, tha DUMPSTER WAS SO FULL. In adittion, a few RATS walking and having fun near the RESTAURANT. WE RAN OUT OF THAT PLACE BEFORE WE GOT AN INFECTION. They are lucky! If the health deparment see what I saw... oh good.There is a bunch of nice hotels for $100 box at night.GOOD LUCK ROACHES-INN!

<Content>Roaches found in rooms The Check-In Lady was rude. We booked 2 rooms and found roaches in BOTH rooms. My mom killed one of the roaches and took it down to the check-in lady and she gave us a measly $10 refund for one of the rooms. I left a message for someone on the property (Corporate doesn't seem to want to get their hands in this issue) to talk about the roach problem. 2 roaches means many bacteria-carrying roaches behind the walls of this old decrepit hotel. The rooms were smelly and there were some shady people in a truck behind one side of the building just loitering around. There's plenty of other hotels around this area. The Holiday Inn near Bayside Marketplace had rooms for $100, same price as the Days Inn, but they were all out. Listen to the reviews...DON'T STAY HERE.

<Content>The ABSOLUTE WORST!! Our family stayed at this hotel only because of it's proximity to Jackson Memorial Hospital during a time when a family member was in ICU there in critical condition. One of our rooms had no lamp shades on the lights. We couldn't get additional, or even clean, towels. We had to request clean towels and were then told that we had to wait until they did some more laundry. The vending and ice machines never worked. The front desk staff was very rude and were responsible for the unexplained disappearance of my elderly grandmother's credit card. The restaurant staff was equally rude - when I was not acknowledged by them when walking into the restaurant, I picked up a menu myself and starting looking at it. A very nasty staff person grabbed it out of my hand and told me NO! There were multiple electrical outlet covers that were broken / missing in my room - one up against the mattress / sheets. Unfortunately, this is in a bad neighborhood with nothing else nearby, so you are a captive to the bad service, rude staff and horrible conditions if you need to stay close to the hospital. Avoid this hotel at all costs!!

<Content>Rather have my eye poked with a needle then stay in this hotel Please who ever reads this review....never ever ever go to this hotel, even for 1 night, 6 hours or less...not even 1 minute! The place is absolutely disgusting. I was so scared to sleep in the bed that I slept on top of the covers and used my boyfriends fleece as a blanket and the sleeve of fleece against my face to sheild me from the pillow. I would have rather slept with a deadly snake, then in this hotel. A bunch of us booked this hotel to stay in for one night because we were going on a cruise the next day. The people at the front desk are a bunch of idiots, and didn't have any hotel management skills whatsoever. My friend and his girlfriends mother cut themselves on the elevator door because they were pretty much broken and they bled!!! Then after getting a few pieces of luggage up to the 4th floor the hotel elevators..all of them...were broken, so we had to lug 6 pieces of luggage up 4 flights of stairs!!!! Then my friends son found a cockroach in the sink in their bathroom. In the room where my boyfriend and I stayed, the paint on the walls were peeling and part of the walls were crumbling. The place stunk to high heavens and the sound of the traffic kept us up all night, which probably was a blessing so we could watch out for bugs - I didn't even shut the TV off, I was too afraid to be in the dark in this place! I beg all of you who read this to pass the word! DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL! It makes the houses on that reality show (How clean is your house) look really clean!

<Content>New Meaning to Nasty This was absolutely the worst hotel I've ever stayed in. You couldn't pay me to take my socks off to walk across the floor! The hotel had horrible service and the staff was completely indifferent to our needs. Of course you had to be put on hold from 10 to 20 minutes waiting to even get an answer. I called the front desk to ask the hours of the resturant that's located litteraly at the front desk and she never could answer me! Well, it was closed by the time my family and I realized they were never going to pick us up at the airport and had to grab a taxi. Oh, and as an added bonus...there was only one bath towel to share among my husband, child and myself. No matter, I wouldn't have used it anyway. Gross sums up their facility.

<Content>AKA Dump Inn The motel was on a very noisy street and was a little nervous staying there especially after a worker in the motel's restaurant said we're located in between the jail, the hospital and the ghetto!!! But he was right. The ghetto was the next block down the busy street. The Cuban food in the restaurant was great though but everything else about the motel spelled shabby and run-down. I spotted a small roach in my room near the door and the room smelled like cigarettes even though it was a designated non-smoking room. The airport shuttle (which was on time when I took it from the motel) was a run-down van with a driver who didn't even say 'good morning' to me when I hopped in. And there was a huge sign in the vans asking for tips!? Not with that attitude! Stay away from this motel!!

<Content>Great and cheap This hotel was more than I expected. I visited on April 2003 and it has a great location. a 5 minute drive to Byscaine Blvd, near to the AA Arena.The room had 2 queen beds, a clean bathroom, private bathroom.It had a clean carpet and the windows were also clean.The courtains didn't close so well, so it was a little bit lack of privacy, but no one walked in front of my room during my stay.It had a parking lot in case you rent a car, the staff was very kind and helpful.Without a doubt, when I go back to Miami, I'll stay here, I rather spend my dollars in the malls and entertainment than in a expensive hotel.

<Content>Not What Was Expected We stayed at this location for one night prior to our cruise. According to the website and agent we booked with this property had just undergone a renovation: which to say the least was just some wallpaper and maybe carpeting? Although i did not feel this was done just recently. The staff upon check-in was not very friendly at all. We had to walk around the entire hotel to find our rooms. The best thing about this property is the complimentary airport and cruise port shuttles. This alone made the stay worth the unsatisfactory room and desk staff.

I've heard the saying, you get what you pay for, but if this hotel is any indication of that saying, it should have been free.We were told the two rooms we reserved would be right next door to each other. They were opposite ends of the hall.One member of our group waited an hour for the shuttle (old lady in a van) to pick her up from the airport. The shuttle never arrived and she ended up taking a cab.Another member from our group waited 50 minutes for the van and when it finally arrived the driver spent the entire ride cursing someone out on her cellphone and when they got to the hotel the driver dropped his luggage out on the ground. And the van has the nerve to have tips are greatly appreciated posted all over the !@#$% van.When one member of our group entered the room he was greeted by roaches crawling across a piece of furniture which I can only guess was a dresser with only 2 drawers in it.The towels in the bathroom were wet.The bathroom floor was stickyI walked around the room, on carpet, in my socks and had to throw them away by the next morning because they looked like I had been walking around outside.The bed had two flat sheets on it instead of a fitted and flat sheet.The comforter had a wierd order that came from God only knows what.They were having a children's party complete with hotdogs and hamburgers in a room down the hall and some little kid about 3 or so wasn't being watched and wandered into our room.We didn't even bother to take our clothes off to go to bed, who knows what was on the sheets.The bathtub took 45 minutes to drain the water from a shower.The back of the hotel faces the highway so you hear cars all night long.There is no order to the shuttle service. It's survival of the fittest when it comes to who gets on first.This isn't worth the inexpensive room. Spend the extra money and stay somewhere else.

<Content>Scarey! Days Inn Civic Center- Miami, FloridaI was looking for somewhere cheap to stay for one night before I left for a cruise. I thought the Days Inn name could be trusted and the hotel website looked pretty decent. When calling for information the front desk staff was quite curt and I was disconnected on another different occasion (which is frustrating when calling long distance). When picked up at the airport by our free shuttle, I found myself getting into the only Days Inn van that had a dent in it (Days Inn vans for other Days Inn locations were also circling the airport collecting guests) which should have tipped me off. We got to the hotel and once again the night front desk staff were not helpful, often spoke to each other in another language in front of me, and rolled their eyes at requests I made or questions I asked. The elevator, ice machine, and in-room safe were all broken. We also found a few bugs scurry past at various times in the evening. Knowing that there were 3 of us staying in the room, we still had to ask, more than once, for extra towels. The location was inconvenient as there were no restaurants within walking distance. Not reccommended! Pay the extra few dollars and go to a different location.

<Content>Never Stay Here! Worst pit we have ever experienced -- I can not imagine how this dump deserves any stars at all, let alone 2 stars! I didn't expect luxury, but did expect a normal clean/no-frills Days Inn. Our room had no functioning air conditioning, so we were finally moved (at midnight!) after jumping through hoops and putting up a fuss. The good room was dingy and dirty; lamps didn't work, alarm clock didn't work, threadbare linens. The staff was rude and spoke no English at all. Scary part of town with no restaurants in the vicinity, so nowhere to get a bite to eat at night. Very tacky attached restaurant (only breakfast and dinner) was way overpriced and had only one overworked, churlish waiter. This was a quick one night stay between arrival in Miami and leaving next morning on a cruise, so -- thank goodness -- didn't have to be here long! Next time we will pay a little bit more! Days Inn should revoke their brand from this dump.I sure wish I had discovered Trip Advisor before I booked this room!

<Content>A piece of SHIZZNICK!@ Anyone looking for a decent hotel this is NOT it. I stayed her in October precruise. It started off bad when I checked in. I bought my 2 nights stay through American Airlines, which was prepaid for. When I checked in they had my reservation but had told me that it wasn't paid for. I explained to them it was already prepaid and I had my confirmation slip from American Airlines as proof. This was still not satisfactory to them. The front desk had to call AA and AA confirmed this. Days Inn is still telling me it isnt paid for. This goes on for about 20 min. Everyone in my group has already gotten their keys to their room and left. I asked the front desk clerk what is taken so long to figure this out and she tells me that someone is going to call again but I can call myself on my cell phone if I'm in a rush. Yeah I'm in a rush. I just got off a long plane ride. I would like to freshen up. That's not asking much!!!!! Some customer service huh. Finally the manager comes out to deal with the situation. And it's taken care of. When I get to my room the room was dirty. The carpet was very stained and dirty. The bathroom was not that clean. It had mildew. Etc., Etc., My friend said that in her room the sheets were dirty when she checked in. When she noticed them at night when she went to bed she called them three times and no one came to change them. The second time when she called the front desk they told her we are really busy down here. i'll call you back click. The girl hung up on her. After the third time my friend was so angry and tired she took the sheets down to the front desk in her nightgown and slippers and demanded new ones. Now this was her pre wedding night. Who's needs the STRESS!!To sum it up. I will never go to a Days Inn again. And I don't recommend this Days Inn to anyone else.

<Content>Yuck! Though the staff were very nice, our room was not! I stayed at this hotel just one night, though we booked it for three, while visiting a sick relative in a nearby hospital. It was so dank and gross that I barely got any sleep -even slept with the lights on! It needs sanitizing  a general update. I think the high traffic from the local cruise ships are part of the reason for this. Bugs in our bathroom, and though we told the maid that we were checking out, she continued to make the beds without changing the sheets!!!!! Stay anywhere else - you'll be glad you did.

<Content>Worst ever This is the worst hotel I have stayed in during my twenty years of travel. Spraying for insects( had to leave the door open to clear the fumes), water didn't work, holes in linens( if there were any), beds not clean and the carpet hadn't been vacuumed in days, waited for 1 1/2 hours for the quick shuttle from the airport and then the driver asked us to lift the luggage because it might be too heavy for his back. . Never - stay here - ever.

<Content>Rip off/ misadvertisement/ Civic Center This place is a rip off and not what they advertise. The 'FREE' shuttle service has some catches, they don't mention this on their website. One van is for the airport and the other is for the port. If you expect a free shuttle to Bayside Marketplace, think again, it only runs at 9:30 and 5:30 although we never seen a shuttle go there.My husband and I were witness to a lady complaining about the shuttle service, she waited two hours at the airport and ended up taking a taxi (so did we and many others in our party, so we could relate to being mad about it). Well, she asked for some kind of compensation and was told he could do nothing, she went on complaining and another lady behind the desk talked about her in spanish and told him to give her 5 bucks so she would shut her mouth. This should never be done by anyone!!! They didn't realize that someone else may understand or they simply didn't care.We stayed the first two nights before our cruise in a first floor room by the pool and it was much better and less noisy than the night we spent on the third floor facing the busy road. In both rooms, the carpets were filthy, but the towels and bedding were clean. There were no roaches or other bugs in either room. The room facing the street was VERY noisy, so if you can get a room by the pool, it's much nicer. The view looks nicer too.The restaurant is overpriced, but not so bad food. My husband and I took the metro and buses to go places. No one seems to smile, but then again we were the ones on vacation and with more reason to smile. It wasn't the worst place, but definately not worth the money. I think the staff could use a few classes in courtesy and respect. By smiling and being courteous, I bet they could have made a few people happier. I would not want to go back there. I felt like I was putting them out by using thier hotel!This hotel category should have Civic Center listed also, cause I missed the reviews before our trip. I think we still would have stayed here, but would never consider staying there again...it's not worth the stress and/or hassle. Everyone is charged a safe fee, but the safe doesn't work in the rooms. Make sure you have them remove the charge!!!!Taxi to Bayside -- 12.50 (or you can bargain with the drivers for less)Taxi to Airport -- I heard was 21.00Taxi to Port --- ??

<Content>never again will a trust Days Inn Had a contract with this Days Inn to stay on Feb. 12, 2005, since June of 2004, they did not honor it. Sent us a family group of 40 to another hotel that was horrible, we even went from 20 rooms to 10 to help them out, boy were we taken advantage of to say the least. Not only that they were to provide a handicap room for my brother as per the contract, who is confined to a wheelchair, and what they gave him was a room on the 8th floor with no running water. Then they had the gall to over charge my credit card. I still can't believe how we were treated, I hope others aren't treated as badly. This hotel needs to take lessons on how to abide by their contracts. All I can say is never, never again.
