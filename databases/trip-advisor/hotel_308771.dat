<Content>Perfect place for hook ups We walked into this hotel off the street and it looked like a fun place to stay. We stayed in a standard room and it had everything one needed and it was nice and clean, although the bathroom was tiny. The hotel had great amenities even had a mini tooth brush. The water temp in the shower was a little too cold for our liking but bareable.T.V was great it had all the cable stations was very nice after all the indonesion t.v. we had been watching.We got room service, a late snack but would deffinitly not recommend the nachos a rip off! The place was very busy with heaps going on the pool/pool bar was open till 3am every nite and buffet breakfast was great, even had a omelette bar.The place was a little over the top for us although if you are a young single with a group of friends i would say this is the absolutly perfect hotel for you.

<Content>For young partiers only I stayed at the Bounty years ago and recently went back and it was still the same. No upgrades at all. Room given us was musty and stunk. We had to use candles and body spray to even tolerate it.Internet is available (for a price) in the lobby but at night there are tons of mosquitos -- i have the many bites to prove it.But it is still a great affordable place to stay for young partiers. As it was years ago.

<Content>Bad vibes, great for partiers Hotel Bounty lies around a 4min walk from Kuta beach, past the hawkers of Poppies street. There are a few that literally lean on the barrier at the front of the drive and shout motor? at you walking between the pool and reception area.This hotel is the place to be if you're young (maybe 17-28ish) looking to party with 90% Ozzies. So perhaps you really won't care about the list of negatives about the place.Breakfast is suprisingly supreme for the tone of the place- impressive quality buffet with omlette chef- of the 10 or so hotels I stayed at in different parts of Bali, including one or two $100+/night resorts, I would say no other beat the Bounty breakfast!Staff are pushy e.g. with the Friday pool party sign here now, yes.. while I'm trying to eat my breakfast! Also every time you walk past the towel hut the guy will try and get you to sign up to whatever that night's expensive but no doubt wild entertainment is. (400 000 IDR typically)Rooms were pretty meh. Air con the loudest yet most effective I've encountered. Depends how well you sleep whether this will be a problem. Bathroom was so dingy, hardly enough room between the door and the bath to get in. Also both rooms I stayed in had a nasty 'sewage' smell coming from the drains. Hot water in shower was not instant and lasted a few mins or so.Was left with sour taste in my mouth when they tried to casually con me: I went to reception to extend my stay by one night and they said come back in 15 mins while we check if we have rooms (?) When I returned they told me they only had triple available, I said no thanks and when I got back to my room the phone rang, it was reception saying actually we have checked and we got standard available... Most hotels in Bali left me feeling warm and satisfied. In honesty I left here feeling a little moody and somewhat unhappy to give business to a place so greedy. Nevertheless if your motives are the same as most people's who come to Kuta, I still suggest it could provide the best fun!

<Content>Bounty Hotel... I loved theis hotel, it had great staff, great rooms, was always neat and clean. There was always some kind of entertainment going on. I loved that it had the two pools... the back one was more quiet and great for relaxing and just hanging out. If you want pleny of fun, drinking etc hang out in the front pool.I loved that almost everything you could want... including the Circle K.... was within walking distance but i agree with the rest of the reveiws watch out for te shop directly out the front... i got done big time! i ended up paying 40 australian dollars just to get my hair in them stupid braids... they just wouldnt take no for an answer! it went from paying 10 aus to 40 after they had done the braids...very shifty!while there i recommend doing the day tours etc its great to get out and see parts of Bali that you wouldnt normally see by yourselves.Over all hotel was great... looking forward to going back there in 2010!

<Content>NIce to look, but awful to stay Very good first impression, nice facilities at first glance. After first minutes the impression turned around unfortunately.Room smelled very bad for cigarette smoke, the water was hot for only few minutes. All the warning signs that said what you should not do and how much you will be fined in this hotel are probably necessary for young teenagers etc having their parties, but made us feel like the hotel expects the worst from every guest.Hotel is very sceptical about your good attitude and very suspicious about your aims. Quite arrogant attitude, not very friendly staff.We got charged for mini-bar even we didn't take anything, but had to pay for the stuff because otherwise they wouldnt give us back our deposit 1M Rp. Internet is crazy expensive (like 20x more expensive than on the street 20m away from hotel).

<Content>Gotta love it if you want to party otherwise stay in the back rooms We stayed at the Bounty with our three teenage kids and two of their friends. Three of them had a triple share room which was very roomy and the rest of us had twin share rooms.You don't stay at the Bounty if you want 5 star accommodation as it is not a classy joint but if you come to Bali to enjoy everything it has to offer, then the bounty is the place to be. It was great to be able to walk straight out of the foyer and have everything at your fingertips....my 15 year old son had a ball at the small cafe over the road and all of the local retailers quickly get to know your name as well as who you are staying with.Anyway, back to the Bounty.....I found the staff friendly and cheerful, always able to help you out in any way. The breakfast was wonderful and the two pools were always kept immaculate.We chose to stay in rooms at the back of the complex near the rear pool to avoid the noisy late pool and 24 hour bar so there was no issues with noise. The only time we experienced any real discomfort was when a group of Year 12 schoolies arrived towards the end of our stay and spent every night running up and down the stairs and making heaps of noise.The rooms themselves were always clean and the airconditioning and facilities were quite adequate. The Friday night party was interesting, steer clear if you can't stand groups of young people drinking themselves into oblivion, otherwise it was great value, alll you can eat and drink for approx $30 per head.If you are not uptight about the classiness of your rooms, I would definately recommend the Bounty and will go back there again in a heart beat.

<Content>Bounty is for those, who want to rock I along with my wife visited Kuta in the !st week of June'08. The Hotel is very good for those, who want to enjoy the parties, good swimming pool and really want to enjoy the holidays. This is not the place for those, who want quiet holidays and do not want to be disturbed. The staff is very good and friendly. The services are very good. Overall it was a wonderful experience. In case we visit Bali again, it is for sure that we will stay at Bounty.

<Content>A Nightmare for Travellers This Hotel has nothing to talk about. The booking was made by one of our friends and hence could not say anything, as we were 6 couples. This place can at the best be described as a Hostel Accomodation for students or youngsters who are tight on spending.The rooms are awful. The linens, towels, the bathrooms are horrible. This is absolutely not the place to go with the family. The only positive is the staff. The House-keeping, the Restaurant etc. Except for that everything else is horrible.

<Content>First impressions didn't last... Firstly, when we (group of 4) first arrived, we were all more than impressed with the Bounty. There was some atmosphere, but nothing over the top and the hotel looked clean and impressive - But soon found this was not really the case. Negatives; Rooms; Average, but soon found them to be well in need of an update, interior is ok, but cupboards etc are starting to fall apart. TV remote didn't work in 1 room, both room TV's were small and had varied channels (which we didn't understand??) Shower was at best a strong trickle, washing hair wasn't worth the 20mins it took to wash out the shampoo! The rooms are in desperate need of a makeover.Staff - all are very friendly, but the constant you going to the friday/wednesday night party, i sell you a ticket?  the Where are you going for tea tonite? I take you to Jimbaran Bay? wears thin pretty quickly. I expect people on the street to hassle you, but not the staff at your hotel!! So called Party Atmosphere - We were there for a good time like most others - it soon became obvious that meant drinking for 30hours+  passing out on Sun lounges at 9am whilst everyone ate breakfast... And this also meant waking up most of the hotel if you got home later than anyone else! The friday night Party was expensive and although we didn't attend, did walk through it a few times going back and fourth and no-one seemed to be having too much fun..... Seemed pretty dull to us! The positives;The hotel exterior and grounds are good, the pools are clean and the pool bars are def the feature of the hotel - great way to spend a day or night if you are happy to stay in the water (which we were)! 24 Hour room service was a great touch, some 3am munchies were perfect and general standard of the meals was good.The LOCATION - middle of Poppies Lane in between the 2 major roads in Kuta makes it probably the most ideal spot in Kuta to be staying! All in all, it's an OK place to stay with +'s and -'s. I would recommend you be selective with your room and make it clear to staff you will contact them if you want a ticket for the party.... The location and Pool bars seem to outweight the Negatives, but this hotel has the potential to be great but just doesn't deliver in our groups opinion.

<Content>Great Hotel Stayed at Bounty 3 times (dec 04, dec 06, july 07, jan-feb 08) and at the Mecure once (next to hard rock). Compared to the Mecure I would say i prefer staying at the bounty. Bounty is central to everything - beach, clubs, great restaurants, shops etc.Yes you do get mostly younger people (17-30 y.o) staying at the hotel who are mainly there to have fun. The hotel does not play loud music at the pool 24/7, they play music til 10pm i tihnk on the 'drink til you drop' nights on friday.All the staff are so friendly and yes sometimes they are trying to get you to buy a ticket for the parties but a no thanks is all you need. I went back a year later after i visited the first time and some of the staff still remembered my name and the friends i went with last time.Rooms are nice, never had any problems with cleanliness and room cleaned very well everyday. Never had any issues with the hotel billing us for things we didn't use.Hotel food was pretty good, more expensive then the street restaurants but stil cheaper than Aus food. If your after a good meal at a good price then the best places are Rainbow (out the front of bounty), Bamboo classic and the best i reckon is Jegeg Bulan (the staff here are the best guys ever especially koming and ketut, its next to cirkle K and mini mart).Overall nice hotel with nice rooms, grounds and staff with a target customer base of 17-30 yr olds. This is the only place i bother staying at in bali unless i was going on a honeymoon, then would stay in nusa dua or tuban (east of kuta).

<Content>What a junky hotel! Obviously called the bounty as they are pirates Booked our last two days at the Bounty via a Qantas package. Obviously the guy who suggested it didn't have any idea what it is like. We went as a family. Mum, dad, 15 yo daughter  19yo neice. What a sleaze hole it turned out to be. Smelly musty rooms. Grey sheets bad airconditioning. Sleazy bali guys trying to lure the girls to all the parties they organise. Even the girls thought the place was disgusting. Party hotel or not its a heap of junk that has seen its day. Good on all you young people who go there to get drunk and ripped off (WHY???). Nothing against anyone having a bit of fun but really there are so many other beautiful places to go that are still cheap and Bali is so much more than parties and boozing. We actually left our gear in the room and booked somewhere else to stay. Went back on the last day as we had late checkout before flying home. Imagine our surprise at the $80.00 charges for drinks/food ( several cocktails, burger, chips and steak sandwich) and minibar charge (which we didnt use).The Bounty is a total rip off and we found the check in staff very unfriendly for the beautiful balinese. Especially when we pointed out during checkout we had not used anything in the minibar. They would not have it and insisted we pay. On our way to the airport the driver we used told of many people he has come across who on checking out of the Bounty complain at the charges/service. Beware!!! I will say the general staff around the hotel were lovely. Oh by the way you know your in a sleazy hotel when part of the mini bar inclusions is condoms and hangover Juice. ENJOY

<Content>The Bounty both good and bad The bounty was a really nice hotel and we had no problems with the cleanliness or service. All of the Hotel employees were very nice, the only thing somewhat annoying is the fact they are always trying to sell something. Maybe it was the fact we were there around Christmas time and there were a lot of events going on, but it was still somewhat bothersome to be asked if we want to attend the Snow Party every time we stepped out of the room. We had a room right next to the pool, the view was nice but the music was pretty lame, I will never look at Twisted Sister the same after having to listen to their christmas album for 3 days straight, it sucked! If you want to get away from the loud music at the main pool request a room at the back, if you want to be right in the middle of all the action the front near the main pool is perfect. The Free breakfast was good, and the omlets were awesome!! We also met some cool australian people, which seem to be the majority of the people that stay at the bounty. It only about a 5 minute walk to the beach, and 5 minute walk from all of the clubs, so its in a good location. Overall it was a pretty fun experience.

<Content>If you're young and love to party.... Well, for the price...this is a good hotel in a good location. Walking distance to the strip where all the clubs and restaurants are...and also walking distance to the beach. You'll see mostly western people here...and they do have parties every night i was there.If you ask them to put you in the quiet area, you will be assigned a room on the far end of the hotel...there are 2 pool area...the front and the back...the back one is where it is quiet. I had no problems with noise when i was there. Most of the party happens in the front area.The rooms are what you can expect from a 2 star hotel...ive never seen a TV that small, and the AC was barely keeping the heat bearable. There are NO security box in the room..so you have to use the front desk security box. The bed was comfy and the bathroom was bare minimum. I had problems with the shower since it barely had any water pressure on it...or sprayed so little water, it took me 2x as long to take a shower. I was on the 3rd floor..and there were no elevators...so if you dont like walking up the steps..ask for a lower floor. I dont think you gain anything from being higher...there are no views to be seen.The breakfast... they have fried rice and noodles everyday... there's a basic omelette bar...the only meat in the buffet is either bacon or sausage...there's fruits, and some muffins and some western baked goods. OJ, and coffee. Not bad for the what it is but nothing special.They have a internet area...about 4 computers...not bad. I didnt check if they had spa service... in general, the place is presentable and a good value. As far as booking...id recommend booking thru the internet... that is where you will find the best deals. We thought that we should just book 2 nights and wait and see...and just book as we go... it turned out to be a mistake...the prices that were quoted to us were about 10%-20% higher.

<Content>The best holiday ever I had the best time staying at the bounty. Clean, spacious rooms (we stayed in triple share) fantastic staff, beautiful pools open to all hours of the night. As young 20 something year olds my frineds and I had the best three weeks of our lives. Would highly recommend it to people who want to party and meet lots of new people. Not specifically classed as a 'luxury' resort but it was luxury enough for me (and im very picky) and sooooo much fun! I can't wait to go back. It was heaven. Excellent internet service open 24 hours. I cannot recommend it highly enough to those wanting to party.Not recommended to people wanting a quiet holiday or families with little kids, although there were several families there who were having a good time. Is quite noisy tho, particularly at night.

<Content>A living nightmare We booked the hotel as we were on Kuta last year saw it and thought looks ok pretty central. A big mistake. The hotel is aimed at 18 to 21 year who just want to go out and drink drink drink, The music plays at full volume from 10am till 5am everyday with screaming 'kids' who no respect whatso ever for anyone else in the hotel. Our first night we had to get the hotel to come and change all the bedding as this has had not been changed due to blood been on the sheets, We had people vomitting right outside out room several nights running and to top it all off ther security is shocking we had one evening where someone tried to break into our room at 4am. The hotel staff were rude and when we complained about things we recieved no apologises what so ever. If your interested in a fully on party holiday then this is the hotel for you if your to relax i would advise you to stay well away.

<Content>Exceptional - friendly and fun! We stayed here in Oct 2002, 2003, and 2004. We were here when the bombs went off and the Bounty became a makeshift triage area. This is when you find out the true calibre of a hotel  its staff. If it was not for the management  staff many more would have died. The service here is friendly and punctual with a general party type atmosphere that tends to lend itself to a younger crowd, but do not let that put you off, you will have a great time here no matter what your age.Look out for William, he will look after you totally.

<Content>Teenagers Heaven=Adults HELL Stayed at the Bounty for 3 nights, coming from East Timor. Chose the hotel after reading many positive reviews in travel forums. Big mistake. Loud Pump up the volume 80's house crappy music 24h/7 at the bar, day and night, no truce. Hungover teenagers hanging out at the pool, mostly men. Average bedroom with lots of mosquitoes and Ibis inspired interor design. Service was also bad, I got ripped off on the rate. Location is also terrible, in the middle of a labirynth of narrow streets with the skankyest Kuta style shops.Endless better options in Kuta for the 50 bucks they ask.

<Content>Great Fun at the Bounty! The Bounty is known for its party atmosphere, and I am happy to say that it lived up to the image.We stayed there 5 nights and did not miss one night in the 24hour pool bar where music is continually pumping till the wee hours of the morning. Every guest in the hotel, armed with cocktail in hand is out for a good time and it鈥檚 a great place to meet people and make friends. We stayed in one of the apartments which is at the back of the grounds, rooms were nice and they had a huge range of pay TV channels (which is important when nursing that hangover!) Although at the back of the resort, you cannot escape the noise from the pool, this hotel is defiantly not for those who want early nights. Bounty is right in the heart of Kuta on Poppies II with shops right out the front and a stroll to some good restaurants.All in all, I highly recommend Bounty Hotel for people wanting a good time and I hope to return in the near future!

<Content>Great hotel with all the necessary comforts The bounty Hotel was a great place to stay in terms of facilities, amenities and service. The staff was friendly and helpful, the hotel grounds are clean and pretty, especially around the pools. The location is perfect, two minutes to the beach and to legian street, away from all the traffic and chaos, but close enough to all the bars, restaurants and cafes.While there were people of all age groups at this hotel, they were mostly between ages 18 - 25 , and it seems the hotel caters to this age group as well. The friday night BBQ had drinking competitions, cheezy dancers and loads of drunk teenagers who couldnt handle their liquor. It was quite entertaining but a tad irritiating when they would get loud and obnoxious. The good thing is that they have two pools, and the pool at the back is much quieter for those who want to relax.Overall, the hotel itself was great. I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Watch the shop across the road I stayed at the Bounty in August 06. Had a great time. The Friday night Aussie BBQ was good fun. I hit my head numerous times when walking into the bar area (6 foot 2) but apart from that i loved the bar. A word of warning, watch the shops across the road. I got sucked in there and before I kn ew it was getting a pedicure and manicure (not a good look for a bloke) and my hair was spiked using special gel (super glue) and this all cost me about $10 aust. It is a good place and the staff are excellent.

<Content>Party Haven I went and stayed at the Bounty in August. I am a Travel Agent and had heard the Bounty was good for younger people and popular with Auzzies. I was travelling on my own so wanted to meet people. Not only did I meet heaps of great people, the staff were fantastic, even addressing me by my name. I would definatly recommend this property if you are wanting to have a good time and let your hair down.The room was a good size and clean and tidy.The swim up pool bar was fantastic and always had people around.Definatly worth a look.

<Content>loved the location ! First time found bounty hotel it was appeared on the banner indise the Paddy's Pub, so the next visit to Bali I tried to spent few nights there.Wow. what a great hotel and awesome for a 3 start hotel, rooms are clean, bathrooms OK, breakfast OK, but what a freindly staff and it is very near to everything, to Kuta beach and to Legian, all within 5 minutes walk..I liked the vibrant and the ppl staying there, all are young so I find, as I was 20, all ppl as my age, teenagers and to 20 sumthing .. Mainly guests stayed there were Aussie's and few British ... so as Indonesian (perhaps the only one) I really liked the atmophere .. as I love eye candying western guys lol

<Content>Only for the young! What a shock! We stayed at the Bounty in 2003 and it was great, quite quiet with a good mixture of families, couples and youngsters.We returned this month and booked in only to find it was like an 18 - 30s hotel full of drunken teenagers who were partying hard well into the early hours and starting again before we'd even got up for breakfast!!! We got no sleep and didn't enjoy our time there. I would say that if you were young and single and want to party you'll love it. I'm only 27 but found it way too crazy. We moved to the sister hotel just up the road, The Hotel Barong, which was great so if you're not up for a 'wild time' I'd find somewhere other than the Bounty.

<Content>Loved the Bounty it was great, We are booked to go back This is the place for the young at heart, I am 25 and my friend is 33 and we had a ball, never a dull moment, We loved the 24hr pool swim up bar, We would get up around 2.00pm, have lunch, swim and start drinking around 3-4pm in the pool bar, we met heaps of nice people, our rooms were very very clean, we have been to bali 4 times before and was great.... Room service was very very propmt.... This hotel would not suit kids... We went to Bali in October 2004 for 7 nights / 8 days and stayed at the Bakasari - It was bloody awful, we returned to Bali in March 2005 for 10 nights / 11 days and stayed at the Bounty and it was awesome, on our return we booked and now are going again on the 30th October and staying at the bounty again.... The Breakfast at the bounty was awesome, Not many hotels have buffet breakfast from 7am - 11pm, most are 6am to 10am...., we made it to breakfast only a few times as we would be out all night... But we never went to dinner on our own, we would go with other guests from our hotel and we now have great friends all over the world... We reccomend to all....

<Content>no where else but the bounty for me myself and my friends stayed at the bounty hotel for 3 weeks and have just returned, after being in bali 3 times at different hotels, i would never stay anywhere else but the bounty, it has everything at your fingertips, the staff are very friendly and the atmosphere great, i love the fact it is so central to everything. we are returning next year and would not consider anywhere else but the bounty. upon booking we requested poolside rooms, on arrival were put on top floor with no view, within 24 hours we were poolside so if you are not happy with your room just ask as the staff are very helpful.

<Content>Young and Fun! I have stayed at the Bounty 3 times now with my partner. I recommend this hotel if you are a partier as the atmosphere at the Bounty is very young and vibrant. The staff are extremely friendly, the rooms are ok, always clean but not the best amenities. This hotel is also a real 'Aussie' place to be and is mainly australian tourists that stay here. The drinks and food are quite cheap and for a standard room it is around $50AU for 2 people. Great location, close to all shopping and not fair from all great restaurants. All in all, great hotel and a fun great place to be - recommended.
