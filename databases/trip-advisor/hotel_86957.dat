<Content>Great upgrade! Wonderful Aloha service at checkin, Front Desk agent Jean was very accomodating and upgraded to ocean view suite. The hotel was obviously not full and the larger, nicer room was appreciated. The fitness center is one of the best I've seen in any hotel.

<Content>Work, don't play here Perfectly serviceable hotel for my needs (work). I cannot imagine staying here on vacation, but then again, I'm not into Waikiki Resortland so I wouldn't want to stay anywhere in the vicinity. Big plus is its location - it's fairly easy access to H1 and just around the corner from Ala Moana/Nimitz. For those who need to be near a mall, Ala Moana mall is right next door and is accessible through a second floor bridge. It's easy to get to Ala Moana park, too.The room is clean and contemporary, but teeny tiny. The bed linens are sanitized according to a little sign under the glass top of the bedside table - yeah, I wasn't too worried in a place like this (or am I just being naive?). The bathroom is also quite small but clean. I did have to request a change of the shower curtain liner, as the first one just reeked of mildew and I couldn't take it any more. Oh, and the rooms aren't Wifi, which I *hate.* The lobby is apparently wired for it, but I just don't see the point.The pool area is pleasant, although traffic noise is inescapable. Liked the workout room. There's a club (???) in the lobby that I did not even begin to think to check out. Ditto the restaurants. All of the staff were perfectly friendly and responsive.I'd stay here again for business, but never for vacation.

<Content>Not Bad You won't confuse this hotel for a Hyatt or Hilton, but it's a great value for being pretty much right in the middle of Honolulu. The staff is friendly and the location is pretty great. It's also a lot better than many of the shady non-resort places in Waikiki.Good: It's a great value, and is attached (sort of) to an enormous shopping and dining complex. There's trolley service to Waikiki for $2 each way, which beats the pants off trying to find parking. Ala Moana Beach Park is right across the street.Our room was pretty well equipped, and came with a refrigerator and microwave. Parking is $15 a night (as of September 2008) in the hotel garage - lower than most places in town.Bad: The parking garage that connects the hotel to the shopping mall can be kind of shady at night. My wife and I were approach by vagrants several times.The walk to Waikiki is a little bit longer than it looks on a map - it was about a 30 minute walk for two reasonably in-shape people. But, if you aren't absolutely set on staying in Waikiki it's not that big a deal and (as above) there is a trolley service.Pool is tiny with not much shade. The rooms (at least in the Kona tower) are also a little on the small side. They're fine for two people but any more than that would probably begin to get uncomfortable.No room in the hotel has a really stunning view (the main tower faces the road), so get whatever's cheapest.

<Content>Good location for shopping We stayed at this hotel for only one night and had a pleasant stay. The hotel room was nicely appointed (note: the room was small, but that didn't detract from the stay); the hotel has been renovated nicely. It's in a great location for shopping-- within walking distance to the Ala Moana Shopping Center. It's also easily accessible from the airport. Parking costs extra. The fitness center was nice and had plenty of workout options (aerobic machines and weights). There's also a really nice pool. Customer service was quite good at this hotel. We would stay here again.

<Content>rock hard beds!!! Never again Bad Beds!!!/ Pretty hotel with nice elevators that worked, the view was great from the 16th floor. BUTthe rooms were small and the beds were harder than in the stone age! I have stayed in rooms in 3rd world countries for $50 a night that had much nicer and newer mattresses. These must have been from the 70's!the Mgt. was called and housekeeping brought another mattress pad. wow!!I had to take off the bedspread double it and put it under the pad. still not much better, all for $175. a night I will not stay here again. Aqua Equus down the street has much nicer rooms with new pillowtop mattresses and flatscreen TVS, for under $100 a night if you need to be by the Marina.

<Content>Mixed Feelings About Ala Moana I go to Honolulu each year to present workshops, so I'm not a typical tourist. Ala Moana caught my eye because it offered WiFi, had some in-room facilities such as microwave and fridge, and was very close to the convention center.The facility was clean and quiet, but with limited amenities in terms of regular restaurant hours, bar hours and so on. This inconsistency is difficult for a person who is working and comes back to the room tired and wanting something more substantial than a microwaved meal.The Ala Moana shopping mall is right next door, which does offer a lot of restaurants and the like, but it's still a walk, and the hours are limited as well. The neighborhood behind Ala Moana is a mix of storefront restaurants, adult entertainment venues, and just not all that savory, particularly for families or women on their own.The location is what will upset most people that visit Ala Moana, particularly if they're expecting to be on the beach. There's a lovely pool, and I had a great lanai with an impressive view. The WiFi worked fine, and most of the staff was very friendly and as helpful as they could be despite the limited amenities.

<Content>Great visit! My husband was in Honolulu for work and was advised to stay here by a coworker. I joined him at the end of his stay here (three nights). The room was very nice and the lanai was wonderful. Location was excellent - close to shopping and dining. The tour desk was always willing to help when looking for places to eat and how to get to destinations (Dole Plantation). The pool area is beautiful and we were lucky enough to have a room that faced the ocean - a definite bonus once you look past the Macy's parking lot. Free internet was good (reasonably high speed - about 100K/s at night) and parking was convenient (prepaid was $12/day parkade - up to $32/day if you just pay as you visit). When husband arrived, he had two double room and requested a change to king, which they accomodated. He thought it was a larger, nicer room for the same price! Overall, would recommend. We debated changing hotels (as we'd already booked at another location for our vacation time) since we liked this one so much.

<Content>Not sure to come back The hotel is convenient located close to Convention Center, but the area is not nice. The only nice place are the Hard Rock Cafe' and a huge mall on the opposite corner.The hotel is also far from Waikiki, and a little overpriced. Our room was very little and noisy. But clean.Also, they charge your car $15 per night for parking.We don't think we come there again. Maybe you can find better.

<Content>Business Centric Hotel - No Surprises Make no mistake, this hotel is designed for business travellers, not tourists looking for a beach location.The room was clean and quiet, the bed was comfortable, the internet connection worked, and the staff was professional. No surprises at this location. Parking was $18 (slightly higher than a Waikiki hotel I stayed at on the same trip). There was a laundry facility but I didn't use it. The hotel is about 5-8 minutes on foot to the shopping mall, depending on how fast you walk.Getting to the main part of Waikiki requires transportation, especially if you are carrying gear. There is a beach within walking distance but it's not as nice.If you're looking for a tourist centric hotel, with a short walk to the beach and a fawning staff, you're not going to find it here. But you can be certain that the rooms will be clean, the air conditioning will work, and there won't be a mildew smell (which many Waikiki hotels have).Discounted rates are very reasonable.

<Content>excellent hotel After a long flight from Pennsylvania to Hawaii, we were pleased with the quality of this hotel. Free Internet service in the rooms was a huge plus as we were able to tell family  friends that we made it safely. Nice pool. Large, clean room. Excellent service. Hotel stored our bags for the day (for a fee of course) and had no trouble finding htem once we returned. Cabs readily available. Reception gave good directions for taking bus to see Pearl Harbor.

<Content>Just okay We stayed here for a night before a wedding that we were attending in the northern part of the island. It was fine for what it was. Check-in also took a long time - there were only two people working at the reception (though there were spaces for 8) but it went smoothly once we got to the front. The rooms were very small - barely enough room for us to lay our suitcases down and to still be able to walk around the room. This meant it was also crowded when we were trying to get ready in the morning. We also booked a mountain-view which we were barely able to see through the other hotels that bordered ours. On a happier note, the sheets/bed were very comfortable and its location next to the Ala Moana mall was greatly appreciated when we arrived and were very hungry!! It was late so not much else was open, but we did enjoy a great meal at one of the mall restaurants. The cost of the breakfast buffet was a bit outrageous. Be warned - its $16.99 per person. This is not posted anywhere so make sure you are willing to spend this much before you sit down! We found out the hard way. Since parking was $15 for 24 hours, who would have guessed that it was more than that for one of us to eat? Yikes!

<Content>Beware..... While on our trip in Oahu, my family and I had a good stay at this hotel so we thought...But, when we arrived home I received a $600 charge on my credit card. When I contacted the hotel about the charge, the assistant manager said that the carpet in the room we stayed in was damaged with cigarette burns, which is bizarre since none of us smoke. When I spoke to the General Manager later that day, he told me that he did not know what the burns were from but were large scorch marks...so now I have been told two different things. I had him email me the pictures, which showed four small round stains that my children remembered seeing when we arrived and thought were dirt marks. We can't believe that they are charging us $600 for their dirty carpets. BEWARE!!!! Have a hotel employee do a walk through when you check in so you are not slapped with a bogus charge. We're never staying there again.

<Content>Choose carefully--this hotel may or may not be for you! 鈥?We stayed at the Ala Moana for our two nights in Honolulu because my first night there was already paid for by the university and it seemed like a lot of trouble to change hotels for just one night. In retrospect, I can鈥檛 decide if I鈥檓 sorry about that or not. We found the hotel to be adequate overall, but it鈥檚 certainly nothing we would have chosen for ourselves. The location next to the Ala Moana Shopping Center is ideal for those who want to shop, and it was about a 15 minute amble to the water鈥檚 edge of the Ala Moana Park. Our room, #757 in the Kona Tower, was tiny but nicely appointed with a queen bed, pull-out sofa, and a flat screen TV which we never turned on. Our immediate view was of the parking garage for the mall, with the marina and then the ocean beyond that. There was a sliding glass door but no balcony鈥攅xcuse me, lanai鈥攖o speak of. The temperature control was an old-fashioned variety so that the fan could be hot or cold, on or off, and it was always humid in the room. We either froze with the fan on all night or suffocated with it off. By the time we checked out any clothing that had been left out in the room was noticeably damp. The complimentary high-speed internet was a joke. The one time we were able to get a connection, it took entire minutes to load the homepage. We waited so long for our email to download that we left it while we went to dinner but the connection timed out before we returned. Wi-Fi was available, but for a charge! In a business/convention hotel! Based on the rate we paid our last night, $149/night plus taxes, I鈥檇 say this place was an okay value.

<Content>Nice hotel but....... We found a 2 bedroom condo high atop the Ala Moana and spent a week there last month. Since we stayed in a condo this review will be on the Hotel itself not the rooms.Our main purpose in going to Hawaii was fun on the beach  in the ocean.If that's your purpose this is NOT the best hotel for you. The beach at ALA Moana Park is QUITE a hike  then there are very few waves. It was too calm for us. We ended up taking a cab down to Waikiki when we were ready to swim each day.It is connected to the Ala Moana mall which made shopping  eating very convenient. The staff at the hotel was very friendly. The elevators seemed to move fairly quickly so there was never much of a wait for one. Looks like they have done a recent renovation there so the lobby  hallways appeared nice not worn at all.So bottom line if you are there for meetings at the Convention Center this hotel should do you just fine. If you are interested in fun in the sun or nightlife move on down to Waikiki.

<Content>Updated hotel in shopping end of Waikiki Great hotel recently refurbished in Waikiki Tower. We were upgraded to a junior suite which was very swish. This was a privately owned condo the hotel sells off and rents.It had a big kitchen but no pots/pans//cutlery to use so assume this was all in a locked cabinet. For two nights we did not need them anyway.Great view of city lights at night and water/marina in the day. Very quiet at nigt due to good soundproofing.King bed was loveley and we had 2 balconies. Right next door to Ala Moana shopping centre with access via the hotel that was convenient. Also close to Ward centre and other shops around if you are prepared to walk. great hotel would stay again

<Content>not great I wasn't a huge fan of this place. Late at night, when I checked in, the lobby was horrendously lit with fluorescent lights and bad music was blaring from the nightclub just off reception...it was a pretty disconcerting way to be greeted after travelling for 12 hours. As well, the people I dealt with when I checked in were completely vacant and focused more on each other than on dealing with me...very bizarre...and when I went back down with all my stuff because the key wasn't working, they didn't say anything to me, but just joked to one another, I've been having some trouble making keys today. No sorry about that or anything. I don't much care about stuff like this, usually, but I was pretty irritated.I found it little dingy, in parts - the carpets in the hallway and the room are really stained, as was the little loveseat in my room. Pretty gross. Otherwise, the room was fine. Functional. What I found strange was the lack of amenities for such an enormous hotel. There was not a crumb of food to be found when I arrived there at 11pm on a Sunday night. I hadn't eaten for way too long, and was starving - but was directed to the 7-11. Weird. I also find it odd that in such a large hotel, there's no coffee/pastries place...there's nowhere to go to just grab a quick coffee/tea and pastry, for instance - you have to do the whole sit-down breakfast buffet. Overall, I was pretty underwhelmed.

<Content>Good for Business Travelers and Shoppers not Families This is probably a great hotel for business and wonderful if you're a shopper but this is not a great family hotel. We were visiting family and they selected the hotel, I would have picked something else. The view out to the city and beach was nice. There are no activities per se at the hotel and the pool is just a regular roof top pool that is not little kid friendly. The proximity to the Ala Moana shopping center is great. It is near Ala Moana beach park (which is a great and very calm beach) but it is about a 15 minute walk over there. The service was slow at times and snappy at others. Between the king bed, fold out couch and crib we were very cramped. The vanity is in the bathroom itself (which is a bit small) so showering and getting everyone ready at the same time was a challenge. While the hotel was recently renovated and very modern the a/c unit was one of the old fashioned kind where it is either freezing or off. Plus, there is no comforter (just a very, very thin coverlet) so between 2 sheets and a light blanket it was at times uncomfortable. There is a fridge but we were missing the microwave. The hotel was a bit hit or miss. The location can't be beat for business travelers or ardent shoppers but it just wasn't the hotel for us.

<Content>poor accomodations As a native of Hawaii ...I hate to report what awful accomodations this hotel has... not to mention their lack of aloha or simple customer service..This room was like staying in a dorm..the video on the website viewing the room is a joke and thank goodness we were only staying there for one night ..I can't imagine where real travelers would put their luggage or anything they bought during their stay. It makes me laugh when people in the business of providing service don't have any and then when their company closes or they lose their jobs they don't think its their fault....Outrigger management should re-evaluate the purchase of this property...Highly not recommended

<Content>Our 3 Weeks In Paradise by Hula girl from Adelaide, South Australia On our third trip to Hawaii, we booked our hotel room directly via condo owner (vrbo). Staying on the 23rd floor, we experienced amazing views with rainbows on the horizon every day! As you step inside the hotel lobby, you are presented with an air of grandeur. Minimal waiting time for lifts and wide hallways gives a pleasant spacious ambience. Our room was compact, but for very clean and comfortable. We were travelling with our 20 year old daughter, and with all our shopping, still managed to enjoy our room. Loved having breakfast on the generous lanai. Never needed to draw the curtains, so experienced magnificent views morning and evening. The pool was closed for renovation during most of our stay, but was finished a few days before leaving. Beautiful renovations and were surprised how large and well equipped the pool area was. The facilities are absolutely fabulous, with state of the art gymnasium, sauna and steam room. Location is great, just take the walkway from the 2nd floor to the Ala Moana Centre for great shopping, restaurants (make sure you go to Californian Pizza Kitchen  Bubba Gumps) department stores, supermarkets. A short bus ride or walk into Waikiki. Make sure you go to Aarons on the 36th floor to enjoy 360 degree views of Waikiki and Honolulu. This was our 3rd trip; have stayed in other hotels in Kuhio Avenue, paid alot more for sub standard accommodation. For the smart traveller, Ala Moana Condo is second to none. We can't wait to return!

<Content>Hotel OK - Dining a big minus The hotel lobby and staff are above average. Stayed one night and toilet backed up at 2AM (without using it). Plumber responded quickly, but couldn't fix it. Had to change rooms at 2AM. Stayed another week at different time and room cleaning was missed one day. Called customer service and was told he would call back after talking to the General Manager. I am still waiting for the phone call.There are two restaurants in the hotel a Chinese and a Japanese. They also have a limited breakfast buffet that is horribly overpriced. No where to get a cup of coffee or a sandwich. It is about a 15 minute walk to the Alamona Center where there is everything including a food court with many, many choices.I would think that a hotel of this size should have more eating choices. Oh, no room service, period.

<Content>Good if you're on a budget It's a couple blocks inland, but within 15-20 minute walking distance to all the action at Waikiki beach if you're looking for a Hawaii vacation without all the hotel cost, and don't mind a small hike. The rooms are clean and modern, although a little small. It's also next to a large mall. I had no complaints, I enjoyed my stay and the staff were helpful.

<Content>wonderful hotel We travelled from Barcelona, Spain with my husband and our 5-years-old daugter , and we stayed in a condo rented via www.rbo.com, our very confortable condo(great bed and matress), full kitchen, lovely livingroom Breakfast at Plantation cafe was not too much good but the staff was very kind. We had dinner at Aaron's Top on the 34 th floor and it was not too much expensive, and it was the only meal I really enjoyed in 21 days...(I missed a lot Spanish food, salads, more vegetables, ). On the 13th floor there is a laundrette, very convenient for a long trip if you don't want travel with lots of suitcases.....If a return to Hawaii some day I'll stay again in Ala Moana Hotel.

<Content>Okay for the $ I travel to Honolulu several times a year on business. I chose this hotel after a pretty unpleasant experience at the Doubletree Alana. The Ala Moana looked about as nice and was significantly less expensive. Also, the location offers very easy accesss to the Ala Moana shopping center, Waikiki, and downtown.Overall, I consider the Ala Moana a solid three star. It is moderately nice and clean for a very reasonable price. The lobby is quite nice and the front desk staff was helpful. The rooms are basic but sufficient. My room had a flat screen TV and a balcony overlooking the pool and sundeck. The ocean was just visible through the other buildings. Word of warning, however - the hotel is located just off of a very busy street and the noise makes the balcony less relaxing than you might expect.As other people have mentioned, the restaurant situation leaves a lot to be desired. They do not offer room service, and the restaurant options are pretty limited. I came back from the mall at about 9:30 and there was nothing open except the high-end restaurant, which didn't fit with my jeans and sneakers attire. The mall is very convient though, and they have a large food court with lots of Asian options, as well as a few corporate sit down restaurants. There is a ramp connecting the hotel to the mall, so it is very easy to get back and forth.The room was clean enough, but it wasn't great. I had tiny ants running around, a weird shiny splatter of something on the bathroom floor that stayed there my whole stay, and a few suspicious spots on the throw pillow. Nothing too horrible, but not the best.Overall, the selling points for me were the location and the price. It would not be my choice for a vacation due to the lack of restaurants and beachfront, but it's not a bad choice for business or shopping.

<Content>Good choice if you're on a diet The hotel is a Honolulu landmark. It's lobby is open and welcoming. The staff is friendly. The food service is appalling!!No room service. Breakfast is limited to a breakfast buffet and closes at 10:00 am. If you want a cup of coffee after that time, you are directed to the adjacent mall. Lunch is limited to a very small selection by the pool or a Chinese Restaurant. If you want a drink, again you are limited to the pool bar or the Lobby Lounge which doesn't open until 5:00 pm. Although there is a bandstand in the lobby lounge, no music was provided on a Saturday evening. Not surprisingly, the lounge was dead. My room was clean but small. The size was underscored by the over abundence of furniture. In addition to the king sized bed and the normal desk/bureau, there was a small couch, a chair and a coffee table. It was virturally impossible to walk in the room without bumping into something.

<Content>Nice, clean and good price hotel Our family stayed in the hotel for 8 days. We booked online for two queen beds in Kona, but when we checked in, the desired configuration was not available. So we were upgraded to Waikiki tower with extra $20/night. The room was small, but very clean. It was conveniently located and close to Waikiki, but with a much lower price. The shopping mall was very close, so we could eat in the food court, which has a good choice of Asian food (this was a plus for us). I enjoyed shopping every night after the dinner. This hotel is a good choice if you decide that you will tour Oahu a lot instead of staying on the beach for all the vacation. Since it was our first time and we drove to different places for the first few days, it worked out very well.

<Content>Rent Condohotel from Owner We found the Ala Moana on vacationrentals.com (listing #32165). You can rent directly from the hotel website at a higher price and with typical hotel services. We rented direct from the owner and found it an incredible value for our one week stay.The room was exactly as advertised, clean and up-to-date decor. The owner was very easy to deal with and the entire transaction was seamless. In addition to the owner's rate, you must also pay the hotel a $30 check-in fee and $10/day resort fee for use of the amenities (pool, gym etc). We ended up not using these facilities but were still pleased with the value. The unit is on the 15th floor with beautiful citylights view. From the furnished balcony, there is a view to the ocean.The location is fantastic unless you really want to be on the beach and pay beach prices. The hotel is at the western end of Waikiki and next to the Convention Center and Ala Moana Mall, a huge shopping mall. We used public transit to get around the island and found it wonderful and inexpensive ($1.00 for seniors, $2.00 otherwise) to go anywhere on the island! Bus stops are at the mall and schedules are available at the mall information center on the lower floor.We highly recommend this hotel and this condo in particular..

<Content>Great for shopping! At first glance, this hotel looks very nice. Big reception area and a nice bar. But the room was average with a small balcony. We had our room in the 32th. floor! If you are afraid of heights ask for a room further down when booking. There are 6 elevators and it was never a problem getting up and down. As we didn't have breakfast in our rate, we only tried the breakfast once, at mothers day. It was like a dinner! Very nice, but very expensive. The other days we went to Starbucks at Ala Moana Shopping-center.Speaking about Ala Moana Shopping-center. It was HUGE, and I think it's the biggest shopping-center at Oahu. All the top-designers were there. At the top floor there is a VERY nice bar, with fantastic view over the city. We had some small snacks there too, and it was delicious. We tried the Japanese restaurant at ground floor. Nice, but i have eaten better Japanese food! I would suggest to go to Shokudo for fantastic Japanese food, just behind the hotel.We were at Ala Moana for a conference and we had the banquette there. It was not worth the money.... The hotel is in the outskirts of the city-center, but it's easy to take the free shuttle bus, which are going to/from the shopping-centers. If you want to stay at a more luxurious hotel, I would suggest wither Hilton or Sheraton which are both at Waikiki beach.

<Content>This is not a hotel! Be careful of sleazy condo owners! This is not a hotel so do not expect any amenities or service. Rented directly from owners (Williams) and they supposedly gave us a great deal. Found out the pool was closed and they refused to refund stay although other owners did at that same time. Hotel clerks didn't care about guests or your perception of them. They said they didn't care if guests thought bad of them. Rooms are extremely small (DD  K). The DD we stayed in had the vacuum cleaner in the closet - thereby taking up storage space, the dirty mop was under the bathroom counter with the can of ajax. There was 1 1/2 rolls of tp for a 5 night stay and towels did not match. It was obvious that the bed spread had not been cleaned in years, it was reaking of odor. The hotel charges $10/day resort fee to use the closed pool and parking is extremely difficult - you're often instructed to double park somewhere that you're not blocking someone. The only good thing about this place was it was connected to Ala Moana Mall. I would never recommend this place due to the non-existant service.

<Content>Pure Comfort The Ala Moana Hotel provides the comfort and relaxation you look for on a trip to Hawaii. The front desk staff was condial and prompt. The hotel and rooms were clean and bright. I particularly recommend the pool and workout rooms. The restaurant on the roof, Aaron's, has spectacular views. The location is about a 30 minute walk to the heart of Waikiki, is right across from a the Ala Moana Beach Park (great for jogging), and has it's own entrance to the mall for end of day shopping. A wonderful way to see Honolulu.

<Content>A shopping mall with a hotel attached The hotel is a Marriott clone, but half the price of the Honolulu Marriot, which is not unreasonable, since the rooms are about half the size. Visitors should be warned that, though rooms with two double beds are advertised, and we booked just such accommodation - months ahead - when we checked in we received a room with one double bed and a sofa that could be converted into a double bed. The management was not interested in discussing the matter. When this sofa was so extended, there was practically no floor space left.However, both the Chinese restaurant and breakfast cafe serve good food, the Ala Moana shopping mall can be reached without going near a street, and the room was newly decorated. I would describe it as cheap and cheerful.

<Content>Tiny rooms, no closet or drawer space, over-priced Seriously, stay away from the ala Moana. My room had a microscopic closet, so small I could not put my suitcase inside.... a problem since the room is designed such that there is almost NO floor space. Small drawers as well with SIX phone books jammed into them. Flies in the room, broken A/C, and I really don't care to speculate on just what the stains on the bedspread and chairs are. Management unresponsive. Also no pool and no room service. So I can't figure out who this hotel thinks they cater to. Vacationers nee d a pool and business travelers need to hang up their clothes and get a meal while they work..

<Content>An excellent alternative to Waikiki We just returned from a three night stay at the Ala Moana and had an excellent experience. It's a great alternative if you don't want to stay in the overpriced, hustle and bustle of Waikiki Beach - but it's still within a reasonable walking distance (about 1 mile; we're not afraid of a little walking). Yes, there is still lots of traffic but what do you expect when you're in downtown Honolulu? There are two towers here, the Waikiki and the Kona. The Waikiki by far is the better choice and offers the best views. We were upgraded to an ocean front suite on the 32nd floor and it was beautiful. The staff were helpful and the self-parking is reasonable by Honolulu standards at only $15/day. Yes, the pool was closed but that didn't bother us with the beautiful Ala Moana Beach Park within a couple of blocks. There was a business center downstairs and a few shops. Lots of shopping and restaurants next door at the Ala Moana shopping mall. It has great access to get to/from the airport and all points west and north of Honolulu. All in all, we would highly recommend it.

<Content>worst hotel in honolulu What a terrible hotel. It took 2 hours after our luggages were delivered after we checked in. The pool was closed for renovation for the month of January and there was no room service. It is so far from Waikiki and the interesting area of Honolulu. The park next to the hotel is so unsafe. It feels like staying in the slum area.It was marketed as a 4 star hotel but it is more like a 2 star motel.I will not stay there again.

<Content>Unit 84954 VRBO Great Value We stayed in unit 84954 and booked it via VRBO site. This is a newly renovated unit and it is excellent in every aspect. The owner Helen is very helpful and she has thought of every little need one could want. She has water in the fridge a bottle of wine some candies and cookies etc. She thinks of everything. She calls to check on the stay very service oriented. Just Great thanks very much HelenWe would stay there again and would recomend this to anyone.The only downside is it is on the 8th floor and the view really is of the parking lot of the shopping center next door. This is the only small negative but this is a great location (away from the main part of beach) The place is very very clean and new.All in all this is a great unit at a great price.

<Content>Average Hotel Stayed 4 nights Jan 2008.Asked for an Ocean View Suite got a mountain view, steeply discounted however....probably due to the fact that the pool was under construction and the room service was cancelled for the entire length of my stay....Oh well..........I was hoping for an awesome stay after reading some good reviews here, instead this turned out to be very average. Staff was not too interested in helping us out with anything, seemed annoyed most of the time. Bell-hop tried to cancel a shuttle that I reserved to give to another guest (who probably tipped more than me). I had to call BS on that deal...Not unlike staying in a Mexico resort, lots of hustling, strip clubs right behind the hotel, crack-heads in park across from the mall. Great place......NOT...Just venting...Next time we're heading to Kona, Honolulu is for suckers. The End.

<Content>Ala Moana Hotel a wonderful vacation location My friend and I recently stayed in Oahu. The Ala Moana Hotel proved to be a wonderful spot for a relaxing vacation. The room was well appointed with a comfortable bed and nice amenties in the bathroom. It also had a useful refrigerator. We enjoyed using the private balcony with its beautiful views of the city and the ocean. It was especially nice on New Years Eve as the entire city burst (literally) to life with fireworks. The hotel is adjacent to the Ala Moana Mall and there are many, very nice restaurants to chose from there. We enjoyed Bubba Gumps and Morton's Steakhouse, but were less impressed with California Pizza Kitchen (not worth the wait) and Ruby Tuesday's. There are a wide variety of Chinese and Japanese restaurants to chose from as well. The Hotel itself also has a nice selection of restaurants including several asian inspired, but we spent most of our time at the Plantation House Restaurant which served a nice breakfast buffet with very nice waitresses.The only drawback to the hotel is that its pool is rather rundown and there is no hot tub which would have felt so nice after those long walks into town and along Waikiki Beach. There was a notice saying that the pool was to be closed and refurbished during the month of January.

<Content>Great base to explore honolulu + awesome for shoppers! We stayed at the Ala Moana Hotel for 4 nights before boarding a cruise back to Australia. As many have said the hotel is newly renovated which is rare in honolulu as the hotels don't seem to have to work too hard to attract guests. The renovation is fantastic. We were upgraded to a suite which consisted of the bedroom, generous bathroom and a seperate sitting room with kitchenette. Very clean and fresh as you would expect. Bonus to have balconies that you can open and step out onto. Have heard that the normal rooms are not as generously proportioned as some other hotels' rooms (recent visit by a friend).Staff were very helpful and positive. Footbridge to ala moana shopping centre is fantastic if you want to head back for an afternoon rest after too much shopping!If this is your first time to honolulu then this hotel may be a little too far from the main street action but for seasoned visitors looking for a clean and comfortable option this is hard to beat. We had a rental car for our trip and the money we saved on the hotel rate vs main hotels paid for the car.Hotel website appeared to be the cheapest option from our research. We often choose the Prince Hotel just across the Canal but given the price differential + new fit out would choose the Ala Moana Hotel from now on.

<Content>Small rooms, but clean Unaware that this hotel went 'condo' about 2 years ago, I was pleasantly surprised given the horrible accommodations they used to offer. Rooms are still very, very small but you cannot beat the location and close proximity to the mall. Having stayed at many nearby hotels in the past two years, I would definitely stay here again. Rooms are very clean and furnishings modern and fairly new. Bed wasn't the greatest, but I was in an owner's unit. Food at the Plantation Cafe wasn't bad and I would recommend using valet parking for convenience. My 'surcharges' totaled a whopping 130.00US for daily parking, resort fee, and misc. taxes for a 4 day stay. Some of the units are owned, therefore do not offer daily maid service. The walls are very thin and I could hear the TV in the next room and whenever someone closed their door, my entire room would shake. Also vacuuming at all hours of the night and early morning hours was annoying. The electricity went out (local construction) and the staff did not know where the fire stairs were located, and then had to call someone for the 'code.' Therefore, you may want to familiarize yourselves with your own evacuation plan as the staff is not well versed in disaster response.

<Content>Nice Honolulu Hotel Booked the hotel through Priceline and what Priceline doesn't tell you is the hotel will give you the smallest room available. I was traveling with my sister. When we checked in the front desk clerk advised us the room is small and asked if we wanted to upgrade. Given we had booked through Priceline, the hotel was unwilling (even though space would be more than available during our stay) to upgrade us for free. The upgrade fee was minimal at ~$20/night. The room we were upgraded to was still small but much more comfortable than our original room would have been. Room was clean, updated, had a small refrigerator, coffee maker and coffee and microwave. The room also had a balcony that was nice to sit on in the late afternoon. Our room faced the city side, but we didn't notice any excess noise.Having read the reviews regarding the issues with parking I chose to valet our rental car for the extra $3 per day over the cost of self parking. We never had to wait more than 5 minutes for our car and the valet team was always helpful with directions and sightseeing ideas. Many H-1 freeway on ramps are closed during morning rush hour so finding a place to get onto the highway can be a problem. The valet was great at giving us directions to the nearest open ramp.The workout room was very nice with treadmills, elliptical machines and various weight machines and free weights. The pool area looked nice as well, but didn't spend any time there. Overall for the price and the location (close to Waikiki, but not right in the middle of it and across from Ala Moana shopping mall) I would consider the hotel above average.

<Content>Spectacular modernist renovation This hotel is absolutely spectacular. Dwell Magazine should do a review of this beautiful modernist renovation.The location is great if you're not set on being by Waikiki, and it's right across the street from the Hawaii Convention Center and next door to Ala Moana Center, the most enjoyable mall in America. The hotel has excellent business facilities and a full-service Kinko's within a few blocks. Check out the down-home Don Quixote's shopping center nearby for some local color.The only downside was that during our stay, there was a workers' picket outside, which may indicate poor treatment of employees.

<Content>Good business hotel The room was clean, new furniture, bathroom had been remodeled recently (nice tile work - clean lines). Small balcony. The pool is on the 3rd floor, nice size, private, with lots of chairs and lounge chairs nearby. Lobby area was nice, staff attentive. Plantation Cafe staff were very attentive but food was medicore.Drawbacks: it's a 5 minute ($10) cabride from the nearest beach (not the Ala Moana beach which should be skipped). Next door is a huge mall with nothing special to recommend it.

<Content>Good value, clean and tidy Good value and shopping is the key for this hotel. The hotel has been recently renovated with new furniture, decor, paint, so overall it feels very fresh notwithstanding it is some over 30 years old. The view over the ocean is very nice, the downside is that the freeway below is very noisy. The main reason for staying is if you want to do some serious shopping, as it is located next to the famous Ala Moana shopping centre. But apart from this, there is nothing interesting near the hotel. In summary, it is great value relative to the other Waikiki hotels, but do not expect it to provide a Honolulu 'experience'.

<Content>Nice place in Honolulu If you want a real tropical island vacation, and can afford it, go to the other islands (Maui, Kawai, the Big Island, or Lanai). They are spectacularly beautiful and wonderful in every way. Honolulu is like plunking down Dallas on a tropical island; you get the noise, the crowds, the crime, the dirt, and the traffic along with the good weather and glimpses of the beach.But if you have to come to come to Honolulu, this would be an excellent value. I stayed here for $125/night through the conference I was attending and for that price, it was great. Beautifully decorated rooms, excellent service, very accommodating people, free Internet, and a refrigerator for your food and drinks. The rooms had great soundproofing and it鈥檚 close to the airport, away from the Waikiki crowds, and not too far a hike to a nice beach. It's next door to a high-end mall with a good cheap food court (I particularly liked the Little Cafe Siam).

<Content>Very pleasant stay The Ala Moana is a very clean and comfortable place to stay, and much more reasonably priced than the hotels right on Waikiki beach. I was pleased with it. The staff are also friendly and helpful. The rooms are thoughtfully arranged. There is a very large desk, and high-speed internet access is available for free. There's a nice sized fridge and a coffee maker too. The bathrooms are clean and pleasant. The hotel is right next to the Ala Moana mall, which -- if you want to shop -- has everything you need. Lots of high-end shops (Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, Macy's, etc), and a great food court that is reasonably priced. You can get some pretty darned good (and very authentic) Japanese food there.The only drawback of this hotel is the location for those who want to spend their time at the beach. You can walk to the Waikiki beach from the Ala Moana, or you can take a bus or shuttle to other beaches on Oahu, but it's not right ON the beach. But then again this is reflected in the price. It also does not have CHARM, if you are looking for a place that is romantic or for a luxury resort.However, I would definitely stay here again, especially if on business or for a few nights before going to one of the other islands.

<Content>Very Pleased Aloha fellow Trip Advisor members. This was our first trip to Oahu, so I did extensive research on finding the perfect hotel and tours for our trip. I decided on the Ala Moana hotel based on location (away from the major Waikiki area), the hotel features, access to the mall next door, and the positive reviews on Trip Advisor. I couldn't have been more pleased. The rooms were very nice, comfortable, and clean. We requested an ocean view room on a higher floor in the Waikiki Tower. The hotel staff gave us a room on the 29th floor near the corner of the building. The view was breathtaking. From our balcony (or as they call it, the Lanai) we could see the mountains to the left, the city to the front with Diamond Head peaking through the tall buildings, and the harbor and the ocean to the right. We got the best of all the views. For most meals we went next door to the Ala Moana Mall food court and brought back our food to enjoy on our balcony. We did order room service a couple times just for fun. The food was good, but pricey. The room was quiet. The staff were professional and helpful. It was nice to have a tour desk in the hotel for assistance. There were also five shops in the hotel, which I enjoyed visiting. There was live entertainment in the lobby each evening. The tour buses picked us up at the hotel. The only negative I encountered was the secondhand smoke that made it's way up to our balcony from the floors below. The hotel is a smoke free hotel (rooms, all public areas and balconies). It was unfortunate that some of the guests decided to ignore the hotel policy. I would definately stay at this hotel again and I would recommend it to others. Just a tip on tours - I highly recommend the Home of the Brave Tour if you are a history buff and would like to experience a VIP tour of Pearl Habor and retrace what exactly happened on December 7th, 1941. The Kos Hummer tour is a must if you are a fan of the TV show Lost. Visit the Waimea Falls Audubon Center for a beautiful nature hike and the Kualoa Ranch to experience true island beauty. You can find the link to all these attractions by doing a google search. I hope you have a wonderful trip to Oahu!

<Content>Nice Hotel but not on Waikiki. Stayed for 6 nights (9/28/07 - 10/04/07). Booked the cheapest room directly via hotel website but was upgraded automatically to Waikiki Tower with partial ocean view. Wish I were given a king bed. Carpet has some stain. Housekeeping is decent, did not use any room service. Having a safe box is a plus. Room sound proofing is very good. Did not use hotel parking, instead I used mall parking during the day and street parking at night. Since my flight home was in the late evening, the hotel provided a complimentary 30-minute use of one of the room for freshen up before heading to the airport in addition to the luggage storage service. Will stay here in the future trip.

<Content>We loved the room 2009!!! We stayed at Ala Moana Room 2009 and we loved the ocean view!! We basically lay down on the bed and saw the ocean view from our bed. What a wonderful sight! The room is very modern looking and we had great experience with all the staff. We didn't regret paying ocean view rate for this room. It's worth it! I would recommend for everyone to stay at Ala Moana Hotel. No hotel can beat the location of Ala Moana. It's a shopping paradise and you can save a lot of money by eating at Ala Moana Center Mall. It only takes 5 minutes walk to the Mall.

<Content>Excellent Hotel Unfortunately, we only used this Hotel for an overnight stay on the way back to Australia. I say unfortunately because the Hotel is superb. The views from the balcony are terrific, the room was lovely and the Restaurant excellent. We had a four day stay in Waikiki on the way over to the mainland and just the one night at the Ala Moana on the way back. Highly recommended.

<Content>Wonderfull choice We stayed at the Ala Moana Hotel during our Honey moon last August. The first thing I must say is that we were a little bit scared with some personal reviews about hotels that were ranked as fabulous, but in the end, that was not the opinion of their users. We were travelling from Portugal and planned to stay for 15 days. We decided to book it online so we had to book the right hotel for we were going to pay it in advance. We were expecting that the hotel/room would be exactly as the online pictures show. And it was!!! What a relief!!! A little bit small but extremely clean, very confortable, everything working right, very frielndly and eficcient staff, night shows, etc. The only problem (which is not a problem at all) is that the hotel is not in Waikiki. We would certainly choose it again for another stay in Oahu.

<Content>Ala Moana Hotel is a GREAT value! My husband and I stayed at the Ala Moana hotel for 2 nights in August. We were absolutely surprised at the spacious room and accommodations the hotel has. The bed was large and very comfortable. There was a flat screen t.v. hanging from the ceiling. The room had a small sitting area with a pull out sofa bed, chair and coffee table. There was also a good sized refrigerator, microwave and they also provided wine glasses! It was obvious the hotel is relatively new as the rooms and the rest of the hotel are very modern looking. We stayed at the Royal Hawaiian during the same trip and will NEVER stay there again. The Ala Moana hotel is a great value for the money and is in a fantastic location. You can walk to the mall from there and parking is right under the hotel. I will definitely stay here again.

<Content>Parking is a Disaster! Rooms are clean, view was good, maid service was great. Overall, a pleasant experience as far as the hotel goes; however, what lowers my opinion is the parking. You will be charged $15 per day for parking at a garage below the hotel. However, two of the nights here during my 5-night stay there were no parking spots available in the garage. The first night, I parked adjacent to the hotel at the Ala Moana Shopping Center and received a Courtesy Notice from security there on my car for parking there overnight. The next night, again there was no parking in the hotel garage. The attendant told us to double park. I informed her I didn't wish to do that. She said that this is an 1,100 room hotel with only 300 parking spots and it's summertime, so sorry. Next, went to the front of the hotel where numerous cars were parked in the Loading Zones. So, I pulled in behind a nice Corvette and informed the Valet Parking that I was leaving my car there until I could move it into the garage. Valet Parking costs $20 and I informed them that I wasn't paying them because I had already been paying $15 per night and not getting to park in the garage for the past 2 nights. Then, the Valet Attendant looks at me and says, So, you're parking there for free? I responded appropriately with Yes. In the end, we had to deal with the parking manager, who initally was going to take care of the problem, but never re-surfaced to provide closure to the problem. So, we went to the front desk management and dealt with them. Explained the situation and they decided to take off the $15.00 for the first night we couldn't park in the garage and switch us to Valet Parking for the last night at the same rate of self parking, which is $15.00. Our total for 5 nights at $15 per night was originally $75. Now, with the $15 being deducted for the first night's parking dilemma, our charges should be $60 (75 minus 15), correct? Well, surprise, we're still being charged $75 as I type this. Hotel is okay for the most part---just don't rely on parking a vehicle here--use the buses and trolley instead!

<Content>Very comfy We stayed for one night on July 4th. I picked this hotel, because of easy access to the airport and Pearl Harbor. The hotels nearest the airport didn't seem to be getting good reviews. We were also able to squeeze in a trip to Diamond Head. Which was also easy to get to from here. The room was beautiful. Nice flat screen TV. Probably the most comfortable bed I ever slept on in a hotel. I liked the fact that check out was @ 12:00, most places are 11:00. We were able to leave our luggage in the room while we visited Pearl Harbor in the morning, before having to be at the airport @ 12:30. I would stay here again.

<Content>Wonderful place Went to Honolulu to attend a conference and spend some holiday around the island. Indeed, a great value of hotel. Spotless rooms, wonderful services (gym, pool,...), very attentive service, etc. Waikiki is within walking distance and the Ala Moana shopping center by the hotel offers plenty of leisure as well. Internet is free if you use your laptop cord (no wireless).

<Content>room 3221was the best. full ocean views from the bed. It was awsome. Just got back from a wedding this past weekend. He had a room 2115 or something. It was facing away from the waikiki view. While i was in line waiting to talk to the receptionist about something. We then was talking to another couple that was checking out. They had a blast and said their room was the best ever. They stayed at 3221. 32nd floor. I thought it was more expensive to stay on a higher floor, but it wasn't. It was for same price w/ a full ocean view. They said to try to request that room. So we did and got it after they cleaned it. Everything was so nice. Best was the full ocean views from the beds. Didn't even need to walk out to the balcony . This room had the beds facing the water where the other rooms have beds facing the other direction. Will stay again and will request that room. 3221. AWESOME

<Content>Way above average place to stay Thanks to the internet, it is getting easier to find a satisfactory lodging experience. I booked this hotel based on what I read from traveler's reviews. It was a fabulous deal!!! Contrary to what I read, the staff was very friendly and accomodating. Ultra clean and comfortable rooms. The mall (and 70 restaurants) was just yards from our room. We walked to Waikiki and things like the Benihanna of Tokoyo at the Hawaii Hilton Village, but the Ala Moana Beach was also very close by. Major tourist guides didn't mind stopping by our hotel to pick us up and there was an Expedia representative at the consierge counter who booked our guided hikes, rental car, and luau. We loved being in this location for the price we paid - it was a deal!

<Content>W*o*w What a wonderful place to stay. There are so many great things to say about this hotel...I don't know where to begin.The furniture in the rooms are great and gives you a lot of options for storage. They have a great contemporary feel. As a business traveller, I appreciated the high speed cable interenet service. The beds are AWESOME - pillow top queen bed that let's you melt into it. The shower has multiple settings from soft to hard and different settings on the spray. The rooms have nice flat screen TV's. Lighting is good for work. BIG refrigerator so you can store your pineapple from the ABC store for breakfast in the morning.As I had a small room it had no lanai, but as I am here for business, I didn't care. The work out room is really super. The pool looked nice, and seemed like a lot of people used it. The restaurants are all full service and VERY expensive...you are better to walk across the street to the Mall to get anything you want and half the price. They have some sort of disco, not my style, but people were flocking into it, so I guess it was good.Bottom line - if you can get in here, you won't be disappointed. Only negative was parking - $18 per day - UGH. But, close to everything and you can be right in thick of it all with a nice 15 minute walk.

<Content>Great place to stay! The Ala Moana Hotel is a great place to stay in Honolulu. It's location can't be beat, the service was wonderful, and the rooms were nicely renovated. I stayed there for a little under a week in November of 06 and would definitely stay there again. I only hesitate to give an Excellent rating simply because the hotel was still undergoing renovations at the time of my stay and parking can be tough at times. Otherwise, here are some of the points I really liked about the hotel:- Great location. It is not on the main strip of Honolulu/Waikiki, so there isn't as much commotion going on, yet it is close enough to get there and anywhere else fairly easily. - Next to the Ala Moana shopping center, where there are many restaurants and a large food court inside. If you want to pick up a quick bite to eat, this is the place to do it.- Across the street from Ala Moana Beach, which is less crowded than Waikiki. The park surrounding the beach is a great place for a run in the morning.- The rooms are new and clean. Don't expect extremely high end furnishings, but it is practical and very comfortable. In other words, it is inviting after a long day out.- The staff was very friendly and courteous. I had a few small issues with my room being ready (not due to the hotels fault), but that was settled quickly and they were very helpful throughout. Overall, a great experience at the Ala Moana. I am sure after my next stay I can rate it as excellent.

<Content>stayed 3/15 - 3/19/07, had a great stay! We stayed in a Waikiki tower, city/mountain view room with a lanai and a king bed (with sofa). Check in was easy, we were able to check in at 2:00p. By 3:00p, the lines were really long, but that's check in time. Lots of airline personnel stay here. Staff was friendly.The room itself was on the small size, but after putting all our stuff away, it was quite ample for the 2 of us. The view is not great of the other buildings, but at night the city lights were very pretty. Our lanai even had a partial view of the ocean. The area is noisy, but the room itself is extremely quiet with the lanai door closed. The a/c was very strong. The decor is clean and modern. The bed very comfy. Complaints: There was only 1 trash can in the room. And the hot water in the shower was not as hot as I like it, but when we notified the front desk of this as we checked out, she immediately called maintenance to look into it.There is a very popular nightclub in the hotel. We ate at the Plantation Cafe for breakfasts and found the food and prices to be very good. Parking was not a problem for us, we always found a space. The pool was small but really nice, though no hot tub. There is a well-equiped fitness room with sauna and steam rooms. The elevators were really fast.The best: Just walked across the bridge and through the parking lot to Ala Moana shopping center. Wal Mart is also very close, we picked up drinks, snacks, and souveniers. The room had a mini frig, micro/toaster oven, coffee maker, and a mini blowdryer. We also walked to Waikiki from the hotel, very close if you follow the shore line rather than following the main street.  Overall, a great stay. If you book a city view room, I would recommend staying at a higher floor to get a better view.

<Content>Great hotel! Jan 16 - 20 We stayed at the Ala Moana Hotel in January for 4 nights. It was great - close to everything, but just off the beat path of Waikiki. We rented our room privately, and had no problems with Check-in as the owner picked us up from the airport and drove us to the hotel. The staff was very friendly when asking for directions, and it was great being right next door to the Ala Moana Center. We'll definitely stay at the Ala Moana again the next time we are in Honolulu!

<Content>Newly Remodeled and Fresh Stayed at the Ala Moana Hotel for 4 days in Aug 06. The hotel is newlty remodeled and became and ownership type of hotel. The unit was a studio that slept 4, 2 on a king and 2 on a convertible sofa. The facility has a nice pool on the 4th floor which has an ocean view. Things I liked were the cleaniness, the updated furniture, like a flat screen tv, and the convenience of being right next to Ala Moana Mall. It's not on Waikiki but close enough to walk to Ala Moana Beach. Things I didn't like were the charge for parking when it seemed everyone else was parking at the mall and the slow drain in the wash basin. All in all it was much better than comparatively price places in Waikiki.

<Content>Chic, with incompetent staff Very classy clean, contemporary look and feel. The staff isn't just on Hawaiian time but TOTALLY uncaring and incompetent. Check-in couldn't have been worse, or even believed, if you didn't experience it. About 50, yes 50!, people were waiting to get in, while one, (1!) clerk was dealing with us, and she took 20-30 minutes EACH. Finally, another customer got on the phone the the management, and after long runarounds finally got someone to get a couple more people to sign us in. Both were about as slow as the first. Thru this all, the manage was parading around behind the clerk, looking us over with disdain as the queue grew, blissfully ignoring the whole sorry situatioin.The parking structure was grossly overbooked despite the fact most of us had paid handsomely to park there.Instead of providing free internet access as all decent hotels do today, they also charge and excessive amount.Looks can be very deceiving. Until this place hires enough competent staff to match it's looks, avoid it.

<Content>Great Location, good value The Ala Moana is a terrific location, away from the craziness of Waikiki and across from the Ala Moana shopping mall. There is a shuttle at the mall that will take you to Waikiki for $2 per person or you can spend about $7 on a cab. The hotel has been recently remodeled and is just beautiful. We stayed on the city view side. With the windows open it was very noisy with sirens etc. all night, but nearly silent with the windows closed. We never even heard another guest in their room the week we were there. The housekeeping staff left a bit to be desired. There were cigarette butts on the lanais and one of our toilets looked like it hadn't been completely wiped down. The front desk and concierge were minimal help. I'm sorry to say that has been typical of my experience in Hawaii so this was no different than I was used to. The parking attendants on the other hand were exceptionally helpful with directions, help finding parking spaces and just generally being friendly.The beds were fabulous and the rooms were spacious. In spite of the minor problems, we plan to stay there again when in Honolulu.

<Content>Just what I wanted -- the renovations are fantastic I stayed at the Ala Moana in November and early December 2006. I had stayed there three years ago and the rooms are night and day after the renovations. They were shabby before.The beds were extremely comfy with lovely bedding, better than what I expect for that price. I have high standards for bed and bedding at home so most times when I get a hotel room at this price I feel like I have to put up with what I get; here I got great rest.I liked the slate bathroom and entry floor, and the nice deep tub, and the flat screen TV. Most of all I liked that it felt clean and new, not worn and tired, and I liked the muted color scheme, not all garish like a lot of hotels.I would not point you here if you're a family with kids (smallish, very adult-oriented furnishings), nor if you care about the pool, and it's not the place to stay for a Waikiki vacation.It IS marvellously convenient to simply walk over to Ala Moana Shopping Mall. I live on the Big Island which has limited shopping, and find the mall far more entertaining than Waikiki. (I don't even like Waikiki and was happy to be away from it.) I enjoyed all the reasonable dining options in the Food Court and the rooftop dining and open air bar at the Mall. I liked having a decent mini-frig and the convenience of a Foodland basically next door. One room I had with a microwave and one not -- unsure why, having the microwave was a big bonus. I did NOT like the Chinese restaurant in the hotel, nice people but the wrong kind of Chinese cuisine for me. Also I had to give up on eating breakfast at the Plantation Cafe Sunday morning; the wait was too long (so I walked over to the food court).The reason I was in Honolulu was the opposite of vacation. I had family in the hospital. Oddly, I found the Ala Moana very comforting. The room was a nice sort of cocoon, very quiet with the slider shut, and the public area was festive. The second floor where they have functions was not nice at all ... it smelled awful due to the old carpet. But I imagine that will change soon if not already, and I only walked through it to exit to the mall.I chose not to have a car for this trip so I can't comment on the parking. I took taxis and shuttles to get where I needed to go, but the nice thing about being near the mall is that it's got so many resources that after a wearing day at the hospital I didn't need to go running around Honolulu (in cabs) to take care of my own needs; I could do it all on foot.One can walk over to the Beach Park to get exercise.The city lights are great at night. The daytime view did include construction and parking, and I would recommend the Waikiki tower as high up as possible to get up above it all.I forgot to mention the staff -- I was not expecting a lot after reading reviews, but they were perfectly friendly and very efficient. The hotel was fully booked during my December stay, no vacancies at all, so the check-in line was a tad long, but hey, Christmas season in Honolulu with three big events going on, it was to be expected.Would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Ummm, much to be desired! Nice location and appearance of hotel from exterior was nice. However looks are deceiving. I got a room with a partial ocean view, but what I really got was a distance (very distant view) of the ocean with a full view of the Ala Moana parking lot and a full view of major construction area of the hotel, which by the way awoken me early in the morning with the sounds of jack hammering and workers yelling commands. I think one can do better than the Ala Moana hotel in honolulu for accomodations.....definitely!

<Content>Very comfortable. A little commercial but very comfortable. We were upgraded to a suite (very stylish), so we had plenty of room. The kitchenette had no utensils at all, which seemed odd. Staff was very nice, though the concierge basically sneered when I asked for a public bus map, said Our guests don't really take the bus.

<Content>Love the renovation! Recently renovated (2005), the Ala Moana hotel offers an unbelievable value for the price paid. The rooms are very clean and nicely renovated. A nice LG 20 flat screen hangs from the wall and the king size bed was very comfortable. Nice size refrigerator and a new microwave were nice additions to the room. We were lucky enough to get the 35th floor but the view from all of the rooms are pretty good. It's a block away from the Ala Moana beach park, and right next door to the world famous Ala Moana shopping center. There are tons of places to eat nearby, a 7-11 a block away and a block away from the convention center. Why pay ridiculous prices in Waikiki when you can stay just five minutes away? This is one of the best places by far to stay on Oahu.

<Content>A Very Nice Hotel Had to travel to Honolulu for a funeral. My whole family stayed here. I was in the smaller Kona tower. The rooms are very nicely furnished with a flat panel tv mounted on the wall, a stainless steel microwave/toaster/broiler, fridge and a nice bathroom. My sister stayed in the taller Waikiki tower. The room was bigger and had a balcony. Being next to the shopping center was very convenient and we made many trips there. The people at the front desk and the parking garage were very helpful and courteous. Overall, we all the hotel a lot!

<Content>Fine with me.... In transition, but for the price, it was great! We were here in October 2006. Got a great deal on Expedia, and as always were a bit wary. The hotel is definitely in transition. Its being renovated (though looks like they are at the end), some of it is being sold as condos, the conceirge desk now works for Expedia and we had heard the Outrigger chain was also taking over, but none of the staff there could confirm that, so there is definitely flux going on and the staff is suffering from all those changes swirling around, but I can't blame them and we did not run into anyone who was overtly rude, I would just say indifferent. However, if you are an independent traveler and are just looking for the basics, this is the place to be. The BEST part of the hotel stay is that they offer a complementary hospitality suite that you can use to shower and change before your late night flight. We checked our bags with the bell desk when we checked out and came back about 6:00 p.m. and got to use a clean room to shower and change and pack up any last minute things, it was great... beats using the cold public shower and changing stall on the beach. The rooms are small, no doubt about it, but if you are in Hawaii you should not be in the room anyway. They are clean and that counts for a lot more with me. Parking was challenging, its because there is a hot spot club there now and the hotel is always hosting local events and business meetings. The pool is on the roof and much larger than a lot of the pools in town. The beach is a 5 minute walk to Ala Moana park and of course being next to the mall is an added benefit, not just for shopping, but there is a Longs there that has very reasonable souvenir type things, snacks, water and food.For the price, it was completely worth it. We will stay again.

<Content>Avoid this place! Stayed there for three nights. Some areas around the lobby smelled like animal dung! Disgustinig! Maybe due to the construction.Bad attitude of some employees. Didn't seem interested in making our stay pleasurable. The restaurants were good, however.Good location for shopping and Wakiki Beach.

<Content>In transition, but a great value We stayed at the Ala Moana for 2 nights. We had an 18th floor city view room. The room was very modern, with a flat screen tv, contenporary decor, and a small balcony. The room was clean and had 2 comfortable double beds. There was plenty of room for 2 people.The rest of the hotel has not been renovated and the decor is tired and worn out. The carpet looks pretty nasty in places and there are stains/burns on the wall. Also, the lobby constantly smelled of smoke, though we didn't see anyone smoking. We also had parking problems as valet parking and the hotel's parking lot were both full. The first night we just parked in the Ala Moana Mall parking structure but we were informed the next day that we were lucky we didn't get towed. The next night we parked in the hotel parking garage with no problems.Overall, if you're just looking for a place to lay your head while enjoying Oahu, this hotel fits the bill nicely. Our room was a great value and we'll definitely stay there again.Tip: Skip the overpriced room service breakfast and walk over to Alan Wong's Pineapple Room that is inside Macy's in Ala Moana mall. The prices were less than room service and the food was divine!

<Content>Ask for Ocean Front in New Tower We had a wonderful stay at the historic Sheraton Ala Moana Surfrider Hotel. It is a historic building but if you prefer newer rooms ask for a room in the new tower that sits west of the original 1902 building. If an ocean view is important to you too, you have to pesifically ask for Ocean Front not just ocen view. Ocean Front with a view of Diamondhead I feel is the best view. It costs more, but it really is worth it. This also gives you a view of the large Banyon tree that was planted in 1904. The staff is very friendly and attentive and you can't beat the great location. We especially loved sitting in the white rocking chairs in the evenings and the Veranda Room rest6aurant at night is a must. They have traditional evening entertainment right in front of the restaursant so it makes for a very pleasant evening.

<Content>A Decent Hotel We stayed at this hotel July 21-28, 2006, as part of our trip for our marriage and honeymoon. We had a room on the 10th floor of the Kona Tower, the smaller of the two towers.Upon our Friday arrival, we discovered the parking garage to be completely full, but were assisted by the parking staff. They have you park and block in another car. If that person wishes to leave before you, they will move your car (you give the parking staff your keys as if it were valet service). The parking garage is nearly always full and it can be very difficult to find a parking spot. As the hotel is still undergoing renovations, they are storing a lot of construction equipment in the garage. This eliminates a good twenty parking spots.Check-in and check-out were no problem.We had no problems with the elevators and we did not eat at any of the restaurants.On our third day at the hotel, we received no maid service. The room was never made up. On another day, we hung out the please do not disturb sign and returned to the room to find had been made up anyway.The room we had was really quite small, but this was not a concern of ours, as we rarely are in the room while in Hawaii. However, noise can be a problem from the streets below, the halls, and rooms next door. The wall seem very thin and street noise can be a problem all night. On one night, we ordered room service and it never arrived. At least we weren't billed for the order.Overall, there were some problems with the hotel (parking, room service, and housekeeping service), but I would stay here again, especially if the rate was good.

<Content>Ocean View Room with No Ocean View We stayed for 4 nights in July at the Ala Moana Hotel.We booked a non-smoking Ocean View Room. When we entered the room, it was smelly (cigarett smell) with NO ocean view. We thought the front receptionist must have given us a wrong room. We went back to check, but the lady said the hotel was not an oceanfront hotel, and thus even the Ocean View Room has limited Ocean View. However, she gave us another room on a higher-level floor 2 rooms closer to the Ocean View because of the smelly room complain.There was a small safe in the room, which was charged at US$3.5/ day. However, the safe didn't work and the hotel could not fix it until the following day.We were given 2 card-keys to our room, but one was defective. I went back  the front receptionist gave me another 2 keys in case one of them didn't work, but both were defective again. When I went back in the evening, another lady exchanged the keys for me, but again, of course, those didn't work either. We did not bother to ask for another key afterwards.We booked 2 tours via the Concierge at the Hotel. The lady was very experienced and efficient and gave us good recommendations. We booked the 9 a.m. tour to Pearl Harbour, but found out it was actually the busiest time. The Pearl Harbour Museum opened at 7:30 a.m.  offered free tour, which include a 30-min. movie  a 20-min. boat-trip. Since it was free, most tours arrived early. So, it was actually better to arrive at around 10-11 a.m. to avoid the long line-up. The snorkeling trip to Hanauma Bay was great. Hanauma Bay was beautiful and there were many beautiful fish even at the shallow water.Ala Moana Shopping Mall, the world's largest outdoor shopping mall, was a short 5-min. walk from the hotel, an extremely convenient location. My 10-year-old son hated shopping but did not mind it because there was an Arcade Game Centre in the Mall. He paid a visit there every day during our stay. It was also convenient to take a bus from the Shopping Mall to Waikiki area.I would love to try Alan Wong's but we were too lazy to take the trip. We tried his Pineapple Room at the Mall instead. Service was great. The 4-course sampling dinner with wine pairing was of exceptional quality, esp. their steak. We also loved Rokkaku, at the Mall. It was an expensive Japanese restaurant, but both food  service was great. Bubbagump Shimp at the Mall always had long line-up. Service  ambience were good, but I suspected the food had MSG as I was allergic to it. We had dinner one evening at the Aaron Restaurant on the top floor of the Hotel. Food was mediocre, but service was poor. They automatically charged 18% service charge to the bill regardless of their poor service.Waikiki area:Afternoon High-Tea at the Sheraton Moana Surf Hotel was extremely enjoyable. Our server gave us an interesting introduction to the 10 different kinds of tea they had and really made sure we were taken care of. The Cheesecake Factory had long line-up and served huge portion of food. We couldn't even finish our appetizer. My son ordered an appetizer mini-burger, and we were surprised to see 4 medium-size burgers on his plate!We took a taxi from the airport to the Hotel. The airport taxi co-ordinater arranged that we shared a limousine with another party of 2 girls who were going to the Hilton, and that each party was to pay $16. When we arrived at our Hotel, the limousine driver made a big fuss  charged us $25 each. When we left, we preferred to take a shuttle via the Hotel Concierge, which charged $9/ adult and $5/ kid to avoid having another bad experience.

<Content>Are you kidding me?! When I read some of the review on Trip Advisor for this hotel, I felt, Yes, I should stay here. It was a big disappointment to me because we stayed at the largest suite they had, and it was as big as my living room at home! It was very small and dirty. The dining here is very good, and you should eat at the Plantation House. The service is ok - sometimes they were nice, and sometimes they were truly crabby! A great place to go shopping is the Ala Moana Shopping Center, which is just a few steps away from this hotel. Overall, it was an average hotel, and I wouldn't stay here again.

<Content>Hidden Treasure After reading some reviews I was a bit apprehensive of staying at a non-chain hotel especially when I had reservations at the one and only Hilton Hawaiian Village, however after much consideration on the cost factor between the two hotels i decided to leap out on faith and cancel at the HHV and try this hotel called ala moana that advertised major billion dollar renovations to turn it into a condo hotel and the fact i was attached to a large and exclusive mall I figured I couldnt go wrong ohh and the affordable price. Let me tell u at the time of my visit may 12-18th renovations were still going on however that wasnt a issue the rooms were already renovated with modern furniture, lcd tv's, a microwave and refrigerator. I stayed in room 2214 which was very nice it also had a pullout couch and a balcony with views of the marina and ocean. After visiting the HHV even though it is truly a world or say village within itself it was also very crowded. Im glad I chose the Ala Moana it was truly a diamond in the rough, I would definetly return there and hey maybe one day afford one of the condos so I dont have to pay the nightly rate.

<Content>Well Worth It! Given mixed reviews we've read, this hotel well exceeded our expectations. It must be the full renovation the hotel is going through. The rooms were very well done. Great location next to a big luxurious mall and a great beach down the block that beats the Waikiki crowd and an ideal spot for swimmers - as the outer reef kept the waters calm near shore. Highly recommended.....and the rates were very reasonable, although it may not stay low once the hotel is fully renovated, which seemed near completion. While not in Waikiki, it is next door in a good location and across the Convention Center.

<Content>Great hotel at a better price! I've never stayed at a better hotel in Hawaii for the price at the Ala Moana! The rooms were newly renovated and the furniture looked brand new. The hotel was right next to the Ala Moana shopping center where we spent a lot of our time. It was also very close to the beach. I highly recommend this place and will come back to stay again on our next trip to Hawaii.

<Content>A Pleasant Surprise I was not expecting much from this hotel, based on reviews I had read on this site. I actually tried to change to the Prince at the last minute, but wasn't successful. What a stroke of luck. My room at the Ala Moana was spacious, clean, and had a great view of the ocean--all for a reasonable price. The area was much quieter than central Waikiki. I walked to that area a couple of times and was always glad to escape to the calm Ala Moana after. Another plus was the beach across the street (about a 5 minute walk), which I also preferred to Waikiki. It seemed like about half of the swimmers and sunbathers were locals. And, as several reviewers have noted, everything you could possibly want to buy can be found in the shopping center next door. The Ala Moana lacks the feeling of luxury that one finds at many top notch resorts, but it would be hard to find a room of the same quality for a better price in Hawaii.

<Content>New Condo Hotel - WOW I stayed at the Ala Moana in one of the newly renovated Rooms in the Kona Tower. I requested an ocean room view and the room was absolutely marvelous. The views were spectacular and the new rooms were really gorgeous. It had all the modern amenities (LCD TV, Internet cable, microwave) and the 6 great restaurants were a treat to eat at.My wife and I really enjoyed just walking over to the Ala Moana Shopping Center that is connected to the hotel and then in the evening walking across the street to the Ala Moana park to take a nice stoll on the beach.The central location to Waikiki and the other shopping areas made this a great location for any activity.

<Content>Excellent stay at an excellent price We walked in without a reservation and received a budget room in the Kona tower at $120/night. Recent renovation, very nice if small room, lovely bathroom, comfortable bed, and best of all, soundproofed. That downtown can be a noisy place, even early in the morning. Pleasant staff, good location. Parking was $15. Easy access to the mall if shopping at the same stores in every mainland city is what you came 3000+ miles for. I have to admit I did hit the mall for dinner. It was our seventh day in Hawaii and I was jonesing for pasta and the concierge directed us to Asiaggo's. The pasta was perfectly cooked and the staff was very nice. I would recommend the hotel and the restaurant in a heartbeat.

<Content>Nice hotel, steps to the mall It's a nice enough hotel, but lacks any warmth or charm. It's undergoing renovations to become something better so the pool was closed and the halls were devoid of furnishings. The whole thing seemed deathly quiet and sterile.The room was quite big and came with a fridge and microwave. The tv didn't work but, since we were only there for 1 night, that wasn't a big deal.The breakfast buffet in the Plantation Cafe was welcome and good. It was free, too. Normally the freebie breakie is in another place, probably with less food, but it was here because of the renovations.Can't beat the location if Ala Moana Mall is a destination. Great, big mall with everything you need. A block from the convention centre if that's what you're there for.

And sunset walks around Magic Island is the best way to cap off the day. This is a hotel that offers everything. I will definitely stay there on my next Hawaii trip.

<Content>So nice I was so nicely surprised. I had read some reviews  was a little nervous about staying at the Ala Moana Hotel. It was the perfect place for me  my boyfriend. The new remodel is so nice. The location was perfect. Near the marina, the beach, shopping,  some very nice  romantic restaurants. The rooms were beautiful  had every amenity you could ask for. Really the only draw back was the construction sounds in the morning. Even that wasn't to bad as they didn't start until a decent hour. I had the time of my life. If I have a chance, I will most definately be staying there again.

<Content>glitzy lobby Ala moana has a great reception--spacious and inviting. The rooms however are showing their age. The carpet dingy, the bathroom very sparse and showing wear. Certainly not a dirty place, but not really as comfortable as my first impressions led me to expect. It has a very nice continental breakfast (complementary), and excellent service with the parking and the doormen. It is fairly priced for central Honolulu.

<Content>Decent location, but don't spend your dream vacation here My boyfriend  I stayed here for one night prior to moving back to the mainland. We couldn't endure even just one more night at our nightmare of a condo, so perhaps this hotel seemed a little bit better to us than it actually was. It sure beat sleeping on the floor with our resident manager banging on our door at 3 AM. Objectively, however, I can tell you that this is not a hotel you are going to want to stay at if you are looking for a 'dream vacation' in Hawaii. The only really great thing about this hotel is that it is literally adjacent to the Ala Moana Shopping Center, which is a must-see if you are in Honolulu. If you are looking for beaches, Ala Moana's beach is decent for views, not so much for laying out or swimming as it is full of rocks. Waikiki is a considerable distance away, probably about a 15-20 minute walk from Ala Moana. So if you want paradise, look elsewhere. The hotel itself looks very inviting from the outside; all clean white with small lanais, a large lobby with a kind desk staff and bellhops and good valet parking. Check in/out was seamless, I don't really remember waiting, and they were very helpful in holding our mountain of luggage while we made last minute departure preps. The pool looked clean and well maintained, but surrounded by astroturf and looks like something out of the '50s. I'm not familiar with the food provided through room service, but I can tell you that even if you don't stay at this hotel, you MUST check out the fine dining rooftop restaurant, Aaron's. It is spectacular in terms of views, service, quality and creativity of the food. You can't go wrong with the flaming strawberries for dessert. There is an express elevator that goes right to Aaron's all the way up on the 30th floor. Typical prices for a gourmet restaurant, ranging from about $25 upwards. As for people who dub the area 'seedy'...it's entirely the opposite. There are maybe 2 or 3 'adult' clubs and ONE lingirie shop, nothing to fret over, and no homeless people roaming around. My boyfriend's parents actually live right across the street (Atkinson blvd.) from this hotel in a nice building and they walk everywhere with no problems.  The condition of the hotel was OK. The rooms were somewhat outdated with all salmon pink and light green, with light wood furniture similar to that found in hotel furniture outlets, and the beds were rather uncomfortable. We were provided a 20 inch TV with cable. I don't remember the bathrooms except for them being small, typical of any hotel on O'ahu. They advertise 'laundry facilities' for their guests, but I wouldn't count on them. They are only on two floors; one of with had only 2 each of washers and dryers costing $1 per load with a long wait to get to them, and the other one had been closed down since it is on one of the floors being renovated into condominiums. There are actually several floors being renovated, and the elevator will not stop at them. Out of curiosity, we decided to take the stairs to check out one of the floors and found that they are being COMPLETELY gutted out. I expect that there must be a lot of noise now as they get closer to completing the renovation. If you are a budget traveller, I would reccomend looking at other places in the area such as maybe the Holiday Inn, which might not be as dated or noisy what with all the construction. I stayed at the Doubletree during my first visit to O'ahu and found it to be quite comfortable, but a bit pricy. The location was prime, being right in between Waikiki and Ala Moana, on Ala Moana boulevard. This is not the worst hotel I've stayed at on the island...by all means, stay away from the Aqua Marina hotel, which was a deathtrap. If you want to be close to Ala Moana for around $90/night (a good price for a hotel in that area), plan on using TheBus extensively (as Ala Moana probably has the largest terminal in the immediate area), and don't care about the outdated decor, this might be an OK choice.

<Content>Great Location I see that some reviewers found problems here,but I'm here to say that we thought this hotel was great !Checkin was quick and we got the [slow to arrive] elevator up to our room on the 26th floor..view across Ala Moana shopping mall to the ocean !Our room was in good condition,clean  with comfortable beds..the aircon unit was quiet too,which is not always the case.Part of this hotel is being converted to condos,but we did not hear work being carried out and were only aware of this due to the model of the finished property on display in the foyer.We liked this hotel,but make sure your room is as good as ours was,as I suspect there may be a big variation between rooms.

<Content>It doesn't get any worse ... Talk about the armpit of Western Civilization! It was awful! The food was barely edible, the rooms were stinky and the elevators were frightfully slow. I would have rather slept on the street! If you stay there, make sure you take some lysol disinfectant.

<Content>A dump We wound up in this horrible excuse for a hotel because our flight was cancelled and this is where American Airlines put us up for the night.First, the rooms are vintage 1975 Holiday Inn, small, shabby, and in need of a complete makeover. The elevators are slow, the ventilation system incapable of reducing the humidity, and the smell of mold and mildew was pervasive.The hotel adjoins the Ala Moana mall and appears to be the favorite hotel of locals from other islands who stay here to shop. If all I needed was a place to sleep and shower I could put up with this dump for a night or two. But I'll bet you there are better places to sleep for the same money. If you're planning a trip to Hawaii and are attractred by the low rates of this hotel you'll be please to know that you're going to get what you paid for. You'll find a small room, horrible service, no beach, and bad food. Don't even think about wasting one dollar at this property.

<Content>Aloha This was my first trip to Hawaii - I came for a family reunion, part of which was in the Rumors nightclub in the Ala Moana. I found the hotel to be extremely pleasant, very clean and quiet. My only issue which someone else mentioned was the fact that of the 6 elevators, two were out of service, and one becomes an express elevator in the evenings for the resturant on the roof. That left 3 elevators to service 30+ floors. The hotel was full, so at peak times, I waited sometimes close to 15 mins for an car. Other than that, I have no complaints. The lounge was a nice break at the end of the day, and the staff were always courteous and pleasant, even going out of thier way to help me find my missing digital camera. Its a short walk to the Ala Moana park, which is a nice quiet place to escape the city. I would highly recommend the Ala Moana to anyone, unless they want to stay right on Waikiki beach.

<Content>hotel is in need of repairs A friend and I stayed here for four nights in July and we found the room to be okay but not worth the cost. Pretty much everything in the room looks dated and needs to be replaced. The most fustrating thing about the hotel was the elevators. For almost the entire time we were there, only two or at the most, three out of six were working. We had to wait a very long time to catch one - usually had to take one going up in order to go back down. Mentioned this to the front desk and in a how many times have I heard this complaint sort of way, was told it was because of all the construction going on (the hotel is converting a portion of the rooms to condos). Not sure how long the conversion will take but probably will not stay here again until after it's completed.

<Content>As Bette Davis would say, "Whatta dump!" Can't say enough bad things about this hotel. Location is fine if you're really interested in spending lots of time at a shopping mall, which is probably why the place is absolutely crawling with young Japanese tourists. It's walking distance to the beach, but we have better beaches here in Chicago than this one! Nothing like you imagine Honolulu beaches should be. And right outside the hotel is a whole block of girlie show nightclubs, bookstores, lingerie shops, etc. Not a neighborhood for an evening stroll. The hotel room was among the worst I've ever seen, probably not having been decorated since the 1970s. Place is undergoing conversion to condos (at least partially, the hotel desk claimed ignorance), so nothing is being taken care of, except the elevators (which means you often have to wait since some of them are out of commission). I was there on business, so my expectations were not as high as they would have been for a vacation stay. If I had booked this hotel for a vacation, I would have been really let-down. Save yourselves. Look elsewhere.

<Content>long walk to the beach/ scary elevators Me and my husband recently stayed at this hotel for our honeymoon and also to watch the pro bowl. Our stay was from feb 9-15 2005. I found the lobby to be nice but once you get in the elevator you become terrified by the shaking and the fact that they do not stop alligned with the floor that your getting off at . The walk to the beach was about 20 minutes and also to any decent restaurant. the hotel food was ok but way to expensive for what you got. Our room was small and you could here everything that the couples in the room next to us did and said. we were rudly awokin several times one night from loud sounds in the adjacent room. I wouldent reccomend this hotel to anyone looking to lay out and relax while in hawaii.

<Content>Needs an overhaul Stayed there four nights for business. Pool: Nice and clean but loud from traffic noiceRoom: OK. Mattress was so bad, I could feel the buttons pop through. Seemed OK after the maid and I flipped the mattress. Needs more light in the room. The best thing though was the shower. Lots of power.Location: If you like the mall, your staying at the right place. Less then two minutes and your your there.The Ala Moana must be going through a transition. They have big display set up in the lobby for CONDO's. You can hear them in the afternoon working on it.Would I stay here again? NO. Too far away from all the great places to eat in Waikaki.

<Content>Loved it!! This is what a hotel should be! I'm so glad I found this hotel after a yucky night in another hotel. When dreaming of a place in paradise, this is it! Leann at the front desk was SO helpful. The front lobby is full service: concierge desk, bellhop, lots of gift shops and right next to the mall. Great parking and easy to find. The bar on the 36th floor offers great views and is a great place to relax after a day of touring and beaching! I highly recommend this to anyone going to paradise!

<Content>Thieves at the Ala Moana Hotel The valets at the Ala Moana took my rental vehicle out for hamburgers and fries (they left the order scribbled on a piece of paper on the drivers seat). After waiting for 15 minutes for one valet to find my keys, another valet pulled them from his pocket instead of from the rack where they were supposed to be. This tells me that this was the person who took my vehicle.When I got into the vehicle I discovered a $1500 camera missing. This means that either the valet took the camera or left the vehicle unlocked and it got broken into.The hotel will not take responsibility for this. If you have to stay here, do not valet park your car.

<Content>Not bad for the price My husband and I just returned from a 6-day stay in Honolulu (vacation/business). We spent 2 nights at the Ala Moana Hotel before moving on to the Outrigger Reef (courtesy of my work). We were able to get a $99 room overlooking the city - not the most beautiful view - but the room served our needs. Our room was fairly small and we were not given a queen bed as requested, so we ended up having to sleep separately in the double beds. The room certainly shows some wear and looks dated, but appears to be clean for the most part. It looked like there was some water stain on one of the walls in our room however. The Ala Moana seems to cater mostly to international visitors, business travelers (flight crews for example), conventions/business meetings, and hosting local parties (birthday parties, wedding receptions).The concierge desk wasn't overly helpful and gave vague directions when we asked for information about driving to Hanauma Bay. The garage always had room in it to park, though some of the spaces are tight. It was very convenient to have the Ala Moana Shopping Center right next door...in fact, there is a pedestrian bridge connecting them.Ala Moana Beach Park is a few blocks down the street. We were able to walk from our room to the water in about 15-20 minutes.All in all, it was an okay hotel for the price, but for a longer stay I would choose another hotel.

<Content>I would return ALoha All,I recently stayed at the Ala Moana Hotel 26-30August. We had a great stay. The concierge was helpful with directions. Plus the front desk accomodated my request for a late check out. Even if we were unable to checkout later we were offered the use of the hospitality suite. Our room was clean although a bit small. We had a view of the city and the mountains. Parking was not a problem, any time we returned we were able to find a parking spot in the hotel garage. Overall we had a great experience and would definately return.

<Content>Great location; excellent staff After years of trying assorted lodging in Honolulu while on business trips, kept comparing them all to the Ala Moana Hotel's level of service. As an island resident, oceanview isn't a priority for me -- staff service level, quality of room decor/amenities, location, and _quiet_ are my high priorities. And the Ala Moana offers me all that, plus easy access to Ala Moana Shopping Center for shopping  dining.This is my O`ahu home away from home.

<Content>Cheap and shabby This hotel is fine for the very budget-minded traveler.... and they do cater to the Japanese tourist which is completely fine, but certainly adds to the atmosphere of the place. It's right next to a mall which is handy. It just seemed kind of shabby, but very clean and the staff was very pleasant.

Some hotels are stuck on the 3pm check in...they could not have been more accomodating...the rooms are well furnished..not fancy..but very nice...the staff was excellent..go for the ocean veiw..not much more than the mountain or partial ocean...excellent restaurants... we'll be back!!! Thank you!
