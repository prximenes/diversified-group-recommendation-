<Content>Nice place to stay in Paris Hotel is well located. 3 min walk to metro, 15-20 min walk to Montmartre, and 15 min walk to Opera to catch a bus to airport. Gare du Nord is 10 min ride by bus 43. Hotel is clean and well kept. Personnel is friendly, helpful and speaks good English in case if you are stranger to French. Rooms are typical european rooms with A/C and adjustable heating. Bathroom is clean and good size. My room was facing the street, but noise was bearable. Breakfast is good and hearty (eggs, meats, cheeses, cereals) and served in cute basement, which used to be a cellar. Room safe is also helpful.

<Content>Very Good Hotel We have stayed at the Paris Albion Hotel for 7 nights in December and found this hotel exactly as it was described in the website - Simple yet nice and comfortable and very clean. Prior to our arrival I confirmed my reservation with the hotel staff and asked whether we could have 2 double superior rooms instead of 2 twin superior rooms. The reception staff, which speaks very good English, quicly replied that our request could be met and everything was confirmed. Upon our arrival we found the rooms we requested and the receptionist gave us a map showing the metro and the many sights of Paris. Rooms aren't big, but have comfortable beds, a flat screen TV and a good bathroom. The only negative point on the rooms is that the 'closet' is very small especially for 2 persons. Other than that everything was very good, including central heating. The staff cleaned the room perfectly every day and changed the linen, towels, soap etc every day as well. During our stay the hotel had a small problem with the heating service which meant that the heating in the rooms (including water) was off during one night but by the morning the problem was solved and of course this was not the hotel's fault.Breakfast is served in the breakfast room downstairs and is worth the money. In fact you get a good english breakfast including scrambled eggs and bacon together with various types of cured meats, cheese, jams, juices, cereals, tea, coffee, etc. The staff here are also very helpful (although they know less English than the reception staff). The hotel is situated in a very good area which is full of good restaurants without being too busy nor noisy. There are 2 metro stations (ST George and Notre Dame de Lorette) which are practically 1 minute away from which you can get to all the attractions of Paris. By foot you can easily get to Montmatre, Sacre Ceur and Opera Garnier area.I would advise anyone who wants to stay in a simple very good hotel to visit Paris to go ahead and book the Albion.

<Content>Real Paris (i think?) I am definetely going back to Hotel France Albion!!! I stayed in a standard double with my boyfriend for 3 nights in Oct 2008. The room itself was basic but comfortable however the main drawcard was the location.It's convenient enough to the main sights (5 min walk to metro or if you're energetic you can walk to the lourve) but also away from all the tourists so you feel like you're really in the heart of parisian life. One street over there are fantastic bakeries  fruit markets for a cheap eat. Plus you can walk up the hill to Abbesses where there are some funky cafes  shops. The room itself had a comfy bed, double glazed windows (we had no probs with noise), ensuite bathroom, tv. By no means luxurious... but very practical.We really enjoyed our stay  I would totally recommend it.

<Content>clean, safe and friendly My husband and I celebrated our 10th wedding anniversary with a first-time trip to London, Paris and Brussels. While searching for a hotel in Paris, we looked to www.tripadvisor.com for advice. Sure glad we did. We picked the Hotel France Albion based on the favorable reviews posted on the site. Booking was a breeze. We went to the hotel's website and they responded very quickly. Our plans changed and we had to move back our arrival date. Fabulous Fabienne assured us that would be no problem, and there would be no extra charge. She and Kelly (this hotel has plenty of friendly, competent staff) helped us complete our tourist visa requirements by faxing a confirmation of our booking directly to the French Embassy in Manila, and supplied us a copy through our travel agent. We doubt many other hotels would do that.The room was small but very clean. We requested a non-smoking room and that's exactly what they gave us. We stayed at a double room with bath on an upper floor. Looking out the window, we had a bonus glimpse of the Eiffel Tower. We did have to look past tin roofs which were not exactly pleasing to the eye, but as long as we gazed upward and towards the Eiffel, the view was okay. We used the in-room safe, and even though we did not leave all our valuables there, we felt very secure and protected. Every morning we'd leave the room key with the front desk, and Fabienne would always give us the weather forecast for the day. We'd come back from our sightseeing at past 11pm. We never felt unsafe walking the few meters from the St. Georges metro station to the hotel. We skipped the breakfast option and instead bought delicious croissants, etc. at a boulangerie a short distance from the Notre Dame de Lorette metro station. It's on a narrow street by the side of the church. Around the corner is a Monop grocery and a mini grocery store from where we got our supply of bottled water for the duration of our stay.The hotel is walking distance to the Opera and Montmartre area. Since we arrived from London via Eurostar at Gare du Nord station, we just walked to the hotel. The website said it takes only 15 minutes, but since we were not familiar with the area and had to stop several times to check our map, it took us 30 minutes walking at a very easy pace. We had a great time in Paris, thanks in part to this wonderful hotel. Would we stay there again if we returned to Paris? Definitely!

<Content>2 star prices, 3 star service I booked this lovely hotel for a weekend with three other friends, quite last minute. It is situated off a main street in a charming area between opera and Montmartre, with easy access to both, and to Gare du Nord; and near 3 metro stations. I've stayed in a few 2 star hotels in Paris and this is by far the best. The rooms were very clean, and well decorated, and the bathrooms large (for Paris), bigger than some 4 stars I've stayed at. They even have bathrobes. The room service menu is wide and not overpriced. The staff were helpful, and there are lovely places to eat and shop in the streets around. We didn't have the breakfast and the internet in the foyer is expensive but otherwise we all really enjoyed it and I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Best Hotel Staff I have encountered in my travels. I stayed in this hotel in September when I visited Paris on a weekend break. The Hotel got very good reviews on this and other sites hence the reason I chose it. I was not disappointed, it was in a great location with the metro station St George just a two minute walk away or if you preferred a 10 minute walk would take you to the Opera House. We availed of both options having purchased a two day pass for the Hop on Hop off sightseeing bus one of the stops was at the Opera House. We were very pleased with the Hotel, the rooms though small ( we were expecting this) the bathroom was a good size and everything was in working order no complaints at all. We had breakfast two mornings we found it to be a bit pricey (at 鈧?2 each ) for what was on offer. We found some nice little restaurants in the vicinity of the Hotel and a large supermarket that sold all the familiar toileteries, water, chocolate etc.But I will say that the staff at this Hotel made a huge impression on me they were so helpful and friendly. On our farrival at the hotel just as we got to reception to check in I discoverd that I had left my mobile phone in the taxi, I was devastated as like most people my phone is like an extra hand to me, the young man on duty that night ( I must apologise I cannot recall his name) couldnt have been more helpful, he used his own mobile to send a text message in French to my phone in case somebody picked it up, he rang and rang my phone but to no avail. I did make contact with O2 in Ireland suspended the service on my phone . As I had it insured I was required to report the loss to the French Police, the next day the young lady on duty in reception kindly typed up a letter (in French ) for me to take to the Police station outling what I required, this proved to be so helpful for me as it only took me 10 minutes in the Police station to get the required form. This Hotel is a little gem with its staff its crowning glory, I will be back and I will be recommending it to family and friends who will be visiting this wonderful city.

<Content>Clean and Friendly You can add a star to the rating if a small room doesn't bother you. Actually, even though the room was small, it was well planned out so you didn't feel crammed in. Nice size bathroom. We felt the 120-Euro double was well worth the price. The room came with many amenities, such as his and hers terrycloth robes, hair dryer, plenty of good shampoo and soap, nice supply of large, fluffy towels and excellent maid service. A very friendly and helpful front desk. Location is also good, about halfway between Montmartre and the Opera Garnier (walking distance to both) - one block to Metro (Notre Dame de Lorette). Breakfast is not included and is an additional 12 Euros per person. We opted to have breakfast at nearby cafe for 8 Euros. We enjoyed our stay.

<Content>Nice and clean room. I was making a stop over in Paris from the 23 to 26 sept,2008, 3 nights. I choose this hotel based in the good reviews I found.The reservation: Fast and trouble free in their own web-site but somehow non of the discounts advertised in the rates page applied to me. When I asked why, the person in charge got defensive and said that there is a explanatory note that states that during some special periods they may have this discounts but not in september. Although it does not says when. You have to pay a one night deposit and there is a charge for cancelling the reservation.The room: Adequate size for a single room in Paris. Nice bathroom. I really believe that the cleaning crew makes an excellent job and the bathroom is restocked daily.The service: The day front desk is average, the night one very helpful and exact with the wake-up calls. No help to assist you with the suitcases at the arrival or departure. I was not able to program the safe in my room therefore I decided not to use it.I did not make use of the breakfast service.Check-out: They offer to charge you in Dollars but check the exchange rate before you decide. The price is good for Paris.

<Content>Great Staff = Good Hotel The staff at the Hotel France Albion was really great! They planned trips for us to take and would call around to get us into the things we really wanted to see.... we had decided that we would wait until we got there to try to book the appointments, which is a bad idea, but the staff made it happen for us! We went on a very romantic river dinner boat cruise on the seine which was amazing plus we got to take in a show at the Moulin Rouge which was very entertaining and not trashy at all. You can walk to the Moulin Rouge from the hotel... plus we loved a dining facility near the hotel that they suggested yummy yummy yummy... it was a little pricy but soooo good! The staff spoke English well and was great. Only things we did not enjoy about staying at this hotel was that we did have to get on the metro station a lot to see the major sites, we witnessed people peeing on the street as we walked home two nights in a row, we were not in a high tourist part of town so the locals in a grocery store hated us, we had to leave our hotel key with the front desk every time we left which made us a little nervous, and the hotel was not easy to find if you did not get off the metro at the exact stop. I would suggest staying in this hotel because of the staff because the two women we dealt with were wonderful!! They were perfect and made the experience awesome. Even with the few negatives I listed above I would stay at this hotel again because we are young and did not mind some of the things that went on that were not so wonderful. The pros overcome the cons!

<Content>Great value, friendly staff! Was impressed with how helpful/friendly the staff was. Don't get me wrong, I love Paris, but Albion staffs' attitude was refreshing given Paris can sometimes be an unfriendly place.Room was clean and comfortable, and well located less than a block from the Metro in the 9th. Nice neighborhood behind Notre Dame de Lorette, very easy to find a bite to eat, etc. Would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Great Deal in Paris The Albion is a good value hotel in Paris. It is clean, the rooms are a decent size and the staff were very friendly. The hotel is located very close to a metro/subway stop, making it easy to get around. Many sites are also within walking distance (Opera is very close). The staff allowed us to change our reservation by one night for no fee when our plans changed. They also made a few phone calls helping us to find a certain restaurant.The shower was clean and the water was hot. Shower gel and other soap is provided. I would ask for a room with a courtyard view. We had two windows facing an inner courtyard which was pretty and quiet.This hotel isn't fancy or elaborate, but it is a great deal in the heart of Paris.

<Content>Good for a 2 Star We didn't know what to expect and our first room was really small but very clean. Maid service was very good. We did have alot of noise as we were facing the street. Bring earplugs and you'll be okay. The location is very good. Lots of great shops nearby and within walking distance of many great neighbourhoods. The staff is friendly. The night staff is the friendlist I've ever encountered and that's rare! I wish I knew the name of the fellow on night duty when we checked out - this guy is the best!Some rooms are larger so if you're looking for more space consider upgrading. One room we were in did smell like cigarette smoke which I believe is permitted in this hotel. I'm not sure if they have non-smoking rooms.It's a good little hotel for the price.

<Content>Tha Absolute Best! I believe any good review should be prefaced with a little about the reviewer so as to gauge probable caution used in determining a choice of stay. That said, my wife and I are in our early 50's, upper middle-class professionals, frequent US travelers (first time Europe) with tastes ranging from Broadway to Wal-Mart... sushi to McDonalds. We're fun-loving but have little desire to abode with/near the rascals of the world just to save a $ (learned long ago that it's not worth your life). We're not puritans or prudes... just real people who can, at our age, buy our way out of steerage if warranted.That said, we love to find a metro area base camp whose musts are 1) safety, 2) cleanliness, 3) vicinity and 4) value, then trek all day and night. I am so very pleased to report that this hotel meets all those requirements AND MORE and is an easy walk/metro ride to everything! Having stayed in many nice properties while on business, this one holds its own and is quiet to boot. The hotel and rooms are small (compared to US... but plenty big enough) and clean. The Manager and staff were EXTREMELY personable (all in English), jovial, professional, attentive and courteous. The hotel door (single entrance) is locked late at night (just knock) as a precautionary measure, which I loved, however we never ONCE felt at ease walking around the entire Montmarte/Paris area... even Pigalle at midnight (touristy=safety). I was amazed. I was also really glad that we got out of the heart of Paris... Montmartre was SO much more alive and indicative of everyday French living.Folks this hotel, its personnel, its surrounding area and its value are a slam dunk/no brainer. Don't think twice.. just book it and relax.

<Content>Nice Hotel We have just returned from a 4 night stay at the Hotel France Albion and found it a very pleasant place to stay. The surrounding area is safe and quiet at night and it's only a couple of hundred yards from the nearest Metro station.Having read previous reviews, I was pleasantly suprised at the size of the double room with ensuite bathroom. The bedroom had a double bed, small built-in wardrobe and table and two chairs. The bed seemed a little hard initially but we slept very well every night and awoke with no aches or pains. There was also an in room safe but we did not use this.The bathroom had a (very small) bath, over bath shower, toilet and basin with soap and shampoo and even shoe-shine!! Breakfast was available but we did not have this. The room was cleaned daily to a high standard and the lobby, lift and stairways were always clean.The staff were always pleasant and in my opinion the only thing I really would have liked was tea/coffee facilities in the room.

<Content>Fantastique! I was a bit wary of Paris hotels from reading some of the reviews online but this one was a real find. As mentioned before it's close to two metro stations and therefore close to everything! But it's quiet at night and the room we had (superb double, 6th floor) wasn't too small with a nice view of the tour eiffel. The bathroom was small but well stocked and the bath just big enough for two :) Most importantly it was clean and comfortable.The staff were very friendly especially the fella doing nightshift, who recommended a fantastic restaurant nearby - Jean's Restaurant - for some great French cuisine. There's also a supermarket selling cheap wine across the street and a bakery round the corner.Getting there is easy too. Get the RER to Gare du Nord then either walk it (as we did) or take the metro about four stops to the Notre-Dame de Lorette stop and walk up the road. We hope to make it back to Paris in a couple of months and will most likely stay here again. It's great value for money and i'd thoroughly recommend it to anyone. As long as you don't book it when we want it!

<Content>If we go to Paris again we would return to this hotel! We chose the France Albion because of the high ranking on this website. My wife had her doubts because it is only rated 2 stars but I guess this is because of the size of the rooms.Our room was small but not too small for a long weekend. It had a small closet with a free safe which I appreciated. The bathroom was comparably big and even had a tub. The temperature and pressure of the shower could easily be adjusted. Everything was very clean and it wasn't very noisy but not totally quiet either.The location of the place is very convenient. There are metro stations of two different lines very close and there are many restaurants, bars and shops within 5-10 minutes walking distance. Within 15-20 minutes walking distance you can get to the big department stores as well as to the Place Pigalle area. Even Montmartre can easily be done by foot .For a longer stay the room and its closet might be a little too small but for a stay of a few days this is really a very good choice. If we return to Paris (which we will hopefully) we will certainly go back to this hotel.

<Content>Hotel France Albion, a great place to stay in Paris Hotel France Albion was great. Being a two star hotel, we weren't sure what to expect, but were pleasantly surprised with our double room which was tidy and clean, with a nice bathroom. The hotel staff were all very friendly and helpful and they let us leave our luggage in the hotel after checking out. The subway is literally one minute's walk from the hotel and Montmarte about 10-15 mins walk. The hotel is also surrounded by restaurants and convenience stores. Perfect location and a great economical place to stay. Apart from our room smelling a bit smokey, no other complaints.

<Content>Great Location Nice bright clean newly decoreated hotel. Day staff were really helpful, guy who' s on in the evening less so. (Mind you I miss the quirky Paris 2 star hotels of the past ,with sloping floors and toilets situated as you opened the room door, not to mention steaming cisterns as the toilet was on the same pipe as the shower. There's nothing memorable about this place)The strong Euro worked against us though; having paid for 1 night on booking, with the remainder to be paid on check out, the room cost 拢10 per night more than when we booked it. C'est la vie!

<Content>Lovely little hotel, good area We had a lovely 4 days at this hotel which is at the bottom of the hill on which The Sacre Coeur stands. Lots of bars/restaurants locally. As other reviews have already said - it is very clean, excellent value for a two star. The hot and cold buffet breakfast was good value at the special offer rate of 10 euros, when you consider that a small coffee in a cafe can cost 3.50 euros. Breakfast is served in a very characterful breakfast room.We did not find traffic noise to be a problem, and we are used to silence at night. It is not a main road, 'though it is a road which is used for access and therefore there is traffic going by, but in February the road was quiet between midnight and 6.30am.There are two metro stations very close by, but we did not use them at all, as it was quite possible to walk to all of the main attractions and was only 20 minutes from The Louvre.

<Content>Average 2 star hotel Bought 1 night here along with Eurostar ticket as a package. Not bad at all, but for 70-80 euro you can probably find better place. As a summary... Pros: close to metro, not far from de Nord train station, not expensive, clean roomCons: quite long time to walk to the center, bad noise isolation, small room (single has single bed, not more)Next time I would probably find more interesting place to stay ))

<Content>Excellent stay at Reasonable Price Hotel France Albion is an excellent 2star class hotel centrally located in Paris and with very convenient connections from there.For the price, it is 'value for money!'.The hotel is well maintained - clean and neat - and the rooms too are taken care of properly.The staff are quite courteous and speak proper English too.One improvement can be done - of keeping coffee/tea bags and kettle - in room at least in the 'superior' rooms!

<Content>Great location, reasonable price Stayed at this hotel for just over a week from Xmas 07 into the new year. I thought it was good value for the money (EUR 100/120 per night for a twin) and we even got a new year card and a bottle of champagne! Overall it was a good experience and I'd certainly consider staying again.OverallPros:+ Location - close to Montmartre, Louvre and the gardens. Main shopping district with Galeries Lafayette and Printemps (famous department stores) is a short walk away. + Transport - metro station is just down the street+ Food - bakeries, grocers etc are just round the corner. Supermarket 20m from front door.+ Staff generally helpful and spoke English. Cons:- Room is a bit small (typical for Paris though)- Pricey breakfast (EUR 12), not worth it with bakery close by- Wifi expensive, PC in lobby is cheaper and has free printing though- Someone mentioned the lift and staircase - small and cramped lifts and staircases seem to be the norm for this grade of hotel in France as they're mainly in converted apartments built decades ago.

<Content>First family trip to Paris We were looking for somewhere to stay that provided comfort and value and were not disappointed with the France Albion. Its locations is also excellent being in easy reach of many good restaurants in Montmartre and convenient for the main tourist sites.

<Content>Great hotel for the price Very nice hotel for the price, the staff were welcoming, helpful and cheerful. The hotel itself looked very nice both outside and in, the rooms were tidied daily to a high standard and the breakfast included was good value, though it regularly ran out of certain items and the staff did not seem to top them up without being asked. The view was not really existent (a courtyard at the back) but this didn't bother us. The location was good (close to quite a few resteraunts), it was on a relatively quiet road. I think that the staff sometimes were quite loud in the corridoors when talking to each other on other floors.All in all, a good place to stay for the price, would go there again if we needed a budget hotel in Paris.

<Content>France Albion: decent hotel, interesting location Clean room of good size, some signs of refurbishing in bathroom, large enough bed, correct staff. Only negative points: no separate luggage room, you have to leave your luggage in a conference room right next to the entrance. We locked ours to the heating pipes because, basically, any one could walk in from the street and grab it. The promised bath robes were not present in the superior room and were not available when asked for at the front desk. Overall, a very decent hotel for Paris, the price was ok (90 euros/night when booked directly via internet, autumn promotion - didn't take the breakfast because cheaper in bakeries), the neighbourhood is safe and conveniently located: easy 20-minute walk to Louvre / Montmartre, there are two metro stops nearby, 15 minute walk to Gare du Nord. Baker, butcher, pharmacist behind the corner. Would recommend.

<Content>very good Stayed at this hotel for two nights with my boyfriend and loved every minute of it. We had a double room on the top floor with plenty of space for us and our bags. Bathroom was spotless and well equiped with complimentary bathrobes and toiletries which were replaced daily. The staff were very friendly and helpful and spoke good english. The hotel is within walking distance of all the main paris attractions and eurostar terminal and is situated between two metro stations. We didn't eat at the hotel as there are so many cafes and restaurants in the area. The only slight downside was the very narrow staircase up to the room and the lift which is very small and lurches. This hotel is worth so much more than it's two stars and the price.

<Content>Does what it says on the tin! This is a clean hotel with very friendly staff. It doesn't pretend to be anything else and doesn't charge high prices. They did mess our booking up but were very quick to rectify it, and offer free breakfast in return. The rooms are small but vary throughout the hotel - our suggestions would be to view the room first - they seem to have alternatives and are happy to oblige. It is a good base for sight seeing, about 30 minutes walk from the Louvre, 15 minutes from shops and 15 minutes from the Mulin Rouge. It is near to the Metro - we didn't use it though as we enjoy walking. There are many cheap, ok restaurants near by and the two local supermarkets sold cheap wine etc. We took a travel kettle and coffee, tea etc plus a cork screw and the staff didn't seem to mind! If you want a cheap base in Paris so you have more money to spend out and don't want to get bed bugs and want a smile from the staff - look no further!

<Content>Great value for money. The rooms at the Albion are pleasant and clean. The staff are very friendly and helpful and someone is available 24 hours a day. The breakfast is a ok and the hotel generally feels safe and secure. I have stayed at the Albion three times now because I think it's very good value for money. You cant beat the location because it's very close to the Metro station and is on one of the most central lines. The museums are easily navigable using the underground. It is a very short walk to the big stores (Galleries Lafayette and Printemps) as well as being very near to the Gare du Nord. The streets around the Albion have to be seen both during the day and in the evening. In the daytime the streets are lined with shops and stalls selling the most beautiful fresh food and wine you have ever seen. There are boutiques, supermarkets and a couple of cinemas nearby too. There are plenty of nice places to have lunch. In the evening, you will be surrounded by restaurants of many cultures. There's a lot of al fresco restaurants and also some very nice bars. I consider myself to be a regular customer at the Albion.

<Content>Would stay again... My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights while we were in Paris. This hotel was very nice and clean and was in a good location: only a short walk to the nearest metro station. We stayed in a superior double room and it was roomy for a European hotel. The bathroom was very large with a full size tub/shower. Our room also had A/C which we didn't really need except for the first day we were there, but it was nice that it was available.The front desk staff was extremely friendly and all spoke English which was helpful to us since our French was not very good. There was also a market across the street that we used to by some water, fruit, snacks, etc. There are also a number of food shops that sold produce, baked goods etc. only one street over and there was also a bakery on the way to the metro station which we went to almost every morning for breakfast.Overall a very pleasant stay.

<Content>Perfect for our trip We booked this hotel as part of our United Airlines package and it was perfect for our needs. Clean and in a safe location. Rooms were adequate size, in fact our bathroom was huge. Maid everyday to make our beds and give us new towels. Two Metro stops rigjht nearby. Staff is friendly and speak English and put up with me trying to speak French. We had a courtyard room (courtyard is size of my thumb) but when you are in Paris are you spending your time in your hotel room or out and about in the city? Our breakfast was included in the cost but 12 E for breakfast was a bit high. ESPECIALLY since the dollar is worth about as much as a piece of paper. Wait let me clarify, the dollar is worth as much as toilet paper.

<Content>Great, great place! Great little hotel - only 34 rooms - with an excellent service, perfect location, small but very good rooms and a nice breakfast that exceeds what you normally would expect in France.The hotel is newly renovated and the staff here is very helpfull, friendly and speak English. We stayed at the 5 floor - and even though we were facing the street we were not bothered by the street noise (not at all).The location is excellent and we will definately stay here again

<Content>Good value, good location We were very pleased with this hotel. Five of us stayed at the France Albion for three nights. The rooms were reasonably sized for Paris, and nicely fitted out. The hotel doesn't have many facilities, but that suited us - we wanted to be out visiting Paris. We didn't try the breakfast - at 鈧?2 it's a bit pricey, but not unusually so for Paris hotels. With so many great cafes within just a step, we had plenty of excellent, cheap alternatives. There's a fantastic boulangerie a block away. The little cafe at the bottom of the street, facing the back of Notre Dame de Lorette is excellent too, and the people who run it are really nice.The location of the hotel is great. It wasn't my first choice, but it worked really well for us - at the heart of the 9th arrondissement. There are two metro stations within a very short step, so it's quick to get everywhere.

<Content>Lovely and central but VERY noisy! I checked out lots of reviews for this hotel before I went, so specifically asked for a room on the inner courtyard away from the street. However when we got there, we were told there wasn't such a room available! This meant that it was very noisy at night, the street seems to be a major cut-through for freight traffic, and the lights from the bars across the street came through the curtains.But other than that it is a lovely little hotel for all it's two stars, better than some three stars I've stayed in! The staff were very helpful and friendly, rooms exceptionally clean, shower had good water pressure. Beds and towels were fresh everyday and breakfast was perfectly adequate. Although would highly recommend using one of the local pattiseries for something extra special (and cheaper).Overall, would recommend IF you can get a room off the road.

<Content>did not care Just come home two day early from this hotel managed to get our travel agent eurostar to bring us home early. Hotels fire sensors going off every 75 seconds outside our room reported this in the afternoon following day when we left about 9.15 following morning sensors still ringing every 75 seconds. My husband and I got no sleep all night and thanks to no rooms being availble thanks to the rugby world cup could not change rooms. Hotel did not seem too bothered that we had to put up with this noise all night. Nice hotel but would not recommend hey do not care about the customer.

<Content>Nice hotel, shame about the noise This hotel has a lot of things in its favour. It's very conveniently located, almost within sight of the St Georges metro station. The room we stayed in was very clean, especially the bathroom, which put the bathrooms of some 4-star hotels I've stayed in to shame. The staff were friendly and helpful, the area was pleasant and we always felt safe when coming and going to and from the hotel. The price of the room was good and there's a very handy little supermarket across the street for drinks and snacks.So why only three stars? One word: noise. There is some external noise if your room is located on the street-facing side of the hotel, but no more than you'd expect in a busy city like Paris. It's the noise from inside the hotel that's the real problem. During our visit we were treated to all manner of nocturnal disturbances, including a woman yodelling, laughing and shouting into the early hours, and shrieking from the upper floors the cause of which I wouldn't like to imagine. On top of this, there's the constant door slamming. The rooms have the kind of doors you might find in office buildings, and have no sound insulation whatsoever. Whenever anyone slammed their door (and our fellow guests seemed incapable of simply closing their doors) the sound would travel through the entire building. Not much help after midnight when you're trying to sleep.Basically, if you can sleep through any amount of racket or are prepared to invest in a set of industrial strength ear-plugs then this could be the perfect Parisian hotel for you. However, if noise is something that's going to bother you, you might want to look at other options. It's a shame really, as this one aspect lets down what would otherwise be a real gem of a hotel.

<Content>Excellent 2-star accommodation in Paris We have just come back from Paris and wanted to say how much we enjoyed our stay at the France Albion. The rooms were excellent and beautifully clean. The reception staff spoke good English and could not have been more helpful. The breakfast was very good value for money, there was everything you could want and the waitresses were efficient and and courteous. All the staff made you feel welcome and nothing was too much trouble for them. All in all an excellent choice. Thank you.David and Elizabeth Eastwood.

<Content>A LITTLE gem Stayed here for 5 nights. Single rooms a wee bit small but en suite shower room more than adequate. Rooms at front have nice street views and street noises. Rooms at back have no view but no noise. Room staff very attentive and efficient. Breakfasted on two days and at the reduced price of 10 Euros was good value for Paris. Staff were all very friendly with good English, although the night porter did appear to spend the night asleep. One of his jobs,I would assume, was to close the fire doors on each floor at night, but as with many hotels abroad this was never done.Close to metros, buses and train stations making all the sights easily accessable. We had the open topped bus pass for two days (covers four seperate routes), and a metro pass for two days. Both worked out well but maybe a one day bus pass would have sufficed as many of the sights were accessable on foot from the hotel.The ' bar' area is very small and the 'patio' area even smaller, really just an outside corridor with plants.Will probabley stay at this hotel again next year.

<Content>Average Hotel This hotel is fairly centrally located, close to a metro station and not too far from Gare du Nord. The rooms are basic yet kept very clean. For the price you cannot expect anything better in central Paris. We booked through Venere and when we arrived our rooms were not the ones we expected, they were sufficient though. Internet is 7 euro for half an hour, which is not really what you want to pay just to do online check in!

<Content>good location Very good location, near to 2 strategically placed Metero stations. Will be even better once the Opera station reopens.Room on 2nd floor small but had air-con which was good. Was right next to lift shaft, which was noisy until it broke down on the 2nd day! Main noise was however from some American guests who arrived at 3 am on the 2nd night and talked loadly into the night.Breakfast was really terrible considering they must have actively sought out bad food. The bakery across the road does wonderful bagettes and pastries for a few cents. Likewise the coffee was nasty. A pity really that they marr the whole experience by being so cheapskate. 鈧?2 for breakfast - maybe 鈧? would be fair.Overall not bad for the 鈧?0 a night I paid all-in. Normal rates are 84+12 breakfast AFAIR.

<Content>Nice hotel, good location, good value For a good value hotel I would highly recommend and definately stay again at this hotel.We had two rooms in the hotel and stayed for one night. The rooms were small which is very much the norm in Paris at this pricerange. Rooms had all you could need. Bathroom was of a high standard and relatively spacious in the double room. Single room was smaller but sufficient.Both rooms has a/c which was needed as there was street noise with the windows open. Perfectly quiet when windows closed however.Staff were friendly and helpful.Very close to 'Notre Dame' metro, 1 min walk and 10mins to Guard De Nord main train station in taxi. 2 or 3 stops to Mont Matre station Allesses.Would recommend and stay again at this hotel.

<Content>A clean, reasonably priced hotel, not for the claustrophobic though We stayed in the Hotel France Albion for 5 nights in a room-only basis, so I can't speak for the continental breakfast, but we found the hotel to be clean and the linen/towels/toiletries etc all to be perfectly acceptable, especially considering the price we paid for the rooms.They also provided us with a travel cot for our infant child, but with this in the room in conjunction with our suitcases, navigating the room became a bit of an obstacle course. The rooms are very small, I'm not sure if all Parisian hotels suffer from this due to the nature of the overpopulated city, but it was very cramped indeed.Despite this, we had a very pleasant stay, no real issues with noise or anything - although be aware that when exiting the hotel and turning left, when you pass the St-Georges metro stop you're more or less in red-light territory. We passed through it once or twice without any incident, so don't be worried, but just in case that would influence your decision at all.

We told the receptionist that that wasn't good enough as we had recieved confirmation by email. We were told that there was a mix up with the bookings and she recomended us to take a room at the Modial Hotel a few doors away, the room was small and badly in need of modernisation and depressing to say the least, we were then moved to a larger room after our protests we stayed two days and then at last were roomed in the France Albion for the last two days of our stay in Paris.

<Content>Nice clean hotel, GREAT service We stayed at the France Albion recently (June 2007) for 4 nights in a Superior Double Room (鈧?115/night) and we loved it. The hotel and the room were very clean and the service was remarkable. We were veryimpressed with this nice 2-star, which is definitely a very superior 2-star. This hotel is not luxurious and the rooms are small like they would be in most European hotels, but they are not tiny. In any case, we were not looking for luxury. When we first walked into the room (Room 10), we thought about how small it was, but we got over that pretty quick. The room was clean and tidy. The room has a small tv and a safe (great plus!). Our room had one window overlooking what they call 鈥渢he courtyard鈥? I wish I鈥檇 taken a picture so you could see, but the 鈥渧iew鈥? which wasn鈥檛 much, is what I was told that makes this a Superior room. I guess it makes for a quieter room, but in any case, Notre Dame de Lorette seemed like very quiet street. If I stay there again, I think I would try out the regular room. The bathroom had the usual basic amenities (bathrobes were a nice touch), a window which makes it nice and bright, and a shower/tub. Even in 4-star hotels you may find a dirty or slightly moldy shower curtain, but I don't think you ever will in this hotel. There was hot water all the time and good water pressure. I know in France you鈥檇 probably want to try a lot of different places to eat, but the hotel鈥檚 American-style buffet was really nice. I would definitely recommend trying it (scrambled eggs, bacon, potatoes, delicious cheese, ham, yogurt, cereal). Once you sit down, they will bring you great coffee and wonderful bread and croissants.Now, our favorite part about this hotel was Kelly! Kelly works at the front-desk and was extremely nice and helpful. She made recommendations, gave us directions, marked our maps, and even made us reservations for a dinner cruise and a cabaret-show. She is definitely one of the reasons we liked this hotel so much and why we鈥檇 recommend it so highly.Two more things...Use the metro... there is a couple of stations a block from the hotel and it鈥檚 incredibly easy to get around (Once you can explain to the metro person the kind of tickets you want in English and a bitof sign language... Of course if you speak French you will do much much better than us, but we had Kelly write it down for us on the second day, because the first day we had no luck with a kinda-rude metro lady) All the stations have easy-to-understand maps and signs.Also, the cabs always take longer than they say they will when you call them and it鈥檚 extremely hard to stop one on the street, so take that into account. It is a shame I can鈥檛 remember the name, but there was a wonderful restaurant, about two blocks from the hotel with incredible food and great service. We had lunch there on our last day. As soon as I find the business card, I will edit this posting... but I did give a card to Kelly, so if you are heading there pretty soon, ask her (it is notthe Fontaine Fiacre, she recommended it but we never tried it). Have fun in Paris!

<Content>Well above average 2 star! Four of us stayed four nights at the France Albion Hotel in Paris, in two rooms, at the start of May. Eurostar had recommended the hotel, and we found it excellent for our needs - clean, comfortable, with friendly staff, and conveniently located. Although the rooms were small they both had two chairs, always the sign of a comfortable hotel. Breakfasts (included in our package) were much better than we had expected - having muesli available would have been the icing on the cake!We have happily recommended the hotel to our friends.

<Content>Good price and location near Montmartre My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights last September. The hotel is small and located only a short walk from Montmarte and several Metro stations, making it a very easy base for sightseeing. We arrived about 9:30am so our room was not yet ready, but the woman at the reception desk were happy to provide us with a space to change and wash up. Throughout our stay, all of the staff were quite helpful in providing dining suggestions and directions. We stayed in a superior double room, which was small and basic, but nonetheless comfortable and clean. It seemed a very good deal for about 300 euros. The hotel offers a pay per use internet service in its bar and basic breakfast service. There are lots of small cafes close to the hotel.

<Content>Great location! This hotel was in a great location. It was very close to both the St. George and Notre Dame de Lorette stations. The neighborhood is great if you walk a little and there is a place very close by to do laundry. The room was good size with a bathroom  shower. The street is quiet and the hotel has internet access but you have to pay for it.

<Content>Stay Here!! This quaint hotel provided a wonderful place to stay on my recent girls trip through Europe. The hotel is reasonably priced, the staff is wonderful and accomodating, the rooms are clean, decently sized and the bathrooms were great. (The water pressure is crazy!)I would definitely stay here again, as the location worked as a good base for sightseeing. You can walk to L'Opera, Galleries Lafayette, St. George and more. If you're interested, the sightseeing bus picks up at L'Opera as well.I will definitely return!

<Content>Very Clean Well situated hotel just up from Opera area ( 10 min walk ) nearest metro is St Georges about a 3 min walk. Area is a safe and middle class one and there are plenty of places to eat and good local food shops in the area, selling fresh bread, meat, fruit etc. The Hotel...Firstly don't let the 2 star rating put you off, the rooms are not huge but perfectly adequate, they are cleaned every day and well kept. The bed linen is changed daily and is exceptionally clean, better than many 4 star hotels i have stayed in..Nice plump pillow on a decent fairly firm bed ensures a good night's sleep. The bathrooms are modern, clean and functional and towels, face cloths are changed daily. The road that the hotel is situated on is fairly quiet for a central area of Paris. The staff are friendly and helpful and all speak English, but best of all is the manager who went out of her way to assist me with many of my tourist type questions and terrible directional sense.If you are looking for a reasonably priced centrally located hotel with no frills BUT with high standards of cleanliness, then i would highly recommend this hotel. 2 recommendations, firstly get a buzzer entry phone system fitted on the door at night rather than allow anyone to walk in, secondly make sure the luggage room is kept locked at all times if guests are leaving their luggage there on the last day before picking up Julian

<Content>Fabulous Location My husband  I stayed here for our honeymoon for 9 days. We didn't need anything fancy but something clean and in a nice location. In a nutshell I absolutely loved this hotel! We were about 10 minutes away from Sacre Coeur in Montmartre, where there were tons of little shops and places to eat. The hotel itself was on a nice quiet street. There was a pub next door and across the street. We thought it was going to be loud on the weekends but it wasn't. I think it actually closed by midnight.The room was cute and decorated nicely. Yes it's a small room (remined me of the size of a college dorm room) but very functionable. I loved the huge windows in the room with the flower beds too.Things I didn't like:-No fridge - we liked to buy bottle water but didn't have anywhere to store them (there's a grocery store across the street)-No alarm clock and we forgot to bring one-Don't buy the breakfast! Way too expensive and not good. Go down the street to a bakery and get a croissant, much better and cheaper too.-Had to pay for internet which was okay but some places it's freeOverall I would definately stay here again. Staff was very friendly and helpful and you can't beat the location.

<Content>Hotel France Albion - Excellent Little Hotel My husband and I returned yesterday (23 April 2007) from our annual trip to Paris. We stayed at the Hotel France Albion for a second time. Again, we were not disappointed. The hotel staff were courteous and helpful and the room, albeit small, was spotlessly clean and pleasant. The day prior to our departure I required access to the internet to check in on line with Air France. The receptionist advised that the cost was 7 euro for 30 minutes or 10 euro for 1 hour. We explained we would only take approximately 5 or 10 minutes and were provided with free access. The weather during our visit was extremely hot for April. It reached 26 degrees each day which to us living in Manchester, England, was an absolute joy. The location of the hotel is superb and if you use a hotel as we do the France Albion is perfect. All we require is a place to store our belongings (each room contains a safe) and to shower and sleep. If you want luxury then you would need to pay substantially more as we did one year staying at the Hotel Jolly Lotti near to the Louvre, however, we still only used the hotel as a base and feel that the additional cost of a hotel is better used as spending money.I would also mention that we ate at the Ciel de Paris on the 56th floor of the Tour Montparnasse one evening. The views are breathtaking, the service was excellent and the food was pretty good (compared with Altitude 95). The meal for 2 cost 230 euro but that included a bottle of champagne and although some may consider this to be expensive it is still cheaper than a Bateaux tour along the Seine.I recommended the France Albion to another TA member Kiwigirl and would be very interested to know whether she actually stayed at the hotel and, if so, what her thoughts were.

<Content>Charming Hotel After reading many of the reviews on this website, we were convinced that this was the place to stay. The hotel met our expectations... We had booked a basic double room and upon arrival were issued a free upgrade to a superior double room. Our room was clean and made up every day. Althought it was small by North American standards, it was more than comfortable, and matched the pictures presented on the website. As well, the bathroom was surprisingly large, with a new soaking tub and a shower with amazing pressure. The hotel staff were all friendly, and all spoke English. There is an amazing organic bakery down the road, next to the church, which had unbelievable croissants... accordingly, we did not order the hotel breakfast, which relatively speaking was quite expensive at 12 euros. The hotel is walking distance to Gallery Lafayette, an amazing department store which cannot be missed, the Opera, and the Sacre Couer. All in all, a very pleasant stay at a hotel that we will surely consider again on our next trip to Paris.

<Content>Positive experince The hotel was in a convinient location, within walking distance to all attractions. We stayed at the hotel for 4 nights and had a good experince. We were usually not there during the day but the staff seemed pleasant and helpful whenever we needed anything. The rooms and bahtroom were clean and beds comfortable. We didn't expect the rooms to be big in size so no dissapointment. We used the elevator and even though it's small and little slow, it works and it's kind of cute as it only fits 2 people, with luggage. The internet was expensive as the card we purchased was 10 euros. We also didn't have breakfast there so I can't commend. Overall, with the prices in Paris as they are, I recommend it.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel I did my research with Trip Advisor before I booked and was not disappointed. To find great hotel in Europe is difficult, but the great reviews for the France Albion were right on the money. Our experience is Paris was amazing, and a great part of it was our stay at the France Albion. The manager and staff were extremely friendly. My husband and I were celebrating our 1 year wedding anniversary and they surprised us one evening with a small bottle of champagne. The hotel is centrally located, in between two metro stations (St. George and Notre Dame de Lorette). The rooms are small by American standards, but since 90% of the hotel rooms in Paris are the same it really did not matter. Another important point for me was the cleanliness. The bathroom was big and very clean as well. The airconditioning is a modern wall unit and worked very well, we had to turn it off because we were freezing at one point. Right in front of the hotel there is a small supermarket. Every morning we would buy prociutto, fruit, and yogurt. Then we went down the street and to the right, going towards the Notre Dame de Lorette Metro Station, right in front there is a bakery that sells amazing croissants and brioch. There is also a brasserie next to the hotel that sells delicious chicken. This saved us a lot of money, since the food is so expensive in Paris. All in all it was a perfect hotel and area for the price we paid. Unbeatable.

<Content>Excellent Location As one reviewer wrote, this is a 2* hotel but this certainly isn鈥檛 a bad point. The hotel is in a quiet location and yes it is off a side street, but all the streets are side streets which adds to the charm of Paris as a whole. As for 鈥榥o frills鈥? well for a 2* hotel you don鈥檛 expect too much but it had everything you needed - the room was clean, fresh and tidy. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was lovely with a really good hot shower and bath. As for 鈥榥o charm鈥? again maybe they were expecting too much but the hotel building itself is a classic French building and we overlooked the street from the 5th floor so overlooked more classic amazing apartments.We didn鈥檛 have breakfast there because it wasn鈥檛 cheap, but mainly because there are too many patisseries and caf茅鈥檚 to go to instead. Because we spent so much time exploring Paris, we only really met the staff on reception, but they were very nice and helpful. The French really appreciate (and almost expect) you to speak their language, however, the hotel staff were more than happy to help us along with our appalling pronunciation and our shameful lack of knowledge of the French language!!More than anything, this hotel is in a perfect location; it鈥檚 about a 10 minute walk to Sacre Coeur/Moulin Rouge area, 2 mins to St George metro station and no more than 5 minutes walk from Rue de Rivoli (excellent for caf茅鈥檚, bistro鈥檚 and restaurants) which is the start of all the main attractions.I would recommend this hotel if you want an excellent base for sightseeing in Paris, but if you want something more upmarket then this isn鈥檛 the hotel for you. I give it 4 out of 5 and would go back.Also, you must go to Chez Flottes, on Rue Cambon, just off Rue de Rivoli 鈥?excellent food/atmosphere/wine鈥he best French onion soup!!

<Content>Most excellent This is a fabulous hotel.We stayed here for four nights - total cost 420 euros for a superior double room. The room was fabulous - even had towelling robes, an in-room safe, colour TV, lovely bathroom, views over...er...the back yard.Staff were fantastic - they spoke great English and tolerated my French. We didn't have breakfast as it seemed a bit steep and there are loads of cafes, patisseries, boulangeries etc around.Saint-Georges metro is 1 minute away and you can even walk from Gare du Nord or Gare St Lazare in 10-15 minutes. The area is lovely and seems pretty safe. Pigalle is up at the top of the road (10 minute walk) and many of the bars around have scantily clad ladies witing for customers but, as I was with my other half, I can't say we went in any of them. Loads of restaurants around and some fantastic shops.I recommend this hotel and this area very highly indeed.

<Content>A most enjoyable stay Stayed here for 4 days. It is an excellent hotel and very well situated to enable one to explore Paris. It is very close to two Metro stations and also to a range of restaurants in which to have your breakfast or have a bistro type meal in the evening. While the bedrooms are small they are en-suite and are well appointed and contain all you need. The hotel is spotlessly clean and everyone of the reception staff were very friendly and helpful, and spoke English if required.I would stay here again.

<Content>Good safe location My boyfriend and I stayed for a whole week to celebrate his 40th Birthday and we booked this hotel based on the reviews on tripadvisor.The room was very clean and tidy, if a little small but also had an immaculate bathroom. Decor was fresh and clean and the photos of this hotel are very accurate.There are metro stations at the top and bottom ends of the street and I can highly recommend the excellent and friendly bakery mentioned in other reviews. We certainly tasted a lot of their fine baking during our stay!We found the reception staff very friendly and happy to talk to us in English even though we were trying to speak in French - perhaps this got us into their good books.While spending a very happy week in Paris we certainly felt we had booked the right hotel in the right location. About the only negative thing was the expensive breakfast but we thankfully didn't opt for it due to the fab bakery in the next street.We would definately go back here again as it was friendly, in a safe part of the city and a bargain at 拢66 per night for the room via expedia. Enjoy!

<Content>Perfect After hours of searching tour books and websites, I finally picked this hotel because it was the highest rated by Tripadvisor for the price. The reviews were very accurate, and we had a perfect stay. We took an overnight flight from Boston, and our room was ready early so we did not have to wait. The shower was designed a little funky, but the whole bathroom was new and clean. The room was bigger and brighter than my best friend鈥檚, who was staying more in the city center. It was quiet and close to 2 different metro stops. We couldn't afford breakfast at the hotel; however there was an amazing bakery down the street and around the corner. There was a very convenient ATM located up the street. Our room was very clean, and we always felt safe in the neighborhood. I would defiantly stay here again, even if I wasn't a poor college student.

<Content>You could do a lot better Small, budget hotel located on a Paris side-street. As another reviewer stressed, this is a 2 STAR HOTEL. No frills. No charm. Rooms are small and basic - look at the candid traveler photos to see. They were kept very clean, thankfully.Elevator is tiny and very slow. Front desk staff was usually incompetent or just plain rude. There are many more cuter, small hotels in Paris for the same price. Wouldn't stay here again.

<Content>A wonderful find We, a family of four (two daughters aged 12 and 16) spent 3 nights in two doubles at this delightful hotel situated in a pleasant central area of Paris.If travelling by car, follow a route via the Arc De Triumphe from the peripherique with a good road map. There is secure parking (54 euro three days) two streets away.Five minute walk to Moulin Rouge, ten to Sacre Cour, 15/20 to Galerie La Fayette and even walkable to The Louvre / Seine / Champs-Elysees or take the metro from St Georges less than a minute away from the hotel!You are spoiled for choice for restaurants all within a short walk and reasonable prices too.Hotel refurbished to good standard and all staff very helpful and friendly. Rooms reasonable size bearing in mind location. Tight and steep staircase but there is a lift.The breakfast is served in a delighful pretty cellar - ours was included in the price but many might find 12 euros pp a little steep!We wouldn't hesitate in staying there again.This review is the subjective opinion of a TripAdvisor member and not of TripAdvisor LLC.* You cannot edit your review after you submit it.

<Content>Average hotel for budget-travellers The hype about this hotel sounds a bit strange to me. It's not a 5 star hotel or anything similar. It's definitively a 2 star hotel and recommmendable for tourists, who spend a weekend in Paris and look for a simple cheap accomodation. We stayed 4 nights and enjoyed the nice neighbourhood (in rue de martyr is a very good bakery straight opposite to a 3-floor supermarket called shopi) and the close access to the metro station notre dame de lorette. due to the bakery and shopi the expensive hotel breakfast is not necessary. the street side is noisy, it's useful to keep the windows closed. bathroom is very small. the bed had a size of 140x200 cm and is small for 2 people. me and my boyfried are slim, so it was ok, but for stronger-built people it will be too small. the house is pretty old, the elevator rumbling, but room and bath clean and staff friendly. on the first morning the water heater in the cellar was out of order, all guests had to take a cold shower. but is was mended by the evening. generally spoken, i recommend it but always with the information, that it is a simple 2 star hotel. we would stay there again, if we get the next time the same cheap rate via expedia (germany) as we got now.

<Content>Okay, not great $148/night after taxes. This was the standard all rooms are small in Paris room with one full sized bed. It was called a Superior room-Superior double by the hotel. It had a decent bathroom. A back alley view. The tub was high I remember so it was a long step down when getting out on a potentially slippery floor. The location is okay. We really preferred it when we stayed in the Latin Quarter. This hotel is near some Metro stops that will take you anywhere you need to go. I did not order the hotel's breakfast.

<Content>Great budget hotel - will stay again We booked this hotel because we were on a budget and from the reviews on tripadvisor it sounded like great value for money and we weren't disappointed. Rooms are basic and simply decorated but are comfortable, have air conditioning and are kept very clean. The road noise at the front can be loud but with the windows shut it isn't a problem.Staff were friendly and helpful - spoke good English and enjoyed our attempts at French.Many tourist sites are within easy walking distance (e.g Louvre about 20 mins) and there are a couple of metro stops nearby. Breakfast is expensive but there's a good patisserie round the corner and there are also good quality and reasonably priced restaurants (around 60 euros for 3 courses and wine for 2) just up the hill from the hotel.

<Content>Wonderful hotel My wife and I stayed here for 5 nights in Jul. It was a wonderful experience. We arrived and were greeted in perfect English by a pleasant girl working. She showed us to our room and offered to help with our luggage. The room was small (but this is expected in Paris) but had a good size bathroom and was very clean! It had excellent air-conditioning which was tremendous because it had been close to 100 F for a week. There was little street noise with the windows closed. The mattress was firm but comfortable. The price of the hotel was extremely good considering the time of year we stayed. It is a block walk to the St. Georges Metro station with easy access to the downtown. I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a clean, affordable place to stay close to the downtown of Paris..

<Content>Top marks for the Albion Thanks to this website we booked at the Hotel France Albion and we found it a lovely little hotel for our small budget. It was one of the hottest few days in Paris but the room had great air con, we didn't think it was a noisy street and it seemed a safe area to come back to at night. The reception staff were all friendly and spoke much better english than our french, they let us check in much earlier than 2pm on our booking too.

<Content>Great Value and a Good Stay I booked into the albion because of the decent reviews and great price on expedia ($77/night) for a single.The room was very nice (typical small size), the bathroom was spacious, and the air conditioning, nice elevator and nice overall appearance were much more than I had expected at the price.Service was great with a nice staff and the manager even let me use the conference room to work one day. The single room is too small to do real work if you're in paris on business.If you use Internet, I'd recommend skipping the overpriced Albion service. There appeared to be several available wifi hotspots if you want to take the risk. There is a nice square up the hill if you make a right at the first stop light. I spent a few days on the benches or in the cafes there using a good free Internet connection.Coin laundry is up the hill as well and there is a very good supermarket right across the street from the hotel.For comparison, I moved from the Hotel St. Louis and was very pleased. The Albion really should be a 2.5 or 3 star rather than a 2 star. Great stay - especially if you can get a deal with expedia!!!

<Content>Had an Excellent Stay at the Hotel France Albion Our family of four recently stayed at the Hotel France Albion and found it to be a very clean, well-kept hotel with very capable, friendly staff. It is located in a relatively quiet neighborhood, with a nice selection of cafes and specialty markets nearby. Access to the Metro is close and convenient. The rooms were very clean and nicely furnished, with good natural lighting and ventilation (although the air conditioning was also nice to have when needed). The room prices were very reasonable -- good value for the money, although we didn't try the breakfast buffet at the hotel, which seemed a bit pricey. Definitely had a good overall experience and would recommend it to others!

<Content>Stop Over at Paris We just completed our travel across Switzerland with a brief stop over at Paris for 3 days as the last leg of the journey. The total trip being for more than 2 weeks. Whilst all the Swizerland hotels were three stars - with a fair bit of trepidation based on some web surfing (Trip advisor) I had booked the Albion hotel which was 2 star. This was despite advise from others that star ratings for Paris hotels were quite misleading and more often than not the hotels did not live upto the star ratings.However our experience at Albion was excellent leaving us extremely gratified at our choice. Its a budget hotel with an overall ambience far greater than hotels of a higher category in the city. Its clean, well maintained, pleasant and with a daily supply of towels and toiletry (unlike other European budget hotels which have a dual bath ----- shampoo holder fixed to the wall). It has very friendly and helpful staff who are conversant in English. Its placed in a quite and safe neighbourhood even though its within walking distance of Pigalle. The metro is very convenient - two stations within a 3 minute walk - though as a tourist we preferred over ground transport. Do agree with other reviewers that the breakfast was overpriced given the choices available outside. Though the room was not big but was not too small either. A big unexpected plus was the split airconditioner in the room which was indeed a necessity (a criteria overlooked by us when we did the bookings for the other hotels in Switzerland) given the 30+Degree centigrade temperatures in Europe this summer. Overall a very pleasant experience and between my wife and I we have agreed that for our next visit to the city we will be choosing this hotel once again.

<Content>Very pleased It is a little removed from downtown but a great little place with clean rooms, a subway at the end of the street, sights within walking distance and a nice comfortable bed. You need to go up Rue des Martyrs and look for a small pastry store on the right with an entrance diagonal to the street. The best mini-quiches (hockey puck size) you will ever eat. My wife and I actually took them with us each day for lunch and snacks. I think we had 10 each in 3 days. Look for the tomatoe and anchovie one.I would stay here again as I have no complaints at all.

<Content>Nice hotel, pleasent stay I stayed at Hotel France Albion on my first visit to Paris based on the reviews on this site and I wasn't disappointed. It's a clean, basic hotel with everything you need for a good stay in Paris. It seemed a little overpriced, but I haven't stayed anywhere else in Paris so it may have been a good deal for what you get. The air conditioning worked well, the room was cleaned everyday with fresh towels, and they filled my requests for a non-smoking room with a view. I didn't think the room was too small, we had a normal double bedroom and there was plenty of room for our luggage and a little closet with a working safe. The street noise wasn't a problem for us at night, the windows block out almost all of the noise. The bathrooms are large with a nice shower that comfortably fits two people. The bed is firm but comfortable and I didn't have any problems sleeping.Most of the people at reception were helpful and spoke English. I didn't really like the breakfast, we only had it once and it's very overpriced for what's available from the little buffet. The location is very metro accessible. It was a pain to get to the Eiffel Tower and surrounding areas, it's much closer to Montmarte and the Opera District. The neighborhood was fine, but there was a lack of good restaurants.Overall, I liked the France Albion. It's a good hotel as long as you aren't expecting something fancy or upscale. It was exactly what we needed for our trip and I didn't regret choosing it for my first trip to Paris.

<Content>Par Excellence Thanks to tripadvisor we found this wonderful, inexpensive, thoroughly charming hotel. Everything was just as pictured here. From the moment of our somewhat late arrival where we were warmly greated and assisted by Dominick, to the lovely morning desk lady who gave us excellent directions to the Eiffel tower, to the very sweet afternoon young lady that helped us get ice for my husband's sore knee, and the also lovely young lady who assisted us on our last evening getting information on the concert venue we were to visit, the service was impeccable. These are the friendliest people in Paris. I am so sorry to have not gotten all their names. The whole trip was sensory overload.The neighborhood is delightful. Dominick directed us to a newer restaurant in the area, Fuxia, which had great food, wine and atmosphere. As total strangers in town we actually struck up conversations with other patrons and had a great time. The hotel is close to the Montmarte area which is well worth a visit. Took the Funicular to Sacre Coeur. Most sights were walking distance if you had the time and you had the opportunity to see the city along the way. We took public buses all over instead of organized tours. We bought the Carte Orange for each of us the first day, a Monday. What a great deal. You just show your card on the buses and can get on and off at any stop. A small ticket is attached which you use in the metro ticket machine. The metro stations are very convenient but the hotel's location halfway between the two kept this busy little side street fairly quiet in this hustle bustle city. We had no problem with the street noise and kept our windows slightly ajar most days and nights. Never had a moment's fear for our safety.The accomodations are immaculate and plenty roomy. Beds are very comfortable and we both slept well. The bath area was enormous for a small European hotel. The breakfast we had one day was plentiful and very convenient for our schedule. There was enough food to make two small sandwiches which we took with us for our jaunt to Luxembourg Gardens. The cellar room is a bit warm.The only other negative was the small TV which did not get many channels. We were not there to watch TV anyway, but the French Open was in progress and my husband is a sports nut. He did watch it while he nursed his knee.All in all, I would not stay anyplace else in Paris. It was all we needed. Don't look any further. This place is more than worth the money. Three stars plus.

<Content>Clean and easy Stayed here very last minute on a Saturday night in Paris when original reservation at a nearby hotel turned out to be non-existent!Front desk staff were friendly and helpful. Room was very clean, decor modern but quite plain. Reasonable room size for a Paris hotel - bigger than the one our friends had at the nearby, trendier-looking BW Lorette Opera. Air conditioning worked perfectly. Bathroom very clean with tub and shower. Bed a bit hard but comfortable enough. Wardrobe had safe and hairdryer.Our room was on the fifth floor so i don't know if lower rooms would be noisier, although the street isn't busy at all, and all rooms have double glazing.Location is good - lowkey, residential, but quite central, about 100 metres to either Notre Dame de Lorette or St Georges Metro stations, with a couple of good corner shops for snacks and provisions 20 metres away. Just up the road past St Georges Metro station there is a little square with some nice cafes and restaurants. This is a decent 2 star hotel and I'd definitely recommend it if you want somewhere clean, quiet, friendly and fuss-free to put your head down for the night.

<Content>Nice Hotel, would stay again. The rooms are clean, the bathrooms big with nice showers and tubs for those evening soaks after walking around Paris. The staff was very helpful and friendly and the location is excellent. 2 close Metro stops, Monmartre, Pigalle, Paris Opera within walking distance. Lovely restuarants and bakery shops nearby. The rooms are small but nice.

<Content>Great Stay Stayed one night on 5th June and found the Hotel to be clean and no noise from outside. Just 200M from St George metro so no long walks.Rooms not large but in view of price they are very good value. Would stay here again.Breakfast was fine and hot food offered eg scrambled eggs bacon fried potatos etc which set you up for the day

<Content>Very good place to stay Clean rooms, friendly staff. Our room was over the street and so noisy with windows open. But the windows closed did an excellent job of damping the noise for sleeping. They sell you internet time which is rather expensive, they could do that more cheaply.We liked the neighborhood location. The Metro station is very close (Use the Saint Georges station).

<Content>clean and basic We had a wonderful weekend in Paris. The France Albion is kept extremely clean but is very basic. Young female staff very pleasant and helpful. Bar next door friendly and a great place to sit late at night watching the parisians walk by. Good value leabanese food straight opposite the hotel espeacially the vegetarian options. Hotel incredibly cheap. Witnessed a pickpocketing on the metro - they identified travellers with lots of baggage and pretended to help them on the train. Be aware!

<Content>Exactly what is required Just a short review to echo the previous sentiments regarding this hotel.Good safe location; good room rate; very clean; helpful english speaking staff; good Metro access.We never ate breakfast in the hotel - 12E each seemed a bit steep - but there are many cafes and boulangeries/patisseries close by to offer great food at a fraction of the cost. You may have to go a bit further afield for dinner as there are not that many quality restaurants nearby - it is a mainly residential area.Would stay here again.

<Content>A good hotel Handy for the metro - St Georges 200 meters up the road, Notre dame de Lorette 300 meters down the road.Moulin Rouge about 1/2 mile way - easy on foot or bus. Nearby streets full of good specialist food shops - with a basic supermarket opposite the hotel.Strongly recommend bus 42 (leaves from just down the road and around the corner) to the Eiffel Tower - as good as sight-seeing toursBreakfast locally (juice, coffee, croissant) is 5-6 Euros. Therfore hotel breakfast can be good value - stock up at breakfast - lasts 'til dinner.We were there for wife's birthday and our 30 wedding aniversary - bit disappointed that although hotel aware, they did not mark it in any way. Reception staff ordinarily most helpful (one did not want to call taxi for trip to Gare du Nord taxi driver won't like short trip - most people take the bus. Bus with luggage not an option for us). However did recommend good hairdresser nearby (wife very pleased - same price in Euros as a county town charges in pounds sterling). Endeavoured to help when we lost a metro ticket. English ability varied from excellent to unrecognisable. Restaurant staff friendly and helpful.Rooms very clean - decor beginning to fray a little. Street very noisy at night (for us - but we do live in a village). Street had much litter and grafitti - but we did not feel threatened (and we were robbed on the metro (Concord)). Police very helpful! Air conditioning persuasive rather than convincing.We stayed 6 nights and are happy to recommend a clean, basic hotel.Website pictures of rooms are accurate

<Content>nice place we stayed here april 13-17 and found it to be very nice - rooms are small but ok for two - we had a deluxe - room #50 with a larger than expected bathroom - extremely clean with tiles and a tub with shower and radiator and windows that opened - the fan/ac only provided a fan at this point so no ac was on, but we opened the windows to make it cooler sometimes - we looked out on the back alley, but just over the rooftop and the chimneys, you could see the very top of the eiffel tour! (was not advertised as room with view of tower, thankfully, though!) the breakfast is steep at 12 euro per person but is very good and we ate there every morning primarily out of convenience - they bring you choice of tea or coffee and they supply milk and oj, eggs to boil or poach in a metal box/machine - a variety of pastries and some excellent apricot and rasberry preserves (in big jars near buffet) also served scrambled eggs, sliced potatos and bacon each morning and had yogurt and cereal also - the people at the desk were friendly and spoke english - the manager was a little brusque when we asked if we could leave post cards at the desk for mailing - she pointed to a mailbox outside as if we were idiots - sorry, but in U.S. it is no big deal to leave them at the desk and we did not notice the box outside - instead of being rude she could have told us to make sure we mailed them in the etranger slot for overseas, but luckily I knew that. - bill was correct and the stay was nice - rooms lock well - you can hear others coming and going but no big deal - elevator is bigger than another reviewer stated - will hold 4 people or at least two or three and some luggage

<Content>Great European Hotel Overall, my wife and I had a great stay at this hotel. Paris was wonderful in mid-March and this hotel made it even more so. The price was right, and the hotel was recently remodeled, clean, and up-to-date. The staff was fantastic. All spoke very good English and all were incredibly friendly, at all times of day as we came and went. Speaking from experience, you will not find a better hotel than this in Europe unless you are willing to spend an arm and a leg. The hotel is out of the major tourist districts (great if you want to experience the real Paris), but the location is so convenient. Two Metro stations are within a block or two away, making every major destination in Paris less than about a five minute train ride away. A short walk away from the hotel are some really nice little bakeries and cafes. Grab a couple bakery items at one of the corner bakeries and have a seat at the counter of the Cafe Bleu for a morning cafe au lait. When you first arrive, the Hotel France Albion can be a bit tricky to find. After a long flight from Chicago, it took my wife about an hour looking at maps and dragging our bags around on the Paris streets until we finally located the place. Here's a tip: take the Metro to the station Notre Dame de Lorette, and the hotel is immediately up the street and around the corner. Just search for the station on any of the maps in the metro stations. If you are looking for a great meal on the go at an inexpensive price, try a restaurant called Brioche Doree. Its a local chain, so you'll see them here and there throughout the city. For a real Parisian experience, find the street called Rue Cler and hang out a bit at the cafes and shops. Its not far from the Place des Invalides.

<Content>Friendly and Clean Two Star Hotel I booked this hotel based on reviews on Trip Advisor and was not disapointed. I booked a double room and was placed on the 5th Floor. The room was small and clean with a good bathroom. The hotel was very quiet and the staff were friendly. Although there are two Metro stops less than 5 minutes walk away we chose to walk to most places we visited. Check out close by Rue des Martyrs for excellent foodie shops and restaurants. We recommend the anglo-french 'Rose Bakery' for to-die-for savoury tarts, salad and crumble! We also loved La Fourmi Caf茅 for Italian food. I would definitely choose to stay at Hotel France Albion again when in Paris.

<Content>Great Value for Money  I stayed at the Hotel France Albion one night. I arrived very late and was very pleased to see how nicely I was welcomed... even at 1 AM!!I stayed in a double superior room... very cosy, comfortable and quiet. What I really appreciated was the hard and very comfortable bed and the very nice, bright and clean bathroom (seems new!).I had a really nice breakfast (with a really cool boiled egg machine!) and I recomend everyone to stop by the breakfast room which is very beautifull and charming.Finally, the hotel is located in a very nice and live neighborhood (9th arrondissement) a few minutes away from two different subway stations and only 10 minutes walk to the Opera and the Grands Magasins (the place to go for shopping!)I had a very pleasant stay and great value for money... I will definately come back!!THANK YOU to all the staff for the nice stay.

<Content>Parisian Charm with all the "modern conveniences" We booked the Hotel France Albion on line not knowing what to expect. We found it to be totally delightful. The double room with two beds that we booked turned out to be two rooms connected by a short hall. Each room had its own closet, t.v., side chairs, window. There was ample space to spread out. The bathroom was also spacious...full tub/shower and sink in one room off the hall; toilet in another. Although this is an older building, everything worked and was clean. There are plenty of cafes and restaurants nearby. Two metro stations are very close. The staff were really friendly and helpful.

<Content>What a great place to stay! I have just been to a short trip to Paris, for shopping and just to relax.We stayed at the France Albion, which was just a great hotel. - 2 stars upgraded. The service at the hotel was excellent, cosy and really personal, fab breakfast and at really affordable prices. The rooms were a good size for the price, which is not often the case in 2 star hotels.The hotel is located really centrally, close to the opera, mont-matre, cosy atmosphere in the streets, and good restaurants.All in all, I can only say that I had a really great experience at the hotel and it made my stay in lovely Paris even more enjoyable.

<Content>Great Hotel We have just returned from five days in Paris, staying at the excellent Hotel France-Albion. We stayed in a superior room on the fifth floor (80 Euros per night) and the room was perfect for our trip. It was clean, nicely decorated, and quiet.The staff are very friendly, and are quite happy to bring drinks up to your room (3 Euros each) which makes a good alternative to the pricey breakfast (12 Euros).The hotel is about 30 seconds walk from the St Georges Metro station on route 12, and is ideally located, with Montmatre and Sacre Coeur within easy walking distance.Don't be put off by the proximity of Pigalle, the hotel is in a lovely area, and feels perfectly safe and secure.Am excellent hotel, at an incredible price. We will be returning.

<Content>A great Parisien find The hotel France Albion is a family-run two star hotel in a well located part of Paris. The rooms and clean, comfortable and, the one I was in, remarkably quiet for a city centre hotel.The staff were attentive and helpful.Although the hotel is not located in one of the principle tourist areas, it is extremely well placed for the Metro with a taxi rank a few metres away.Certainly worth a visit, very good value for money.

<Content>Thanks Trip Advisor - great hotel I booked this hotel after spending hours researching Paris on Trip Advisor. It was exactly how the reviews described it, and an excellent place to stay.It is in a great location - 2 minutes to Metro and walking distance to Moulin Rouge, Sacre Coeur. You could stay for a month and eat at a different restaurant in the area.We stayed for Valentines (got engaged exactly 14 years ago) and the hotel even gave us a CD of French Love Songs. All the staff were very friendly and helpful.It's not the Ritz but good value for money. The breakfast was good (try the egg machine!!)The only minor irritation was the traffic noise during the night - try to get a room at back or on high floor.

<Content>Loved the Hotel France Albion I wanted to stay in a little hotel that made me feel very welcoming and confortable.I found just that at the Hotel France Albion. Not only all the staff took such a good care of me, but my room was so cozy and so charming. I did not feel I was in a hotel but instead felt I was staying at a friends house. The colors of the room were so warm and happy. The hotel was very quiet and every morning it was my joy to have a warm breakfast in the beautiful breakfast room that makes this hotel so special. I have never seen quiet a room so charming. I would definitely recomment this hotel as my experience was all positive. I can't wait to go back next year.Thank you to The Hotel France Albion's team for making my trip so special!

<Content>Great location, amazing deal!!!! Located in a beautiful neighborhood two blocks from the metro, this small but charming hotel was a steal through Expedia at $75 per night. A short 10 minute ride to the center of Paris. We tried the breakfastwhich was a bit expensive but very nice if you're feeeling lazy or pressed for time. Would definitely stay here the next time we head to Paris. The staff is extremely helpful and everyone spoke English.

<Content>decent hotel We stayed for three nights in late January. It is an average standard hotel, nothing spectacular. We had a superior double but the room was still rather small. Large bathroom though. They have a computer in the lobby for guests to use but charge 7 euro per 30 minutes (Ouch!) There is an internet place within walking distance, we had to ask another hotel's front office to find it.Good Korean restaurant close by. A good alternative to confit de canard and other heavy french food.

<Content>Nice little hotel We stayed at France Albion for three nights. Although it's only a two-star hotel, the rooms are nicely furbished and clean, the bathroom is spacious (don't forget you are in Paris...) and it's conveniently located for Montmartre, Pigalle (Moulin Rouge) and Opera/grands magasins.Would definitely return.

<Content>Stay there! +ideal for budget travellers - they really offer a lot for such a price(e.g.air conditioning,safe,elevator)+small but clean,nicely decorated rooms and also clean bathrooms (very important)+staff is incredibly helpful and friendly+metro station only down the street-breakfast kosts an extra 12Euros but ist quite alright; they even serve it in your room if wished-so no more fear of dingy overpriced parisian hotels, just stay at the France Albion!

<Content>Friendly in Paris, yes really! Having been to Paris a couple of times before, I'd given up hope of ever finding a hotel where the staff smiled or went out of their way to help, until I found this hotel(thanks to Trip advisor reviews!). Yes, the rooms are basic and cosy (more the standard of a local BB in UK) and not what you would really want for a romantic weekend, but it's the welcoming attitude of the staff and it's convenient location that make this hotel a real gem. We found the reception staff were so helpful and friendly. They were even helpful and smiling (really!)when our safe broke - it was no bother at all to come up and fix. The room was serviced really well and overall the room/hotel was very clean. As for the location - turn left out of the hotel to find some fab local restaurants, rather than heading back towards the Opera house area where you'll pay more for dinner. Also on the Sunday the next road along to the hotel is closed to traffic so you can wander along to all the lovely food shops. Plus it's only a 10-15 minute walk from the Sacre Coeur. All in all a fab hotel.

<Content>Loved Hotel France Albion So I guess this is just another of several reviews singing the praises of this hotel. Like others, I was very skeptical considering the price. And I'm a low key budget traveler but this was my first time to France so I really didn't want to be in a dungeon. To my suprise, I think the Albion was every bit worth the money. Standard room, very neat though and very clean. For those with back problems like me, the firm bed was Heaven sent. For those who like the really soft Westin Hotel type posh bed, this isn't it. But it was very comfortable. And yes, there are no closets but there was plenty of hangers and I hung all my stuff up and the stand up closet is tall and could easily fit the large size carry one suitcause. Plus there is room under the bed. The best part of the hotel is the proximity to the Metro Station. It's very convenient. Located in more a quiet residential area. Still plenty of inexpensive shops and mom and pop restaurants and bakeries. Hints for first time travelers: 1. Street signs. If you are looking for the silver pole w/ the green sign, you won't find it in Paris. Most street have the street name on a plaque that's glued to the side of whatever the building is on the corner, it could be a church, a store or a house (must be some law that allows the gov't to paste the thing on your property). I spent two hours walking around trying to find this place on my first trip because I couldn't find a damn street sign...and I probably was no more than 5 minutes away!! Definitely take the rue de Notre Dame de Lorette stop on Line 12. It's the easiest and you should take it at least your first trip to you get used to the Metro system, then try other stops and walking. But this lets you off right at the street. Another first timer hint: U.S. usually have 90 degree angle corners. Paris has many acute angle street (more V shape). This is important because if you look on the side of a building and see the name of the street, you should look on the other side of the V cause there will be a second plaque with the name of that street on it. Another tip: Rue=Street! so rue de Main would be more like Main Street! Other hotel info: Breakfast is a little overpriced, but its a decent meal considering it's all you can eat. Go early.Internet: If you have your own wireless card for your laptop, DON'T pay to use the hotel's. Like most hotels in the U.S. you click on your internet explorer and get a screen where u gotta put in some user name and password that you usually pay for. But before I did that, I did a search of available wireless connections on my computer. And there was some other one called wireless that was absolutely free! Maybe one of those coffee shops that offer free internet signals. I dunno. So I never paid for internet. Try to get a street view room. I was in room 24. So 14/24/34/44, etc. are all on the street. I only say this because I'm guessing it helped me pick up the free internet signal versus being in a room that's more on the inner hotel.Hotel staff are extremely, extremely nice! ALL of them spoke enough English to explain what you needed to know. Another tip: BRING POWER CONVERTER! They have a very limited supply and the plugs in France are not the same as the U.S. And their supply didn't have a 3-prong U.S. converter.That's really it. Anyone can email me at: xandersonc@msn.com if you want more information. I was there for four days and three nights and I won't even chance staying anywhere else on my next trip to Paris. Great place. Basic, clean, comfortable and a homey feeling.

<Content>Best value for money in Paris - for sure! We went to Paris for a weekend stay, and had heard about Albion from some friends. As most people one is a bit sceptial while going to stay in a hotel in Paris many horror stories!! Hotel Albion combines every bit of every travellers dream - great location behind Galleries Lafayettes (department store) close to Opera, safe neighbourhood, charming hotel, great rooms, wonderful attentive serviceminded staff and not the least but Large modern bathrooms -something NOT easy to find in Paris! And none the least, you can get your breakfast served in your room - what more can one ask for in a hotel with great rates like at the Albion?? Love it!

<Content>great hotel... my boyfriend brought me to paris for my birthday and as I had heard some terrible things about hotels in Paris we were both so relieved when we arrived at Hotel Albion.It was a great hotel considering the resonable price. Rooms are lovely, although small they are clean, comfortable and warm. The bathroom was a good size, like the room it was clean and we had clean towels everyday. Only bad point about room was noise that could be heard from comings and goings of people next door, this was mainly because the hallway is very small and cramped so doors are very close together. But also down to our noisy neighbours, no doubt.Hotel is in a nice area, close to 2 metro stations and about a 20 minute walk to gare du nord. Not really in centre of paris but with the metro its so easy to travel to all the sights. There is a lovely frunch pub next door that shows all major football games (much to my boyfriends delight) and the owner is a lovely man who took great care of us on the evening we spent there.Breakfast at hotel is a bit expensive at 12 euro each, we only got it on our last morning, but was nice and did set us up for journey home.Would definitely reccommend this hotel to anybody visiting paris. My boyfriend and I were really pleased!

<Content>I now have a Fiance, magic of France Albion Result of stay at Hotel France Albion: I now have a fiance rather than a girlfriend. The hotel was truly magnificent. The staff are excellent and help with everything.If u want to go somewhere just ask them they will go as far as booking it for u. Also, the rooms and bathrooms are excellent and perfect with a medievel effect.I have nothing bad to say about the place, the hotel takes a bit of finding but its worth its walking distance to the sacre couer and le louvre and a trains journeys away from everything else.Well worth the money and for Paris this is a BARGAIN. We actually asked the guy why the it was a 2 star and he also had no idea.

<Content>Good value, neighborhood location I was pleased with the stay based on reading the positive reviews. Very helpful staff; clean rooms and bathrooms. Rooms are small; i experienced both a double and a single room over 6 night-stay. Acceptable considering that i was rarely in the room. Very firm beds! Good location in non-tourist area with plenty of restaurants and neighborhood shops nearby. One street over closed on Sunday morning for a Farmer's Market atmosphere. Walking 20-30 minutes could get you to Sacre Coeur or the Louvre depending on the direction. Metro stop is one block away.I was looking to spend under US $100 per night in this very expensive city and was satisfied with the hotel for this value.

<Content>Friendly, helpful staff This Hotel is located near Moulen Rouge, with small but adequate rooms. The staff were VERY HELPFUL, even the manager offered to allow us to leave our big luggage there for a small trip to London. Also all staf spoke english, which was a big plus!!!! In fact the only reason I would return to Paris is because of the great service we got at the hotel and the pub next door, everywhere else seemed unfriendly and offered little help.Small tip, the BREAKFAST is NOT INCLUDED, it's quite expensive at 12 euros.

<Content>Perfect place for us! We stayed here from August 13-18, 2005 and it was a perfect hotel for us, a 20 something couple on our first trip to Europe. The room was just right, particularly as we spent very little time in it besides for sleeping! It was clean and comfortable. Air conditioning worked well and the bathroom was clean. We did not try the breakfast as we were happy to stroll 2 blocks from the hotel on Rue de Martyrs and get pastries in the morning. It was a short walk to the Saint Georges and Pelletier metro stations, as well as an easy walk to Gare du Nord. We highly recommend this hotel!
