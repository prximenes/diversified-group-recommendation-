<Content>PERFECT place in the heart of BERLIN Beautiful, upscale hotel near main city area of Berlin--can walk to Brandenburg Gate, Unter den Linden...We chose the city view and could literally open up window to the city bustle...LOVED that. Modern room with luxurious linens. Restaurant pricey, but expected. WONDERFUL breakfast to be had...made to order omelettes, meats, very Euro. We loved our stay. Gorgeous lobby. Close to u-Bahn.

<Content>Conveniently located I picked this hotel because it is directly next to Komische Oper and I had to attend a performance there and did not want to walk through the bitter cold late at night. The hotel is nothing special except it is located on Unter den Linden and across the street from shopping on Friederichstrasse. The Deutsche Guggenheim is one block away and museum island 4 blocks away. The rooms themselves are adequate, and food was decent as well. This really does remind me of a typical American chain hotels, but with a bigger lobby. The staff is efficient, but not friendly. Compare to many other Berlin hotels that I have stayed in, they are better alternatives. Try the Regent or the Hilton which is within 1-2 blocks in the same area as the Westin.

<Content>Great blend of classic and modern My overall impression of the hotel is no doubt influenced a great deal by the room I had during my stay there. I booked what was essentially a standard room for a recent business trip to Berlin but, upon check-in, was upgraded (thanks to Starwood Preferred Guest status) to a 1-bedroom suite, which was one of their themed suites (themed suites are individually appointed and decorated according to who they are named after, such as Bach or Goethe or other historical and artistic notables). The suite was large, wonderfully appointed, had a great deal of character and charm, and was ideally situated (fourth floor, right at the front of the building with a large balcony). Tons of closet space, wood paneling in certain areas, a huge bathroom (with dual sinks, walk-in shower, seperate bathtub, lots of counterspace, and a separate toilet area also with its own sink and a bidet), work desk, sitting area, yet more and more closet space, flatscreen TVs, minibar, and so on. Like the hotel itself, I found the room a great blend of charming and modern. They didn't sacrifice character for their recent renovations, clearly.Service throughout my stay was also very nice. Everyone spoke excellent English - likely better than my own, really - and requests were handled quickly, competently, and with a smile. The location of the hotel couldn't be better, either. It's just a block off of Unter den Linden, and just a short walk to the Brandenburg Gate, Museum Island, the Tiergarten, the Holocaust memorial, and other sites. There's plenty of shopping and dining nearby, as well as plenty of public transport options right outside the door.Dining in the hotel was quite good, and their breakfast was fantastic. Restaurant on the ground level was very nice also, and the lobby/foyer area at the base of the grand staircase was a nice place to hang out and relax, as well as meet up, with afternoon tea and snacks as well as a full bar.Given the experience we had here and the overall feel and service at the hotel, I found it to be quite well priced, as well. Would highly recommend the Westin Grand Berlin!

<Content>Still Wonderful After All These Years In early September we made our second trip to Berlin and based upon our excellent experience there in 2002 we chose to return to the Westin Grand. And again we were extremely pleased with our stay. First, the location is perfect. Located directly on Freidrichstrasse at the corner of Unter Den Linden it is in walking distance of many of the the reasons you come to Berlin for a visit. For those locations which are not in walking distance, a U Bahn station is just a few feet (meters?) away. The hotel itself is both pleasing to the eye and the person. The lobby with its giant staircase makes an impressive statement, and the four efficient elevators will take you to your room with no waiting. The room itself is exceptional with extremely comfortable bedding, attractive furnishings and with one exception a very efficient bathroom. The one exception is the shower which like many European showers is not up to American standards. But that seems to be an European failing, not specifically one of this marvelous hotel. We overlooked Freidrichstrasse from our room which made for an interesting city view. There was no sound from the street which made paying for the upgraded garden view unnecessary. The breakfast buffet was included and with a wide variety of hot and cold foods, breads, and even German bubbly (sekt) it made for an excellent start to the day. If we ever have reason to return to Berlin it will be to the Westin Grand.

<Content>would highly recommend I stayed at the Westin in mid september after having stayed there in 2005. I have always like the location and was very impressed with the recent improvements. The room was great with a modern updated decor. Most importantly, the staff were very helpful and friendly. This had not been the case in 2005 when folks seemed cold...so I really highly recommend.

<Content>Very Impressive!! I'll make it short! ** The hotel is a 5 stars deluxe - realy impressive!  ** rooms are well designed very luxorious and quite (when window is closed) **The hotel has a very nice Gym and Spa floor. **The food is expensive, and probably adequate to the guests who can afford staying there. **the location is realy first calss, in the middle of the buisness center and quality shops. Its a walking distance from alot of sites in Berlin, and the sub-way station (U-Ban) is only 30 meters from the entrance of the hotel!!!!IN COCLUSION - if you can afford it - GO FOR IT !!!

<Content>Beautiful, Grand, Remodeled Contemporary Rooms, Perfect Location I read a couple of not so favorable reviews so was a bit concerned. We used points to pay for our rooms, so was concerned with the room we would receive. The hotel has a luxurious old world charm, yet the rooms were remodeled. A flat screen television, a comfortable bed and modern furnishings were more than adequate. Although the room was smaller than US standards, there was ample storage. The location was perfect for major sight seeing attractions. We did not eat there for we were out and about early each day. We would stay here again !!

<Content>Fantastic Hotel with awesome Beds! My husband and I stayed at the Westin Grand Hotel in Aug this year for 3 nights. The hotel foyeur is lovely, with a massive grand stair case running through the middle.Check-in was easy and concierge staff were quite helpful. We were asked if we would like to pay to upgrade our room to a room with a garden view, which would be more quiet- we declined and couldn't have been happier with the room we were put in, facing the Street- very quiet and nice modern room with fantastic-very comfortable beds!!! Bathroom was a little tired looking, but still had nice toiletries. In a great location, within comfortable walking distance to many of the main sites, and very close to Unter De Linden, where you could hop on a bus if you didn't want to walk. Also has a nice pool!Overall, very happy with the hotel. Would recommend it highly.

<Content>Great Hotel and Fabulous Location We used points to stay at the hotel and found it to be a fabulous hotel. Extremely clean, heavenly bed was wonderful, and bathroom was great.Location was perfect. Super convenient to the S or U stations and plenty of food choices right around the hotel. Food at the hotel is pricey but what hotel restaurant isn't expensive? Service was great too.No complaints and definitely recommend, this was a great hotel!

<Content>Disappointing. This is an upscale business hotel, not a luxury hotel. The location is great, breakfast was excellent and the beds are fabulous but it lacks character and charm. There was no luggage rack although a call to housekeeping solved this problem. There was only 1 chair and the room was small. This was the last place we stayed after 2 weeks in Germany and it was disappointing to end our trip in a place that was so sterile and impersonal.

<Content>Disappointing Experience There were both positive and negative aspects to our stay at the Westin. When we checked in, the receptionist tried to get us to move to a more expensive room, claiming it would be far quieter than the room to which we were entitled. We decided to refuse the offer. As it turned out, the room could not have been quieter. While the location of the Westin Grand was ideal, we found small amenities missing that should have been available in a hotel of the Westin's calibre. There was no luggage rack whatsoever, no hooks on the back of the bathroom door and most shocking of all, not one reasonable space to place folded clothing. Even though we had gotten an extremely reasonable rate for the room, you would have expected those basic items in any room at a Westin hotel.

<Content>Well Located, Comfortable but Pricey We booked through the Starwood web guarantee that if there is a better like for like offer available than on their own web site then they will match it and then deduct 10%. I don't understand the logic or the mechanics of hotel pricing but a non-Starwood site offered an exceptional price and the hotel chain honoured their promise. It was our second visit to the hotel and we were less impressed than first time round. The room was well furnished and a reasonable size although there was only one seat - in a double room! There was a safe, a mini-bar (with no price list), good lighting but mediocre air conditioning. The bathroom was good but at least one set of the bath towels was well past its best.  The hotel is very well situated just off Unter Den Linden which may well be the best part of the city for tourists. There is a U-Bahn station just outside the entrance. The breakfast was good but try to get an inclusive BB rate for it cost 28 Euros a head (we had it once in four mornings but if the hotel had offered it at something like 20 Euros we would probably have had it every day - as I have said I do not understand hotel pricing). That takes me nicely to the overall prices on offer! There was a bottle of water sized 75cl on offer in the room for 8 Euros 50 cents. I have travelled the world but I never ever come across such an extravagent mark up. Does anybody actually buy this? A small beer (30cl) in the foyer was 5.50 Euros and a slightly larger beer was 8.50 Euros. Internet access was 7.50 Euros for an hour or 19.50 Euros for 24 hours. I could pay these prices but I will not out of principle. Fortunately there are alternatives nearby. We had a good stay and The Westin is certainly a high quality hotel by any standards but for some rather indefinable reason it failed to charm us on this occasion.

<Content>Close to everything This is a five star hotel at reasonable prices; really close to everything from a siteseeing point of view; Brandenburg Gate is a few minutes walk, as is Museum insel and Checkpoint Charlie.We stayed for 4 days and didnt need to use public transport once - all the main things to do and see are right on your doorstep.The beds (which they have trademarked as Heavenly beds !) are unbeliveably comfortable and the rooms are clean, modern and of a decent size.We only had one drink at the bar (拢30 for a bottle of red) and didnt eat there. It did all look very pricey and to be honest, there are plenty of places to eat and drink nearby for better use of your Euros.My one and only complaint is the view (we could see the patched up roof of the building opposite) but that is a tiny price to pay for such a lovely hotel that really is close to everything!

<Content>Perfect location The main advantage of this hotel is its location. Perfect located at Friedrichstra脽e and Unter den Linden is simply close to everything. I had the impression that the building seemed a little old and the carpets a little outdated. On the other hand the rooms had everything you need and especially I really enjoyed a fantastic mattress and pillow something very important for people like me who spend a lot of time in hotels for business purposes, simply because you can have a good night sleep.

<Content>Impressing hotel Very good location. Walking distance to Brandenburger Tor and in the same street as Checkpoint Charlie. A short walk to excellent shopping and som of the best restaurants in Berlin. My room was fine and quiet, with a view over the hotel garden.Westin Grand is undergoing a successful renovation. The style is impressing.Kind and good service from all employees I met.

<Content>very nice hotel I know that the hotel is currently undergoing a significant renovation and guests' opinions depend on a type of room they get. We were lucky, got a fresh and new double room on the 3rd floor. We loved the hotel's location and the area. The room was quite large, had a huge, lovely bed and was nicely furnished.

<Content>A Slice of Heaven! I love this hotel, have stayed here twice. It is in a great spot on the east side of Berlin right in the heart of fabulous shopping and walking distance from some of the sites such as Checkpoint Charlie. Everything is new as it has been totally rennovated, the hotel staff is top class and the restaurant is really good (althoughy fairly American). I look forward to Berlin because of the Westin!

<Content>Nice location, but don't expect much I was in Berlin July 2006 (for the worldcup final) and I decided to return because I loved the city. For my first stay I stayed at the Steigenberguer hotel, quite nice, but I didn't love the location so for my second visit I decided to go to the Grand Westin, since Westin had never let me down.I browsed their site and I saw amazing pictures, great rooms, very modern... an amazing hotel! When I got there, and my room was asigned I was in shock! My room was in the furthest wing from the lobby and it couldn't have been worse, it literally was more than 50 years old, the beds were very stiff, the bathroom was not very clean and it was very disfunctional. After going through a lot of talking with the managers they changed our room, but it was still quite old (like 30 years) and not much of a 5 stars room. I must say as well that location was incredible, and the service wasn't bad. But if you would tell me about going another time there I would really reconsider it.I must recommend the adlon hotel, right in the brandenburg gate, and an awesome 5 star hotel.

<Content>The Benchmark for Berlin After staying in a not so grand hotel in the German capital as the name might have suggested, the Westin Grand was a pleasant surprise! When I asked for a quiet room I was upgraded to a room with garden view free of charge. The rooms are ideal for business travel. It's possible to work and relax in convenient and comfortable surroundings, no big fuzz about designer somethings... And it's soooo QUIET right in the center of Berlin! Unless you step outside. The location is extraordinarily good for sightseeing as well as for doing business.And the champagne breakfast is a real treat...

<Content>First class hotel and staff Following a disatrous experience at the Westin Turnberry last month the Westin Grand Berlin restored my confidence in the Westin GroupWe arrived at 1010 am following an early flight form Terminal 5 Heathrow (superb incidentally, with no delays) to find our suite not only ready but containing complimentary flowers champagne and chocolatesFro the moment of exiting the courtesy car at the hotel we were treated like royalty. The Concierge was superb and set the standard of service throughout our stay. All staff we met could not do enough but without being over the topThe furnishings and cleanliness throughout was excellent and someone is doing a good job in managing all of this and there was not a complaint thoughout the weekendThe food was good ,well presented and whilst expensive you never felt you were being ripped off; the beers and wines tip topThe Hotel is situated off the Unter den Linden on Friedrichstrasse and used to be the place to stay for the top communist politicians pre 1989.A thoroughly good hotel offering excellent service and well recommended

The internal architectural structure is beautiful, friendly staff and room was very pleasant.Be warned that the pool is being renovated at present, so you can't use it.Also, I got a room overlooking some tired concrete roofs - not sure if better views are available upon request...

<Content>Good but not Great The Westin Grand is a bit of a contradiction. Its location is outstanding, right at Freidrichstrasse next to the fabulous Gallerie Lafayette department store in what used to be East Berlin, walking distance to Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag and Checkpoint Charlie, etc.The hotel continues to undergo renovations and expansion. During our 5 day stay, the concierge was only available during the day, which is bizarre for a hotel of this class. There was no one at the concierge desk who knew what they were doing during the early evenings when we came back. I don't know if someone is on vacation or the hotel is just cutting corners.We asked for and got a better room than we were given at first, which was noisy and not impressive. We got a slightly better room than standard which faced the inner courtyard and gardens.Breakfasts were very good.There was just something lacking in terms of service quality and ambience. It really comes down to what you paid for your room which raises (or lowers) your expectations.If you can get this hotel for a good price, you'll be content. If you pay for what you thought was a 5 star hotel, you won't.

<Content>Nice hotel, recently refurbished I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights in March on business. The hotel is situated in the old East German quarter. In the local area you have lots of great shops and it is about 600 metres from the famous Checkpoint Charlie. It鈥檚 a great spot.The lobby is lovely and reception is very friendly and efficient. The rooms are all recently renovated with flat screen television and nice d茅cor. I also understand they are finishing the spa in May which will complete the renovations in the hotel.I thoroughly recommend this hotel if you are spending some time in Berlin and especially if you plan to visit the high end shops and department stores. The Buggati dealership is right across the street and they have the Veron supercar on display for the car fans. The only issue I can think of is that it on the other side of town from the airport; it鈥檚 about 25 euros in a cab.

<Content>Stunning Hotel Stayed on an SPG deal for $50 and got a brand new room (which was superb, wonderful bed too).The only building work going on now is in the pool area (finishing in May) so all the other public areas are clear. The Westin is a stunning hotel, with a really lively upmarket piano bar.

<Content>Disappointing Had been warned of a noiseless facelift but was unprepared to battle my way through a foyer of painters and then have to step over debris and rolled up carpets to find the room. Really not worth the money for such a top class hotel. They should have closed for such extensive work and I think it is just greedy to keep it open but treat it's guests as second class citizens. My request to speak to the Manager was ignored as was a letter whilst I was staying there.Would not return as so much choice in Berlin but can say it's situation is ideal for walking to the sights.

<Content>Amazing location Note: The hotel is in the middle of a renovation so all this may change soon.We booked a Starwood Preferred Guest point stay online. The bulk of the hotel is in the middle of a renovation. Most of the lobby was blocked off, only one restaurant was open, and there were hardly any guests at the hotel. That being said though, our room was newly renovated, looked and smelled brand new, was appointed with modern furnishings, had what seemed like new linens, and had virtually no signs of wear. We heard virtually no construction noise during our 3 night stay. Although many of the facilities were reduced, room service was in full operation and arrived quickly, the front desk staff was helpful, and the bell staff eager to please in helping us to rapidly get a power adapter and ethernet cable. The best part of the hotel is the location. It is about 2 blocks from the Brandenberg Gate, right across the street from a series of three luxury malls, 50' from a U-bahn stop, and about a 15 minute walk from museum island. Overall a very pleasant stay, and an absolute bargain at only 7,000 SPG points per night!

<Content>Good location, still adhering to Communist service standards I stayed at the Westin for eight nights during a business conference. I did so partly because it was very convenient to my conference and partly because I knew it had been the flagship fancy hotel of East Germany during the GDR. The public spaces--especially the lobby--are beautiful, but the rooms are sadly in dire need of renovation. There's an air of shabbiness about the room fixtures and furnishings. Breakfast was okay but overpriced even by European chain hotel standards, especially with the cafes of Unter den Linden only steps away.That's the main plus of this hotel--great location in the heart of Mitte, with an express bus from the airport stopping only a block away. And almost everything I wanted to see in my off hours was an easy walk from the hotel.Service, however, is appalling for a chain hotel of this calibre and price range. When I arrived at 1 pm, I was told that I couldn't check in till 3. That's not unreasonable. I was told to leave my bag at the front desk and it would be taken to my room when I came back. Well, arriving at three, I checked in, got a key, walked into the room, but surprise! My luggage wasn't there, though somebody else's was. Traipsed back to the front desk, waiting for the front desk staff person to finish a phone call. When I told him about the problem, he asked Are you sure? C'mon, the one thing people are likely to be really sure of is what their suitcase looks like. They issued me a new room key and told me to wait for a bit till someone could help locate my bag. Half an hour later, waiting in the glittering lobby, I had to get in line again at the front desk and ask when someone could help me. This time I was told to accompany a non-English speaking guy into the baggage room and he pantomimed to me to see if my luggage was there. Frankly, as a woman traveling alone, I wasn't crazy about being alone n a secluded part of the hotel with a male staffer. But it was equally disturbing that hotel guests' property wasn't better secured. Honestly, I could have taken as many bags as I wanted for all they cared. As it turned out, my bag wasn't there. Back to the front desk, who suggested that I go back to my room and when the bag was found, they'd call me. Two hours went by without a call. I asked to speak to the manager and was told that I could file a lost baggage claim for compensation as long as I had proof of the contents of my bag. I think that's about when I lost it.After a small but well earned public tantrum, the manager said he would look into the situation himself. Twenty minutes later, they found the bag--apparently another guest found it in his or her room and had brought it down to the main desk hours earlier.I don't have to have effusive service to be happy, but this was in the Fawlty Towers category.

<Content>Confortable hotel, convenient location Westin's are normally of a pretty good quality and this hotel seemed fairly typical of the brand.. Most of the expected amenities were present and correct and my stay was comfortable enough..I had a day to kill in Berlin and booked the Westin as a base.. I chose it because a) it offered a good rate (the Grand Hyatt was twice the price), b) I participate in the Starwood preferred guest programme and c) my previous experience of the brand was +ve.Firstly, I only really used the room as a base, so I didn't use most of the hotel's facilities and cannot comment on food/beverage/service etc..The room (a renovated one) was nice enough, if a little gold and brown (as is the whole hotel, which can feel a little old style).. But comfortable, nonetheless.. the amenities were as expected..Located in what used to be part of East Belin, the hotel's location was absolutely fantastic for a walking tour of the main parts of the old Berlin centre (Mitte).. certainly, in my opinion, in a better location that the Am Zoo area (in the former West Berlin) if you want to see the sights.. The hotel is close to a U Bahn station, so you can also explore further afield using a day pass for the U-bahn and s-bahn..Luggage service and valet parking all worked as it should.Bottom line.. nothing particularly worng with my stay,,

<Content>Nice city break Me and my wife went to the Grand Westin Hotel, Berlin for a 3 night city break. We found it to be lovely hotel and in a good location, with the Unter Den Linden just round the corner. The room though was a little dated for a four star hotel. The hotel bar was lovely and the reception area was very impressive. Also the pool area is well worth the visit. A Good hotel to visit Berlin.

<Content>Outstadinng Hotel Stayed in this extremely well-located hotel in Oct 2007. I found the staff to be extraordinarily friendly and were incredibly helpful in handling a pickpocketed wallet episode. The lobby atrium was magnificent and the location could not have been better.The room was modern, well-equipped (except as noted below) and had excellent temperature control.However, the mattress on our bed was probably the worst I have slept on since my college days. It must have been 30 years old and sagged in the middle. How a hotel of this caliber could have provided such a mattress is beyond my comprehension.Another negative, was the lack of ice machines.

<Content>Good location, good hotel I stayed at the Westin Grand this past weekend during my trip to Berlin to run the marathon. As a family member of a Starwood Hotels employee I have stayed at many Westin properties and this one was about in the middle in terms of quality. On the plus side, the location was great. It is close to public transportation, close to many of the city attractions and close to the start of the marathon. It also was great to have access to the spa and pool before and after the race. I also agree with many posters that the breakfast was great. They also did not charge me for my 7 year old son and he eats quite a bit. On the negative side, was the fact they did not change towels on one day and only stocked the bathroom supplies once for a 3 night stay. Additionally, room service for a pot of coffee took 1 hour. I stayed in an unrenovated room with a view out the window onto Fredrichstrasse. This was nice since I could see a portion of the race route and could watch roller bladers and runners go by from my window. Overall the stay was just above neutral.

<Content>positives outweigh the negatives I can agree with some of the previous postings, but we had an excellent stay here last week. The rooms may not be huge, but they are well furnished and decorated, with quiet efficient aircon and amazingly comfortable beds. There was a faint hint of sulphur in the bathroom, but it wasn't a problem, and the room had good fittings with a powerful shower and excellent lighting.We found the staff courteous and helpful. The breakfast was amazing- although expensive at 28 Euro. I have never seen such a wide choice of fruits,meats ,fish ,breads, pastries and hot foods, as well as eggs and omelettes cooked to order. Although the hotel was busy we never had a problem finding a table free.The best thing about the hotel for a tourist is the position- perfect for exploring the eastern city on foot.The Brandenburg Gate was about 400 yds, as was the Museum Island. The beautiful Gendarmesmarkt with its restaurants and bars was even nearer. To get to the western sights the number 100 and 200 buses stop 50 yds away, and they go to all the places a tourist would want.All in all I would highly recommend this hotel. Get a good deal on the net that includes breakfast ( we got one with GTA) and you won't be disappointed

<Content>Trip to Berlin We had a small trip to Berlin this spring and choosed this hotel because it is easy to reach and in the heart of berlin. Breakfast is one of the best I ever had, but you have to wait quite a long time to get seated in this small and crowded breakfast room. As this is a quite large luxury hotel, the rooms are really small. The room we got was nothing special, small, clean, thats it. Overall the hotel is quite ok, but I had better ones.

<Content>Fab Hotel I have visited the Westin Grand Hotel in Berlin on 4 occasions now and apart from the problems with the credit card payments on departure I only have good things to say. The location of this hotel is brilliant, round the corner from the Unter den Linden and all the sites.The staff are very helpful and pleasant, the rooms are spacious and clean and the beds are so comfy you struggle to get up in the morning. The breakfast is the best I have ever had anywhere, it's the only place I have ever stayed where you can have a bucks fizz in the morning. It is also the only hotel I have stayed in where i can get a Grasshopper cocktail. If I have one critisism to make it is the pool is far too cold, you can only stay in there for a short while. Having said that I would recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>No Westin Heavenly Beds We stayed in the Westin Grand Berlin in July 2007. In spite of the fact that the reservation we made through the Starwood Hotels website said our rooms would have Westin's renowned Heavenly Beds, we found that only a few suites actually have the beds. The beds we were subjected to were firm to the point of being like sleeping on a sidewalk. Had we not been told in advance how wonderful our stay would be because of the Heavenly Beds, we might not have been as unpleasantly surprised.The beds and fitness center made it definitely not like a usual Westin stay. The pool was lovely but the work-out room was small, dimly-lit, and hot. There were only two treadmills (one of which was broken), a Lifecycle bike, and four computerized weight machines. There was also one ratty, old floor mat. Almost everything in Germany had English translations, but not the machines there. With the highest breakfast prices we've ever seen, it would have been nice to have in-room beverage stations/coffee makers like one usually finds in Westins. There's a fantastic deli across the street where we purchased breakfast for four for half the price of a single continental breakfast at the hotel.The hotel had two positives: the concierge service and the location. The room price was actually pretty reasonable.

<Content>Would stay again just for the pool!!! This is a very nice hotel in a very nice location. The service is above average, and the indoor pool is the nicest I have ever seen. The only downside to this hotel is the small rooms with no king-size beds. The rooms are nice and quiet, but not what you would expect after walking in to the stunning lobby.

<Content>Very nice hotel Stayed 3 nights in late April (07) at Westin Grand. Great location with good access to transportation but from here you can walk to Museum Island , Reichstag, Brandenburg gate, Kulturforum,Philharmonie. (Last two about 20 to 25 minute walk but in interesting area. ) Very nice breakfast. Concierge was very helpful and the best of hotels we stayed at on this visit. Rooms were bright and clean and were standard size. Lobby area was quite atttactive and the hotel staff in general were very pleasent. There are many nice things about this hotel and I would stay here again if only for the excellent location.

<Content>Grand Hotel in a great location This is a quality hotel in a great location. Well placed for all the tourist attractions with easy links to S  U Bahn (Trains) and the main bus routes. Easy to get to from Shonefeld airport. The staff are friendly and eager to help, overall hotel is what you would expect for 4/5 star in city centre. Booked through lastminute.com for best rates and this was very reasonable. Drinks etc are expensive within hotel however that is to be expected, take a stroll outside the hotel and drinks and food are half the price. We will return to this excellent hotel soon.

<Content>This is a Westin??? I love Westin's... Heavenly bed. Heavenly bath. Great service. Well, the Westin Grand Berlin has a Heavenly Lobby, a Heavenly Spa and great service. The bed, bath and room in general would only be considered heavenly by the defunct communist regime... Very dissappointing, actually. I had expected more.

<Content>An elegant hotel The Westin Grand is the perfect hotel to stay in Berlin. Conveniently situated for most tourist attractions and transport systems.Comprehensive tourist information supplied by the hotel.Room was adequate and well serviced- the only complaint was the lack of pillows.One chair in a double room does not make sense. The public areas were attractive, warm and welcoming.ALL staff were friendly and helpful and made our trip very enjoyable. The breakfast served would put many high class establishments to shame - choice, quality, comfort, presentation and service could not be faulted. After that, who needs lunch?We will definitely be returning to Berlin and the Westin Grand

<Content>Lovely hotel The Westin Grand is located in the upmarket Mitte area, which is ideal for shopping, sightseeing and eating out. Some of the best restaurants and tourist attractions are located within walking distance. The hotel staff was friendly and efficient. The rooms were sufficient, if a little warm but as we were there in February it wasn't an issue. The kids liked the hotel and loved the pool area. The U stations nearby made this an ideal location for sightseeing. The breakfast was truly delicious (if a bit expensive at 鈧?6 a head) but as it was all you can eat buffet it kept us going until tea time! I highly recommend this hotel as an ideal base for business or tourist trips to Berlin.

<Content>Wonderful Weekend at the Westin We just returned from a 3 night weekend stay at the Westin Grand Hotel in Berlin. First of all we found the location to be excellent and completely convenient to transportation and all East Berlin sights.We arrived early Friday morning and 1 of our 2 rooms booked was ready for check in, which was very convenient. This was the Premium Deluxe Courtyard room. It is traditionally furnished with a queen size heavenly bed. The room was apx. 340 sq. ft. but big enough for a desk  chair and a comfortable club chair. The bathroom is small but adequate with good lighting, hair dryer, several mirrors and a make up mirror. It is certainly not a super deluxe bathroom but comfortable. The lobby of the hotel is beautiful with a grand staircase and elegant atrium. The lobby bar has a grand piano and a pianist every night from 5:00 to about midnight. it's costly but a great place to relax for a drink and a cigar. The staff was very responsive and friendly and the concierge took care of all our reservations and touring needs.The second room we booked was a Grand deluxe room and was not to be ready until after 3:00 PM. However, we were told that we would be given a double upgrade to a junior suite. Also a traditionally furnished room. it had the same bathroom as the Premium room. This room was much larger with a separate living room, couch, desk  chair and club chair. The bedroom area had a king bed with a closet and dressing table. The room also faced the courtyard and it was very quiet which was great. The pool  spa area are excellent with a hot tub, full bar for snacks, sauna, showers, infinity pool, etc. Buffet breakfast was included in our rate and was outstanding. German breads are incredible. The cheese cart was an unusual breakfast treat as was the free flowing champagne, The cost of this buffet is 26 euros if it is not included in your rate. A la carte breakfast can be had at the lobby bar. I would rate this hotel as an excellent 4* property.

<Content>WE LOVED IT. Berlin was the start of our Europe trip and the Westin was a great start to our holiday. Without doubt when in Berlin we will try to stay here again. The location is perfect (a few minutes walk to Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag),the heavenly beds are heavenly, the buffet breakfast is superb and the quality of the hotel far exceeded our expectations. We were there for 3 nights in February and with limited time location is so important - and this hotel was the perfect choice.

<Content>Nice Place Stayed at the Westin Grand Berlin in late January of 2007. We paid 120 Euro/night for Fri and Sat night. The hotel had a great location that was in good walking distance of all the major attractions, shopping, and restaurants. Our room was nice, had an old fashion feel to it, with a nice view of the street below. My only complaint about the room was our shower went on the fritz and would lose its water pressure; I let them know when we left. The pool and spa area was extremely nice, but we forgot our suits! Overall I though the hotel was very nice, and we had a pleasant stay.

<Content>As good as the reviews suggest Booked the hotel via an internet deal at a very good rate including breakfast. The breakfasts are extremely good, with a huge choice. A very civilised start to the day with oodles of coffee etc. We found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. The concierge was magnificent, booking tables at local restaurants for us.(Lutter  Wegener at Gendarmenmarkt is great, and not expensive- their weiner schnitzel etc. is legendary!) He also helped out by calling the airline to confirm return flights. The room was very warm, clean and comfortable, in fact the entire hotel was very clean. The only problem is that most people smoke, and the central atrium allows that to drift up to all floors. We had a non-smoking room, which was fine.The location is brilliant, and the public transport easy. We took a bus from the airport to the hotel, the TXL from Tegel, and it took about 20mins.The History museum along Unden Den Linden is very good, as is the DDR and Jewish Museums. We will go back soon, as there is so much to see.

<Content>Loved the Westin!!! My son (17 yrs old) and I went to Berlin for an early graduation present the week of Dec 17th 2006. Our room was wonderful.We stayed on the fourth floor. We had a big closet and a sitting area.We had a balcony that overlooked Unter den Linden. It was all lit up at night . It was so beautiful.The room was cleaned day except one day when my son had a bit of jet lag and slept in too long-I just called down to housekeeping but I guess they didn't understand. So I talked to the front desk and they straightened it out. The staff is very pleasant especially if you at least attempt to speak German (Gooten Morgen, etc). Their buffet breakfast is to die for!!! My son and I are still talking about it.- I noticed that if I carried a German Newspaper at breakfast(they are free when you walk in) in stead of the English one the staff was a bit more friendly!!!! The pool is cold but the hot tub is great. The gym is just a small room with a few pieces of equiptment.Oh beware- my son was surprised (and not pleasantly)by the naked co-ed steam room!!!!!!!! Yikes!!!

<Content>Not exactly what the website says! Bit of a dissappointment to be honest. Rooms needed upgrading badly (and our view was of the roof!) and a good clean! The wing where our rooms were had bad smell. When we complained about the smell the staff simply told us to open the windows. Some staff were very nice and helpful and others were not at all. When we mentioned our room hadn't been cleaned one day they simply dumped clean towels in the room and didn't even tidy up!There was also some inconsistency on the service...we were there with family and our room got turned down every night and a free bit of chocolate while the other room never got that...and we all checked in together and paid the same price!

<Content>Disappointed for the price Obviously this is a high end hotel located in the heart of old East Berlin. For the price we paid for the room; however, I left very disappointed. The rooms were very small and noisy. The hotel itself is clean and ornate, but not spectacular. We actuall returned to Berlin later on this trip and stayed at a different hotel for 1/3 the price and twice the ambiance and experience.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Location The Westin Berlin was wonderful!We had a great room, the bathroom floor was heated, my husband loved that.The staff was very helpful. The breakfast which was included in our package was outstanding! Every type of sausage, American breakfast with cook to order eggs, waffles, European breakfast with cold cuts, herring and salmon. Every type of bread, rolls, sweet rolls, pretzels.You could have coffee, lattes, champagne!The location was in the middle of everything. We would stay here again and again.

<Content>Top Class This is the best hotel in Berlin for its value, quality and proximity to all the major sights.We have stayed here on a number of occasions including our wedding anniversaries, birthdays and other special days such as the Christmas Markets weekends.We have now got to know the charming pianist in the rteception and he plays our tune when we walk in.All aspects of this hotel cannot be faulted and the hotel has been used in films including The Bourne Supremacy and the French National Football Team stayed there during the World Cup this year. The Westin Grand is on the corner of Unter den Linden and Friedrichs Strasse and the Brandeburg Gate is only a few yards away. Many of the major sights (sites) are in walking distance.One may book seats on a Berlin tour in a bus at reception or walk across the Unter den Linden and hop aboard one which appears every fifteen minutes...This IS THE hotel, we recommend it highly.

<Content>Great stay -again The Westin Grand is usually the hotel I choose on trips to Berlin. It's probably 5-6 times a year. It's the charme of an old school Grand Hotel, no scandinavian chique, old fashioned and very cosy.The room was on the 5th floor, not too big, but ok. The bathroom was nicely equipped, the bed was ok. Too soft for my taste.The best thing about this hotel is the breakfast buffet. The selection is superb, the quality is outstanding. Best puppy seed rolls in the world.If you book it online, you might get a deal below 13 Euros, which is a great rate for a hotel like that.

<Content>GDR nostalgia This hotel, built in 1987, was the pride of the late German Democratic Republic, designed to show international guests that communists were able to provide luxury. However, the result was and still is mixed. The historical style appears kitschy, especially the lobby which is dominated by made-up columns. The rooms are in historical style, too. Bathroom and furnishing are rather 4 star than 5 star.The pool is quite nice - round with some waterplays. Note the odd signage and strange translations into English - still GDR nostalgia.The location is certainly good, but there is no view. The Hilton on Gendarmenmarkt certainly has the better location.

<Content>OK Good location in the heart of Mitte. The room was acceptable; clean with a comfortable bed. Decor is in the dowdy, frumpy Edwardian style. Not my taste. It was annoying though that they do not provide free internet access. The staff was friendly and helpful and spoke English perfectly. While there's nothing wrong with this place, the Radisson (yes, a Radisson!) on Alexander Platz is a much better option.

<Content>A good choice and not disappointed I booked this as a special birthday treat for my husband, and after consultaion with our travel agent who had stayed there. We returned home this evening so it is all fresh in my mind.We had booked a deluxe room and were told on arrival that we had been upgraded to a 'Preferred Guest Room' - it was large, with king size bed, easy chairs, desk etc, and overlooked the main entrance. The room was clean, smart, but uninspiring - slightly dated decor, but nothing looked old or shabby, and these things are a matter of taste. The bathroom was small, but so well equipped and everything worked. And it was spotless.The hotel itself was impressive and we enjoyed the main lobby - though lobby is an understatement! We had drinks there on both nights, listened to the fantastic pianist and generally chilled out after a hard day of walking. We didn't think the drinks were exhorbitant for a 5-star hotel (though we do come from the UK and everywhere is cheaper than the UK), but the bottle of mineral water in our room, which we had assumed was complimentary, cost us 7.50 euros, which we thought was crazy, but to be fair, the dinky little tag around the neck of the bottle did give the price - we just didn't read it. And the Herald Tribune that was hanging nicely bagged on our door on the first morning was not free either.We dined in the hotel on the second night, and it was fine. Nothing memorable, but nothing to complain about. The breakfasts were magnificent - it was included in our deal, but I consider it well worth the euros even if you have to pay. Truly the best breakfast, and the widest choice of food, I can remember being offered in a hotel.We found the staff to be professionally friendly, and mostly competent. We reported a non-working bathroom sink plug on the first afternoon and it didn't get repaired despite the concierge making an immediate phone call. My husband fixed it in 2 minutes that evening. The Heavenly Bed was indeed heavenly - though maybe too hard for some tastes. The towels were thick and fluffy and the toiletries were of good quality. Bottom line is we found it a good place to stay - great location, somewhere to come back to that was comfortable and welcoming. No hassle, no wasting time at reception getting things put right - we are fussy and don't hesitate to complain, and didn't feel the need this time.

<Content>Good Location, Rooms Need Upgrading In terms of location, this hotel is very well placed on the main Friedrichstrasse thoroughfare in Berlin. Although it's the former East Berlin, it's not evident at all given the location of the Gucci, Mont Blanc and Hermes shops in the same area.The guest rooms are comfortable but distinctly average for a Sheraton/Westin with no coffee making, no iron (but reasonable TV) I had a room on the inner courtyard on the 2nd Floor that was relatively small and uninspiring and this was apparently a 'Preferred' room in the SPG Gold program.I would therefore state it's good for overnight business trips but certainly not for a weekend stay.

<Content>Good hotel, lousy staff The hotel is ideally located. If you're a walker, you are close to many attractions. Room was big, bath was lovely, but watch out for the tile floor after you shower. No curtains, and water pours off you onto the tile floor which has a drain. Put your towel on the wet floor or you will definitely slip.Desk staff needs to go to a Waldorf class on manners. Very cold reception, couldn't answer a few simple questions for directions to a few of the sights or an ATM.Room was nice but does need to be vacuumed more frequently than ours was.. Pretzels and cookies under the bed. Chair upholstery needs to be cleaned. We turned the cushions over. What a difference.. Don't eat breakfast in the restaurant, too costly. Walk 2 to 3 blocks away and get a muffin, coffee, or egg sandwich for about 6 Euros..Liked the room, and the location, but didn't care for the staff of the hotel. Look around the same area for another hotel. Think you can do better.

<Content>Perfect location, attractively appointed. We overlooked the interior gardens from the 6th floor. The room was not large but it was comfortable. The pool area was great . It had a sauna, hot tub and a variety of shower styles so you could do your own version of Baden-Baden baths. The location is perfect , being at the corner of Friedrichstrasse and Unter den Linden , near the Brandenburg Gate, the Reichstag and the Tiergarten and a short walk to Checkpoint Charley and The Wall. We didn't eat at the hotel, but it looked very attractive. We chose to have breakfast at the Ka Da We and the Hotel Adlon. We only had 2 nights but we found it most enjoyable.

<Content>Perfect Location I stayed at the Westin Grand for 7 nights and would definitely recommend the hotel as a good value. You are not going to beat the location-off Unter den Linden and Friedrichstrasse with a Ubahn station and Sbahn station very near and many sights within easy walking distance. The hotel lobbby is very nice. The room was small though nice. The bed was definitely old and ready for replacement however. The service was excellent. The buffet breakfast was include in my $150/night rate and was outstanding. All in all a great deal and a nice hotel in a great part of town.

<Content>old fashioned, but still my favorite... Fantastic location in the middle of East-Berlin at the corner of two historic streets. The hotel was build in the Eastern Germany Days, but its renovated in most parts. I was here many times before and have seen all kind of rooms (make sure, you get an renovated one with Heavenly Bed!). Due to my SPG Platinum Status, this time I had a corner suite with a great view, but it was a old interior... Try the breakfast, its fantastic, but expensive (鈧?5). Beside the location the best thing is the atrium lobby ... very old fashioned, but a great spot! My favorite hotel in Berlin!

<Content>Comfortable Hotel in a good location Stayed 2 nights and paid 拢46.50 PPPN BB. Breakfast was very good, Room service was prompt and the choice extensive. Spacious leisure facilities and lobby bar. Staff were efficient, helpful and polite and our standard room was spacious and clean and a comfortable temperature. It overlooked the road but was triple glazed so no lost sleep. Well located for the sights, the underground and trains to the Airport. Good value and would recommend.

<Content>Absolutely terrible My husband and I stayed at the Westin for three nights. We had booked a non-smoking room but were given a smoking room instead. Our room was down a long corridor with three dead lightbulbs, which we pointed out but were not replaced during our stay. As soon as I arrived I went to wash my hands and I the head of the tap came off. The fridge door became unhinged as soon as I opened it. This would have been funny were it not because we were on a rare break and, in addition, the room was tired, smelly, had a stained carpet and a stained armchair. The net curtains had not seen a washer in a long while. The sheets were not changed for three days and one the them had a suspicious rosy mark on it. However, the worst thing was the level of service (or rather the complete lack of it). We were not given another room and had to wait until the next day for the tap and fridge to be fixed. I asked for the sheets to be changed three times and I was told they would be, but it never happened. Reception staff were plain rude and even the manager told me (I still can't believe I heard this) that they had given us a smoking room, even if I had asked for a NS one because I happen to be Spanish and most Spanish people smoke! We tried the pool to relax ouserselves but after waiting for 15 mins to get some towels we gave up (a single lady was managing the beauty centre and the whole pool area). The following day we were lucky with the towels, but found the poolside furniture dirty, We were never given any apologies or signs of regret for the shortcomings we had to deal with. A frustrating and depressing experience. I had to pinch myself to believe it was actually happening.

<Content>Best hotel in Berlin?? I stayed there during the weekend of the world cup final. It was my first stay in a Westin, and I was amazed upon enterring. The taxi couldn't not go up to the entrance as it was blocked off with football fans, police and media personnel ---- the French team had selected the Westin as well!!!After making it through the crowd we arrived at check in to an amazing lobby. If that was a sign of things to come everything would be perfect. The room was just as impressive, very spacious and luxurious. I was on the 4th floor and the French team were on the 5th floor. Security was all over the hotel to protect the world cup finalist I presume. Guests had to produce room keys to get entry into the hotel.The service was incredible and the bar in the lobby area had the perfect atmosphere for alcohol consumption. When we reached back after the final, we consumed some beverages there and saw the French team return, most of them in tears. Also saw Diego Maradona, since he too was staying at the Westin, maybe its the #1 hotel in Berlin.

<Content>Still Mixed Briefly stated, the previous writers who titled their reviews schizophrenic hotel and mixed bag have it right on the Westin Grand Berlin. Like a few other reviewers here, I'm Starwood Platinum with extensive five star hotel experience throughout most of the world.The Westin IS in a great location. In fact, so much so that it is hosting several of the World Cup teams (including Argentina, while we were there). And, while we didn't try the breakfast oft written about here, can probably take it on faith that it's good.But, now seemingly more than two years after the first reviews appeared here lamenting the state of guest rooms, the Westin still hasn't finished upgrading them. Perhaps more concerning, one would have to conclude they're not planning to do so (more than two years seems like a sufficiently long enough time to complete an upgrade if one was really intended?).The hotel has six floors of rooms--we stayed in room 663 which is NOT an upgraded room. Upon checkin, we were shown to the room by a helpful and friendly bell hop (can't recall his name). Immediately on seeing the very rigid-looking (and decidedly not heavenly) bed, we called down to the desk to ask about switching rooms. The operator told us they could switch us to an executive room after claiming the bed in 663 was a European Heavenly Bed (a flat-out misrepresentation--the bed was/is simply an old model that has probably been in that room for many years). The friendly bellhop then showed us the proposed alternative executive room which was on the 4th floor, smaller and with the same type of bed. Having been clear with the desk agent that we were interested to change to get a more comfortable bed, this exercise was an annoying waste of time. We stuck with 663.No problems with foul odors--that seems to have been a problem the hotel has addressed (though I'm amazed any here would pay for a hotel/stay in one with that problem as reported).Finally, when we checked out early on a Saturday morning, we were told that the entire computer system was down so we couldn't be checked out. They'd just charge the card and send a receipt. Naturally, given some of the reports here about erroneous charges appearing on bills, I wasn't too excited about this. But, that can happen and it's only worth of mention because the desk clerk, a blonde woman, was particularly unfriendly. Other than the agent on the phone at the beginning and checkout, the staff were generally friendly (as was everyone in Germany with all the enthusiasm about World Cup).I'd encourage any considering staying here to make sure you get a rate under E200 (it's reasonably priced at that level (and even a bit higher if you're certain to get an upgraded room--these seem to be the 5th floor--that's where the Argentine national football team was housed anyway)). I'd also encourage the hotel to be a bit more transparent with guests--especially those of us who know the Westin product very well.

<Content>Fantastic We stayed at the Westin for 4 nights and had a fantastic experience. The hotel certainly has a wow factor and for all those people that have moaned about this hotel are obviously to stuck up to appreciate a first class hotel!Everything about the hotel is brilliant especially the location. You are within easy reach of all the main attractions and sites. Our room was lovely and clean and was turned down every night. The hotel pool and sauna was a real treat and is lovely to go to in the morning before you go to breakfast. You really are spoilt for the breakfast which is fit for a king! It is a little pricey but if you manage to get a deal which includes breakfast you will not be disappointed. There are a number of bakeries around the hotel if you don't want to do this.My husband and I are both in our mid - late 20's and we enjoyed this hotel. If you want to really spoil yourself then I would highly recommend this hotel. There are NO smells to complain of, the BEDS are very comfortable and the staff are EXTREMELY friendly and helpful.We will be returning again!

<Content>Lovely hotel in excellent location. Lovely hotel in excellent location for sightseeing. Bus 100 stops on the corner with Unter Der Linden and the underground is just across the street. Excellent breakfast buffet but a little pricey if you're paying separately. If I had to quibble about anything it would be that when going for a swim we were told that they had no towels left and we would have to return to the room and get them from there. Not really what you would expect from a 5 star hotel. I thought the beds were very comfy - unlike some other reviewers. Sniffed everywhere but couldn't smell any bad smells. Would happily stay there again.

<Content>Nice location...but... The Hotel staff were attentive, and I enjoyed the location (near Brandenburg, Museum Island, etc), but I wasn't blown away. I stayed in one of the renovated rooms, and the room itself was quite comfortable--but very small. My main impression was that the place seemed rather empty, even though I was there during one of the busiest weeks for Berlin tourism (ITB). If you want a quiet Hotel near tourist sites, this is for you. If you're looking for that famous Berlin nightlife, look elsewhere.

<Content>Schizophrenic Hotel... My wife and I stayed two nights at this hotel at the end of February. The carnival was in full swinging in Berlin, but not in this hotel. Granted, as you enter the lobby you feel that you are entering into a great hotel. The lobby is beautiful and has a luxurious feel, with a loveably staircase, but the luxury ends right there. The schizophrenic state starts as you begin walking to your room, what an awful smell in the corridor. I concur with previous reviews; I felt I was walking through a sewer. Then you enter the room. A twin bedded room, and I mean twin and small beds. Really separate beds. Request for change was denied, notwithstanding my Starwood card. No heavenly pillows; no heavenly beds; and no heavenly comforters here. I felt I was staying at a **star hotel room. Then you enter the bathroom. It must have been decorated by the owner of a hospital. It was all white, with no goodies. I accept, however, that we had a balcony and a great view unto the Unter den Linden, but that was it. In conclusion, this is no *****star hotel. If you get a great rate per night, like I did using a voucher system, is OK, but otherwise stay elsewhere.

<Content>Certainly a mixed bag, here We stayed at The Westin Grand Hotel and it was just fine. We had a great time in Berlin and the hotel served its purpose. However, it was not spectacular for a few reasons.1. At first we got an unrenovated room. This was not too miserable but we asked to be upgraded in rooms after my back started hurting from the bed. I was under the impression that ALL beds were the so called Heavenly bed and boy were we wrong! The funny thing is, my husband is usually the one with the back pain!When we changed to a renovated room were were delighted with the bathroom but still stumped at exactly what was so heavenly about the bed. It was hard and REALLY uncomfortable. (We were making jokes about it being left over from the Communist era. Tee hee hee)2. Terrible smell of sewers down the corridors of hotel although, thankfully not in our room.3. The main conceirge did not give me a warm and fuzzy feeling. He seemed harried and annoyed at me asking too many questions. He recommended the restaurant Stamhouse which is part of the hotel. It was a sportsbar type place and the food was really not good. The main staff of the hotel were all very nice and they had a bunch of baby supplies for us that were helpful. Not a bad choice, but I wonder if we could have done a bit better...

<Content>OK. Not great but not horrible either I travel a lot and have seen many different types of hotels, from the Grand Hotels to the boutiques, in the US, Europe, Asia, and other countries.Westin Berlin is an OK hotel. It's not that GREAT and does not deserve the 5 rating, nor does it deserve the 1's. Here are a few things to note:(1) Yes, definitely get a room away from the elevators. Closer to the elevators, closer to the atrium where you can hear the piano playing downstairs(2) Westin Heavenly Bed it isn't. They claim that they are the first in Germany to get these Heavenly Beds but they are NOT the same as the Westin Heavenly Beds in the US. These are substantially harder.(3) Decor is very traditional. A bit dated but not horrible.(4) Nice welcome wine and fruits greeted me in my junior suite room. Nice touch.(5) Services is OK as well. Haven't met a rude staff member(6) Have to get Wireless Broadband through T-mobile as there's no broadband through room (at least in my room(7) No airconditioning. Can get a bit hot in the evening so you may want to open the windows. Problem is, it may be noisy outside. (my room was quiet as I was looking over the courtyard)I did Westin as I wanted to get points from Starwood but in retrospect, I would have stayed in Grand Hyatt instead. Not that Westin is horrible, but it aint great either.

<Content>rooms are simply awful! I stayed at the Grand Westin several times. If you get a deluxe room (yes, you are right: deluxe room) you will hate this hotel. Lobby and location is perfect. Service is so so. I'm a Starwood Platinum Member and they didn't upgrade me! They said it was a congress like Berlinale or so. The rooms are so old fashioned, stinky and noisy. Bathrooms are even worse. Dont go for the pictures on the starwood internet site. In reality, rooms look different! (and much worse!!)

<Content>Not a smooth stay. We booked on Expedia for Jan 2006, and were put in one of the unrenovated rooms. The room was fine, a bit dated, decent size though and new beds. There was no air-circulation in room. The bathroom was not up to standard. I noticed they were renovating a lot of rooms when we were there, ripping out the old stained toilets. Four nights into our six night stay we asked to be changed to a non-smoking area as the smoke would drift in to our room at night, but they said they were full. The room was quiet at least, as it was on inside courtyard of hotel. It was a long long walk to the elevator though as we were at the end of two corridors.The service was friendly but not smooth. For example we found out after we left the hotel that we had received none of our telephone messages. Also when we checked out they tried to charge our bill to a credit card that was not ours. In fact they tried to charge it to a credit card that belonged tosomeone we know in New York who had emailed the hotel earlier during our stay and requested a bottle of champagne be sent to our room and had given theircredit card number for that sole purpose. They had no record of the credit card we had given them for inprint at check-in.Another example is that when we booked train tickets through the hotel they neglected to tell us upfront that there would be a travel agency fee.We went in the spa pool. It was lukewarm and the jets did not work. A guest went looking for an attendant to help us out, the attendant said there were technical difficulties and it was not working. The regular pool was slightly heated. Breakfast is amazing. Location can not be beaten

<Content>Great! We stayed at the Westin Grand for two nights in Jan 06. It麓s an very nice hotel, located close to anything in the heart of Berlin. It麓s located at the quite famous Friedrichstrasse, just an 150m walk from Unter den Linden and a 500m walk to the Brandenburger Tor/Reichstag. It麓s a 5-star hotel and really worth it. Service was great all the time. My room was nice and classic with no noise problems at all. We were very happy with the hotels restaurant Friedrich麓s. Would definately stay there again, given the good rate we got (EUR 114,00 ---).

<Content>Luxury from start to finish Staying here was a wonderful experience - it was sheer luxury. My husband and I booked for 4 nights over the Christmas break and also booked in for the Christmas lunch. We arrived at 11.30pm and it was so nice to step in to a warm and friendly haven after experiencing the freezing weather outside. We took the S-bahn from the airport and it was only a 5 minute walk from Friedrichstrasse station to the hotel. Very convenient.I was worried about the noisiness detailed in other reviews so specifically requested a quiet room away from the elevator. It was extremely quiet - we didn't hear a thing and had no troubles at all. Probably because our room was off the main atrium part - I think it must have been a Deluxe (but we got an exceelent deal on their website).Breakfast was not included (which is why it was probably such a good rate) but that suited us since we could take our time each morning rather than rush down to breakfast. And I highly recommend Einstein Cafe for breakfast which is 2 minutes from the hotel on Friederichstrasse - excellent coffee! They also do takeaways which we sometimes got and took back to our lovely room to relax.The location is fantastic - close to everything. We went to the opera one night (book tickets through the website) and we were able to walk there and back to the hotel (5-10 mins). If you are thinking of a Christmas break next year - this place cannot be beaten. The lunch was sensational. It was a luxurious buffet with oysters, prawns, scallops, roast goose and all the trimmings - and for only 鈧?5 a head!! It was great to be able to come back to the room afterwards for a nap!Overall this hotel is grand - the rooms are medium size, clean and have every convenience you could need (no tea and coffee making facilities though). The lobby is lovely and the staff all friendly and cannot do enough for you.Highly recommended.

<Content>Grandeur expected of a Westin The hotel and its staff were up to par of that expected of a Westin property. There were a few items worth improving upon: 1. The Television set was extremely small for the size of the room. 2. When a room is booked for two, it should have 2 robes in the room. There was only one. 3. The Spa was lovely. However, the spa staff left a whole lot to be desired. My colleague and I had to ring the bell numerous times and still no one showed up after 10 minutes of waiting for a towel and locker key. The attendant that finally DID show was quite rude to my colleague. Both the attendant and my colleague spoke fluent German, so why he was rude to her was beyond my imagination. This behaviour is not typical of most Westin properties I have visited. A change in staff would greatly improve the situation. If this had been my first exposure to a Westin, I would have been livid. It was most unfortunate because the facilities were more than ample and were very well maintained. The personal touch was very much missing at the Spa. But, to be fair, the rest of the hotel staff, including the housekeepers, concierge, front desk staff, bar tenders, etc. were nothing short of professional and polite.

<Content>A great place, with amazing location and super nice staff. I guess I was lucky. My room was a perfect size and extremely cheap for the type of hotel. I liked the bathroom and everything was new and up-to-date. The lobby is great, and the staff were nothing but nice. The location can't be beat, especially if you are there to shop. I was unfortunately on a business trip and couldn't take advantage of everything but I wasn't at the Westin the first nor last time.

<Content>Great overall, but rooms are not exceptional We were a bit surprised by the size of the room, given that we had booked a Deluxe double, and given that it is a 5-star hotel.The pool was very nice, although we had too little time to enjoy it. The lobby is indeed very beautiful, and the piano gives it a touch of old American movie.Also a bit noisy during the day, with FriedrichStrasse, and possibly the piano if you get a room close to the atrium. These for the negative details, but the place is overall very beautiful.

<Content>Room for improvement The hotel lobby has a definite wow factor - the galleried atrium is impressive and the Christmas decorations are beautiful. The lobby and restaurant staff are extremely pleasant. However, the hotel did not impress beyond this. Our visit was part of a 40th birthday celebration. We emailed ahead and asked for a bottle of champagne to be delivered and charged to the room upon arrival. No response from the email I sent to Wendy, the front-desk manager and no champagne in the room. The room itself was very disappointing: torn bedsheet, unacceptably noisy air conditioning and a most unimpressive bathroom (white-tiled and institutional-looking). We complained to reception and were offered an upgrade for an extra 50 euros per night. We declined and were eventually - and clearly reluctantly - upgraded to a room one floor up and exactly the same size. Only differences: the air-conditioning was much quieter (largely because it did not work); and a mini-bar with a blown fuse (any takers for warm Diet Coke at nearly four euros a throw?). We were also absolutely appalled to find that the television in the room featured free-to-view hard-core pornography. This is simply unacceptable. Last but not least the hotel appears to have a serious problem with its drainage system - quite unpleasant smells in the corridors. Ending on a positive note, breakfast was very good. In all, the Westin Grand promises much but fails in its delivery.

<Content>Very happy with our stay The location is absolutely ideal for a tourist trip to Berlin. So much is within walking distance, and that which is not is easily reached by transit. There are restaurants nearby, and plently of shopping. The hotel is a great building. We too, noticed the sound of the piano player in the evening, but this isn't the worst sound to have wafting into your room! Although I would think they could stop it a little earlier in the evening. Our room was very nicly furnished and clean with a large bathroom.Our rate inclued and extensive buffet breakfast - VERY nice, with an omlette bar and wide variety of hot and cold foods. I beleive they charge 24Euros for it if it is not included. I wouldn't pay that, but try to get a rate that includes breakfast!

<Content>Mixed bag This is a great location for Mitte facilities such as Staatsoper, Museum Island and the Friedrichstrasse shops. u6 Franzoezischestrasse is right outside. I thought my room was not very large for what I paid, but it was quiet. If I had a room near the lobby, like others I would not have liked the noise. I did not notice any smells that others have noticed. Breakfast was a problem. AT about 9AM there was no space in the small restaurant (really is too small for breakfast in an hotel that size) and had to have breakfast on some large tables out in the atrium, and had to share a table that could have seated 12. Table service was very poor. President of Azerbaijan came to stay, which meant that the lobby was full of bodyguards and lots of police outside for a couple of days. The arrangement of rooms around this central atrium is very odd and could make for a very noisy stay. I have got to say I prefer the Grand Hyatt or Marriott to this hotel, overall.

<Content>Nice lobby, noisy rooms If you enter the Westin, you will not be disappointed. The fantastic lobby is plainly the gem of this hotel...unfortunately, the architecture was the only thing that made the stay at this otherwise excellent hotel worse than anticipated. There was a piano player in the lobby and as all rooms are open to it, even shutting the second door in the room which apparently was wisely placed there did not help shutting the music (noise) out completely. Therefore, I would not recommend the hotel for travellers looking for quiet stays. The rest was above standard and nice, the food at the lobby was perfect, service very nice.

<Content>Luxurious, superb location, extremely comfortable I stayed in the Westin Grand Berlin in June of this year (2005). Looking at the Starwood site, I thought that it would be an average hotel. (Starwood's pictures did not quite look like the room I was given and it was a Category 3. For those familiar with Starwood and its points -- I felt like it very well deserved a Category 4 or even 5 rating! I have stayed at other Starwood hotels that were Cat. 4 and I honestly preferred the Westin Grand Berlin.) Well, when I checked into the hotel and also my hotel room, I was very impressed. My room was absolutely gorgeous. It overlooked the famous Brandenburg Gate, and I could just open one of the three window panels and stick my head out and admire the Berlin scenery! The room was extremely spacious, with a separate walk in area. The bathroom had a separate area for the toilet, with a luxurious-looking sink area. The bed was extremely comfortable. The location is superb - close to one of the main S-bahn stations (Friedrichstrasse) and very close to a U-bahn station. It is about ten minutes walking from Brandenburg Gate, 15 or so to Potsdamer Platz. I also managed to walk to Alexanderplatz (much farther) and the famous Fernsehturm. I loved how central it was!The only complaint that I had was that I would place the card that denotes that you'd like a change of bedding on the bed (like instructed), and they did NOT change the sheets. I was very confused about that. In addition, just FYI, I felt very underdressed at the hotel. Everyone would wear business professional clothing, while I did not. Also, (perhaps because I was underdressed) sometimes, service would be snooty, while other times, I received high-quality service. Overall, however, I enjoyed my stay at the Westin Grand and would stay again -- but the next time, I would dress business professional!

<Content>A Starwood Jewel I also read some negative reviews here on Tripadvisor and did not know what to expect. I am a Starwood Platinum member but was staying 2 nights on starpoints. I would have considered Priceline but the hotel was booked during the time we were there (Sept. 2 - 4). I have heard that Priceline reservations are often treated like 2nd class citizens but it is nice to read here on Tripadvisor that many have been treated well by the Westin Grand Berlin. I doubt that I would have been upgraded on a Priceline stay but the price definitely seems excellent.I had an early flight in so arrived at the hotel around 10am and asked if my room might be ready. I knew the hotel was sold out so I was not surprised that it was not. The front desk attendant, Kristin Lucking was very friendly and simply told me that the room was not ready but they had reserved a junior suite for me. We sat in the lovely lobby to relax a bit before heading out.The hotel is located within many of Berlin's top sites so we checked in our luggage and walked towards Checkpoint Charlie, headed towards the Potsdamer Platz - Sony Center then up to the Reichstag Dome, past the Brandenburg Gate onto Unter Den Linden back towards the Westin. This was a lovely morning and by the time we were done, it was about 2 pm and the room was ready. For those that like to shop, there are many shops near the hotel including Galeries Lafayette (the French department store) and other high end shops. The junior suite had a nice sitting area with a sofa and armchair with a view facing the inner courtyard. The room seemed newly renovated to me and was lovely. There was an wide arched wall separating the sitting area and bedroom. Although the bed was very comfortable, it did not seem to be the heavenly bed that I am use to here in the States. The bathroom was spacious and had a deep sunken tub.It was nice to listen to the pianist in the evening when we went out for dinner although we didn't have a chance to site in the lobby for drinks. The pool/hot tub facility was relaxing and the tiny tiles definitely gave it a spa like feel with several people simply relaxing in their robes on the lounge chairs, reading. It was not crowded at all during the time I was there. The concierges were friendly and extremely helpful with directions and restaurant recommendations. Overall, this was an extremely pleasant stay and a jewel in the Starwood Hotel collection.

<Content>I need not have worried! After booking a four night stay at this hotel, i happened upon this website and decided to read the relevant reviews. They seemed to be very mixed so i did have some concerns.I had booked with Expedia and had a seemingly great deal in a top hotel.I need not have worried. From the minute of arrival to departure the staff were fantastic, could not have been more helpful and courteous. Our room was large, airy, spotlessly clean and all in perfect working order.The breakfast, which was included in our stay, was fabulous, in fact the best hotel breakfast i have experienced. The spa/pool were excellent too.This hotel deserves the Grand in its name. Location wise, perfect. It could not be more central to Berlin's main attractions, with a tube station 20 metres away.

<Content>A fabulous stay at the Westin Berlin We had an wonderful 2 night stay at the Westin Berlin. We were upgraded to a suite and our kids room were upgraded to a deluxe (Starwood Preferred Gold). The hotel lobby was nice and the location of the hotel is ideal. The pool area was really nice as well as the locker room and spa. The hotel does need to improve the fitness center; it really lacks in comparison to the pool/spa with very little equipment stuck into a windowless aerobics room.We didn't have a lot of interaction with the hotel staff, but when we did they were friendly.Overall, we had a great stay at the Westin Berlin and would stay there again.

<Content>Is this the same hotel??? that has the bad stinky rooms? Not ours. The location was great, the lobby was great, and the room was great. NIce bed, lovely linens, a spotless bathroom with no bad smell! And the pool and spa area was one of the nicest I've seen! Sorry to the the people who got bad rooms - ours was close to the center and must have been renovated. I'm almost embarrased to admit that I paid 75$ on priceline, and I would have paid double for the room. I'd gladly stay there again. Jay Gitter Bloomfield New Jersey

<Content>Fabulous luxury, location and service Stayed 3 days at The Westin Grand and was overwhelmed by its perfection. Whereas some luxury hotels can be cold and a bit forbidding, I found the Westin Grand very warm, welcoming and comfortable. The public rooms and the bedrooms are decorated in excellent taste and give a feeling of spaciousness and relaxation. The staff are unfailingly pleasant and helpful; the restaurants are excellent and the breakfast buffet is bountiful and served in superb surroundings; the swimming pool and spa are quiet, roomy and pristine - not filled with club members as at many hotels. The location is perfect - just down the street from the Brandenburg Gate, Reichstag and Bundestag, the Museum Island, shopping malls and high fashion shops; the U-bahn number 6 to Franzoesischestrasse stops outside the door, the express bus TXL from Tegel Airport stops on the next corner (Unter den Linden and Friederichstrasse), and there are always taxis waiting outside the door as well. This is one of the great hotels of Europe, not just Berlin! Taking into account the breakfast buffet and unlimited use of the pool, sauna and fitness room included in the rate, this hotel was much better value than many 3- and 4-star hotels on offer.

<Content>Great location, no air conditioning, combative staff The Westin Grand in Berlin spoiled our trip to Berlin. I am a Starwood Gold member and advocate of Starwood Hotels. Our recent stay at the Westin Grand in Berlin ruined our trip to Berlin. We arrived on July 12th and used points plus 1 night accommodations through Expedia. Berlin was our first stop of a 2 plus week journey in Europe from San Francisco 鈥?not a short distance!After I made our reservations, I went onto Trip Advisor just to see what others wrote about the Westin. I became very concerned about the rooms etc. after what I read from other travellers and contacted the reservations manager in advance to ensure that we received a nice renovated room plus combined the 2 reservations into 1 so we would not have to move rooms. I also advised the manager that I was doing something special for my other half so that as this was the first time to Berlin and dealing with jet lag, I wanted a typical Westin carefree stay.When we arrived on the 12th, we did receive a very nice renovated room but when we entered the room, we told the bell man that they room seemed very warm with little or no air. He assured us that it was because we were western facing, it was late in the afternoon and Berlin was experiencing a little bit of a heat wave. We showered and left and came back at midnight to the same unbearable temperature. So, we opened the windows hoping for relief and figured we would deal with mosquitos or flies to get some sleep and tackle the jet lag. At 6 a.m., we realized that our room was over the loading dock and trash alley as large trucks and noise woke us up and kept us up. In the a.m., we called the desk as we went out and informed them of the situation and they told us they would send an engineer to the room and provide a fan. They had not heard of any other problems.When we came back the room in the afternoon, we encountered the same heat, absent fan and no additional information or note regarding our situation. We called down to the front desk again, went through the whole situation and they then sent up a fan. Each person we spoke with had no idea there was problem with the air conditioning and each person acted as if this was a new isolated problem. As we came home that night, the fan broke and we still had no air-conditioning. We could not sleep the whole night because it was so hot and we didn鈥檛 want to open the windows because of the noise. This is not the best way to get over jet-lag! The next day after countless interactions with the front desk and Starwood One-Touch plus finally demanding to be moved, the front desk told us that the air-conditioning in the hotel was broke, 4 coolers were down and it was being fixed or it was fixed. But how come the public areas and hallways still had air-conditioning, no response was ever offered to this. This went on for 24 hours, each employee we spoke to have either surprise at our story and dealt with it nonchalantly and only after we became insistent would they offer up more lies or become combative. Finally, we involved the Front Desk Manager who only told us it was fixed, sent up 2 fruit baskets but the reality was, it was never fixed. As we left the hotel the next day, the bell man asked how our stay was and we told him about the problem and he acted so surprised, no air conditioning 鈥?how could that be, I will tell the management. If the air-conditioning was bore, how could he not know this?As we reflected on this, it was the worst case of customer service I have ever experienced. If the air conditioning was broke, every customer facing employee should know that and be prepared how to help the guest. By each employee acting as if this was the first time they heard of this problem and then only after tempers flared did they tell you things were broke or not working, made us realize that we were being lied to the entire stay and this took so much out of us plus the lack of sleep, heat and jet lag, I think you can see how our trip was ruined. You should really take the Westin name off of the hotel and call it the CCCP Grand because we tasted the old East Germany at this Starwood.

<Content>Starwood's White Elephant The best thing about the Westin, as everybody has already stated, is the location. But, this is not the only hotel in the area - The Hilton is just a few blocks away as are a few others that are in the 5 star range.The big problem for me was the fact that the rooms have an ever present sewer smell that hits you as soon as you walk in the room. I was prepared for this as many of the reviewers have mentioned it, but still, it is unacceptable. I was staying here with my Starwood Points, so the room and breakfast were included in the award, but my points are valuable and I felt like I wasted them on this hotel.A curious thing for me was, when I walked outside the hotel, every so often, from Friedrichstrasse to the Brandenburg Gate, that same awful smell would drift by. My take on it is that the sewer system put in by the GDR needs to be replaced. Bottom line: pick another hotel, the Starwood Group has a white elephant on their hands with this smelly grand hotel.

<Content>Great Location Just spend 2 days at the Westin Grand. It was fabulous. Had an upgrade with our room. The pool/jacuzzi in the basement was a haven after walking around the city. Breakfast was quite pricey but the food was excellent even having Bucks Fizz included. The staff were very friendly and polite. The hotel is a 5 mins walk from Friedrickstasse on the S9 line from Schonefeld. Plenty to do and see within walking distance.

<Content>OK Hotel, Fabulous Location Got this hotel on Priceline, and was pleased at the great location. Perfect for our short stay in Berlin - close to all major toursit sites and easy access for public transportation. We also had a lovely bay window overlooking Under den Linden. However, the room itself had a bad odor that seemed like it was coming from the drain in the bathroom. the staff was friendly and accomodating even though we were Priceline customers. I wold stay there again, due to the location and Priceline availability.

<Content>Good hotel in the best location for tourism visit The hotel is not comparable to the Adlon, however rooms are nice, clean, the personnel is friendly and the location is the best. Right in the middle of Berlin, walking distance from all major sights, we found this place the perfect hotel to stay for two nights to get to know Berlin. Great rates are offerd by www.hrs.com, the breakfast is often included in the room price and the breakfast buffet is really good. If you are not expecting the exceptional, but rather the good 5-star-experience, we can strongly recommend the place!

<Content>Terrible rooms - stay away I stayed at the Westin Berlin 3 or 4 times. This time I stayed for two nights and they gave me a room upgrade to a renovated room. Renovated? Yes, they call it renovated. The renovated rooms are located to the courtyard and have the same size like the normal rooms. Bad smell, ugly furniture, bad design, old fahioned, dirty, noisy a/c and not really a heavenly bed I guess. Forget about the rooms in this hotel!Still, the location is the best and the lobby is very pritty and impressive. But the rest of the hotel, forget about it. Also the food at Friedrichs is boring and very traditional. If you have the chance, go for the brand new Radisson, Hyatt, Marriott or Adlon.

<Content>A Five Star Experience! As a Starwood Preferred Guest, I was a bit concerned when I read some of the negative reviews of the Westin Grand Berlin. Going on the general reputation of Westin, I chose to stay there anyway. I did, however, write the Guest Relations Manager in advance stating my concerns. From the moment I arrived, I couldn't have been more satisfied. I felt as if I were treated like royalty right from the start. Our room was newly renovated and extremely comfortable. The hotel services couldn't have been better. The staff was responsive and efficient. The amenities at the hotel are five star - in fact, I think this hotel should be rated as a five star hotel. It far exceeded other Five Star hotels I stayed at in Europe. I highly recommend the Westin Grand Berlin. The location couldn't be better. There is a piano bar in the lobby that is so peaceful and relaxing - perfect after a day of sightseeing. Also impressive is the workout room and swimming pool/spa. Be sure to bring a bathing suit to take advantage of this wonderful luxury. I highly recommend this hotel!

<Content>Fantastic This hotel was amazing. I didn't have one problem with this hotel, but if I did I know that the staff were there to assist. The restaurant food and service was outstanding, our rooms were charming, and the location was superb. The atrium was very special indeed and we loved the bar area at the bottom. It was wonderful in the afternoon, we would come in from the cold and take a seat where someone would serve us the best hot chocolate ever and we would choose a cake from the cake servery. We could sit their watching the world go by all day. We would definately go back.

<Content>Excellent hotel and location....but I stayed at the Westin November 2004 and really liked the hotel and location. We were in the old unrennovated section that overlooked Unter der Linden. We had about a block walk, seriously, from the lobby to our room through many corridors. The room was old, but had a very German feel with down comforters, white tiled bath. Both bath and room were generous in size and very clean and maintained. I asked to see one of the renovated rooms and it was of course much nicer, better bedding, etc. I was told all of the rooms were undergoing rennovation.Staff was very friendly and helpful. I would stay here again, but if you are in the old section do not pay full price.

<Content>Worst rooms ever! I stayed at the Grand Westin Berlin for four days. The location is great but the rooms are the most horrible experience I ever had. Small, ugly bathrooms, bad smell, never renovated and noisy. Even the a/c did not work. Avoid this hotel, I would never, never stay there anymore. The lobby is nice but as soon you enter your room, you just want to leave this hotel!!! I payed my room in advance, so I had to stay there... but I never will go back!!!!

<Content>Terrible Rooms - Great Breakfast Stayed at the hotel over Easter 2005. This hotel is in two parts the new and the old. The new is 4 star and the old is 2 star. When we arrived we were impressed by the lobby and the friendly staff. When we were shown to our room we were given a twin bedded room in the old part of the hotel. We had booked a double bed. We were moved to a slightly better double room (two beds purshed together) but still in the old part of the hotel. The rooms in the old part are described as Classic. Avoid these rooms - it is very clear why they do not have a photograph of them on their web site. The rooms are shabby, the air conditioing did not work (left the balcony door wide open all night in March!), soft furnishings grubby, smelt unpleasant, the toilet broke (still not offered a change of room).The only positive things to say about the hotel is that it is in a very good location, the breakfast is excellent, friendly staff and lovely lobby with pianist. Even with these benefits I would not recommend staying in this hotel. I do not know what the quality of the rooms are like in the new part of the hotel.I would certainly never stay in this hotel again.

<Content>Breakfast Heaven My partner and I stayed at this hotel durung easter 2005 for 5 nights. The main lobby and grand staircase is like a palace and the staff were fabulously helpful. Initially we were allocated a room off the main atrium, but upon arriving there was a horrid sewerage smell. We asked to be moved and this happened instantly and our new room was in an older part of the hotel overlooking the Unter Den Linden. The room was spotlessly tidy and clean and we were very pleased.There was a lack of info of how to use the pool facilities but once we got the hang of it they were superb and we used them everyday. The hotel was very quiet and peaceful and you could not hear your neighbours at all, the beds were comfy and the room was warm.The most enjoyable part of our stay was the superb breakfast buffet available. Everything you could want and more was available and it was all beautiful, I found myself having 5 or 6 courses for breakfast and the staff were so pleasent and friendly.The location was ideal right near U Bahn and S Bahn stops but actually we mostly walked our way around this very interesting city.

<Content>Perfect location but not rooms I have just returned from 5 days at the Westin. Perfect location booking in no problem but I was shown to one of the annex rooms. It was small damp  there had been a water leak from the roof at some time. I complained  was moved into a much better room in the main part of the hotel. Breakfast first class a very good pool, sauna,  hot tub. The staff were very helpfull. I didnt find the bed comfortable  the pillows were much too soft.In conclusion I did an internet deal at 拢100 a night for 2 with breakfast, which was reasonable after I was moved to a decent room. Its not a 5 star hotel. Would I stop there again possibly if the deal was right.

<Content>haunting 3* experience The hotel was said to be fully booked the day we checked in. We had requested a queen bed when we made our reservation, but were given twin beds in a 3* dorm-like room (I believe that's the old wing of the hotel). And the toilet was very depressing and got stains on it. we called the frontdesk for a change, but staff hasn't been very helpful. at last we got into a standard room, which is definitely not 5*. Anyhow, breakfast buffet was quite nice, and the location is ideal. but i would not come back again, not value for money!

<Content>Truly First Class We stayed three nights in The Grand Westin Berlin from the 2nd through the 5th of january 2005. We were impressed with the lobby and it's majestical stairways (were some scenes from The Bourne Supremacy with Matt Damon were shot). Our room was very comfortable although there was no heavenly bed, nor heavenly bath.Nevertheless we slept like angels.The only minor remarks are in the food and beverage dept.. On our first night we had dinner in their restaurant Friedrichs which serves an average cuisine. Please let them remodel this place to a restaurant worth being in a Westin hotel and start with the lightning which is terrible. It looked like all the food appearing on our table was grey.Why don't they open their Coelln restaurant , were a fabulous breakfast buffet is served every morning, as main restaurant for lunch and dinner?Second night we went to the Stammhaus, which looks very nice on their website and brochures, but once you enter, it is an ordinary caf茅 with no no smoking area.But don't let this put you off from a stay at the Westin Berlin, because with the exception from the above experiences in their FB dept., I recommend this hotel to everybody who wants to stay in a first class hotel ,in a first class location (next to the Galleries Lafayette) with a dedicated, friendly and well trained staff.

<Content>Very Solid Perfect location in the very center of east berlin, minutes from shopping, restaurants, and attractions, and a subway station right across the street. Rooms are small by US standards, but very nicely fitted (at least the newly renovated deluxe rooms, which are the only rooms with the heavenly beds). Service was overall excellent, though the concierge staff was unimpressive. Fabulous breakfast with sparkling wine and an incredible selection of european cheeses.

<Content>A sophisticated establishment. The Westin Grand, Berlin is a sophisticated establishment. This hotel was booked by ourselves as part of a honeymoon. The rates were very reasonable, despite being a 5 star hotel. The main entrance, and reception area are beautiful with a piano player there at all times. The reception staff and concierge were excellant. The grand staircase phenomenal. The standard rooms were clean, tidy and bathroom large and modern. Room service pricey. Complimentary breakfast 10/10. A very big breakfast hall, with beautiful chandeliers and ornate tables and chairs, attentive staff and every type of breakfast and drinks you could ever imagine. The spa and pool facilities are lovely, and the salon also. Position wise you cant get any better. Situated on the main tourist area, the unter den linden, with the brandenberg gate a few yards away, and checkpoint charlie and tv tower etc. The train station to the main airports in just off unter den linden. This is the place to stay if you are in Berlin. My husband and I are hugely critical of hotels on the whole, but we cant criticise this only praise it.

<Content>Rooms are not up to 5* I stayed in the Westin in early December 2005 and although the common areas are very nice, the location is perfect for tourists, I found the rooms to be nothing like a 5* property. I had a booking for a double room, but was initially given a single room. The next room offered did have a double bed, but the furniture had clearly seen better days.If you get a good rate, it is OK, but do not pay full price for what it is.

<Content>Amazing and wonderful! This is one of the nicest hotels we've ever stayed at in Europe. The customer service was outstanding - everyone spoke English. The rooms and bathrooms are tastefully decorated, spacious, and have nice ammenities. The spa area is phenomenal!! Gorgeous pool, whirlpool, saunas and a whole range of body care options - massages, facials, etc. The whirlpool was not hot enough. The lobby is stunning - great bar, and wonderful piano playing every evening! They do NOT have the Heavenly Beds that you would expect from a Westin in the States. The location is the most centrally located hotel you could hope to be at in the city. Walking to everywhere. Overall - absolutely excellent! We wouldn't stay anywhere else!

<Content>Enjoyed my stay..... I had a very pleasant 5-night stay at the Westin Grand earlier this month. The atrium was beautiful and, well, grand. I did not notice the musty smell that the other reviews mentioned. It's definitely a nice 4-star hotel in a great area. Within walking distance to Checkpoint Charlie, Brandenburg Gate, Reichstag, etc. We were in a guest-office room and it was spacious and soundproofed. The staff was very pleasant and attentive. The breakfast buffet was the best I've seen - many choices. My only complaint was the bed. Although the front desk and housekeeping assured me I had a Heavenly Bed, I am positive that I did not. It was not as comfortable as I had hoped. The photo on the Westin Grand website shows the bed has a feather mattress topper and mine did not. Otherwise my stay was very nice. I would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Enjoyable Stay My husband and I stayed for a romantic break over St Valentines weekend this year. Booked a good deal with expedia over the internet. Because we had booked a cheap(ish) package I was not surprised to be allocated a room in the somewhat less salubrious extention at the back of the hotel. I did object however to the single beds in the room! A swift phone call to reception however and we were soon moved to a room with a lovely big double bed-however still in the same part of the hotel!The one major complaint I did have was the closure of the only bar in the hotel on the Sat. night for a private St Valentines dinner and dance. We had planned to have something to eat and a few drinks before going out for the evening. There had been no prior warning that the bar would be closed to all, including residents. If there had been, we would have planned our weekend differently. When I asked about this, their only solution was that we eat in their restaurant, which we had done on the Fri night and did not want to do again. Not quite what I expected from a 5* hotel.We also discovered on our last morning there that there is a far larger choice at breakfast if you are lucky enough to get a table in the breakfast room. On the previous 3 mornings we sat outside the breakfast room and did not think to check if there was a larger selection inside.The hotel is well situated for exploring and the staff were always polite.All in all we did enjoy our break in this hotel, but the little things did somewhat let them down, and as said previously not quite what I associate with 5*. It is however a very good 4* We do plan on returning to Berlin but would probably stay elsewhere.

<Content>Ordinary I stayed here with my girlfriend for 3 nights in August and was distinctly unimpressed. Don't get me wrong: the Grand is not a bad hotel - it's just not up to the usual Westin standard and is certainly not a 5 star. If you're looking for a good 3 or 4 star hotel and can get a good price then go for it. The issues and problems that we had were:- The breakfast room is too small for the number of guests in the hotel and there was no-one to show you to a table. Consequently, every morning resulted in a fight for a table (including a gamble as to whether you'd end up in the smoking section), a wait for it to be cleared and then a huge crowd / queue at the buffet. (At checkout, when I mentioned this, the assistant said that it was a common complaint).- The atrium is lovely and huge but there's a bar at the bottom of it. This means that whenever you go to/from your room, and all rooms are accessed via the atrium, there's a musty smell of smoke in the air (which is worse in the evenings).- No ironing boards are in the rooms: you have to ring for them. I did this and a bell hop turned up to collect my bags. I explained the mistake but no board turned up. Two calls (and about two hours) later and a board turned up. Unbelievably, when it arrives you have to sign a piece of paper for something like a 100 Euro deposit!- The rooms seem tired - even the renovated ones. We had a very dull, plasticy, hospital-like white bathroom which I certainly wouldn't describe as 5 star. We had the Heavenly bed but no Heavenly shower.I don't want to sound like a moaner... the good bits are:- The Heavenly bed (if you get a room with one). This is fantastic!- The location. Great for exploring Berlin by foot or easy access to the U-Bahn.- Er.. that's it.

<Content>Excellent hotel in pefect location My wife and I spent 3 nights at the hotel in October 2004. We were able to obtain a great deal via the internet giving room and breakfast for about 拢80 per night, c50% of the normal rate. We expected or feared that the staff may be very cold and formal but it was far from the case, they were, without exception, very professional but also warm and welcoming. Nothing was too much trouble to them. The buffet breakfast, including a chef preparing individual egg dishes, would certainly rate amongst the best I have had anywhere in the world. Our room overlooked Unter den Linden, an ideal central location and convenient for the U and S Bahn. If you can obtain a good deal on the hotel or if money is no object I couldn't recommend this hotel too highly.

<Content>Heavenly Beds We chose the Westin Grand because of its location at Unter den Linden / Friedrichstrasse, because of its history as the hotel constructed for the 750 years Berlin jubilee by former GDR government and... because of experiencing the heavenly bed. Our rate was 136 Euros, breakfast included. The welcome was perfect, the luggage was taken care of and I could leave the car for half an hour to accomodate ourselves before leaving it at the rental car office. We were upgraded to a Westin Guest Office, that proved to be a spacious room. The bathroom was good and made up in an old fashioned way. Looking at the 'heavenly bed' we found a hole in the linen (it was torn). The very friendly house-keeping changed it when we asked for it. The matress was ok, but the pillows nothing spectacular at all. Compared to the sleeping experience at the Hilton Berlin, this bed was good average, but no heavenly average. Breakfast was very good, though they ran short of fresh fruits both mornings. The breakfast lady seemed to have problems with foreigners when they do not match the caucasian white cluster (as we watched the first morning). This hotel reminds a little bit of the former GDR at its best, which is can be a plus. It has a good service, a great and convenient location, but it did not give as the ultimate experience as I would have expected.

<Content>Drainage This is a goodish hotel. Very good location and fairly grand. The underground pool/sauna and spa are excellent. The staff are friendly. However, there is a bit of an issue with the drainage system in East Berlin and some of the rooms have a whiff of drains. During our stay, several of our party suffered brown water flowing from the taps and water escaping under the bath. This may be due to the renovation work.Top tip - don't use the 'phone in the room, particulalry for e-mail downloads. Ouch!

<Content>Not completely "Heavenly" Not a 5-star, but a good hotel. For starters, be warned that not all the beds are Heavenly Beds, as per the Westin trademark. My bed was proof of that. My Starwood Gold status got me upgraded to an office suite, but the bed was not the Heavenly Bed I slept in last year at the Westin Excelsior in Florence, a FAR better property. I know the Grand doesn't pretend to be the Excelsior, so that is perhaps an unfair comparison. Let me say some nice things -- magnificent lobby, great live pianist, VERY warm and accomodating staff. EXCELLENT location -- central, with both U-bahn and S-bahn stations in quick walking distance. Many wonderful cafes, stores and restaurants in immediate walking distance...On the distaff side, the minibar is wildly overpriced, the room a wee bit musty, the internet computer in the lobby guest office is ridiculously expensive. Details, yes, but these would be the details that make a 4-star hotel into a 5-star, which brings us back to where I started...I do have to say that Berlin overall was a VERY pleasant surprise. What a terrific city...great people, great food, great sights, fun day and night, so much to see and do. I never envisioned falling in love with Berlin, but I did, and I shall return...

<Content>Great stay at the Westin Grand Just returned from a Great 3 night stay at the Westin on a fantastic priceline deal . I would agree with earlier reviews that this hotel doesn't quite make the 5 star status it claims but is a very good 4 star property . The hotel is located in the former East Berlin and is well placed for most of the sights . Getting around is easy thanks to the U -Bahn station practically on the doorstep.The public areas are very grand especially the lobby with its huge atrium ,sweeping staircase and piano player. Couldn't notice any strange smells in the lifts as mentioned by a previous poster. Bedroom was standard size and decorated in classic style .The room did show some signs of wear ( nothing major though)but a refurbishment programme is in progress (we had a note apologising for any noise heard though we did not hear any). The beds were as promised Heavenly with a pillow that could be moulded to suit any height preference. The bathroom whilst adequate was a rather basic white tiled room which didn't quite match the granduer of the bedroom and public areas.Everything worked well though and there was a good selection of bathroom products. Staff were at all times exceptionally courteous and polite. Breakfast was not included and at 鈧?3 overpriced as was the bottle of water strategically placed in the room at 鈧?.50.All in all I have no real complaints about the hotel and would have no problems in recommending it .If you are lucky enough to be awarded the hotel through priceline it really is a fantastic bargain.

<Content>Nice, but not 5 Star We have recently had a wonderful weekend in Berlin and found an exceptional price through Expedia. We stayed at the Westin Grand hotel on Friedrichstrasse (?). This was a nice hotel, but not what I would have expected from a 5 Star. The rooms are your typical chain variety (OK theyve got good wall paper) but the one we stayed in was rather 'tired'. This included the lack of toilet rolls, cracked tiles in the bathroom, slow replacement of the bath products and a 'whining' TV (this is written at the time of the olympics - so it would have been nice to relax whilst watching some of the sports!)In general the hotel needs smartening up. The sofa's in the lobby have threadbear arms, the carpet is tired throughout the hotel and there is a perculiar 'musty' smell in the lifts and other areas. Keep your eyes up, hold your breath and you'll be fine.We also had a problem on the first night where they could not provide us with an iron. Although the hotel has a number of irons they were already leant to other people staying, and to quote: -because we are a 5 star hotel we will not ask for them back until the guest leaves. This is not impressive after a 7 hour door to door journey!Otherwise as others have mentioned, the beds are superb. Possibly the best we have stayed in on vacation.The location of the hotel is great and your near to all the central 'sights'The staff were superb and extremely courteous and were most Germans we met on our trip. A truely wonderful location that has seen some hard times in the past 100 years.Hotel, I'd give it a good 4 star. For a true five star in Berlin I would suggest the Adlon (if you have the cash!).

<Content>super stay, super staff, super location We stayed for a relaxing weekend in Berlin and booked a room in the Westin Grand. What a hotel!!!! A nice and charming lobby, very helpful and polite staff whereever you go. The room was a more than well appointed junior suite with very large bathroom, perfect cleaned and everything in very good condition. Perfect service were ever expect it, from turndown to morning newspaper to valet parking. Excellent value for money and we will come back.

<Content>Heavenly Beds We just came back from from a week in Germany and stayed 4 nights at the WEstin. I must say that the beds at the Westin are absolutely the most comfortable beds in any hotel in the world. Also, the pool facility is extremely pleasant and attractive. It includes a hot tub and sauna at no extra charge (as opposed to the Berlin hilton which charges 11Euro to use their sauna and the pool area is not nearly as attractive.)The only negative about the Westin is the high cost of the buffet breakfast, which was not included in our special Internet rate. There are very few restaurants in the vicinity of the Westin that serve a decent reasonable breakfast. So one morning we ate at their Buffet. The cost was 46 Euro (or approximately $60 for two people. Definitely overpriced. Try to get a rate that includes breakfast.

<Content>Great Location Myself and my wife recently stayed here for a four night break in March 2004. Unfortunately the break didn't get of to the best of starts as when we turned up at the Westin at around 9pm we were told that our prepaid room was not available as German legislation stated that anyone wishing to stay for extra nights at a hotel that they didn't pre-book must be allowed to keep thier room, so therefore there was no room for us on this busy Saturday night. As you can probably imagine I was not too happy about this, however the hotel did get us a room at a 4 star hotel about 300 metres away called the Jolly Hotel Vivaldi (This hotel was great, but the brekfast wasn't as good as the Westin's. The rooms however were in my opinion much better!). The Westin also payed for us to get to the other hotel as you would imagine, and they also picked us up the next day in their limo to return us to the Westin where they upgraded our room as a small gesture of compensation. The stay at the Westin was trouble free after this and the brekfast buffet was the best I've seen anywhere in the world. The hotels location is great and close to all attractions. After having seen the area around Zoo Station in the old West Berlin I was really happy that I had chosen to stay in the East where to me it felt a lot safer. The hotel is next to a U bahn station which is handy if you want to go to West Berlin. Also the hotel is around 100 metres away from a TXL airport bus stop which takes you to Berlin Tegel airport for 2.20 Euro's (Dont bother wasting your money on a taxi as the bus service runs like clockwork). The Westin has a touch a class about it, and its foyer is beautiful. The staff are also very friendly. I would definately stay at this hotel again, although I would try to arrive at the hotel as early as possible when staying on a weekend just in case they allocate your room to someone who wants to extend your stay. Also dont be concerned if you are young travellers- Myself and my wife are only 27 and you get a couple of funny looks from the older people who tend to frequent the Westin ( I think they are probably wondering how you can afford to stay in a Westin). Great Hotel- to be recommended along with the Jolly Hotel Vivaldi

<Content>wonderfully comfortable We stayed for three nights April 2004. The room was very spacious and comfortable in every way. Enormous choice at the huge buffet breakfast and the best pool/ sauna/ health club we had ever used. Near all the sights-- if a little qiet at night but all in all a luxurious place to stayin a great location.
