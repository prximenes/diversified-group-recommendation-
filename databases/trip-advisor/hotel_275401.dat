<Content>hi Bastion Hotel Amstel offers great breakfast, wireless internet connection, and clean environment.Though not really close to central areas, if you don't mind a little walk to and from the metro station everyday, it's stiil a pretty nice option. The only not-so-pleasent thing was that our air conditioner broke down a day after our arrival, and we asked the crew to have it examed and fixed the following day. They did come to our room and try sticking the key a little farther into the slot to make sure that the electricity supply was on. But later he said that he would have to consult this with his colleague, and went away. As you may have already know, he never came back, and the air conditioner was never fixed during our stay there, even though we went to the counter everyday to complain about this matter.And other problems my friends were having such as out-of-use phones or blocked up sink were not repaired, either.Fortunately, the weather is cool so we don't really need the room air-coned. Well, maybe that's also why they don't think it's necessary to fix it.

<Content>Pricey, upscale hostel This hotel gave us a place to leave our luggage, shower (sort of), and sleep overnight while we explored the city for 2 days, but not much more than that. The positives of this hotel are that 1) the room had adequate space to accomodate 3 adults and a baby, with a sofa bed and two twin beds that were easily pushed together; 2) it is about a 7 minute walk to the Overamstel metro station (the stop is only 10 minutes to Centraal Station); 3) parking at the hotel is free; and 4) free wireless Internet access if you have your own laptop. The negatives are 1) the broken showerhead that leaked and sprayed water all over the bathroom floor, but not so much in the tub; 2) the dirty towels from the previous guest(s) that were left on the bathroom floor (which we informed the reception desk about on our way out to sightsee and still found when we got back 7 hours later); 3) the disgusting, visibly stained bed covers and carpeting; and 4) the lack of soundproofing which made every passing train from the tracks across the street and car on the nearby highway audible. The gas station, which is literally at the hotel's front doorstep, is convenient, but adds nothing to the hotel's external aesthetic. The security measures (key card access to rooms, elevators, garage, and the front door after dark) were appropriate given the hotel's location, which is outside the main downtown area and somewhat industrial.

<Content>Try to avoid this hotel I stayed in this hotel 2 nights to attend a meeting in Amsterdam Zuid-Oost area. This hotel was a affordable option with parking possibilities.Parking space is indeed available, but this is about the best the hotel has to offer. Hotel rooms are small, and although clean, it doesn't look that way, not given you the comfort you need. The whole hotel 'feels' a bit dirty.It is located nearby a business park in the surroundings of Amsterdam. The metro station is a good 15 minute walk away and a walk you'd like to do alone in the evening. I didn't feel very safe and I am scared easily. Please, if you have the choice, avoid this hotel. Try for another hotel (maybe not in Amsterdam to have comparable prices).

<Content>horrible experince We arrived in this hotel in the afternoon of the 23th august 2007 .First thing we observed was that the hotel had three stars and not four stars ( as we knew from the website page ) .The rooms are very small without hairdryer, air conditioning, balcony and the windows don't open .The hotel is situated too far from the city center and you must walk to the train 15 - 20 minutes or call a cab which is not very cheap .The stuff is not very frendly and they don't have any city maps .And after all , next morning when we had breakfast with our friends in the hotel restaurant my wife's bag was stolen from her chair .Neither the stuff or the police man ( because we took a cab to the police station ) seemed to be concerned in our problem more the stuff from the hotel was very iritated and shouted at us .As a matter of fact in the bag we had passports, 1200 euro cash, credit cards and the keys of our car .In the end be carefull and better stay away from this hotel .

<Content>Hotel or dormitory? This hotel was not the cheapest, but a bit less expensive compared to the hotels located in the center of the city. This hotel is quite far from the Centrum (1 km to the Metro station, then a dozen of stations to the Centraal Station, where you can reach the place you want by tram or another metro).It's located in a zoning, so really not with the fun...Good point for people coming by car : the parking lot is free for customers.Inside, an unfriendly staff, they don't even give you a map, so you walk down the street not knowing where you are... The rooms are so gloomy: your window sight is the motorway or the railway, it's up to you...Towels were missing, furthermore they were stained, unstitched, quite scandalous for such an expensive hotel. I'm not accostumed to go to palaces, but when you pay as much, you're allowed to expect a clean room and clean items. We didn't have the (expensive) breakfast : 12 euros!!! In the room you have a kettle so you can have tea or coffee, but ours was dirty so we didn't use it. To sum up, this hotel may be suitable for business men or so, and maybe not for tourists or people on holidays. The good vibe was missing. I wouldn't recommend it for tourists : they'd better go to the Centrum.

<Content>Good Hotel for drivers This hotel was great for what we needed. It has a secure parking garage, is right off the A10 and is super easy to get to by automobile. The Metro stop (OverAmstel) is a 5 minute walk. You take a left out of the hotel and walk two blocks and there it is up the stairs. The only thing about having to take the Metro to your hotel is you have to be on the train by midnight. The cab from the RLD was 20 Euro, not too shabby. The room itself was adequate, clean, and spacious for two. The breakfast was included, and very tastey. The staff was very helpful and friendly. All in all, a good deal for the price. If you are driving to Amsterdam this is your hotel.

<Content>Good value for money There are few hotels in or near Amsterdam offering a 4 bedded room for 鈧?30 per night for a family. This had a twin and an adjacent (open door) sleeping room and was clean and comfy but no frills. The breakfast is pricey at 鈧?2 per person but compares to other hotels in town which are 鈧?0 pp. There are pleanty of cafes in town offering breakfast!Don't be put off by the walk to the train - if you are tired you can get a taxi for 鈧?0 or less.We also looked for a hotel with free parking which seemed safe which you need to do in this city.One side of the hotel rooms face the trains which can be noisy if you open the windows but didn't worry us.

<Content>Clean hotel if you are good in walking It is a nice and clean hotel in the suburbs of Amsterdam, very good if you are traveling by car.There is a gas station nearby and free parking.If you go by public transport, the hotel is quite a long hike away from the station.(about 20 minutes) There is no restaurant or supermarket in the vicinity of the hotel except the hotels own restaurant. If you are going to Amsterdam be sure to do it on Queensday, which is the 30.April.

<Content>Good, friendly hotel We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. After reading reviews we were a little worried, but we needn't have been. We found the hotel easy to find, about a 5-10 min walk from the metro. The staff were friendly and helpful. We had a problem with our safe and they sorted it out immediately. The room was a good size family room, which actually had 2 bedrooms. Although we overlooked the railway this wasn't a problem and our younger son loved watching the trains! Breakfast was superb and it was actually included as we had a BB package. Although we were the only family staying at that time, the staff were very good with our 2 sons. We found it quick and easy to get into the centre of Amsterdam, taking in all about 20mins. The metro is very reliable and frequent and we tried various routes, using both the metro and tram. The transport system is excellent, so don't be put off by the location of this hotel. We found the 72 hour travel pass, which we purchased on arrival at the airport (tourist information) very good value. We would stay at this hotel again if we returned to Amsterdam.

<Content>Well we had a great time!! Myself and 5 friends (all girls in our early 20's) have just arrived back from a 4 day stay at the Bastion Amstel, i have to say i think other reviews have not been a good guideline. Apart from the 5 minute walk to the metro centre the hotel wasn't too badly located. it wasn't in the city centre, but we found this an advantage as the hotel itself was quiet. We found the hotel rooms of a high standard and the staff very friendly and their hospitality was suberb. My friends and I would recommend that if you are visiting in a group its an ideal place to stay.

<Content>Choose somewhere else! Firstly I would like to say how badly located this hotel is. It costs about 28 euros on a good day to get to the city by cab from this place and akes 15 mins to get to a metro. The hotel did not have a kettle or hairdryer and we did not feel comfertable to ask the staff for anything since they were very rude and obnoxious.Breakfast was not included and cost 11 euros if you wanted it. We were meant to be in another bastion hotel but they sent us here in the middle of the night and we had to travel by public transport with all our luggasge at 11 pm. In conclusion, bad hotel stay away.

<Content>The Breakfast Was The Best Thing By Far Hotel was perfectly based for us as we were travelling from Germany.It was slightly hard to find but good secure parking. The room was reasonable standard 鈥?clean but nothing special at all and shower room was not too great. The room we had was the first one guests go past when they walk through corridors, so not a very quiet room.The rail way station is a few km away across some busy roads and it鈥檚 very small but good access for Amsterdam centre which is what we went for.The upside was the food 鈥?we had an evening meal and it was a good choice of 3 courses for a very reasonable amount, quick friendly service and generally tasty. Breakfast was delightful and so many lovely things to be had 鈥?that was the best thing by far!The staff was quite helpful but this is not a tourist hotel, so I鈥檇 go with information already on what is nearby. Just about average hotel, but certainly would not stay there again.

<Content>Nice hotel for drivers Easy access with car, for others is more complicated - 10-15 minutes walking from metro stop. Typically Dutch as they advertise, so nice rooms, service sometimes good, sometimes unbearable. Restaurant with limited menu and good food quality.Free Internet access, also with WiFi from hotel room.

<Content>Unfriendly Staff My friend and i stayed at this hotel 22nd and 23rd June '06. The main reason we chose this hotel was because it was relatively near the Amsterdam ArenA, where we went to see Robbie Williams in concert. We checked in at 2pm, there were 4 people stood behind reception talking, we were stood there for a good couple of minutes before any of them took any notice of us!! The man behind reception then took my name and said we had booked a standard room - which we hadnt - I told him it was a Deluxe room we should be given and he muttered something in Dutch, to which the other 3 people found hillariously funny - not a great first impression!! The room was nice and maid service was good, we had a safe in the room in which you create your own code for and tea and coffee facilities. The view from our room was a train track!!! As some people have said on previous reviews you are quite out of the way, although the metro staion was only a 5-10 minute walk from the hotel. Cant comment on the restaurant as we preferred to eat out in the city where the staff were a little more welcoming!! Checking out of the hotel was just as unfriendly as checking in, I personally wouldnt stay in this hotel again.

<Content>cheap alternative a little out of town We didn't want to spend a fortune for a hotel, nor stay in a cheap one - because those are just plain nasty (talking about those downtown Amsterdam...), so this one seemed to be a good alternative. It was an acceptable hotel, for our 3 day stay, we got there by car and you can park your car for free there - parking your car in the city costs you a little fortune too (I think last time we paid 30 Euros a day), so this was another reason not to stay right in town. The walk and ride with the train downtown was ok, of course it would have been nicer to be closer, but we didn't want to spend that much money. Room was clean, ate once in the hotel (was expensive but very good).So I would stay there again.

<Content>Not So Close to Amsterdam The previous review for this hotel sums up the location......terrible. As the writer of the other review states, its a good 10 minute walk from the metro station. Of course, this wouldn't be so bad, if you don't have a lot of luggage - otherwise, its a bit of a tedious walk. And contrary to what the hotel says, it is not overly close to all the major tourist attractions; you will most certainly have to make a connection or two on the trains or trams in order to arrive in any part of Amsterdam's major tourist destinations. We were a bit disheartened to learn that the other Bastion Deluxe Hotels throughout Amsterdam offer free shuttle service to and from their hotel; however, this one does not.As for the hotel itself, we were relatively pleased with our room and the appearance. The room we had came with two twin beds, a large bathroom, safe and a mini-bar (which was very reasonable in prices). We highly recommend paying for the breakfast they provide (EUR 11, per person) as it is delicious and well worth it. If you're in the mood for anything else other than breakfast, you'll find the closest thing you're going to get beyond the hotel restaurant is the gas station situated only feet from the hotel - which hardly constitutes a meal.We did not find the staff to be overly friendly, as most everyone tends to be in Amsterdam. They were certainly very attentive and promptly took to our request for a taxi and internet service but they did not give the going the extra mile impression.All in all, we as well as the previous writer, do not recommend this hotel for the tourist. It's a great hotel for the business traveler or the person who enjoys walking and/or public transportation rides. And not to mention, going out at night may take you a bit longer to get back to the hotel since the trains and trams don't run as frequently as they do during the day. Certainly a very clean, comfortable hotel but in a poor location.

<Content>Terrible Location! If you're thinking about staying here while you tour Amsterdam, I'd consider thinking again, particularly if you don't have a car!The hotel is a good 15 minute walk to the metro station, down a road that does not have a sidewalk for part of the way. Nor does the road have a proper crosswalk for pedestrians, so prepare to engage in a run of terror across the street with your suitcase.The hotel says that it's just a 'hop skip and a jump' from the main tourist area, but that's just not the case. There's nothing around the hotel but a gas station, and the hotel restaurant is quite expensive, for poor quality. From my side of the hotel I had a lovely view of the metro tracks, which were very loud and ran all night. From the other side of the hotel you can look at the 3 jails which are just down the street from the hotel. Aside from the location, the hotel is alright. The showers suck, and flood the bathroom, but I think that's a European thing, rather than specific to this hotel. I had to ask for fresh towels, they put the ones I left on the bathroom floor on the radiator to dry. Overall, a good hotel for business people in the city on business and with cars, but not for the average tourist.
