<Content>GREAT Location, GOOD Saving! We stayed in the Panda Plus room for 3 nights and the room was clean and spacious. Pretty easy to get to the hotel from airport by taking bus A31 which cost you HK$17.80 per person.Very friendly  helpful staff. Simply walk to the nearest MTR station - Tai Wo Hau or hop on to the hotel shuttle bus to get into the center of HK. The shuttle bus is free though it was stated in the Downtown Shuttle Bus Services Timetable HK$5 per single trip.Do explore those restaurants/ shops around the hotel for good food :)

<Content>Loved the spaciousness  We love the spaciousness and cleanliness of the room and facilities. Three of us had no problems sharing the room complete with our luggages. We also appreciate the fact that it is located a fair distance from the heart of Hong Kong - which meant that it was quiet and tranquil - perfect to rest and relax in after a long day of shopping and walking about. It's also part of a shopping centre with another shopping mall just across the road. We found a cosy little noodle shop that produced one of the nicest noodles we've ever tasted.The hotel staff were helpful and responded promptly to our requests for a better quality of our extra bed. They were informative when we asked them for directions to the local attractions. Be sure to ask them for the very helpful road map and mtr (subway) map - they are indispensable guides to the tourist.If you walk down towards Tsuen Wan town (about 10-15 mins from Panda Hotel), you'll encounter a nice park, a large City Landmark shopping centre and plenty of local delicacies to eat. The Tai Wo Hau MTR station is only 7 minutes minutes away and it's easy to find seats being the second stop from the beginning/end of the Tsuen Wan line.

<Content>Nice lobby but shabby rooms Booked the hotel through a travel agent in Singapore. Was expecting the hotel to be good from the photos of the hotel.First impression of the hotel was not too bad. The hotel is located above a shopping mall where you can buy your stuff like bread, water, soup... daily necessities easily. After taking the lift to the hotel lobby, the lobby looks good and grand i would say. The reception was friendly. however, when i went up to the room, i found the room was pretty old, not what i feel in the lobby. The toilet i old too. The bed and the pillows are pretty soft and they feel cheap. The room is also pretty small. Understand that the room that i had gotten was the cheaper ones. There are the better ones which are located at the higher floors. Location is not fantastic as well as it is located quite far from the city centre. it takes about 15 minutes walk from the nearest MTR station. Took some time travelling from the hotel to the other places.

<Content>Nice hotel. nice rooms Nice Hotel its a bit away for the centre of hong kong but still only about 15 mins. plus with it being at the start of the Tsuen wan line you'll get a seat!! anyhow back to hotel, rooms clean, quick check in and out plenty of shops in hotel and near by. bit of a tip get off the train at tai wuo hou station. check which exit you need i think its A, you'll see panda hotel over the road bit to the right. you can't miss it its got a massive panda painted on the side of it!Anyhow turn right out of the station after a short walk you'll see a spiral walkway on the right go up that and turn left at the end and it'll take you right into reception.Overall a good hotel i little out the way but good transport links close by (10 mins to mtr)

<Content>Family enjoyed our stay at The Panda Stayed in 2 bed Apartelle Suite with our 2 boys (aged 16 and 7) had a wonderful stay. Suite was spacious and peaceful after the bustle of HK. Rooms clean and lovely comfy beds. We were really impressed with hotel pool and changing facilities. Used the MTR most days and enjoyed the walk back and to. Although hotel is situated outside tourist area, shopping precinct underneath hotel was useful for eating near to hotel on a couple of nights. Bakery on ground floor great for breakfast.Overall thought accomodation was spacious and good value for money.

<Content>Housekeeping doesnt respect "Do Not Disturb" Stayed in late August 2008; was expecting to be on executive floor since we had booked a 2bedroom suite (they advertise the suites as part of their executive floor...so a bit misleading)Suite was fairly large by HK standards; i think we were assigned the Apartelle suite, which has a small kitchenette (sink, mini fridge  stove), along with a dining areaHotel itself is located between the Tsuen Wan  Tai Wo Ho MTR stations (about 10-15min walk to each?); there's a McDonald's around the corner, and a small grocery store (Wellcome) downstairs, and a full-sized grocery store (Park n Shop) across the streetAnyways, due to jetlag and a young toddler who likes to nap in the afternoon, we usually have a Do not disturb sign on our door. Unfortunately, housekeeping must work on some sort of room quota, so we received daily phone calls or the maid knocking our door asking us when they can clean our rooms. One time, the maid actually entered the room despite the Do not disturb signThe hotel does cater to mainland China tour groups...so be prepared for tourists who dont like to line up, as well as enjoy charging into an elevator before its occupants can leave

<Content>Great service, lovely even though small room Loved the Panda. We stayed on Executive floor, which I highly recommend. THe accommodations were more up to date, even though small. They adjoined a second room for us for our daughter, so having 2 rooms and 2 bathrooms with updated furnishings was lovely. The staff at Concierge desk at the Executive lobby were very helpful, even writing out directions for us in Chinese for the taxi drivers. We enjoyed the simple breakfasts and cocktail hours each day that came with staying on executive floor. We will be back.

<Content>Hidden Charges, Walls shruk room, New Charges Panda Hotel 5th stay in 6 yearsDate: May to Jun , 2008Reviewer: A frequent traveller to Hong KongI know this hotel is trying to survive as a tourist hotel so its a give and take. The first year I came here the lowest price hotel room was very large. Now over 6 years later the remodeled and the room is now roughly 3/4 the size. Bathroom is smaller as well.The value is still there but then other things were notices. The microwave was removed from the room, there's hardly anywhere to put clothes in the closet. However the price of the hotel remains the same. Sacrafice a bit to go a long way. The hotel has tried to keep their prices as low as possible. Make sure you DO NOT use the phone in the room with a phone card. They will charge you. Use it only for local phone calls. They upgraded from previous encarnation. The Panda place which is the bottom 4 lvls are full of shops. Some good some bad. An arcade, internet cafe and other resturants. Checkout the toy shop. Also the shuttle that gets you to Mong kok for 10HK dollars is worth it. It's a long haul by mtr and 4 times the price,

<Content>Recommended I stayed in this hotel on a 4 day /3 night package .I was upgraded to a room on the 28 executive floor on arrival .The room was very nice , king size bed , Lcd screen ,very clean , clean bathroom with a very good shower .The buffet breakfast is excellent at about 110HK dollars . The gym is small but adequate , the surrounding area around the pool is not very attractive . Internet access wifi is extra at 40HK for an hour .Staff are courteous not really friendly as in smiling but if you look for advice or help they will oblige . The MTR is about 5-10 mins walk and that metro is excellent. It takes about 30 mins to get to the city . Overall I was very impressed

<Content>Loved the Panda Hotel! We have just returned from a 14 night stay at the Panda and have only good things to say about it!The reception staff were excellent, they couldn't be more helpful. Our room was on the 26th floor and despite being fairly close to the lift, was exceptionally quiet. It was big and very clean, and the maids were so good, even phoning us to see what time the room could be cleaned if we hadn't surfaced by 1pm!It's situated slightly out of town, but the MTR is fabulous - both reliable and cheap. It took about 10 minutes to walk back to the hotel under the covered walkway. There are lots of handy shops though, both in the Panda Place under the hotel and in nearby streets.The hotel shuttle bus is also free and efficient. It drops off in a couple of places in Mongkok if requested, otherwise it goes to the New World Centre, right near the Star Ferry. A word of advice - the hotel laundry is pretty expensive. Just across the road is the Decent Laundry Shop. Take your bag of washing in there, we paid 24 dollars for a weeks worth (about 拢1.50). It was washed, dried and folded, and returned to the hotel reception that evening! Fabulous service! We paid for Broadband access in the room, but that was incredibly slow, and that was the only negative thing we can comment on.And if you've got kiddies, or you're easily offended, avoid the Joy Gift Shop in the hotel. I thought it would be full of panda nicknacks, but it's actually a sex shop! How bizarre.We will definitely be going back to stay at the Panda! Hong Kong is a fantastic country with so much to see and do. I could wax lyrical for hours....

<Content>Rude  1). The front office staff apart from being rude  unfriendly, also demanded US $ 300 per day per room before we avail any room services, which future guests may please note.2). Courtesy coach to city center is not free, but they charge HK $ 5 per seat per trip. (for guests to note). Its about 30 minutes drive to Tsim Sha Tsui the main city centre.3). Most of the front office staff cannot speak or understand ordinary English ( more of information rather than a complaint).

<Content>Good value for money Needed a well-priced hotel in Hong Kong as we would be staying there for a week for work. Honestly, we chose Panda because of its price - it seemed to have the best value.We weren't wrong. While not a luxury hotel or anything like that, the Panda is a good, tourist hotel. The rooms were clean - and maintained each day. There were a couple of restaurants on the ground floor that had good, reasonably priced food. The staff was very helpful.The hotel is in between two MTR stops, the end stop of the red line, Tsuen Wan is about a 10-15 minute walk through shops selling clothes (some cheaper than in the Kowloon area). The other, nearer stop, is about a 5-minute walk on the street.Get an Octopus card for convenience and you can reach any spot in Hong Kong on the MTR lines. Quite easy to get around.Would certainly consider staying here again if ever i return to Hong Kong.

<Content>not so recommendable I just came back from a 4d/3n stay in hong kong, panda hotel was suggested by a travel agent. It's quite cheap but the room is old. I requested for a newly refurbished room instead I was given an old one, the last room on th 25th floor, so from the elevator i had to walk for 1.5 min to get to my room. The room is just ok, but clean, ref is sooo small. Some of the front desk staff is not approachable or at least doesnt look friendly. I especially didnt like one of the conceirge, he's not helpful at all and very unpleasant at that, the management should teach the customer service staff to atleast smile or reply with a nod once a customer says thanks, or perhaps these people are just not so friendly with filipino guests, you'd see the difference when they talk to american or european guests. That is just soooo wrong. But to be fair, some of the staff are helpful and pleasant, the hotel is within 30mins drive away from the airport. There are a lot of restaurants and snack bar in the area. They provide free shuttle ride to downtown hongkong, bus driver is friendly, free wireless internet acces in the lobby. Although the vicinity is not recommended to tourists who are into enjoying the view, the hotel is sorrounded with old rusty buildings, though it's safe to walk around. I regret to have not chosen a hotel in kowloon,

<Content>Great Hotel We stayed in Kowloon because Hong Kong was too expensive. We are glad we did. The lobby staff spoke English. The bed was comfy. The room was quiet. The area the hotel is located in was convenient to the subway and right near the big market - great shopping - cheap restaurants - nice covered walkways (elevated) kept us dry and out of the street when walking to the subway. Wifi works in the lobby. They have a cheap bus that takes you right from the hotel to lots of Hong Kong  Kowloon destinations. Would stay there again! Took the train to Guangzho - really cool to see real Chinese countryside - and a breeze to get into the mainland. (just don't let anybody at the train station, at customs or the airport offer to take your bags - they'll charge you for a 25-yard journey and confuse the hell out of you - acting like they're all official and such) (also - if you're American looking you have a sign on you that says please yell at me in an effort to get me to buy what you're selling - the louder the better).

<Content>PANDA- relax, dine, shop, It's all here!!! The whole family stayed here for 2 ngihts, we had occupied 4 rooms. Panda hotel is located at 3 Tsuen Wah Street, Tsuen Wan, Kowloon, Hong Kong. You can easily spot the hotel because of the mural of a panda painted on its exterior wall. The first and second floor of the buidling was a shopping center, you could do your last minute shopping here where you can find clothes, colognes, shoes and a lot more. They have an outdoor swimming pool at the 8th floor, we haven't got the chance to try the water because the weather was cold I think because it's still winter. The size of the room was ok but the furnitures are quite old, the room was not so appealing because of its neutral color. The toilet and bath are excellent, they have a bath tub with shower. The toilet and bath room looks clean because of its white color. We haven't encountered any problem with their service, it's just that some of them don't understand English. We went to Mongkok and from Mongkok we took the MTR, took off at the Tsuen Wah Terminal and walk for about 10mins using a footbridge which will lead you straight to the lobby of the hotel at the 3rd floor. It's not at the heart of the city but it's ok. Travelling is not to and from the hotel is not a problem.

<Content>Lovely efficient staff, shabby room I stayed at the Panda Hotel for one night until 7pm the next day as my flight wasn't until Midnight. The staff were great despite being so busy and my transfers, arranged in advance, all worked like clockwork.The room was a disappointment as it was a little shabby - always ask for a refurbished room - and mini bar costs were very, very high.So stay here by all means but ask for a refurbished room and don't use the mini bar!

Highly recommended.

<Content>Great value and service for transit stay The hotel was suggested to me by the staff at the airport (for a 1 night transit stay). For just 604HKD, I was taken to/from the hotel by bus, and had a great 'executive' room on the 23rd floor. Room was very well equipped, spacious and clean. Free wifi internet was available in the lobby.

<Content>great hotel We stayed in this hotel for a week during September 2005. We found the staff were very professional and friendly and the hotel was lovely and quiet at night.The foyer which has just been refurbished was beautifull. We didn't mind being away from the main stream of hotels because Tsuen Wan gave us a real sense of Hong Kong and the under cover walk to the MTR only took about 10 mins if you could resist the shops in the malls on the way and the free shuttle bus laid on was just as quick, we used it all the time to get into kowloon. We would stay here again and would recommend it to anybody.

<Content>HK bargain Although you're in the new territories, It's really easy to get to HK on the MTR. It's the last stop on the MTR (Tsuen Wan) and takes about 30 mins to get to Kowloon. Take bus A31 from the airport which takes an hour and only costs $20. You go to the last stop and get a short taxi.Good hotel, clean, comfy, a few shops nearby and staff v friendly. Would go back.

<Content>True bargain I stayed at the Panda Hotel in Hong Kong the night of Mar. 14, 2005. While it is quite far from the city center (Kowloon-- about 25 km.), the hotel was pleasant and very reasonable: for me $44 US per night, including buffet breakfast. The shuttle from the airport was easy and cost only $10 US. They even had my name at counter A-16 in the airport where you get the shuttle. The hotel staff spoke English and were extremely courteous. While the floor carpet was stained (I believe they are renovating), the room was otherwise very clean with all the amenities, including TV, A/C, and a refrigerator. The free breakfast was fine. Cabs are cheap and this hotel is closer to the airport than most. For a business stay or overnight, it is a great bargain. One caveat: the dining room can be a little expensive if you're on a budget.

<Content>Just fine OK, so the location isn't central but the free shuttle makes up for that and takes no time. Also, take into consideration that this hotel is one of the few in hong kong in which the rate includes breakfast - a big plus, especially if you dont know chinese - the sole language in which most restaurant menus are written!rooms are designed a bit wierd but nothing harmful. service is friendly.

<Content>Not a good deal We booked the Panda last minute during the SARS outbreak a few years ago to catch the Rolling Stones' HK performance. Despite SARS, most of the reliable hotels (Prince, Marco Polo) were still fully booked that weekend, so on the advice of our travel agent, we went with this affordable alternative. The hotel was shabby - stains on the wall, bed and carpet. We requested a change of room when we found the in-room radio to be broken (it couldn't be turned off) and we were moved to a better floor - ie, rooms looked better. The location of the hotel is terrible -- you have to walk around 15 minutes to the nearest MTR station and stay on the MTR forever to get to Central or Causeway Bay. We will never stay there again.
