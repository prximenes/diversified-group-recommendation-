<Content>nice place to stay I recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to the Seattle area. In the suburbs but only a ten minute drive to downtown Seattle. Nice rooms, free breakfast, easy in/out. Stayed here in 2004 and again in 2007 for a week at a time. No complaints.

<Content>Good central location, reliable amenities We stayed at the Homewood Suites in Tukwila over MLK holiday. The price seemed right and the location was convenient. I was also thinking that we could use the refrigerator/stove, etc, but decided instead to eat out. The room was very nice and large with a nice leatherette sofa, great lighting, ample seating at a desk or the sofas. The kitchen/lounging area was separate from the sleeping area. I was impressed by the amount of room provided.The kitchen is small but adequate. It has no oven. Also, ours did not have a colander in case we wanted to strain food.There are apparently nonsmoking rooms with fireplaces, but these were not available when I checked in. I also received one of those Homewood Suites blankets at check-in (an option at the $139 price when I made online reservations) and it is great. We stayed on a weekend and did not get to experience the light dinner hors d'oeuvres.I did notice a rather strange odor in the hallway of my building, something similar to sour milk or curry (but not in a good way). However, this did not carry into the room.The breakfast was fairly standard. As a budget Hilton member, I enjoy the Hilton Garden Inn breakfasts the most. The Homewood Suites breakfasts tend to have oddly shaped scrambled eggs, greasy meat and the usual continental affair. They did have a decent oatmeal. The business center was large with two computers and an awesome color laser printer. My husband, however, felt that using Microsoft office applications was very cumbersome due to their security software.It was too cold to use the pool, but it looked like it would be nice in the summer. Overall, the stay was pleasant. In retrospect, if I knew I wasn't going to use the kitchen, I would have a chosen a less expensive Hilton option.

<Content>Nice place, Great Staff I was in town for an interview and the company booked the hotel. It was a very good experience. Their shuttle came and picked me up, took me to grab some food, back to the hotel and then out to the company for the interview and back again. All of the staff were extremely nice. I had a double room with a full kitchen. They have a full complimentary breakfast in the morning and during the week they have themed dinners that are also complimentary. You're definitely getting a good amount for your buck. I was even late to the dinner and one of the workers went back to the kitchen and got me some food anyway. I have nothing but good things to say about the staff and hotel. I'd stay again and probably will this month when I relocate to Seattle.

<Content>Very good Homewood Suites With one notable exception, all my stays at Homewood Suites have been very good and as expected. This one was also good.We had a suite with king bed and everything was clean and in good condition. There were some fake red flowers on the coffee table which provided a splash of colour.I booked this one night stay 11 months in advance and got a great rate of $99 plus tax for the night. It was considerably more expensive later.The only slight negative for us was we had travelled from the UK on a Saturday and the buffet breakfast was not served until 7 am on Sunday. As we'd been up since 3 am thanks to the time difference, we went to the closest 24-hour Wal-Mart and stocked up on water, snacks etc for the rest of our trip.The buffet was very good and as well as all the usual items, there were breakfast burritos (good), scrambled egg and a waffle iron was provided to make your own with the batter provided. There was also a separate food section with what appeared to be Japanese food, along with chopsticks.The surrounding area to this Homewood Suites was quite pleasant. A good place to start a vacation.

<Content>Excellent hotel I think the reviewer below has possibly confused this hotel with another one????There is ample parking, all of it safe and near the suites. It's near some offices (definitely NOT industrial) but there is no 'kerb side parking' and the hotel car park seemed very safe and secure - it was also well lit. We had no problems with our rental car.The rooms are serviced well each day - they are clean and modern and very well appointed - quite stylish really. The towels and linens were good quality, the bed comfortable and the bathroom very nice (good shower in our suite). There was also a very large separate kitchen with free popcorn and water.Our suite was number 227 - it overlooked a nice walking/cycle path on the Green River. It was easy to walk to the nearby mall too.Breakfast was fine - it was a busy time but the place remained clean and tidy - the staff were nice and helpful. Food was typical HS  the tea and coffee were excellent. In the evening, there was a fantastic salad bar along with chicken burgers on one night (other half liked his, I just had salad) and spaghetti the next - both reasonable and eaten in a nice environment.This is both a good airport hotel AND an excellent choice for touring given it's close proximity to the freeways. I'd definitely recommend it.

<Content>Homewood Suites is Awful and Unclean We booked this hotel during Bumbershoot (Seattle's arts and music festival), and stayed there for three days and four nights. Our stay was barely short of a nightmare, and had we spend more time in our room I probably would have gone insane. Our room was not cleaned once during our entire stay. Every day the maid came by at 9am and we told her we were stepping out soon and to come back in about fifteen minutes. When we came home in the evenings after the festival was winding down for the night, we found our room had not been cleaned and the linen had not been changed. On the third day I specifically called the front desk and told them we were stepping out and to please send housekeeping up to bring fresh towels and fresh linen. When we got home that night there were a stack of towels scattered beside the door (like someone opened the door and threw them in), but the room had not been cleaned, the old towels had not been collected, and the bedding had not been changed. I went down to the front desk to complain, but they told me they didn't have any housekeeping personnel on shift at the time, and sent a maintenance man to our room to change the bedding. It took him almost a half hour to change the bedding, which was quite annoying since it was after midnight and we were exhausted.On top of that, the hotel does not have a parking lot. You can park on the curb for free (nearly impossible and not safe given its industrial downtown location), or you can pay $15 a night to park in their parking garage. The garage is under the hotel and the ramp leading down is at an extremely sharp angle to the alleyway. My car bottomed out every time I entered and exited the garage. Plus the garage is very poorly ventilated. It smelled like stale exhaust and there was dust all over my car after three days.Also incredibly tacky were the maids. They loitered in the halls in the morning and talked more than they cleaned (obviously since my room was never touched.) One of the mornings we were leaving one of the maids was telling another how she made out with her first cousin the night prior.Last, the room was terribly outdated. You could tell it was nice and prime about 10 years ago, but they've done nothing to keep with the times. No DVD player, just a VCR. They also did not have any room service or amenities. I'd expect more for over $250 a night.I will never go back to this hotel, and I would not recommend it to anyone. They have some serious corrections to make to their staff and their facilities, not to mention their prices.

<Content>Great hotel close to the airport We stayed at the hotel for one night because we wanted to be close to the airport for our morning flight the next day. We arrived around 3:00 pm. My daughters wanted to shop at the Southcenter Mall and the shuttle driver drove us there and picked us up at a prearranged time.When we returned, we enjoyed the complimentary evening snack which was cream of broccoli and cheese soup and salad which were both decent. One of my daughter's is a very picky eater (doesn't like soup or salad) but my husband found a fast food restaurant close by.In the morning we enjoyed the complimentary continental breakfast. Our daughters especially enjoyed the waffles which they could make themselves. Some of the food was not great, such as the eggs, sausage and canned (yuk) fruit., There was yogurt, muffins, oatmeal (didn't try) and toast as well, enough to sustain us for our flight home.The room was nicely decorated. We booked a one bedroom suite. It came with a small kitchenette which encluded a full size fridge, microwave and even a dishwasher. We felt it would have been comfortable enough for a few days stay.

<Content>The perfect long staying After spending a great week in Buffalo, we were sure to find the same hospitality also in Seattle. And so it was. On a business trip, we felt like on vacation.The location is excellent, close to the main businesses of the great Seattle-Tacoma area, to a big Mall (being a European you appreciate even that) and sorrounded by green areas with bicycle trails and pedestrians paths. But above all was the excellent and caring staff that made our staying perfect. Even being 6,000 miles away from your Country, we found ourselves at home. And the rate compared to what we got was even greater. Overall Superb. Definitely our choice when we travel back to the American Continent.

<Content>A very Nice Place for a Week's Stay... Do to a future Job Transfer, my family and I combined a House Hunting trip and Vacation into one and stayed at the SeaTac Homewood suites for a week from Mar 14-21.Although the hotel appears very plain from outside, we found upon entering, a large, well appointed and very comfortable Lobby/Great Room with two fireplaces. (This area also doubles as the breakfast and cocktail area) The two bedroom-two bath suite was very roomy and comfortable for 6 adults and one small dog. With a fully equip kitchen, this made for an ideal central point to explore the Seattle Area.Our suite overlooked the Green River and the river walkway was perfect for walking the dog in the morning. Although trains could be heard they were not bothersome and added a light country feel to the atmosphere.MT route 150 (METRO BUS) which stops less than a 1/8 of mile from the hotel is a direct (no transfers) to downtown Seattle with stops 2 or 3 blocks from both Pike's Public Market and the Space Needle. It saved on gas and traffic headaches.The staff was extremely helpful and courteous and the business room with two Internet ready PC's was very convenient along with the 24hr self serve laundry, which we all used. As for the reports of numerous vehicle break-ins, the hotel has a few office buildings and a large park in the immediate area which would account for these. We parked all the way in the back of the property and did not have any problems.My wife and I will be returning in late July or early August and most likely be staying here for a week or two until our new home is ready.

<Content>Good place to stay in Seattle We, a party of 3, enjoyed staying at this hotel for 4 nights between Christmas and New Year. We did not experience car break-in. The hotel is clean and efficient. Great breakfast bar, as mentioned by many, and by far the best accommodation I have had in Seattle, for my tight budget.A hint to others: For $10 more, choose a suite with a fireplace - the suite is much roomier and most important, has a bathroom that's outside of the bedroom. Some minor dings: train noise, drafty first-floor room.I thank Billy and one of his colleagues for accommodating our request to switch from a smaller suite: it made all the difference. Also, my luggage did not arrive the first night and I was estatic to find it at the front desk first thing in the morning.

<Content>Convenient and exceptional value for Seattle Airport area This hotel is closer to the South Mall than the airport, but they have a free shuttle which picks you up and drops off, so the extra 5 minute drive is really irrelevant. We do have to wait an extra 10-15 minutes for the pickup, but it is really worth it. We have stayed here 4 times recently and every time has been great. Each room is a suite with a living area, fold out couch, TV and small kitchen and a large bedroom with beautiful bathroom. This makes it a great value if traveling with kids especially with their free breakfast. There is a second TV in the bedroom.Breakfast is buffet style with make-your-own waffles, fruits, cereals, yogurts, muffins, toast, scrambled eggs and meat and fresh juices. There is a fireplace and big-screen TV in the lobby which looks out on the pool and hot-tub (in a pretty little gazebo).In the evening there are soft drinks in the breakfast area and on certain days there is a free happy hour with snacks, but we have not been there for that. The staff is really friendly and professional and the maid service has turned towel-folding into an origami artform. Rooms are immaculately clean and very quiet. Their soaps and shampoos are first class and we always look forward to popping the complimentary pop-corn in the microwave. Trying to find this place on your own is tricky, it cannot be seen from the main roads, so call for directions or use a map.

<Content>Car Break-ins at the Homewood Suites - Tukwila, Washington My husband and I were meeting family from overseas in Tukwila, Washington for X-mas. On our second night at the hotel, our truck was broken into and various items from our vehicle were taken. When the police arrived, they informed us that this hotel averages 2 break-ins a week and that he was here two nights before investigating a break-in only two parking spaces where our vehicle was parked. 2 break-ins a week equals 112 break-ins a year -- obviously our break-in is not an isolated incident. This hotel is very aware of the break-in probelms that occur in their parking lot, but have not make any steps in which to thwart off potential break-ins, such as security cameras, fences/gates around their property that admit only registered guests with keys or on-site security officers. It is very upsetting to know that break-ins occur on a fairly regular basis at this hotel and yet the hotel itself has done nothing to prevent such incidents. This incident cost me approximately $600 for the damange to my vehicle and a loss of over $200 worth of items removed from my truck. I do not recommend staying at this hotel.

<Content>Good Choice for Seattle Stayed here over Labor Day weekend and was pleased with all aspects of the hotel.I especially enjoyed their morning breakfast that is included in your room price. The selection of hot and cold items allow just about everyone to find something they really like.The only thing you should be aware of is that this hotel has some rooms on the first floor that are below street level. This is what I was given on check-in. When I informed the desk that there was no way I was going to stay in a room like that they informed be I could stay in a better room with a higher price.Being assertive, I got a better room at the same price. Suggest if you book this hotel you request a room on the second floor or higher to remove any misunderstandings.Other than this one item I found the staff to be friendly and helpful. The problem with my airconditioner was solved within 30 minutes.Note that it is a long walk to downtown and the windows do not open for fresh air.

<Content>Absolutely Great Place Stayed here for 4 nights and found the this Homewood Suites absolutely great. The staff went the extra mile to ensure comfort of their guests. I especially liked the great breakfasts and evening Manager's dinners (Monday thru Thursday). Clean, quiet, roomy, and well maintained. Also great location near jogging/bike path. My number one choice for Seattle.

<Content>Great Choice The Homewood was a very nice surprise. The room was spacious and very clean. The free Evening meal was tasty and the breakast very good as well. I booked well in advance and received a great rate around $70. Overall, the Homewood was a great experience and I would definitely stay there again.
