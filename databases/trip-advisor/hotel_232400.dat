<Content>Great budget hotel in great location Let's be honest, this is a budget hotel ideally suited for boozy weekends in Amsterdam.At 拢60 a night this place is a bargain considering the following:1. Amsterdam hotels can be pretty obscene tariff wise2. It was en-suite3. It was clean4. It had a great location (if your intention is getting drunk)As I was travelling with my girlfriend, an en-suite was essential and from researching hotels at the time it was clear that hardly any hotels had this basic facility in a central location at a reasonable price.Spot on for the budget traveller as we were at the time.

<Content>Nice location, nice stay We managed to find a double room on Expedia for about 60 euros, which was a decent price for our budget. The room was small but clean and comfortable, the staff friendly, and most of all, the hotel is very well located. The only negative thing was that there was no shampoo or soap in the shower, but as long as you know it before going, it's not a big problem!

<Content>Much more than meets the eye ! From the start I have to say I have known The Gerstekorrel (In de Gerstekorrel as it used to be) since 1966 and have been STAYING as a regular since 1972.My own 2 yr.absence recently has only been due to an intractible domestic situation,NOT to any loss of faith at all..indeed..the very OPPOSITE !YES..a very tourist/family type it IS.However,the CLEANLINESS,COMFORT ans sheer OBLIGING FRIENDLINESS and HELPFULNESS of the staff quite set it apart;and,the location..as slap-dap central as you could ever want it to be ( 1.minute from the Dam Square says-it-all).We'll gloss-over the fact that the RLD (Walletjes..or whatever) is just 3.minutes the other way !!!!! Moreover,the lingustic professionalism of the staff,especially at reception is almost university level,with their considerable personal Warmth enhancing their commitment that no request is ever too small,for them to go out of their way to help you !This and the other points DO,without question,offset the touristyand a little noisy situation -only to be reasonably expected for a location such as that in a city of the size and vibrancy of Amsterdam.Finally,one last and HUGELY HONOURABLE and GREATLY RESPECTED point about this hotel.Just after it opened at the beginning of WW 11,after Holland was invaded,not surprisingly, the hotel was occupied by The Wehrmacht.from time to time (and,I believe,more than that even),the then owners,at a HUGE risk to themselves,sheltered people of the Jewish faith -in the cellar; right under the noses of the German military -upstairs !!It has been an honour to write this report..and GOD BLESS to all !Cheers,Mr.Stereo

<Content>Location, Location, Location! We had a prompt e-mail response from the ** Hotel de Gerstekorrel with a fair price quote for our nine day visit to Amsterdam. I had read all the hotel reviews available on the web, and was looking for what would fill our needs....simple, safe, quiet and within walking distance of reasonably priced restaurants with good food, local sights, as well as Central train station for day trips.The Hotel de Gerstekorrel filled the bill! Our spacious room with private bath and tv was mostly quiet as requested (#27). The only time it wasn't quiet was when other guests were noisy arriving or departing which can be true of any **** hotel. The room was simple and clean, with thick white towels after a hot shower in the private bath, The twin beds were almost a human cocoon of cozy, comfort for my husband and me.  Upon arrival at the hotel (long before actual check in time), from a 3 hr drive and 9 hr. sleepless flight, our luggage was cheerfuly secured, and when the room was ready we fell into the beds and slept like babies til late afternoon. This nap was not on our agenda but we never regretted it one bit!The entire staff was always friendly, and helpful; they seemed genuinely interested in making our stay memorable.As for the location, Hotel de Gerstekorrel was tops!  Hotel de Gerstekorrel is situated within walking distance of the Central Station where we could walk to board and travel to nearby villages as well as an economical, timely assurance of getting back to the airport later for an early morning departure. Within blocks were various restaurants and easy walking to the tram or many of the sights of this lovely city.Note, the hotel stairs are a little steep, but normal for most European buildings where space is at premium. At 63, I had no trouble making it up to our room.The breakfast was not like home ( the only disapointment) but certainly kept us full til our noon meal. The strong coffee and orange juice were most welcome.After many, many years of foreign travel, we recognize a gem!When we return, we will no doubt stay here again, for a simple, safe, convenient, clean and comfortable stay.Thank you again, Lisa, and the whole staff for making our 44th anniversary so memorable!

<Content>Mission We stayed at Hotel De Gerstekorrel 16/08/08 - 18/08/08 and it was rubbish we got put in a different building with loads of stairs about 70 steps or something. We were dead by the time we got up the stairs. Breakfast well how tasty bread roll, cheese slice, tea with no milk, orange juice with loads of bits of crap in. Location ok close to everything coffeshops, red light district, bars, munch!! so quite good for location. Staff seem nice too! Ohh almost forgot our excellent view of Roof Tops and crap on roofs. So overall good location and thats all it has going for this hotel.

<Content>Good location but nothing more Located in the Dam square so if you like that that's ok or even great otherwise there are better and quite places in Amsterdam (now we know...). Not that the hotel is terrilble but a tiny room, no breakfast included (but many places nearby to eat/buy). Tthe worst thing is that the walls are very thin so the room is noisy.Conclusion: the price too high for living in the center. There are better and quite places even in same price. We'll look for a better place next time!

<Content>Amazing Amsterdam We stayed at this hotel from 14th - 19th February 2008. Upon arrival the reception staff were polite, welcoming and friendly, and the process of checking in was quick and easy. Our room was on the 2nd floor, at the back of the hotel. Whilst the room was smaller then we expected, it was clean and had everything we needed. The bathroom looked recently renovated, with a wet room style shower. Towels were changed every day, and the room cleaned. We didnt have any problem with noise, being at the back of the hotel it was away from the main street and therefore quiter. Breakfast was delivered to the room every morning, a time having being arranged the previous day, and consisted of a fresh warm bread roll, cheese, jam, butter, a strawberryorange smoothie, tea or coffee and an After Eight chocolate! Everything was fresh and individually packed. We stayed 5 days and all of the reception staff and cleaning staff we came across during our stay were helpful and friendly at all times. We would certainly stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Perfect cheap base for the RLD Me and my friend (both male/mid 20s) stayed here for a few days in Feb '08.I've stayed in some 'hell hole hotels' in Amsterdam before (Delta) and also some really nice ones (Victoria Plaza). This Hotel was a good compromise between the two. No frills, but cheap and clean.It's major plus point is the location for Red Light District. It's just off Dam Square and a minute away from the Coffee Shops, Bars and the other RLD attractions.Because of this, it is noisy outside, but it didn't bother me as I had a belly full of Heineken and would of slept through an earthquake.I had read reports on TR about the steep steps. We were on the third floor and they were a bit of a pain, but nothing too troublesome. However if I were to stay here again, I would ask if there was a room on the first or second floor available.Housekeeping service was great and the staff were very friendly.Couple of bits of advice...1) When you are trying to find the hotel the wording 'Hotel De Gerstekorrel' is written very small on the sign. We walked passed it several times. The large wording on the sign is 'DAM STRAT'2) If you are planning on leaving your bags there before check-in, you should get there as early as possible. They do have a place to leave your bags but it is only a small cupboard. We arrived at 10:30am and the cupboard was already full.

<Content>Basic but fantastic Got this hotel included very cheaply in a DFDS Ferry 3nt package (whole trip, ferry 2nt and hotel 1nt cost us 拢75 each) So for the price I was blown away. We bookd a twin room but when we got there the room we had was non-smoking, we said at reception that we needed a smoking room and with no hassle whatsoever they said one would be avalible by 1pm, and it was a double, which is what we really wanted. Plus it was on the 2nd floor instead of the 4th which didnt go amiss.The staff also provided a hairdryer and iron on request.The staff, clearly are very friendly and helpful. The location was perfect, literally a one minute walk from Dam Square (though we walked past it a couple of times as it really doesnt stand out)The rooms, at least the two I saw were clean with satalite TV and en-suite bathroom. The bathroom was tiny but I got a laugh from resting the side of my head on the wall while sitting on the toilet. Although the bathroom was a little crampd there was ample room to use all the facilities. The room itself didnt feel cramped and the bed was very comftable.Breakfast consisted of a choice of tea coffee and orange juice with bread, cheese, jam etc. very basic but as I didnt even think breakfast was included it was welcome. It was left on a tray outside the room in the morning.It was very noisey from about 11:30pm well into the early hours of the morning, especialy since we had the window open because we were smoking. However this didnt bother me too much, and being right, quite unbeleivably, in the centre of the city centre, was to be expected.Ive given this hotel a five rating, but thats in the constraints of a budget hotel. If I'd paid enough to expect a 4 or five star hotel this would be a let down, but I expected a BB for what I paid and got so much more. If your on a budget and want someware smack bang in the centre of things with friendly staff, comftable rooms and havnt got bad legs look no further.If stairs are a problem find someware els.

<Content>Great Location! We just got back from a European vacation and stayed at this hotel for 3 nights.The best part of this hotel is the location, it is located in central Amsterdam, close to restaurants, bars, and shopping. You are also 3 minutes from the Red Light District area. When we arrived at the hotel, you can definately tell that the hotel was not going to be a high end hotel, it is very very basic, we got a quad room, to sleep 4 adults. You have to take the stairs up to the rooms, which are pretty narrow. The rooms are clean but very small, same with the bathrooms, very very small. At first thought we thinking to ourselves what did we get ourselves into? but at the end of our stay, I think we were all happy that we stayed there, mainly because the rooms weren't that bad but we were so central to everything. It is nice to go out late at night and be walking distance back to the hotel. You would never have to leave this area as it is so close to all the hot spots.If you are looking for the Hilton, this is not it, it is at best a two star, but the rooms are clean, it can get a little loud at nights but once you close the windows, it's not all that bad. The front desk staff were very very helpful and spoke good english. Overall, the location speaks for itself, the rooms were as basic as you can get but I knew that prior to booking. Grab this place if you are not fussy about having top notch rooms, and if you want to be close to the action, you will save your money on cabs alone by grabbing this hotel.

<Content>Excellent Location, Excellent Staff Stayed here for one night after cruising over from Newcastle for one night to spend a day and a half in Amsterdam before cruising back.This was my second time staying in Amsterdam, the first time staying at the Amstel Botel and found this experience far superior.Really wasn't expecting anything spectacular but the rooms were clean which is all I really care about for a one or two night stay.The best thing was the staff, they couldn't have been any friendlier if they tried and it really made the whole experience pleasurable.As stated by others the only problem we had was with the stairs to the rooms as they were very steep which was quite a challenge trying to negotiate up my 2 year old nephew, his buggy, our suitcases, oh and his pregnant mother (lol). But at the end of the day it is Amsterdam so what else do you expect.All in all a very pleasurable experience and would definitely book there again as the location is second to none.

<Content>Very friendly hotel This small hotel has a narrow entrance squeezed in between a pizza place and a Wok to Go take-away with rooms on 5 floors, via steep narrow steps. The hotel is Dutch-Finnish owned with mostly staff from Finland and with Finnish magazines in the reception area. Room info is in English, Dutch and Finnish. The staff are VERY friendly. I got a big room for myself alone, bright, nicely decorated, with big desk, a TV on the wall, flat screen but not wide sreen, 35 channels via the cable, incl. BBC 1 and 2 and BBC World. Nice bathroom with shower.I did not find it noisy, even being on the street side. It is very clean, good beds (3 in my triple room). Price I paid was 99 Euro through a Dutch website [--], cheaper than via Booking.com. No credit card needed via this website I used.Not cheap but normal for Amsterdam. Location is very near Dam square, opposite rooms of the 5-star Krasnapolsky, ideal location I think, walking distance from central station and most sights in Amsterdam.For eating dinner in your room the next-door take-aways are ideal and cheap. No minibar in hotel room, no airco but a table fan, which I found to be VERY necessary in summer. Without it it would be too hot for me in summer in this hotel, but the fan means of course the room will not be quiet at night.In the reception you can get drinks and even toiletries. in bathroom there's only a dispenser on the wall, bring own toiletries. All in all a good place to stay, especially outside summer months. I am Dutch but stayed here because of a very early flight and evening activity in Amsterdam. Had to leave to early to say anything about breakfast but it is served in the room.

<Content>Superb Location The location of this hotel is superb for bars, shops, restaurants, trams. We paid for and expected a budget hotel and were pleasantly surprised that it was far nicer than we had anticipated. Staff couldn't have been more helpful. Our allocated room was on a different floor from our teenage children and the receptionist immediately said it wasn't a problem to change and gave us rooms on the same floor. Rooms were ready early and we were able to check in immediately. Rooms are pleasant (though not particularly large) with neutral decoration, beds comfortable, linen fresh and clean, showers worked well. Rooms facing the front can be noisy when the windows are open (the children had no problem with this) but the rooms at the back are very quiet. We had our breakfast delivered to our rooms every day at a time to suit us (warm rolls, jam, coffee, juice). We were able to leave our luggage in the hotel's locked storage room on our day of departure. We have been to Amsterdam on a number of occasions but this was our first stay at this hotel. We would not hesitate to book this one for our next trip. The only downside would be that the stairs are very steep and it is a little awkward to carry cases up and down. Certainly wouldn't be suitable for disabled people.

<Content>Great location, basic and clean We have just returned from a 1 night stay here and found the hotel to be a great overnight stay. The rooms are basic but clean, the location is perfect just off Dam square. The only down side to this hotel are the stairs up to the rooms very steep and no lift..... we stayed on the 4th floor it was a work out, but not impossible. Breakfast was nice served to your room nice fresh warm bread and tea or coffee and OJ too.Overall we found it to be a good place to stay for a quick stop off from our cruise. Would stay again if I returned to Amsterdam.

<Content>Very warm rooms, very squishy beds As others have said, the ventilation is terrible -- I found it too warm to sleep. The beds are soft and unsupportive. It's a walk-up -- prepare to climb as many as five stories of steps. I decided during the first night of a five night stay that I wanted to find another hotel, but because I told them after 3pm, they insisted that I pay for at least two nights. There is no breakfast room; if you order breakfast, it's delivered to your room in a take-out box. The location has some perks, but this street is very active until the wee hours of the warning -- if you're on the street side, it will be loud. The wireless net worked fine.

<Content>Excellent no-frills base for sightseeing The rooms are simply furnished but very clean  very comfortable  the staff were pleasant  obliging. We were able to check in straight away  on departure leave our luggage until it was time to meet our coach. Unless you want luxurious surroundings or an all-inclusive holiday I don't think you can beat this hotel as a base for your sightseeing as it is just off Dam Square. As you come out of the hotel turn left for the most fantastic bakery on this planet, turn right out of the hotel for a charming Fantasy shop selling Trolls, fairies etc. The noise didn't bother us even with the window open but if we stayed there in the summer I would probably request a room on the other side so that we could have our windows open at night. The location was excellent  I would happily stay there again.I don't like steep stairs but found these were ok especially as we had requested a room that was on the 1st floor.

<Content>Fantastic value We have been to Amsterdam 3 times now and the last two were spent at this hotel. The staff are all so friendly and helpful. The rooms are fairly basic but clean and tidy. We asked for a front facing room which had fab views of dam straat. We plan to visit Amsterdam each year and will definetly be returning here! The location is just too good to resist. Dam square is a minute away and there are some really good coffeshops close by. Would definetly recommend.

<Content>Shame On Management I mistakenly relied upon the tripadvisor reviews about this well located hotel. What a mistake as their rooms desperately need major maintenance/decoration work and a very good clean. Avoid this place as there are many better value for money options in the area.

<Content>Great location!!!! Suited a young crowd/couple I have stayed in Amsterdam 3 times now and this by far has been the best for location! Its just of Dam Square and in a very busy street with a beautiful Argentian Steak house next door. There were 9 of us in total on my stag do, and we had a ball! There are a few things though to note. The stairs are very steep and would not suit an old person or someone with say back/weight problems. The cost we paid was 50 euros per night without breakfast included which was hefty enough. However if you are like me and want to do Amsterdam properly and are not too bothered with elegant and quiet surroundings then its not an issue . We were able to walk from central station about 10 minutes to the Hotel and everything was so close! I would recommend also that you visit Susies Saloon which is a bar just around the corner. It has a pool tabel and between 4pm-6pm its 2 euros a pint of ice cold Heinekein (beautiful)Do Not buy drink from the Bulldog bar!!!!!! It cost us 70 euros for 1 round of beers and one wiskey was 8 euro! Getting back to the Hotel , the staff were friendly and to sum it up its clean, comfortable and really, really, central. Would I stay here again ? Yes definitley . Would it be everybodys cup of tea? Probably not. But if your young fit and ready to party , its perfect.

<Content>Great Hotel The hotel was very clean, comfortable and in a superb location right in the centre of Amsterdam(Dam Sq/Red Light). We had a triple room which worked out a 拢90 a night between us which is great value. Would definitely recommend this hotel for young couples and groups.

<Content>Great Location, Adequate This was our sixth time visiting Amsterdam in the past 12 years, but our first at the Hotel De Gerstekorrel - selected purely for location, it certainly didn't disappoint on that score (very central indeed); while the accommodation itself is somewhat basic (more or less what you would expect for a hotel in the low to mid price range), the room itself was clean and more than adequate for our needs - and with friendly and helpful staff too, I'd definitely consider staying here again.Whilst the rooms to the front (overlooking Damstraat) can be noisy at night, they are slightly bigger (and in my opinion preferable) to those located at the side - we actually changed rooms to be at the front, so for us noise was not an issue; for some it may be though... With that in mind, I'd say this hotel would most appeal to the 20 - mid 40's age bracket.

<Content>Hotel De Gerstekorrel I stayed at the Hotel De Gerstekorrel on February 2006. Decent accomodations. Nothing fancy, nothing too shabby. Rooms were a little small with small beds and a small bathroom. I would stay there again if I was on a budget and trying to save money.

<Content>Perfect for our needs A basic but clean hotel. Perfect location just off Dam Square with a pastry shop one side and a fab chinese the other. The nearest 'coffee' shop was about 2 minutes away and the red light district 5 minutes away. It's about 10 minutes walk at most from the train station which in turn is 3.40 euros and 20 minutes from the airport.I will definately use this as my base again.

<Content>great location My husband and I visited Amsterdam for the first time and stayed at this hotel. I picked it due to the location, of which turned out to be excellent. It was in walking distance of all main attractions. I think it was a good 3/4 hour walk to museum area, but there are lots of things to see and do on way. The hotel itself was presentable. We arrived mid afternoon to find that we were in room 40 - on the fourth floor with no lift! The stairs are quite steep, but managable, by the end of our stay we could get to the top without being out of breath!! The staff were very friendly and helpful, the reception was 24 hour. The information at reception for sightseeing was good (I recommend looking through 'Boom' Magazine for handy tips on where to go). The room was cleaned daily, with no extra cost incurred. We did not have breakfast at the hotel as there were so many cafes / bars that served breakfast and we like wandering around! We caught a train from airport to Central Station and walked it down to the hotel (which is about a 20 min walk down Damrak. You will pass a S-- Museum - this is rubbish. Also theres Teasers, which was 13 euro for two large beers - the dearest we paid, but my husband wasn't complaining!! Also on the left (opposite teasers on other side of road) is the Grasshopper Bar, well worth going into. We got round a few sights. We thought the museum entrance fee were a little steep. We went to Anne Franks House, which was alright (a bit depressing though!). It was a shame that the front had been altered to a modern looking buidling but I suppose this was required. We went in Hollands Casino, which is quite a grand building (don't forget picture id or you won't get in!), we had a quick walk around the Vondelpark, but due to the terrential rain we didn't see much of this. We did plan to hire bikes (there is a shop very close to hotel for this), but the weather put us off. The flower Market is good for soveniers, and I thought were the cheapest. I liked the Leidesplein and the Rembrantplein for drinking and meals. We went round the Red Light District Area a couple of times. The bars, are alright round here. I did not like the Old Sailor as it was always jammed packed with lads and a bit off putting. We went in the Casa Rossa S-- Show (recommended to be the best one). I thought it may have been a bit more racy, but the comment from the couple at the side of me kind of summed it up when the lady commented that her husband could dance better than the lady on stage.......Also the bar staff were very somber, and you were hard pushed to get them to serve you. We went for a smoke (something we have no real knowledge of), we were recommended to try thr Stones Cafe (about a 5 min walk from hotel) and the Bulldog (walk right from hotel and first left before canal or go over canal and then next left!! you'll see the signs). This is very commercialised so for people like us who didn't know what they were doing - ideal! I think though for the more expert smoker they would be a bit rubbish and overpriced. The bulldog cocktail bar on Leidesplein (I think) is well worth visiting in the evening. The bar opposite the hotel (Zwart) on the corner of Dam Square was my favourite. It played 70s and 80s music and has a good atmosphere. Overall I recommend you look through the Boom Magazine to give you some ideas, it also has vouchers in which came in handy (this magazine was in reception). The Hotel is worth staying at if you just want somewhere to put your stuff and go to sleep. I would stay there again definetely.

<Content>Cheap and cheerful I have stayed in the single rooms at this Hotel twice, it only has two single rooms on the first floor, rooms 11 and 12. they are small, you can reach out and touch either wall, the room has a small TV mounted high above you. You do get a shower and toilet, no bath, the room window over looks a busy main road and may not suit the light sleeper the view is of the side of the Krasnapolsky Hotel. its within 200 yards of Dam Square. The Staff are OK, there is a resturant attached to the side of the hotel if you want food, there is a Vending Machine for soft drinks / beer / water. As for location you cant beat this hotel for the price, the hotel only has stairs, no lift. All in all i would stay again. Ideal for the 'just need a bed' person. dont expect a palace.

<Content>Good Central Location This hotel was very reasonably priced, it is right on Dam Straat just off Dam Square. The room was ensuite with wet room, which was basic but clean. The staff were always friendly although the stairs were steep.

<Content>Marginal Joint but good location Selected on price and location and that is what we got. Lower price than most in the area. Just on the outskirts of the Red Light District. Walkable to canels, musuems, train and many points of of interest. Not very clean , plus mold in bathroom. Needs remodeling throughout. If it was any worse we would have walked away. Front rooms can be noisy facing busy street. Front desk staff was courteous.

<Content>Horrible Experience They charged us extra for having a friend stay past the time of 12 am. Also they charged my credit card for cleaning charges which were unnessecary. They also only cleaned our room once during the five room stay.
