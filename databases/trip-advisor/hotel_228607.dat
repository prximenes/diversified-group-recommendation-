<Content>Good but not a 4 Star Nice clean hotel with friendly staff and good breakfast. However to my mind the rooms are small for a 4 star. Admittedly there is a balcony for the front of hotel bedrooms but in November not sunny after midday. Although near the beach the surrounding area is very quiet with little of interest. Bus No 41 stops nearby and takes you right into the hub of the shopping centre of Barca - Pl. Catalunya.

<Content>beware the neighbourhood The hotel is quite pleasant but is devoid of atmosphere.My wife and I walked from the metro-about half a mile. On the way a youth tried to grab my wife's backpack-luckily he failed but the experience was very unpleasant. The wonderful reception staff told us Barcelona is a very dangerous city but they kindly upgraded us to a suite.The hotel reception is below street level and there is a lift down from the street but it never worked for us.Breakfast is good value.One gripe-my visa card had to be swipped on 3 different occasions at reception-check out took ages.I feel this hotel is best suited to business types with self defense skills!!

<Content>A nice surprise! My friend and I stayed here for a few days in August 2008. After we had booked the hotel, we were a little concerned about the distance from the hotel to the city centre, but our anxieties were rapidly dispelled when we arrived. It is only a 10minute walk to the metro station (Poblenou) and then 20 minutes into the centre. Also, the hotel was practically on the beach, which was marvellous. This part of the beach was quieter than the more tourist orientated ones at Barceloneta and is very well set up: it is one of the few beaches we have been to where disabled people are actively catered for. The hotel itself is quiet, air conditioned and comfortable. The rooms/toilets are spacious and very clean. The staff were polite and knowledgeable. The breakfast was also very good, with a wide selection.Overall, we were very pleased with our find and would probably stay here again on our next visit.

<Content>A superb hotel Couldn't fault the hotel at all. Elegant design, spotlessly clean, welcoming friendly staff, large room, clean towels every day. Breakfast relaxed (until 11 a.m.) with extensive choice of fruits, cereals, hot and cold meats, eggs, breads and rolls. We really enjoyed our four nights there and would be happy to return in the future.One suggestion - provide a kettle with tea/coffee facilities in the room please (Spanish hotels in general don't seem to do this).

<Content>Nice place to stay I stayed here for a week. Nice hotel with some rooms facing the sea. There is a bus stop in front of the hotel, so it is very convenient to go to the city center. Metro is a little bit far though. Staff are quite friendly

<Content>Better than expected I had to go to Barcelona on business and my sister joined me as a tourist. I booked this hotel because during the period of our stay most of the central hotels were fully booked or were asking crazy rates (above 400 Euros/night), but I must say that I was a bit concerned after reading the previous reviews. It has been a nice surprise! Rooms size is acceptable even for 2 ladies spreading all their stuff around, same is the bathroom. Very clean with a maid always ready to leave us extra soap or towels. We also liked the wooden floor (much better than carpets that normally look dirty) and the opening window. Only negative point was airconditioning not adequate.Breakfast is fairly expensive if paid on site, so next time we'll try to get an inclusive rate because all the coffee shops around open late. We found the people at the front desk extremely nice and they helped us a lot with restaurant suggestions, public transport information, directions, and even allowed us to leave the car into the garage after we checked out.Garage was really a plus, safe place to park the car at a reasonable cost, instead of the packed streets around where you hardly find a parking and your foreign plate is catching the eyes.It is true that the hotel is not in the city center, but very close to the sea and a very short walk to the olympic port. We walked there and back at night without any fear. If you don't feel confortable at night you can always get a cab which is not expensive. The tourist bus stops around the corner and so is public bus n. 41 heading to Plaza Catalunya. A very positive experience

<Content>Near beach, long walk to metro. We booked the room for one night on our arrival to Barcelona. The hotel is located near the beach, about 20 min walk from the metro station.Room was good quality so was breakfast. Enjoyed my stay but next timeI visit Barcelona, would probably opt for a more central hotel.

<Content>Bad Service The hotel is a very long walk from the Metro Station.The food in the hotel is not very nice, my (hot) breakfast was cold, and they still charged me 15 euros.The internet computer was so slow, dont use it unless you really need too.The bed was very unformafortable and the room was dirty.The staff were very unhelpful at times, and there are no restaurant nearby, so stay in the city centre if you are dining.

<Content>Not great value This is an ok hotel, not great value for the price.This is last row of buildings across the highway from the beach, but perpendicular to the beach. Only a few rooms have beach front views. Free wifi was advertised but there was no signal, the staff wouldn't change the room for that. Friends changed their room because the room smelled.I understand the other comment that it is isolated - the nearest Metro is about 15 minute walk, the longest I've had in a Barcelona hotel. We also stayed in a small hotel near Diagonal, no views but clean, friendly, and conveniently located. So, I can't recommend this hotel for the location - it's only near the beach and most rooms don't have views. It's not well located to a Metro stop, and the price is the similar to other hotels near the beach with views or more conveniently located. It wasn't terrible but I wouldn't go back.

<Content>Clean, Quiet, Friendly, and Quircky Stayed 6 nights in the off season while going to a conference. The hotel is near the beach, very clean, well run, and the front desk staff are very friendly. It is a short cab or metro ride to the city center. A couple of quirks: there is no standard hotel entrance for this hotel. You pull up in your taxi, the street is packed on both sides with parked cars. The lobby is in the half basement, but you can see it from the street. Every time we pulled up in a cab, the cabbie was confused. The other quirk is that it is in a residential area. In the off season a lot of the restaurants and businesses are closed. ON top of that, the hotel restaurant is open for breakfast, but closed on weekends for other meals, and there is nevery anyone in there after breakfast. You can walk about a mile to a big shopping mall at Diagonal Del Mar near the Hilton if you wish. All in all, it was quite good, and I would recommend it.

<Content>Value for money It can be isolated for those without a car. We rented a car and was lucky enough to find a space to park every night. A nice clean, comfortable hotel with free internet access. Would choose something nearer to the city next time but wouldn't mind to stay here again for the packaged price we got last time.

<Content>Great Value hotel with quiet location this hotel is a really great quiet Hotel directly opposite the beach, the rooms are modern and clean with great buffet breakfast and attentive staff. Free WiFi is also availlable. The bus goes dirct into the city centre stopping at the main square of PL Catalunya.I have stayed here twice and can confirm that the level of service each time was the same high standard, great for a city break and beach holiday combined and so much quieter and relaxing than city centre hotels.

<Content>Happy Holidays!! We were not sure about this hotel after some of the reviews but you will not be dissapointed, Very friendly staff, give good recommendations about how to get to some of the attractions. Excellent bathrooms, Super Large comfy beds with a choice of a pillow menu. Bus stop right outside the door, Beach just across from hotel and there is a fantastic shopping and dinning area called Diagonal Del Mar just about 10 mins walk which caters for everything.All in all a very good Hotel and Barcelona is a fantastic place to see. Go and see the football team play if you can I have never expierenced anything like it if they are not playing then try and do a tour of the stadium Nou Camp it is brilliant. Happy Holidays!!

<Content>Fantastc, modern friendly excellently located Hotel!! Excellent hotel. 5 minutes to great beach.7 minutes to Metro station.20 minutes into the hustle and bustle of Barcelona City.10 minutes to port olympic and La Ramblas with all the night life.Friendly professional staff (on many occasions I notice reception advising visitors on good spots to go to)Great room,,many with sea views, modern and clean to a high standard.I laughed at previous bad reviews after my 10 day stay here and I am the most discerning travller as was my travel parter.Have a great stay if you do book here, I think it's much better than being in the city, taxi's are really cheap and it really is soooo close to the beach.HAPPY HOLIDAYS x

<Content>Good, quiet hotel We stayed 2 nights precruise and got this hotel from Priceline. This hotel was away from the hubbub of things but we did not mind at all. As previous reviewers have written, the bus stop is right in front of the hotel. We actually walked along the ocean to the pier restaurants and shops, which took about 30 minutes. The next day, we walked all the way (this took a couple of hours as we meandered through the different areas at various paces) to La Rambla. The staff is very nice and helpful. Only negative for us was we wanted a nonsmoking room but they did not have any available. Because the room is not carpeted, the smell was not bad at all.

<Content>Great place for those who worry I am always worried about where to stay when travelling, especially when travelling to an area for the first time. My husband and I stayed at this hotel on the second part of a Barcelona and cruise vacation. We had stayed at a hotel around the corner prior to our cruise but that hotel didn't have availability after our cruise. I booked this hotel as it offered a discount with a 3 day stay. I saved $100 for a 3 day stay from the first hotel (Hotel Atenea). What a difference from the first hotel! The staff at this hotel was extremely helpful. (Atenea staff didn't want to know me after check-in.) The rooms were clean. The hotel was immaculate. The breakfast was great. (Friends of ours who were able to rebook at the Atenea, came to our hotel for breakfast). Although pricey, we ate dinner there once (it was a rainy evening). The dinner was very good, although the English from our waiter wasn't that great, but we managed. The elevator down to the lobby wasn't obvious upon arrival, but is on the right, just inside the door. The bus touriste has a stop on the main street. It was an easy walk to the beach. It was about a 7 block walk to the subway - speaking for someone who is NOT physically fit, it was manageable, and relatively safe. We did avoid cutting through a park in the evening and stayed to the sidewalks. Internet access was available in English. Was extremely pleased with this hotel and would stay there again.

<Content>superb hotel After i booked this hotel i read some reviews and they almost made me cancel it. Im glad i didnt. The staff were friendly and helpful sorry very helpful, the room was spacious and clean and the bathroom was spotless. The location is great as you are 10 min walk to the olympic port. For 1.15 euros you can get the No41 bus outside the hotel and be in the centre of barcelona in 10 min in fact it is the same price for any part of the city.Thank you for a fantastic stay

<Content>Brilliant I looked at this web site before i went away and was very worried about staying in this hotel, after staying there i now realise that the Americans are very dramatic, and this hotel is actually lovely!! Me and my partner stayed here for 5 nights and are stay was a very comfortable one. Don't be put off by the distance to Barcelona as you can jump on a tourist bus right out-sdie the hotel which will take you right into the heart of Barcelona, this takes about 10 mins and the bus runs all the time. Not really that impressed with Barcelona it's self. It may be is for the older generation as there is not that much to do. But if you are going this is the hotel to stay in.

<Content>Free Wi-fi Went to Barcelona for work for 1 night and booked and 'package' on Expedia with car and flight. I found the hotel clean and professional, perfectly aimed at the business traveller, and was very impressed with the free wi-fi access.It was out of the centre but I didn't mind as I got a taxi to a bar showing the premiership, and next thing I knew it was 3am and I was stumbling out of a basement club!Barcelona is indeed a fantastic city!

<Content>Visit 26/03/05 For 5 Nights Stayed here and had some mis-givings about location and service ( having read previous views ) but found this to be a very pleasant hotel for the family.On the mostly positive sides, the hotel staff were very helpful  friendly, room service was very good, rooms/ bathrooms were spotless. Location-wise - yes, you're out of the city centre but the number 41 bus stop is less than a minute walk away and takes you to Placa De Catalunya for 1.5 euros and you rarely have to wait for more than 10 minutes.Getting to the beach means having to simply cross the road and you're there. Diagonal Del Mar is a ten minte walk away and hosts a large shopping centre with a plethora of restaurants and cafes - whilst just around the corner from the hotel is a local shop for your bottled water, crisps,etc.Breakfast is the only area for grumbling, in my opinion, really - whilst the quality is good, I did feel it was over-priced at 12euros PP ( including children) - but you could do as we did and get the bus into the city centre and have breakfast at any of the cafes . The bus ride to the Placa De Catalunya takes only about ten minutes. All-in-all, I'd definitely stay at this hotel again as you've virtually immediate access to the city centre but also reap the benefit of staying in a quieter part of Bracelona whilst having acces to the beach. i.e LOTS OF OPTIONS.

<Content>Good Hotel, not great though I got this hotel on priceline, so I can't complain about overpaying. The hotel itself was very nice. The lobby and rooms are very well done, and everything was quite comfortable and up to the standards of a 3 star hotel. The staff wasn't particularly friendly, but they weren't rude either. The hotel is rather far from the main tourist areas of town, which (to put a positive spin on it) was sort of nice because it felt more like you were in an authentic part of the city, but mostly it was anoying, and I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone lacking a car. The subway is a 10-15 minute walk away, and then its an additional 20 minutes to the heart of the city (although the trains are amazingly reliable). In short, adequate hotel, annoying location. If you get it on priceline, its do-able, but I wouldn't pay full price.
