<Content>Fantastic Hotel with excellent staff! This hotel is beautiful. On entry to the hotel you are greeted by staff who know how to provide customer service to a high standard.Myself and my partner were in Frankfurt for 3 days, being January it was really cold but the hotel and especially our fantastic room were very well heated. The bar is a pleasure to sit at, 1 thing though would be the cost of the drinks, too expensive.Breakfast was what I expected from the Germans, amazing and everything you'd want to eat. Restaurant staff very helpful, pleasant and eager to top up with drinks and coffee!All in all I would thoroughly recommend Hilton Frankfurt, my partner and I didn't really like Frankfurt so it was a pleasure to return back to the hotel.

<Content>Very nice other than the renovations! So I stayed at the Hilton Frankfurt in August '07 and it was nice. The atrium in the lobby is BEAUTIFUL! They were doing renovations when we were there which was absolutely horrible. Every morning at about 7am I would wake up to hard core drilling. It was terrible. I called the front desk to ask them to stop and they did until about 930. It wouldn't have been so bad if I wasn't so jetlagged! Other than that, the staff was pleasant, the rooms were pleasant, and the location was great!

<Content>Great hotel not far from the Christmas market We came to Frankfurt for a weekend break and to visit the christmas markets. This hotel was only about 15 mins walk from the market and about 1 min walk to the nearest underground station. The location for us could not have been much better.The room was on the 4th floor and very nice. I like having a separate shower. You can get all the English channels on the TV which is good. The only thing it lacked, if I were to be picky, was an iron and ironing board, though I'm sure we could have got one if we'd asked.We didnt have breakfast here as it was expensive, and I am a fussy eater so rarely get my money's worth from a buffet..The only negative I could find with this place, is the Asian bar. It was quite smoky... I'll be so pleased if/when they ban smoking in bars there, I hate to smell of smoke.If I were to ever go back to Frankfurt, I would have no hesitation in staying here again, or recommending it.

<Content>Good hotel, excellent location I went to Frankfurt on business and was pleased with the courtesy of the staff, the clean room and the excellent bed. My room was quiet. The central location is hard to beat. The breakfeast was good, I especially liked the fact that there was a wide selection of coffees. My only point of critcism would be that all this comes at a price.

<Content>If you like modern well run hotels stay here Stayed here with my wife from nov 1 thruough nov4. Standard room was above expectations, nice size,modern room and bathroom. Excellent buffet breakfast included in the rate. Most people seemed to miss that they would make eggs in the kitchen at your request. Watch out for some rooms facing the interior atrium but otherwise, excellent experience. Phone in the lobby did not take mci prepaid card but T mobile phones throughout the city did.Hotel was a 5 minute walk from the Hauptwache subway stop which was on the airport S8 or S9 subway line, cost 3.60 eu one way.(approximately 5 or 6 stops, no transfers,less than 30 minutes) Not only would I stay here again, I plan to.

<Content>Very nice hotel The hotel is situated on a couple hundred meters from the S-bahn (station HAUPTWACHE) and it is very easy to reach it from the main train station by underground. The hotel itself is like the other Hiltons a very nice hotel. The lobby is an atrium, with a bar and glass elevators to the floors: which is a spectacular experience. The room was perfect. It is a city hotel, so don't expect magnificent windowviews : you see the other buildings around the hotel. The service is perfect. I had dinner in the restaurant and choose the Malaysian menu (only a few days on the menu card). The food was very well presented and tastefull. The service was without remarks. The breakfast buffet had a large variety of everything and the quality was excellent. A good hotel to visit the Frankfurter fairs.

<Content>Bad Breakfast Hi, we've stayed at several Hiltons before, but never hat such problems during breakfast. Service was very slow, Quality of Breakfast Buffet wasn't really 5 star. Room was OK, but compareble to other hotels.

<Content>Great hotel I've stayed at the Hilton Frankfurt on two occasions. On the first, we were given a terrific room called the Hoover suite, which was beautiful, very clean, had a great bathroom and a fabulous view, especially beautiful at night. The room was very spacious and we decided to have dinner in and did not regret it; it was delicious. On the second occasion, we weren't as happy because the room, instead of having a window to the exterior with a magnificent view like I was expecting, had a window to the inner foyer of the hotel, which was very strange because I always felt like it wasn't very private and we had to keep the curtains closed at all times, day or night. This was very disagreeable. But I liked the hotel so much the first time around that I'll rate it only considering the first stay. Just remember to ask for a room that faces the outside of the building.

<Content>Great Hotel/Great Location I have stayed at the Hilton Frankfurt 4 or 5 times on both business  leisure and have found it a great hotel. Of course, as a Hilton HHonors Diamond member I've always been upgraded to at the very least an executive floor room and at best the Presidential Suite, so I know my opinion is a bit skewed. Although, with that said, every time I've stayed all staff members, from the front desk to the executive floor lounge, are consistently friendly, helpful, and competent. The hotel is also in an excellent location and if you're there during December, it is just a short walk to the Christmas market. Overall, it is an excellent hotel and my first choice for a hotel in Frankfurt.

<Content>nice comfy hotel in Frankfurt but noisy due to remodeling/refurbishing We stayed only for one night on a business trip, hotel is centrally located and the old city is not far, you can walk there..Lobby is nice with lots of glass and we had a room on the club floor so with club lounge access. The lounge is nice with drinks and snacks and the room was lovely too, except it was quite noisy from time to time because they are working on three floors a bit below the 21nd floor.We said when we checked out that we were woken up by the noise and the only reaction was: you should have called..as if that would bring us back to sleep??

<Content>Very Nice Hotel The rooms were very clean and comfortable. The staff was very friendly. The location is very good. In Germany, many shops and restaurants are closed on Sunday, and there are very few places to eat around the hotel. You are then forced to eat at the hotel, which is somewhat expensive.

<Content>Beautiful hotel, near everything, ice machines! Stayed at this hotel with my spouse for five days and it was great! There are no vending machines but there is an ice machine. A pants presser is in the closet, but I requested an iron and got one. I loved the huge shower, bath robe and Hilton bedroom shoes! Expect only two English speaking channels on the tv. No flat sheets on the bed, just duvets. The breakfast buffett is huge and excellent! Elevators are quick. Taxis are ready available. Non smoking rooms are available. Be sure you close your blinds at night...in June, the sun was up from 5am - 10pm! Internet is expensive, 30 euros per day. There is an internet cafe a block away called virus where it cost 1.50 euros for 30 minutes. A huge gym is within the hotel and is available to non-hotel guests. If you are a silver honors member, it's free...20 euros if you are only a Hilton blue honors card holder. Employees understand English. Check in/out was quick. When calling for a wake-up call, know how to tell military time. Clock radio hooks up to ipods, but the volume does not get very loud. Several shops are nearby. For a fantastic lunch/dinner, go to the high rise department store called Galeria Kaufhof. Their 7th floor has a huge buffet and you can eat outside and enjoy the view of downtown Frankfurt.

<Content>Fabulous Staff, Very Kid Friendly, Large Clean Rooms This hotel was very clean, modern and just steps from the main shopping and dining streets as well as adjacent to a lovely park and the cathedral.The staff was very helpful and accommodating. The hotel was kid friendly as we were traveling with a toddler and they provided a very nice travel crib as well! worth every penny and would highly recommend!

<Content>Great Location and Great Hotel Staff My adult son and I stay at this hotel beginning April 25 for 3 nights. The staff is excellent. Location is the best to walk to different area. We walked to Zeil Street which is the shopping area. Along the way there other places to eat. The Zeil area is also a place where you sit and people watch. We walked to the Opera House, the Romerberg Area. the city hall Market area which seem to have a festival each day we were in Frankfurt..There is a subway about half block from the hotel. My favorite is the park behind the hotel. I coul sit and read or stroll along the path way. Hotel can arrange tours for you. I enjoyed my stay at this hotel.The cost in euros from the airport to the hotel is between 27 and 30. Valet parking is 27 Euros. This hotel has all the extra you would need in a five star hotel.

<Content>Very modern and inviting hotel - love it This is a great hotel. It is very close to the center of Frankfurt and very modern and well kept. And I don't mean modern as in hip and spartan but a hotel that feels very new, well thought-out, well-built, and very inviting. The lobby is grand with the open atrium (with a piano player usually), but I really like the rooms. They have great desks for working, with very new and comfortable furniture. Everything in the room just feels brand new and polished and really well taken care of. And they have complimentary coffee and tea in the room, complete with a coffeemaker.I have stayed at other hotels in Frankfurt, but I think this is the best by far. No pretentiousness of the other high-end hotels, and all of the comforts of a great hospitable hotel.Other little things: a very good room-service menu even for late at night (if you arrive late), and a great health club.

<Content>best location ever for a sightseeing tour We spend 3 weeks in Germany and were travelling from Berlin to Cologne, Frankfurt and Munich. Munich was the most impressive city, but Frankfurt had the best accommodation of all. It was so nice to stay at the Hilton Frankfurt and there was so much to visit (we didn't expect this, when we planned our trip), that we extended our stay.

I even took my little kids to the restaurant, and we all had a great meal together! Overall it was just great, I can't wait to stay there again.

<Content>Always nice to be back . . . . After a week of touring Germany and Switzerland we stayed at the Frankfurt Hilton for the last two nights to see the city before leaving. During our trip, we stayed a local hotels in other towns that cost approximately the same amount as the Frankfurt Hilton. I must say, it's always nice to get back to a Hilton. For the same money we found our stay here to be the best. I remember feeling the same way a few years ago after traveling through Alaska and getting back to the Anchorage Hilton.I know chain hotels sometimes make us feel like we're missing the flavor of the city, and maybe it's me getting older, but this was my best stay of the trip. It was well decorated, the food was great, the service was excellent, I have no complaints.

<Content>Enjoyed the Hilton Frankfurt The Hilton Frankfurt is a very nice hotel. Its location is outstanding, within walking distance to the Hauptwache and plenty of restaurants. In addition, there's a U bahn station a few hundred feet from the hotel entrance that makes getting to the airport a breeze.The rooms are decent size, clean and nicely equiped. King bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was good size with nice walk-in marble shower. Shower water pressure was a bit weak.As a guest of the Hilton, you have access to an on-site health club and pool. This is a nice feature in comparison to other Frankfurt hotels.All hotel staff I encountered were friendly and helpful.I had the breakfast buffet the first morning of my stay. The buffet offers a variety of breakfast items and is comparable to most other hotel breakfast buffets. Nothing really knocked my socks off as being outstanding. At a cost of 31 Euros per person, I thought the breakfast buffet was ridiculously overpriced for what you get. During the rest of my stay I walked a block or two from the hotel and got a hearty breakfast for about 10 Euros.While the Hilton may be a bit pricey, its location and amenities make it an excellent choice in Frankfurt.

<Content>Better than expected Went to Frankfurt over the Christmas holiday with my family. Before booking, I was between the Hilton, Westin or Intercontinental. I went with the Hilton based on TripAdvisor reviews. I must say I am very pleased with how things worked out.The location of the hotel is great. Easy walking distance to plenty of shopping and food, and easy access to the train system. We took the train to the airport for our return trip, and it was very simple. Took about 30 mins, and only cost about 5 euro (vs 30-35 euro for a taxi).The hotel itself is very nice. I found the rooms to be bigger than most in Europe, and the bathrooms are far above average. Very large with a separate glass shower and whirlpool tub. Everything in the hotel was very clean and well kept.The staff at the hotel was OUTSTANDING. The front desk service (ask for Jennifer if you can find her) was as helpful as we could have asked. They helped arrange day trips, train schedules, and dining options. All of their choices were on the spot. I can honestly say you would be hard pressed to find a more helpful staff than what we experienced at this hotel. Few negatives: Everything you eat or drink in the hotel is EXTREMELY expensive. Think like 5 euro for a Coke, 29 euro for bacon, eggs and toast. My advice is just go out. So many places that are so close. Also, as you may have previously read, internet access is very expensive. Use it sparingly. All in all, this hotel was great. Check on the big sites, as they have pretty good rates available (under $150). I will definitely stay there again when I am in Frankfurt, and will recommend it to all my friends and family.

<Content>Good location for Xmas Market We stayed here from 13/12-16/12 to vist Xmas Market  was very pleased with the location. You can walk to the Market  Museums within 10-15 minutes. Our room was large  comfortable  we had a separate shower  bath. We booked though the Hilton website  paid 134 Euros per night for the room which we thought was good value. We ate breakfast (29 Euros per person) twice had no other meals at the Hilton as the food is so pricey. The Buffet breakfast was excellent but the restaurant struggled to cope with the number of diners on Sunday morning. We had a short wait to be seated, had to ask a waiter 3 times for coffee and there was insufficient cutlery on the table. When we checked out at 11.45 there was a long queue of people also waiting to check out  only 2 staff on reception. As noon is checkout time the hotel should have had more staff manning the desk between 11.15  noon to deal with the rush. Apart from this, we were happy with our visit.

<Content>Great Hotel Stayed in this hotel with a small group of friends in Dec- 4 ladies to be precise! Rooms were good size, beds very comfortable, bathrooms were large with every amenity.Breakfast was brilliant- buffet style  open from 6am to 11am at the weekend- so you could have a lie on! There was everything you could want  if they didnt have it you could ask the chef to make it. I ordered pancakes one morning  they were devine! We were full for the day after it!!! Hotel was only a short walk from old part of the city- about 10-15mins. We really enjoyed the christmas market in the old city- but there was a christmas market about 5mins from the hotel also. The one in the old city is much busier so mind your purses/wallets. The only downside to the hotel was that it was the food  drink was very expensive. We didnt eat in the restaurant ourselves prefering to go out-( Conrads is a great little restaurant with excellent steaks! Only 3-4mins walk from hotel) But we did have a look at the menu  drinks list in the bar. We had hot chocolates on our last night whilst waiting for the taxi-2 hot chocolates 鈧?. Maybe thats the norm in Germany???? All in all we had a great weekend  we were all very happy with the hotel- its location  the staff!

<Author>HiIslandsGuy
<Content>Popularity Has A Price As of this writing, the Frankfurt Hilton is rated #1 by Tripadvisor reviewers. Based on its rating, I booked a stay about a month in advance. But I discovered that popularity has a price. Hotels that run very full have less flexibility to honor guests' room requests. I am a Hilton Honors member and my preferences are listed in my profile, but I also informed the hotel that I'd like a quiet no-smoking room, preferably on a higher floor away from the elevator (not unusual or difficult requests.)When I checked in, I was given a room on the first floor, right off of the main lobby and 15 footsteps to the elevator. The room was noisy and smelled of cigarette smoke. I expressed my concern to the front desk and was told that I could get a room that met my preferences for an additional Euro 25/night.I pointed out that I was a Hilton Honors member, but was told that because I was only a Silver level member, I was not eligible for an upgrade. If the front desk had done a little preplanning based on guest preferences, they could have accommodated my request without having to upgrade me. But I was told the next day that Hilton Diamond and Gold reservations are assigned rooms the day before they arrive and everyone else is assigned they day they arrive to whatever rooms are left.I am posting my experience because I think guests should be aware that unless they have very high status in Hilton Honors, their room requests may not be honored whenever this very popular hotel is running a high occupancy. If your room preferences are important to you, you would probably be happier booking into a hotel that is not so busy and has greater flexibility in assigning rooms.

<Content>Breathtaking rooms Dear traveller,My wife and I stayed in this hotel from 8 th till 9 th of December with the same couple we went to Dusseldorf in June last. They are quite nice people (the Quadens) and we show them around so to speak. We booked this hotel after checking the reviews written before ... well, we definately recommend this hotel for 2 main reasons. First because its very nearby the centre/Altstadt/Weihnachtsmarkt and secondly because the breakfast, beds, service is just excellent. The only thing you should know is the fact that the Hilton hotel has 16 rooms with the view on the inside of the hotel ... the so called Atrium rooms. Be aware that these rooms have no windows to open! First they booked us in such a room, but we quickly asked for new rooms with windows which can be opened.Dear triplovers, the Heinles will absolutely recommend this hotel for short and long stays and we will book this hotel again!Have fun!The Heinles

<Content>So-so We were excited to stay, given the favorable reviews. Unfortunately, the hotel is little more than a 3 star business hotel. No charm, aesthetics or concierge, for that matter. Amazingly, the staff could not recommend a breakfast restaurant. Our own search--a five minute walk--revealed 3 fine restaurants within one block. This may have to do with the fact that the staff seemed listless and unhappy.To compound matters, the hotel charges exorbitant rates for internet, even in its business center or for its guests such as me that have achieved higher status due to their utilization of Hilton. I am a Diamond with Hilton, and have never experienced this. We found a small internet cafe a block away--next to one of the restaurants the staff was unaware of--that charged 1 euro as compaired to the 12 euros the hotel was requesting.The real issue is a lack of attention to detail. Prior to arriving in Frankfurt, we stayed at the Park Hyatt in Paris, where every possible detail was not overlooked. An example is the newspaper delivery in the morning. Despite my diamond status, which clearly identifies me as an American citizen, a German newspaper was delivered both mornings, despite my request when I checked in for American papers. This lack of thought was a consistent pattern during our stay.My recommendation would be to stay if you have a brief trip, and want to enjoy the abundant nearby shopping, but otherwise to shop around.

<Content>Deserves its accolades! What an excellent hotel - it well deserves its accolades. We booked this hotel purely on the recommendations of Tripadvisor and we were not disappointed. We had a small initial hiccup in that we booked a King bedded room and were given a twin room as they were full but the overall experience made this problem fade into insignificance. The ambiance of the hotel is first class, the room (we booked an executive) was great with a big bathroom, picture windows and modern, comfortable finishes. The Executive Lounge was open plan and also first class. The staff were brilliant throughout the hotel and couldn't do enough to help their guests. I would go as far as saying I found it difficult to fault anything with this hotel, even the Executive Lounge breakfast was first rate. Frankfurt Airport is a nightmare however, so allow plenty of time. A few tips! Firstly, don't go through security until it is absolutely necessary as once through it at Terminal 1, there is nothing other than the gates except a Frankfurter stall which sells bottled water and little else. Secondly, the local train to central Frankfurt is quick and cheap. Take the S8 or S9. Depending on which terminal you arrive at, you may need to take the free bus to the station. Get a ticket before boarding to the stop Hauptwache which is two stops after main station, the travel time is about 15 minutes. Exit Hauptwache station through the exit signposted Schillerstrasse and walk straight along to the end where you take a left turn. The Hilton is there immediately on the right. Without doubt, the Hilton is an excellent choice and if we were to return to Frankfurt we would have no hesitation is returning to this hotel . It was a great overnight stay!

<Content>I agree with everyone - this is # 1 I am a Hilton Hhonors member so expect good treatment in their hotels. I was not expecting the fabulous, welcoming treatment we got here. They kno\ew my name as I entered the hotel, showed us to our room on the Executive Level (this is important), and made sure that we knew that we had full use of the Executive Club, when we didn't want to be in our room. With breakfast, afternoon tea, and appetizers during the dinner hour, as well as any drink that you wanted to make, this was an especially nice touch. The hotel is beautifully appointed and the wait staff excellent. This is our third best stay in Germany/Austria, only overshadowed by the Bristol in Salzburg Austria, and Brenner Park in Baden-Baden, both of which upgraded us to suites.

<Content>Hilton Frankfurt is Great, Greater, Greatest! From the moment we arrived we were welcomed. The entire staff was so friendly. Though the hotel has a great location we decided not to go out on Saturday night but just enjoy the cocktails in the bar and a great dinner. We will definately go back to the Hilton!

<Content>Well managed The Hilton Frankfurt is a busy, bustling and very well run property, within walking distance to the business and shopping districts. I liked: Check in - efficient and very courteous staff. In fact, everyone in the hotel was very welcoming, from the very sweet staff at the bar, to the check in, busboys and housekeeping peeple. The room was very nice - large, excellent air con (quiet!), fantastic view (9th floor), good bed and well equipped bathroom with separate shower. Lufthansa auto check in in the lobby which was very useful, if complicated.Could be better: The decor is very corporate. No character but everything is well designed and thought through. Expensive internet connection - why????????? This should be in the room rate!! Breakfast is expensive and the dining room was full - had to eat outside and it wasn't a warm day. Better to have coffee and a bread basket in the room from the a la catre room service menu - with a 鈧? cover charge however. Overall, good hotel, spotlessly clean and very nice staff.

<Content>Friendly staff, impressive building In my opinion, the main advantage of Frankfurt Hilton is its location: it is in a practically walking distance from every major point of interest. Additionally, the subway is 50m from its entrance. The Hotel itself is a bit uneven, in that its interior is exceptional but the rooms (because of a mistake, I happened to see two of them) ought to be more luxurious to be in par with the asking price. I cannot say anything about the dinner or breakfast, as I didn鈥檛 opt for them. Finally I would like to mention the good impressions I left with from the people at the reception desk- especially Miss Annegret, whom I happened to deal with, was very polite, helpful and smiling.

<Content>Made my working trip a pleasure. Staff and room service were always very helpful. Staff very friendly. I speak no German and had no problems communicating with anyone. The rooms were just perfect. I stayed for 10 days on business, so I spent quite a bit of time here. Staying on the executive level was very useful in the morning before work and nice in the evenings for a nightcap. The internet connection was problematic, but it did work after some assistance. All in all everything was great!

<Content>Great start to a great trip. We began our 9 stop trip of Germany, Austria, Hungary, and the Czech Republic at the Frankfurt Hilton. We arrived from our flight at noon, and were immediatly shown to our deluxe corner room. The hotels location, food, and staff could not have been better. We ate dinner both nights in the hotel, and the park view made the experience very pleasant. The breakfast buffet was fantastic. I can't think of anything bad to write. The room was exactly like the pictures on the net.

<Content>Fantastic hotel! Stayed for two nights in dec 2006 for the christmas markets. Great location for the markets, only a short walk till you are amongst the stalls. The staff were very friendly and we were very impressed by the hotel reception area, the glass elevators were a centre piece. We were on the 8th floor and the views across the city especially at night were lovely. We were welcomed with evian water and fruit and biscuits which was nice after a flight. The room was very clean and lovely decor. The beds were comfortable also. We had the buffet breakfast both mornings and the choice was excellent as well as the quality of the food. I would not have one fault about this hotel, was a great stay and I'm planning on booking up for this year again!

<Content>They are the best! I walked up to the Hilton Frankfurt when rooms that I had at another Frankfurt hotel for me and my elderly parents turned out to be a disaster. We had driven for a few hours, were hot, tired and hungry. The front desk staff were exceptionally kind and helpful. They immediately secure 2 rooms for us and get everyone settled in and fed. They later worked with me to use Hilton Honors points to pay for both rooms and were trustworthy that I had enough points even though the Hilton Honors computers were down. They also arranged for a city tour for us and assisted with the return of our rental car. While a bit pricey by US standards, the hotel is worth it. Rooms are large, well lit, quiet and have great A/C. The beds are exceptionally comfortable with lots of pillow. The bathrooms are lovely and the showers have great water pressure. Our only ouch was the buffet breakfast. While extremely extensive it is quite expensive and there is no other a la carte options.

<Content>Nice Staff at Hilton Frankfurt Just returned from a 4 week stay at the Hilton Frankfurt where I had to stay while on project for my company. So, if you speak of having experienced the goods, I did! By the 3rd day, all of the staff knew my name and used it throughout. Going to Germany I didn't know what to expect but all of the people working in the hotel were really nice and made my stay all that more comfortable. Having worked long days at the office, coming back to the hotel, my temporary home, was quite important. The buffet breakfast is one of the largest I've seen on my travels, I did loose count on the different kinds of bread they have, fresh fruit, cold cuts, cheese, hot dishes, 5 kinds of fruit juices, fresh and bottled. You can either have a normal coffee or order a special coffee, go for the latte machiatto, included in the price! The Asian Bar makes for a nice change with sushi and sashimi, try the mixed platter, it's heaven. As for restaurants in the area I can recommend the Neue Volkswirt. I also did a boattrip on the Main for 2 hrs, great to relax on the deck of the boat with a beer and a snack, you even get some cultural background from a recording that plays back while you go past the sites, the english version is quite funny. Thanks again to Hilton Frankfurt for my home away from home! Greetings Caroline

<Content>They gave us Evian instead of showers When I first learned that the lack of water pressure in my shower was not unique to me but an experience supposedly being shared by the rest of Frankfurt, I thought that the offer of bottles of Evian to help satisfy my bathing needs was a thoughtful touch. When none of my colleagues in our office had heard of a water outage, I began to feel silly as well as clammy. I may never know exactly why the showers failed that day, but the hotel didn't feel compelled to offer any concession beyond the Evian (chilled, at that), and if it was in fact their fault that's a real disappointment. If not, I certainly hope they are better prepared in the future.Apart from this minor debacle, cleared up by the time my clammy colleagues and I returned from our meetings in the afternoon, I have good things to say about this Hilton. The rooms were newly refurbished, the staff were at their peak of Teutonic efficiency, and the chocolate bar (forget just a single square, I mean the whole 200g) on my desk was delicious. The executive floor breakfast was a shade underwhelming, but this is after all the home of the Continental breakfast.If you bring sponge bath material in your suitcase, you'll have nothing to fear and lots to like about the Hilton Frankfurt.

<Content>Very Nice Hotel We stayed at the Hilton our first night in Gemany. Even at the end of our two week stay, staying in various hotels throughout Germany, the Hilton was our favorite. I did not properly appreciate the ice machine on our floor until after staying in other German 4 and 5 star hotels where you could only get ice by going down to the bar. As mentioned in previous reviews, the breakfast buffet is excellent. We enjoyed the fresh squeezed OJ and the large variety. If breakfast isn't included with your room, it costs about 30 euros per person (about $40 with today's conversion rate). Be aware that the Hilton is located on Hochstrasse (strasse is street) which is a one way street running east. Also, that street changes names often. Check out mapblast.com for details. Of course there are pedestrian only streets and plenty more one way streets in Frankfurt, so order a map before you go.

<Content>Excellent value Huge reception, even bigger attrium enclosing coffee bar / longe area with leather seats  sofas. Really funky seperate bar decorated oriental style service drinks and food. Service at reception very good indeed, receptionist accomodated request for low floor then gave excellent advice regarding getting out and about in frankfurt. Room modern, spotlessly clean, average size, batroon had bath and very large walk in shower. Buffet breakfast superb, shown to table immediately, very professional. Overall we were made to feel that nothing too much trouble from the very polite, smiley, professional staff, a home away from home. ONE slight dowside - mini bar, bar, cafe bar drinks very expensive increasing the final bill quite significantly however, you dont HAVE to buy the goods on offer so the choice is yours! Highly recommend.

<Content>Another favorable review Great location, nice hotel with all of the amenities.I think this is one of the nicest European Hiltons.The location is really close to the downtown shopping area and only a 10-15 minute walk to the Romerplatz (city hall and historic center). There is a Metro station 1 block away and the central train station was only a 5 Euro cab ride away. Cabs in general are reasonable so even the further destinations such as the Apfelwein taverns in Sachsenhausen (across the river) aren鈥檛 too expensive. The hotel seems really new and modern, with a huge open atrium in the middle (not the best for those with a fear of heights!). The beds are very comfortable with nice mattress and pillows, and a sheet-covered comforter. Bathroom had a separate shower and a nice big bsathtub, with plenty of big fluffy bath towels. My room was comfortably sized, with more than adequate space to hold the king bed, desk, chair and table, as well as the rack for my luggage. Room also had a minibar, electric kettle, wireless internet (for a fee), and the other standards. Breakfast buffet is fantastic, especially the selection of great German breads (the fig rolls were amazing) and pastries, yogurts, hot food, fruit, etc.We had dinner in the restaurant one night and even though it was a bit expensive the food was very good, in modern continental style (the soups were superb). Avocado Bistro, right across from the hotel, was also excellent.

We arrived late at the hotel and we were welcomed with a warm smile. Since check in the service level was maintained in all areas: Concierge, executive lounge, bar, etc. We will certainly come back. PS: Great atrium and rooms !

<Content>Spoiled at Christmas We went to spend Christmas in Frankfurt to visit family. The overall stay at th Hilton was wonderful. The rooms were in perfect state and had many little features which made them special and different. On Christmas night and on Christmas day the hotel had organized special meals (a 5 cours menu and a brunch). All the food was absolutly wonderful. We had way too much of it. But also during normal meals like breakfast everything was very enjoyable. Specially breakfast since it is a very big buffet with a lot of choice. We had two little children with us (a 1 and a 3 year old) but the staff was always very helpful - whether we needed something special to eat for them or they were just running through the lobby not behaving particulary civilized. We never got the impression we were bothering the staff or the guests. We also took them to swim to the wonderful and huge swimming pool, which the children enjoyed very much. Even here the children were made to feel comfortable and welcome even though they did not really do anything to help the relaxing and quite atmosphere that swimming pool has. All in all it was a wondeful and very special Christmas for us all!

<Content>Always great to stay at the Hilton It's been a pleasure again to be a guest at the Hilton Frankfurt. I spent 2 nights there for christmas 2005 and a weekend in November 2006. I got upgraded to a beautiful Corner Room with a georgeous view at the Frankfurt Skyline. We really enjoyed a huge and very tasty american breakfast buffet!! There's food available for any tastes, orange juice and coffee are free and you can drink from it as much as you want to. In contrast to many other business hotels, the Hilton Frankfurt kept its charming atmosphere, friendly people and professional staff. I can recommend a stay at the Hilton Frankfurt to anybody. Business travelers, families, singles and couples. Enjoy your stay!

<Content>Excellent Weekend at the Hilton Frankfurt We stayed at the Hilton Frankfurt for a weekend with some friends and enjoyed it thoroughly. Had a room on the Executive Floor (topfloor) with lovely views of the skyline of Frankfurt. The Executive Lounge was great, both the very nice Team up there and the ambiance, with always something to eat or drink...well worth the extra money!!Location of the Hilton is very good, a couple of minutes walk and you are in the shopping district (and the x-mas markets in this case)...Had the brunch on Sunday, very popular apparently with the locals and it was very good... All in all, very nice Team throughout the hotel, good service, good food, nice relaxed atmosphere...ideal for a w'end.

<Content>One of the best hotels in Frankfurt The location of the Hilton is perfect, just a few minutes walk from the Old Opera, the underground station, the shopping and banking areas.The rooms are spacious, modern, nicely decorated, clean, and have a large desk and a large bathroom. Half of the rooms are overlooking a park. The breakfast buffet is great, and the service is very friendly and efficient.I would definitely stay there again, although the prices tend to be rather at the high end.

<Content>Great hotel in Frankfurt We have just returned from the Hilton Frankfurt/Main. The location in Frankfurt is superb, adjected to the financial/banking and shopping district including a nice park behind the hotel. The view from the elevators in the lobby over the Frankfurt skyline is magnificent. Especially during the night, the view over the lights in the city is just great. We were given an upgrade to a Junior Suite with a very spacious living room and separate bedroom. Again, from the suite the view over the city was fantastic. The bathroom was very big with a separate shower and bad. For our 15-month old daughter they hotel had prepared a save baby bed and a teddy bear was waiting in her bed (present). Furthermore a VIP treatment (fruit  water) and pre-Christmas cookies where awaiting us. The possibility to use the relaxing Executive floor with its complimentary breakfast and food  beverage during the day was very generous as well.All in all we definitely would like to recommend this excellent Hilton hotel down town Frankfurt and are looking forward staying there again.

<Content>Perfect Xmas Market Hotel We decided to go to Frankfurt to visit the Christmas Markets as we had heard alot of good about them.I got the Hilton on a cheap deal through work as i work for a travel company. I could not fault the Hotel one bit. Its about 250m away from the main underground station that takes you to and from the airport on Train number S8 or S9. It was 100m away from all the xmas markets and food stalls, and even had a few bars and restaurants within walking distance too! We had a big double room over looking the central park which was nice. The Bed was huge with very comfey Cushons and quilt! ... I couldnt wake up the nxt morning! Bathroom was bigish, it had a bath and a big walk-in shower with a glass panal door that could fit at least 3 people in! (not that you'd want to like! ... but you get my drift!) Best of all though was the Buffet Breakfast in the morning......WOW it was good! They had everything you could imagin and it was always hot and loads of it. Really nice! Room service was good, came within 10-15mins of ordering, and all the staff were happy and pleasant.I wouldnt suggest to buy a drink in the Bar part though as its very expensive! We had 2 Vodka's and Coke and it came to around 40Euro's just for that!Overall we enjoyed our stay there, and will deffo stay there again if visiting Frankfurt!Hope this review is good for you, if you need to know anything else don't hessitate to email me. Cheers!

<Content>Great staff at the Hilton Frankfurt Some hotels are excellent becuase of their service. The service in this hotel truly make the difference. After having a sencere warm welcome you don't mind the pink walls in the lobby anymore. It is quiet a large hotel, but I felt like every team member knew my name. I felt at home. The restaurant has an awesome breakfast buffet, too!!My room had a fantastic view over the city and -also important- the bathrooms had a good size (I hate small bathrooms, as I am always in a hurry in the morning).Hilton Frankfurt - next time definitely again!

<Content>Always a pleasure to stay at a Hilton I'm a frequent Hilton traveller (business). Location of this one is very good, you can walk into town/banking area. Next to the hotel is a nice park so try to get rooms overlooking that one. Rooms modern and stylish, european style rooms, good size, very consistently decorated, nice bathroom, of course very clean. Great view from my room (park - high floor)Wonderful breakfast as usual at Hilton (can't beat Cologne though). Very pleasant and proactive staff.Bewere though, there are 2 rooms on each floor I'd never want to stay in: next to the elevator, overlooking the hallways. You'd have to stay with the curtains drawn all the time cause people would stare in. Acceptable only in times of extreme room shortage (book fair).Room prices vary a lot, I've paid over 200 on a business trip but they can also be much higher or lower depending on the trade fairs/events in Frankfurt. Good value for me is under 200.

<Content>Modern, and luxurious I stayed two nights in this hotel and it was faultless. My room was excellent and very clean. The bathroom was lovely - bath plus big marble shower cubicle. Excellent Crabtree and Evelyn toiletries and nice touches like cotton wool and emery boards.I used room service for my food and my steak was so good that I had it both nights. The food arrived promptly, and it was obviously freshly cooked and very hot.This is a premium priced hotel, but it gives a premium service and I could not fault it.

<Content>Good Hotel-Good location Stayed a family of four at the Hilton. We arrived to find our reservation had been cancelled. They had the right name but wrong country listed for us. They were quick to find us a room with a cot for the 12 year old but the six year old shared our bed. The room was quite small and the bathroom (WC) was beautiful. One downfall was arriving a bit late for breakfast and was told to come back at lunch. They were beginning to clear the breakfast buffet and we asked to have some fruit for the small children. We tried to even get some bread but the staff literally were reaching over us and scrambling to take the food away. They charged us for this breakfast even though we never had a chance to have it. They were very unsympathic towards us as we had arrived the night before from Canada and we were experiencing jet lag (6 hour time change).I thought they at least would have strived to feed the children. The hotel is located across the street from the Zeil and wonderful shops. The subway (underground) is about 25 feet away from the front of the hotel. The staff here was excellent especially the kind lady at the cafe bar and the front desk staff. I would probably stay here again but would look at other hotels first.

<Content>Problems providing even the basic necessities........... They must have been having a shortage on linens, because despite several calls to the front desk, they couldn't seem to provide washcloths for the room. Someone else in the same party had the same problem with towels - he received no towels at all  ended up having to use the bathmat for a towel. Was looking forward to charging up an American cell phone, seeing as this hotel had a 110 outlet, but the outlet had no power to it! Difficult finding a somewhat fluent English speaking staff member. One would expect at least the basics from a Hilton brand. However, one good thing is that the food was good.

<Content>Best Hiotel in Center of City I stayed 4 nights in March 2006 at the Hilton Hotel in Frankfurt, Germany. It was my first time in Frankfurt. I also do not typically stay at Hilton Hotels as I am a Platinum Level Member with Starwood Hotels. I rate the Hilton Frankfurt as superior. Location is the best, service is outstanding from the bellboys to the front desk staff to the fitness center staff to the concierge lounge on the 11th Floor. That lounge is open all day and serves scrumptious food at breakfast and dinner, plus free alcoholic drinks. Views from each outside room in the hotel is spectacular, as is the design of the hotel itself with a huge atrium, and one side of the hotel all glass to view the Old Opera House, which is illumiinated at night. Oh, and everyone of the staff spoke English fluently. I definitely will stay at the Hilton Frankfurt again.

<Content>A real rip off I stayed here for Frankfurt Book Fair. Room rates were jacked up to 580 Euro a night. Location is good, but the rooms are very average.My business partner and I went down to the hotel restaurant for a cup of coffee one morning. They added $26 EU each to our hotel bill - that's almost $70!! - because there was a breakfast buffet. When I discovered the charge upon checkout, I explained to the staff that we only had coffee, but they were unwilling to take it off the bill.Upon return, I e-mailed Hilton asking for at least a partial refund, but got no response. Most expensive cup of coffee i ever had!

<Content>Excellent Frankfurt choice This is a very nice business hotel. It caters to Americans, and the Atrium lobby and bar are friendly places. The rooms are modern, a little on the small side, but with nice touches. Compared to the Frankfurter Hof, the Hilton is the better choice. Although the Hof's rooms can be larger(only on request) it has the air of an aging European hotel. The public areas are compartmentalized and not inviting. The staff at the Hof are formal and aloof, compared to warm and helpful at the Hilton. The Frankfurt Hilton is much nicer than any U.S. Hilton and is a good choice.
