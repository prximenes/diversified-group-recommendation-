<Content>Nice Hotel, Not Quite Ritz Carlton Standards The RC in PHX is a very nice hotel. The appearance is quite nice (looks like any other high rise hotel) from the outside. The lobby was decorated for Christmas beautifully. My arrival and check in was very good. Front desk was polite and addressed me as Mr... Upon arriving in the room, I found it to be somewhat below typical RC standards. The room was a smaller room (king bed) with a Mountain View (read as view of shopping mall accross the street and driveway into the hotel). The room was very clean, but the bathroom was VERY small, as compared to other RCs. All of the appropriate amenities were there, except shampoo. I had to call to the front desk to get shampoo after I was all ready in the shower and couldn't locate any. They had given be 2 bottles of shower gel, but NO SHAMPOO. I thought that this was really not up to their standards and should have been checked prior to my arrival. During my 4 night stay, we were having lunch one day in a meeting room and asked for some additional Tuna sandwiches. The meeting room attendant left and came back to tell us that there was no more Tuna! These were grilled Tuna steak sandwiches, how could a Ritz Carlton (that has a sushi bar in the main restaurant) run out of Tuna. I proceeded to go downstairs to the restaurant after our meeting and saw pleant of Tuna at the sushi bar. I was quite disappointed by the hotel to tell me that they ran out of Tuna, just because they didn't want to be bothered with making another sandwich. The balance of the stay was good. The club bar is quite nice and the staff is very attentive. There are also excellent restaurants within walking distance (Mortons, Houstons, Capital Grille). While staying there, we did see several celebrities as guests. We saw Charles Barkley in the bar, Marley (of Marley and Me) was a guest (yes the dog), and AC/DC was staying there as they had a concert during our stay. All in all, this is a very nice hotel. The rooms and bathrooms are small (and in my opinion not quite up to normal RC standards). The service is generally good, but not quite up to the typical RC standard of anything for the guest.  The beds are great (very comfortable) and the meeting rooms were appointed very nicely. I must say that I would stay here again and without much work the hotel could be truly excellent, not just good. I'm just not sure that is what they appear to be after here.

<Content>Excellent as a Ritz should be This was a weekend getaway stay on the Club Level (Tina Turner was just down the hall as she was in Phoenix for a concert appearance). As to be expected of a Ritz, the service was outstanding, from the greeting of the valet to the concierge on the Club. The food during club services was always beautifully presented and you could ask for what you didn't find.The rooms are a touch on the smallish side, but great furnishings and ammenties, and a very comfortable bed. Two turn down services were provided with good attention to detail (filling ice buckets, replacing towels, prepping coffee area, etc.).The evening before departure I was called to ask if I needed anything to prepare for the next day, such as boarding passes, airport transportation, etc. Another nice touch!

<Content>Club is great! We stayed here for 3 nights in club and although the rooms are on the small side and showers lack any real power it was Jean and Joyce,the concierge, that made our stay here more than comfortable. They arranged everything from reservations in the best restaurant in the South West (Binkley's) to a hot air balloon ride over the desert, they just could not do enough! The Club lounge is exactly as a lounge should be, full of great food and masses of free drinks all through the day and more information about the area than you can shake a library at. Would highly reccommend, but only in club.

<Content>Club Level was fantastic You can never go wrong with the Ritz. They have such amazing attention to detail. The Club Level here was very nicely done. There were several presentations throughout the day with a tremendous number of choices. If you can upgrade to this level, it's well worth it. Cocktails, wine, champagne are always available so you'll save a small fortune on drinks. The location is a bit odd as it's across from a mall and next to an office building. Sitting at the pool loses a bit of its charm because of the surroundings. Overall, it's a great place to stay.

<Content>Exceptional Service Work brought me to Phoenix and I decided to stay at the Ritz this time. There is always a good feeling when being warmly greeted by the valet and again the doorman. Registration was very smooth. The lobby had a feeling of grandeur. The room was very nice, not necessarily new, but clean and comfortable. The pool and fitness facility are small and don't have views, so if you're looking for these amenities, you might prefer a different resort. My colleague and I did not eat at the restaurant, although it looked very inviting and I heard it has a good reputation. There are other good restaurants (and shopping) nearby, including the mall across the street. I think the last time I had experienced such warm and genuine service was when staying at the Ritz on Central Park. The Ritz brand is in a class of its own!

<Content>Great service but there are better options in Phoenix I was attending a conference at this hotel and so I decided to book a room out of convenience. The Ritz-Carlton is a nice hotel that is starting to show its age. For the money there are just better resorts out there, with more amenities. The value is just not there, yes the service is still excellent but this small hotel just provides, at best, average amenities like its restaurant, gym and pool. The RC still provides the excellent service it is known for but why settle here when you can get so much more elsewhere.

<Content>disappointed We went for a convention and were sadly disappointed. When we walked into the room, a hugh stain greeted us on the carpet. Generally run down. There was no spa...had to go across the street to Merle Norman. Food was good, not great. Concierge not very helpful, but doormen always polite and friendly. Not worth the money! We left and went to Sedona!

<Content>Great first experience with Ritz! I had read some unfavorable reviews of the Ritz in Phoenix before I went, so my expectations were low. I am happy to say they were unfounded. The hotel was beautifully furnished and the service excellent. I especially was pleased with the front doormen and valets. They were always smiling and helpful. The hotel is located right across the street from a fabulous outside shopping mall, and there was a walkway underneath the highway so you never had to worry about crossing the street! I was there for a conference which had breakfast provided daily so I never ate at the restaurant, nor ordered room service. One night, we ate at Donovan's and had leftovers which we stuffed into the mini-fridge. The next day, we asked for a microwave to be brought up and it was---promptly! Overall, it was a great experience, and it definitely will be difficult going back to the less expensive hotels from now on!

<Content>Great, solid hotel I stayed at this hotel for business, and this is also the first time I have stayed at a Ritz-Carlton. Service is impeccable. Everyone is incredibly courteous and remembers the tiniest details and your preferences. But of course, that's the Ritz-Carlton. The valet, bellman, people who checked you in, concierge, housekeeping, servers, everyone was so nice! The room was neat and clean. Bath products were great and smelled good. Turn down service included chocolates and water. I liked getting 2 bottles of water every night because you get so thirsty when traveling. The bed was soft and comfortable. Workout room was pretty good with two ellipticals, 4 bikes, lots of treadmills, and weights. Water and towels were provided. Headsets were provided so that you could watch TV while working out on the cardio machines, but sometimes, there were not enough headsets, so it's best to bring your own. The valet were great at helping with driving directions and telling you the best and quickest ways to get places. Business center was small with 2 computers with fairly decent internet connection and printer. There was also another computer designated to print out boarding passes. The hairdryer busted the first night I was there and the housekeeping staff was quick to replace it with a new one. The restaurant is good. I ate breakfast there twice. Service is great, and portions are smaller than most other restaurants. The guests at the Ritz-Carlton seemed to be the typical guests, wealthy retirees who expect great service and attention to detail. Great hotel with impeccable service.

<Content>Perfect business hotel in Phoenix Just returned from a business trip where I spent 2 nights in Phoenix at the Ritz Carlton. After staying at other, more spa-like Phoenix hotels in the past year, it was a pleasure to be at a hotel that so thoroughly pampers and caters to business travelers. From the moment I arrived in a taxi to the moment I left for the airport, each and every staff member I encountered offered any assistance they could provide to make my trip more productive and stress-free. And, while to a person, they were terrific, none was more excellent than the concierge, Gail Daugherty. What a great person to have on your side to make a road warriors's life easier. I had to make difficult to get dinner reservations at a top restaurant for an important client dinner and she not only took care of me, but called to tell me everything was set up and then after, to check and make sure everything went smoothly. Kudo's to the Ritz management for hiring such an impressive concierge. She truly made me feel that nothing was too big or too difficult for her to accomplish.As far as accommodations, the rooms were typical Ritz Carlton, lots of traditional furniture, very comfy beds and marble bathrooms. While not as up-to-date in style as other hotels (plasma TV's, CD players, etc.,) the rooms were perfectly comfortable with more than adequate room to work and relax.I know that others will prefer newer, hipper properties when they go to Phoenix, but when I have to be there on business, you'll find me happily esconsed at the Ritz Carlton.

<Content>Nice Business Hotel with terrific staff I had a business meeting here and stayed at the Ritz-Carlton Phoenix for 1 night only. The staff has def. made a lasting impression. Everyone was so friendly and willing to help with anything at all times. Had lunch in the Bistro which was very delicious. Drinks in the lounge call The Club is very cozy with leather chairs and couches. Although this is a great hotel, I would have to stay it is your standard Ritz-Carlton Hotel in the sense nothing to me tells me i'm in Phoenix once I'm in the hotel. I would not reccomend this hotel for anyone taking a vacation as the pool looked small and it is on a busy street with no golf, tennis etc but for someone coming in for business like myself, this is the perfect spot. I've stayed at the Phonecian and Four Seasons Scottsdale and these are great choices for someone coming to Arizona for a little RR.

<Content>Good business Hotel I had stayed at this hotel for a quick business trip. The hotel is perfect for business travelers. Very nice and fancy hotel. Rooms were on the smaller side though. Food was pretty good. Location was ok. Some shopping plaza's and a limited amount of eateries were around. All in all, I'd stay here again

<Content>Nice Hotel We spent 3 nights at the Ritz and had a very nice stay. We had an executive suite which had plenty of room for us (2 adults, 2 young children). The room was clean and had decent fixtures (tv's were dated). We also had club privlages, even though we were not on the club floor. The service was excellent during our stay. Everybody was friendly and professional. The hotel is in a central Phoenix location and access to main roads is a breeze. The hotel was clean, except for the pool area which had cigarette butts all around it (hard to criticize the hotel and not the disgusting, thoughtless cigarette smokers). The pool was odd in that it was so small. You would think they would expand it ? The misters were nice, when they were on. One note on the club level - it was mediocre compared to other Ritz club levels in terms of presentation and decor (not bad, just not the best).

<Content>Good Location! This Ritz is well located on Camelback in Phoenix. for what tht's worth, Camelback is an endless array of shopping malls. The value to that is that you can drop your rental car there without getting hammered by the hotel valet.The rooms and foyer to the Ritz have a slightly off-putting faux-European feel to it which is an odd motif for a desert city. Nevertheless, the rooms are vastly discounted to under $100 in the height of the heat. The hotel is in easy proximity to several decent restaurants and lounges. The rooms are small but clean with extras and it's quiet.Further, if you know just a little of Phoenix, it's a nearly straight shoot from the airport rental car to Camelback, giving tourists easy access to this hotel.

<Content>A so-so, worn-out Ritz I stayed at the Ritz for a business trip and left quite underwhelmed. The lobby is beautiful, the service was great, but the room itself was disappointing and in need of a makeover. The furniture was worn and starting to look a bit beaten up, the towels were thin and worn, the bathroom showed signs of rust in various places, the bathtub's coating was peeling in several spots, the TV was old and didn't work very well, and the room service food was nothing special. I expected much, much more from a Ritz property.

<Content>Lovely hotel in boring location Our organization's conference at this hotel went beautifully. The hotel staff were most eager to make the event a success. At all times the level of competence and courtesy were beyond reproach. As for dining, the room service was very good, and the Bistro 24 restaurant even better. Bar drinks were wonderful but overpriced as in most posh hotels.My room was a tad on the small side but perfectly comfortable, with a dreamy bed, comfy armchair and ottoman, capacious desk, and two extra chairs. The bathroom was a white marble dream and the Bulgari toiletries were delightful. And those Frette sheets and down pillows were just delicious!The hotel is clearly intended for business travelers. The pool is a quick-dip affair, not a resort-style place to spend the day. There is a large but fairly ordinary mall across the street (Macy's, Chico's, etc.) with several restaurants, of which I tried only one--Sam's, which was mediocre. The location is pretty boring. If there's a soul or spirit to Phoenix, you won't find it close to the R-C.

<Content>Phoenix Ritz is nothing Special I stayed at the Ritz Carlton Phoenix for business. The rooms are nice, the beds are comfy, and the hotel has the Ritz service I've come to expect. The drawbacks: 1) the pool itself is very small and felt overcrowded with 5 people in it, 2) there were no refreshments or drinks in the bar area dispite the hotel advertising a pool bar, 3) the hotel restaurant is very expensive (a bagel with cream cheese is $3, side of bacon $4, and an iced tea $3), 4) the business center only has 2 computers, which were always occupied, 5) the concierge was not knowledgeable about hiking and other activities in the area, 6) the hotel is in an urban setting bordered by office buildings, condo buildings, and an nearly 75% vacant Biltmore Fashion Park.Bottomline, if you are visiting Phoenix for business, this hotel will serve you just fine. If you are planning a family vacation or a romantic vacation, choose another hotel.

Pool roof top , square and boxy and fitness area small and tight. Hotel across the street from nice outdoor mall with nice dining. The beds are luxurious, fluffy and beautiful.

<Content>We give the bar an A+, the rooms just a B The Ritz Carlton provided excellent service and a comfortable, but nothing special, room at an expensive price. The only word that I can think of for our room and bathroom is standard. Don't stay here if you're looking for a hotel stay that will wow you. I always thought the Ritz should stand out as special, but it doesn't here. The bar had a great atmosphere, very country club feel, with excellent service.

<Content>Enjoyed our second stay here We stayed March 15-18 and this was our second vist here. I like the hotel and love Ritz Carltons - we try to stay at them wherever they are, unless there is a property that interests us more. I like the location, which is central, and love the proximity to shopping and restaurants. My husband attended a cardiac conference and the hotel handled that meeting well he thought -- it was not a large meeting. I do wish the pool was larger, and that there was more than one person on duty to help with towels and get drinks. Also there aren't enough chairs -- that becomes a problem when you've got a full house and folks looking to spend some time outside - we had gorgeous weather and while my husband golfed I took the opportunity to relax in the sun after a full morning of emptying his wallet.The fitness room is small and I found the treadmills full each morning, but was so glad to be able to run outside as there are plenty of safe routes. I especially loved that jasmine was blooming everywhere and that heavenly scent was worth running outside in that gorgeous dry morning air. Love the lobby bar and the live jazz duo was wonderful! I'd have stayed there all night if we didn't have dinner reservations!We will likely attend this conference/meeting again in the future, and I'll look forward to returning to this property. Staff was very friendly and the rooms were lovely and very clean.

<Content>Disapponited As a frequent business traveller, I really look forward to stay in nice hotels when poosible and was really looking forward to the RC in Phoenix. Unfortunately I set my expectations way too high. My room was not that different from a Holiday Inn or Hilton. Service was polite and the staff do try to mae your stay pleasant, but there is little they can do about the physical layout of the hotel.ROOMThe room I had on the club level, was very small. Bed was nice with good bedding. Regular TV, 24 inch (no flat screen?) with very limited cable. Standard shower/bath could use an upgrade. CLUB LEVELVery disappointed. The offerings were sparse, when they ran out, which they did, that was it. When I asked the host what the offerings were, she described them as chicken or fish. I felt like I was on an airplane, non-descript generic offerings. If you stay here not sure it is worth the extra cost for club level.LOCATIONNot far from the airport and great if need to be in Scottsdale. Mall across the street with places to shop/eat, etc..

<Content>Great Service The Ritz Phoenix was a great hotel with outstanding Ritz Service. The hotel is located outside of downtown Phoenix near an upscale mall, suburban office buildings and upscale chain restuarants nearby, Morton's, Houston's, Capital Grill etc. The room was pleasant and average for a Ritz. The toilet in my bathroom ran but was fine with the door closed. Valet parking was $24/night and I did not see anyplace where I could self-park. Overall, I would stay here again.

<Content>Expected more... I spent one night at this hotel with my wife on our way back from Sedona (Stayed at Adobe Grand Villa, loved it!) and was kind of disappointed. I have stayed at the Ritz at Laguna Nigel and was really unimpressed with this resort. Here are my thoughts...Room: The bed was comfortable as expected. However, the furniture in the rooms looked old and worn out. Also the A/C and heater unit kept malfunctioning. The heater would come on at the wrong time and the room became all toasty. We called the front desk who sent a repair man to fix it. They stated that the fuse needed to be changed. Amenity: The workout room was very small. They crammed a bunch of tredmills next to some free weights. It was kind of crampedService: They were kind enough to wave our parking fee after I complained about the heater. However, my wife left her favorite pillow there and we asked them to ship it back. They offered to do it for $30. I thought that was kind of absurd.All in all, I think you can find a better place to stay in Phoenix. However, I got a great deal online and thus would only stay there again if I got the sam deal.

<Content>Solid choice for a non-resort It deserves mention first off (because one might not know by looking at the hotel website) that not only is this not a resort, but there are no grounds to even speak of (what with pictures of grass and trees and a large pool terrace). The pool is located on the roof of the first floor and is not a concrete pool -- it is a fiberglass pool measuring about 15'x30' and not even 4' deep, and there is no jacuzzi. The fitness center adequate, furnished with newer cardio machines, some weight machines and older looking free weights and a couple TVs. Do not expect individual screens or flat panels or even flat screens. In defense, most business travelers (the Ritz's target demographic) probably don't care much about individual TV screens and free-form infinity pools and rock formation hot-tubs.What I would imagine business travelers care about most (I was visiting for a football game -- business in its own right) are beds, internet access, and showers, in that order. The beds are phenomenal -- so plush I fell into a euphoric bliss. They feature down pillows, quality linens, and the most overstuffed featherbed on which I've ever slept. Each room also features a quality Panasonic clock/radio/cd player which sounded good (a poor-man's Bose Wave Radio). The internet access ($9.95 per day) is wireless in the room and presented zero problems. As good as the bed is, the shower is a close runner-up. Many up-market hotels are opting for rainfall showerheads, which seem appealing in theory but often miss the mark because of poor water pressure. This bathroom had an older looking (though premium quality) standard-size showerhead, and it was perfect. It maintained a more than sufficient amount of pressure without stinging or creating a windstorm. Kudos on keeping it real with the old-school showerhead.The guestrooms also feature an ample-sized desk, complimentary coffee/tea/water with a sleek new coffee maker, and early-90s TV set. My only gripe with the room is with the television - it simply doesn't fit with the rest of the room. The in-room dining menu could definitely use some tweaking. Prices are pretty standard (dare I say reasonable?) for an upscale hotel, but menu offerings are pretty limited (I didn't order anything so I can't comment on the food itself). While the outdoor public areas are totally forgettable, the lobby and lounge area exude an old world ambience without the stuffiness one might expect from a luxury/business property. The staff overall was pleasant and accommodating (they granted me a late check-out without flinching), but the ladies in housekeeping and doormen deserve special recognition. The room was spotless for the duration of the stay, the rollaway was brought up when requested, and the two times I approached one of the ladies for extra towels or shampoo they were so genuinely happy to help. The doormen were also great with directions and recommendations around Phoenix.In closing, I would advise that if you are looking to relax and unwind, you might wish to look elsewhere. However, for a weekend trip or business excursion, it's hard to beat the Ritz. It's centrally located (near food, lots of bars, shopping, stadiums, the airport) and provides everything necessary for a great night's sleep.

<Content>Classic Elegance Came down to Phoenix for a few days with the girlfriend to get some sun and relaxation. Despite this being somewhat of an urban busienss hotel, we picked it because of its super Class A location and because of the Ritz brand, which we love. The hotel delivered perfectly. Location is perfect to use as a central hub to explore the area and other resort hotels. The lobby is really elegant and welcoming. The rooms are incredibly upscale and the beds among the most comfortable I've ever slept in. Staff was friendly, but one concierge was very helpful, another was a little clueless, but at least friendly.We didnt eat at the hotel restaurant. Despite being a wonderful stay, I'll comment that the $24 overnight valet parking seems ridiculously expensive. Also, the hotel's pool deck was a little sparse, and the hotel gym should be expanded. Also the guestroom TV wasn't very impressive. Other than those minor imperfections, the place was graet. I'd love to return.

<Content>An Excellent Return Stay A few years had past since my last visit to the Ritz-Carlton Phoenix and I was impressed on how fresh and revived the hotel was. The Lobby has always been elegant but now it sparkled. My room on the Club Level was brand new with a soothing updated look and excellent bedding. Service at the Ritz-Carlton has always been excellent and this stay the staff were at their best. They know I love the fabulous chocolate chip cookies they make--and the night before I left--they had a tray of them sent to my room with a fond farewell written out in chocolate. The location of the hotel is very central--and I look forward to my next stay at the Ritz-Carlton Phoenix.

<Content>Great place for an upscale business conference or a restful stay!!!! The service and the food is fantastic The rooms are clean (a little dated), but the service and the staff are impeccable!! We have meetings at Ritz-Carltons all over the country and the Ritz-Carlton Phoenix offers incredible attention to detail. The staff could not have been more accomodating and the food presentations were outstanding. You can tell how well a hotel is run by the way the staff at every level meets or exceeds your every need. Group attendees and those in our membershp who have visited Phoenix and stayed in this hotel raved about the calibre of service over and over. We gave the Ritz-Carlton, Phoenix a try and we will be back again. Hats off to General Manager, Peter Ells and his fine staff.

<Content>Yup, It's a Ritz (except the fitness center) Have stayed in Ritz/Four Seasons properties in several cities and this one followed in line; prompt service, individualized welcome card upon check-in (not that I need that kind of thing), clean, comfortable room and beds - and the requisite Ferraris, Porshes and Escalades parked front and center with the valet. We had a ton of luggage including musical equipment, and the bellhops were attentive and luggage was in our room less than 10 mins after check-in. Was a little disappointed in the fitness center - more along the lines of something you'd find at a Hyatt, but still decent. Close to shops, etc. Still ticks me off that the Ritz and other 4/5 star hotels charge an extra $10 for internet access, but guess most are just expensing it through on business accounts anyway, but just include it in the room rate - I can get free access at Best Westerns!!! Overall, you'll definitely know it's a Ritz.

<Content>OK, But I Have Been At Better RC's I am currently staying at the RC Phoenix as the hotel where I am attending business meetings was full. For a corporate rate of $169/night, it's not bad. If I was paying more, I would be very dissappointed. I have been at RC's in San Francisco, Half Moon Bay, and Chicago, and this one does not compare. The bathroom is showing its age and overall the rooms just feel old. The pool is tiny, the valet charge of $24/night for parking is insane, and the $10/night fee for Internet access is ridiculous.Food quality and room service speed has been very good. Overall, an average stay, but probably not worth the price if you are paying anywhere near the rack rates.Also, if you are thinking this is a relaxing spa-like resort, it certainly is not. It is a suburban high-rise hotel amongst the urban sprawl of Phoenix.

<Content>Nice hotel Stayed 3 days at the Ritz in late April. Not quite as nice as some other Ritz Carltons, but nice enough I'd go back. Staff was very helpful and pleasant. Everyone called me by name. I'm thinking the car valet had to have called a head to the front desk to say I was coming, how else would they know? Nice touch... Rooms were pleasant but we walked in on the cleaning staff while they were refreshing our room, and the lady didn't finish putting things away, she just left. I had to put the ironing board back myself, etc. It's located across the street from a big mall so we ate at Cheesecake Factory there.

<Content>I've stayed at better... I recently stayed at the Ritz in Phoenix. I must say that I was not at all impressed with the hotel or the staff. I have stayed at other Ritz hotels before but this does not campare at all. The rooms are decent at best. The staff was not as courteous as others that I have stayed at.
