<Content>Its spot on! Stopped at the Agora about 5 years ago, and new I'd be back, which I was just lst week! Nothings changed... quite literally! I'm not sure its had a lick of paint since I was last there, but honestly compared to other hotels, its a delight!The location for starters is brilliant.. right on the Singel next to the flower market....within a 5 min walk you can be at every main attraction!The rooms are comfortable with a TV which has some English channels. The cleaner came in every day! Bathroom was nice, we only had a shower in our room, which was ok, but would've appreciated a soak in a bath after walking around all day! Breakfast was nice! Nothing hot, just croissants, cheese, ham, cereal, boiled eggs etc.... but very nice! You don't want to be filling your belly too full if you're gonna be trogging round all day!Staff are brilliant, very friendly! Speak excellent English too!The only advise I can give is to get this hotel booked! If you ask for a discount, YOU WILL GET ONE - just be cheaky, I was! Another word of advise.... don't sleep with the window open at night, we were almost eaten alive by the pesky mosquitos - totally our fault, we never expected mosquitos in Amsterdam so never gave 'em a 2nd thought!!

<Content>Needs A Major Overhaul We stayed at the Hotel Agora with our three children in March. We were supposed to have adjacent rooms, but due to an emergency our rooms were two floors apart. We didn't feel comfortable with that, so my husband and I split up to be with the kids. We expected small rooms and lots of stairs, and that was fine. But as I entered the rooms and saw the stained carpets, chipped paint, and cigarette burns on the blankets I just felt sick. I asked what we could do to get out of the reservation but of course we were stuck with it. Along with thin towels and lukewarm showers, the last night we battled the mosquitoes that came in when the cleaning staff left the windows wide open. Pretty much the only advantage was the location--very central. And there is a mediocre breakfast included in the rate. I can say that the pillows and mattress were good (no mattress pad of course, just a thin sheet), the place is very secure, and the staff was friendly and helpful (though young). For the price you should be able to do much better!

<Content>A bargain! Booked over the internet, paid 80 euros. Great location, staff super-friendly, room pretty good, breakfast fine. Its not the Ritz, but a great deal price-wise and a brilliant location.

<Content>Good location, but... We went to Amsterdam in Agora Hotel last june. It was the second time. We went once before a couple of years before. This time I was very disappointed to see that the general state of the room was very mediocre compared to the rate (more than 140 鈧?per night) : dirty walls, carpet with holes, outdates interior decoration. In a word, the room would have deserved a good renovation! However, the location of the hotel is really perfect to visit and enjoy amsterdam day and night life! Just be aware that the rooms on the street are quite noisy because of a night club next door. In the morning the breakfast is correct. And the staff is nice and accommodating.In sum, not too bad but don't expect too much !!!

<Content>A Disappointment This hotel has nothing to reccomend it other than the location. Let's just say the bath featured a can of bug-spray and mildewed tile. Then there was the dirty carpet, the tired bedding, the youth hostel level of service. This was basically a diappointment all-round. Perhaps some of the rooms are nicer and more updated. Ours was a horror -- the type of room in which you do not want to spend an extra 10 minutes. Terrible value for the money.

<Content>You Can't Beat the Location This is the 3rd time we stayed here over the 10 trips or so we have taken to Amsterdam....Main reason why we stay here....we love the location...And the staff is very friendly and helpful...The rooms are very small...and i see the hotel has become quite run down.but we still had a very pleasant stay...We stayed 7 nights in total...4 at first...then we went to India...and then 3 after we returned from India..We got the same room both times, room 24 overlooking the canal. The plus with this room is it is on the first floor!! It is fairly noisy late at night as there is a night club next door...but....i still love staying here, as anything we want is right outside the door, or a very short walk.I hope that they do a little renovating in the future, and will be sure to stay there again!!

<Content>Very central Hotel Agora is incredibly central, overlooking the Singel canal, which is definitely its biggest selling point. Our room was a bit tired-looking, although the bathroom had clearly been fairly recently replaced. As with any of the canal-side houses, the hotel is quite narrow and as a result the staircase is relatively steep and twisty - not ideal for anyone with mobility issues. The breakfast is included in the price of the room, which makes a nice change. The buffet is limited but good - the usual croissants, ham and cheese: John was a particular fan of the chocolate croissants!For a weekend trip to Amsterdam, the Hotel Agora isn't a bad choice - the staff are welcoming, the rooms are adequate and the location is ideal.

<Content>Lovely situated hotel! We have just returned from a long weekend in Amsterdam in the lovely hotel Agora! We really liked the hotel and its surroundings. We were surprised of the location; a lot of the famous museums are walking distance from the hotel and it is even situated on the Singel, one of the canals of Amsterdam. All the members of the staff were very friendly and cooperative. Due to the fact that it was our first time in Amsterdam, we had a lot of questions. Therefor the personell of Hotel Agora has given a lot of good advises for sightseeing in Amsterdam. We also appreciated the dutch breakfast in the morning, good service!

<Content>this place is knackered This is an uncomfortable hotel that's cold, ugly, shabby and very, very tired. Rooms are small, basic and cold, and breakfast is toast in a bland poky room. On our lasty night here we came home at around 1 am to find our door lock was faulty and we couldn't get into our room so we reported it to the night staff. We spent 4 hours in the lobby waiting while the staff organised a repair man to open the door. We were ignored by the staff as we waited. Eventually after 3 hours I found a member of staff and requested blankets to try and get warmed up in the lobby as we waited. Blankets were located after approx. 30 mins and they smelt disgusting. We finally got in to our room at 5:15 am. Thankfully this happened on our last night in this hotel that I was glad to leave.

<Content>I enjoyed I was looking for a hotel next to the singel canal as I knew it would be central to just about everything. This was my 5th stay in Amsterdam and I knew what to expect of the old converted canal houses.Yes, the Agora is a little tired looking now, but the service was really good and the staff friendly.My friend and I had the attic room . It was a lovely size and very clean. Due to all the hot weather of late, there was also a nice big fan in the room, which was much appreaciated.The bed linen was spotless, clean and crisp. The bathroom was also nice and clean. I too, also found a can of bug spray in the room, but with the windows open and being next to a canal i was happy to find it as there were plenty of gnats on the ceiling. We closed the windows, sprayed the room then went out for a walk. We had no problems (or insect bites) during our stay. I think some of the reviews are a little harsh, come on folks, this is a two star hotel!! I've stayed in worse four star hotels and paid a lot more.Plenty of steps to climb, but I did expect that. The breakfast was more than ample, typical dutch fare. and you could have as much as you wanted.Perhaps, a little expensive, but I did go in the height of the holiday season, so, that too was expected. Most of the hotels do special offers throughout the year, so you just have to watch out for them. All in all, myself and my friend enjoyed ourselves, and our stay at the Agora, and YES we would stay there again, it was very central, and quiet . One other thing, one of the staff did say that the hotel was having a refurbishment, probably this winter..so watch this space!

<Content>Small and charcterful Stayed here in 1997, at that time rated hotel high. Stayed again in July 2006. On this visit some disappointment about slightly rundown now and not being kept in best condition, as evidenced in other comments here, but on balance still liked it and still several positive points.Location of hotel good. Better hotels tend to be further out, while the ones right in the centre are generally inferior budget ones.Stayed in room 35. Small attic room on top floor, rather cramped, and many quite steep stairs to reach it; but adequately warned about these points on website and when booking. Double bed, window with no view, very little storage space, but definitely a room with appealing character. Walls need some paint. Own private bathroom across corridor, ie not ensuite; obviously recently refurbished, good size, high standard, very clean, plenty of hot water, shower quite good. Electronic safe in room, no extra charge, good. Key cards to control access to both hotel and room.Mosquitoes and a noisy unit outside (a/c or similar) a problem the first night (unusually hot weather), so kept window closed subsequent nights.Staff efficient, helpful and friendly.Breakfast typical Dutch continental of various breads, jam, cheese, cold meat, eggs, and a few other supplies. Good coffee and orange juice. Served as help yourself buffet, not a vast spread, but quite good and sufficient for us. Breakfast room peaceful and quite spacious, better than many hotels. A few items not fresh on second morning, assume left over from previous day, otherwise a good and relaxing breakfast.Some parts of hotel need attention. Graffiti on outside an unwelcome start. Stair carpet in poor condition, and distinct musty smell on lower stairs, as noticed by everyone else on this website. Repainting some walls would be a significant, and cheap, enhancement.Paid 92 Euros per night, which is reasonable for Amsterdam (although 88 Euros posted in room ?). Larger ensuite rooms around 120 Euros, 140 euros for view of canal. Booking dealt with efficiently by email, cancellation available up to 48 hours before arrival.In summary: Needs some refurbishment - new carpets and some paint, and ensure everything at breakfast is fresh. Otherwise, still an attractive hotel with character, good value, good location, a typical Amsterdam house rather than a bland hotel. (Other than spending a lot more money elsewhere) we would probably stay here again.Martin  Sally

<Content>Good Location that's about it. This is a hotel that has seen better times. The location is great, close to everything and right on the Singel canal. However, the lobby is a good clue that the Agora is getting tired to say the least. The furnishings are old and the walls need a paint job. When you are ready to go up the stairs from the lobby, a strange smell greets your nostrals. Not pleasant. The rooms are ok, the showers could use a good cleaning, but our room had a nice view of the canal.There is a disco next store and on a Friday and Saturday night the pounding of the music beat goes until 4am. Unless you sleep though anything, this will be a problem.The staff is friendly, but the breakfest is skimpy. It seemed like I needed to ask for basic food stuff every morning, like juice and coffee.It's too bad that I can't give this hotel a good review, if the owners of this hotel tried, this could be a very nice and cozy place to stay.

<Content>Great location, somewhat odd hotel Wonderfully friendly staff and great location makes up for somewhat decayed state of furnishings and especially carpet. We settled on funky as the best description of it - very steep stairs with weird angles, quite decent sized rooms with better than average bathrooms, reasonable breakfasts, but on the verge of run-down.

<Content>Great Location Too bad the hotel does not live up to the website. It was dirty everywhere, from soilded carpets to worn walls and doors to large amounts of mold in the shower. The staff was friendly but inexperienced and could not give basic tour information or get a taxi for us. The complimentary breakfast was pathetic and you are better to pay for something at a cafe nearby. The bed was hard and difficult to sleep on.The location was ideal near the Leidesplein and a tram stop. This was the cheapest canal house with a water view I was able to find. But at $135 Euro a night I expected a basic level that was not there.

<Content>Horrible Hotel This hotel is not worth the money. Stayed there three terrible nights. The beds were horrible - might as well been trying to sleep in a hammock. The room stank of smoke, and most of our neighbors stayed in their rooms smoking pot all day, which is their right, but the smoke filled the halls and all the rooms on the floor. There are no non smoking rooms. On a scary note, the fire escape stairs aren't finished, and they're made of wood. That seems like a bad idea. The location is good, but for 120 Euro, you can find better places. I will never stay there again.

<Content>Hotel Agora- Not recommended Stayed at Hotel Agora on my eighth visit to A'dam. Have stayed in many hotels there and do not consider myself to be a nit- picky person. However, I have to agree with the sentiments of those who previously posted- sewage smell in the stairway, mold in the bathroom, etc. Breakfast was skimpy- on my first day there they ran out of boiled eggs. The staff was pleasant enough, but for the money you could do better elsewhere. The best thing about it was the location- everything very walkable from this hotel. Still, my advice is that you could do much better elsewhere for the same price or less. Keep looking before you settle for this hotel.

<Content>Terrible hotel, despite the location This is in many ways a terrible hotel. Prepare to be disappointed - I know I was. Imagaine going back to the 60s - and you'll find the rooms haven't been touched since. The worst is the carpets - absolutely filthy. Old furniture, beds that sag - and worst of all, mould in the bathrooms. Sure, the place is in the centre of everything, and the 4 rooms at the front with windows over the Singel canal have a great view - but don't turn round and look at the dump you are staying in. The rooms are tiny. I gave up after one night, after finding there was no hot water, and my TV had no reception. No, none at all, of any picture! This place isn't particularly cheap either, and there are much better hotels just over the road. My view - avoid.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Location My wife sent me and my best friend to Amsterdam for a week for my 40th birthday (Thanks honey!) and after much research, I booked a room at the Agora. We were not disapointed. Our room faced the Singel Canal and featured a modern bathroom with a shower. The room was clean and came with a security card-operated safe perfect for storing passports and valuables. The security card also opened the front door, the door leading to the upper floors and the room itself. We felt very safe. Breakfast as noted in other reviews was delicious and filling. The coffee was especially exceptional. The Agora is very centrally located to the flower market, the museums and the nightlife of the Leidseplein. There are many pubs (including a great single malt scotch bar) and restaurants nearby and if you have any questions about what to do or see, the owners are very friendly and eager to answer all your questions. The only concerns you might want to consider are the steps - they are numerous and steep. Don't forget, you are staying in a Dutch canal house... I would consider asking about a ground floor room if you have bad knees or vertigo. Also, the hotel is located on a major intersection (the Koningsplein) where the trams take a hard left from Leidsestraat then a right on up the Spui. While I found the ringing of tram bells and general street noise charming and a welcome change from the everyday, those who prefer a less frenetic atmosphere might want a Garden view room. A note to westerners - this is not a Holiday Inn. If you are expecting a large room with every possible amenity, look elsewhere. If however, you want to experience staying in the intimate setting of a canal house in a great part of town for a very attractive price, I would highly recommend The Agora.

<Content>splendid hotel We, a family group of six aged 12 to 56, stayed at the Agora for 4 nights - and enjoyed our stay very much. Perfect location close to many interisting places, locations and restaurants. Nice and quiet rooms, good beds, recently renovated bathrooms. Delicious breakfast buffet in cozy room. The hotel is clean, safe and quiet. The staff are kind and helpful. Good quality for money - we will definitely stay at the Agora next time in Amsterdam

<Content>Bad Taste My husband and myself stayed at the Agora Hotel during May this year (2005). Apart from the fact that the hotel is centrally situated within walking distance to all major attractions and a relative, good enough breakfast, there is nothing positive that we can say about the hotel.Firstly when you are in the foyer of the hotel a sewerage smell hangs in the air, secondly the furbishment of the room dated from the 1960's, the carpet was disgustingly filfy and the room had a terrible smell of cigarette smoke. (We are smokers ourselves). The bedding, specially the mattresses are disgusting and it is obvious that the owners do not plough any capital back into upgrading the facilities. The Agora Hotel will be a definite NO for us to visit again. We have travelled a lot, we are not fussy people but the Agora Hotel was a terrible mistake for us to have stayed in during our visit to lovely AmsterdamAlba Moolman, Cape Town, South Africa

<Content>Loved the Agora We (3 females) stayed at the Hotel Agora, Amsterdam from May 8-14, 2005, and loved the hotel. It is in a GREAT location - 15 min. walk north to Dam Square (up a great shopping street) and 15 min. walk south to the museums (down a great shopping street). The room was quite adequate for the price, with a brand new bathroom. It was very clean, safe and quiet. The breakfast buffet (which was included in the price) was very good -- cereals, breads, boiled eggs, cheese, cold cuts, tea, coffee  orange juice. The staff were very friendly and helpful as well. I would not hesitate in recommending this hotel for the great price, location and hospitality.Transportation tip - buy a round trip Connexion bus shuttel ticket at the airport which takes you from the airport to the hotel and back (about 18 euros return). The bus conveniently stops 2 blocks from the hotel - but make sure you tell the driver it's Hotel Ahora (Dutch pronunciation of Agora) and even show the driver the name and address of the hotel.

<Content>Ideal location, clean, comfortable, inexpensive I was returning from a conference and stayed in Hotel Agora to explore Amsterdam for three days. My room was at the top of the stairs, so I had a good workout. By the end of three days, I could run up easily and I did often. I did not have to carry my suitcase because the owner carried it up himself.Agora was ideal for a single woman staying in Amsterdam. The front door has a key lock, the door to the stairs has a key lock, the room has a key lock. I never felt more safe. The staff was very nice and spoke English and French. The best part of the hotel was the location. So close to everything and anything - shops, restaurants, flowers. The first day I walked to the Rijksmuseum because I couldn't figure out the trams (which are very easy). Agora's proximity to many interesting places and its affordable rooms make it my first choice upon any return trips (and I hope to soon.)

<Content>Very friendly.good location Just back from Hotel Agora - good value, well located hotel on the Singel Canal next to the floating flower market. Friendly, informative staff. Rooms at the front look over canal - double glazing and dark curtains so you get a good night's sleep. Rooms at back look over a pretty courtyard garden.

<Content>Nice Hotel in a semi central location This Hotel attracted me thru its reviews and price. The location was a few doors down from the main road thru town, but quiet. Transportation was easy, A variety of restaurants were nearby for dinner, and the hotel serves a nice breakfast in a nice setting.

<Content>Great location, olde worlde charm We stayed at the Agora Hotel in Amsterdam from the 6th to 9th January 05. It is on the Singel Canal, within minutes of the Flower Market. My husband and I and our 13 year old had Room 32, a Triple facing the Canal. The outlook is lovely, specially at night, with the canal and street lit up. Being winter, we had the windows opened only a few inches for fresh air, so the noise of the nearby Trams did not bother us, but it could be different in summer. I think the ambience more than makes up for any background noise.  The room had a double bed (two singles pushed together) and a single. The bathroom is a bit small for three, but recently renovated and everything is clean. Towels were changed everyday. There is a shower only.  The room smelt strongly of smoke when we came in, but this is a problem I think one encounters everywhere in this city. We got some air freshener from the Management and left the windows open for a while and that helped.  Breakfast, which was included, was good. Cereal, juice, beautiful breads, toast and spreads, hard boiled eggs, some typical Dutch sweet cookies/toast, tea/coffee. The breakfast room was obviously the living room of the previous owners and is furnished with some lovely Dutch pieces, very comfortable and relaxing.  The Managers/Owners, Els and Yvo, and their staff, all speak English, are friendly and extremely helpful with suggestions and directions. They called a Taxi to take us to Central Station on our departure and it arrived in a matter of minutes.  The only drawback of the Agora is the steep, narrow stairs to the upper levels. We had to drag three big suitcases to our room and it was not easy. All Canal house hotels must have this problem, but be forewarned if you cannot manage steps.   There are many good restaurants within a short walk of the Hotel. we tried an Indonesian restaurant, that does Rijstaffel, it was excellent. All the sights are reached by a short tram ride or a brisk walk.  The biggest problem we encountered in Amsterdam was the amount of smokers in restaurants. There are few designated non smoking areas and some of these are in very close proximity to the smoking section. Ask, before you sit down, if this is as much of a bother to you, as it was to us.  Amsterdam can be very cloudy and windy. A good head scarf is invaluable, besides all the other cold weather gear.   We truly enjoyed our short stay in Amsterdam and the Agora did much towards that satisfied feeling. From what I have seen on the Web, it is one of the most reasonably priced Canal hotels. Enjoy !

<Content>Good Hotel, Good Price, Great Location I agree with the reviewer from England that the person from the US is off the mark with comments about security. We stayed at the Agora during October 2004 and never felt the least bit unsafe. There is plenty of security, and we enjoyed our stay there. We had a canal-side room, and are thinking of getting a garden-side room when we go back, because there is quite a bit of street noise on the canal side. But at night we just plugged in the fan that was in the room and it drowned out most of the streetcar noise. And it was nice to look out the window and see the passers-by. At any rate, we found the Agora very comfortable, the staff was very nice, and the location is just great. We also liked the breakfast. There's plenty of choice with coffee, tea, toast, cereals, soft-boiled eggs, meats and cheeses. We'd stay there again without hesitation.

<Content>Security The person from the USA who complained about security is way offtarget. The bedrooms are secure (three swipe cards) at least threecctv,s and staff on hand. The doors are secure, rooms have large safe's. ONLY THE CARELESS WOULD GET ROBBED, and the doors to the rooms are good and solid (fire reg's).Our bathroom was brand new, there were downsides but like forlike it was reasonable value for money, and very Central. Not thebest presented breakfast, or the best choice, but adequate, there is noneed to go hungary.GET IN THERE TO BE IN THE CENTRE FOR THE PRICE.

<Content>Very comfortable beds! We stayed at the end of November 2004.Centrally situated, quiet at night, trams stop right near it. This hotel was excellent. The only slight complaint was that we are ex-smokers, and the room had obviously had a cigar smoker in it before us. Having said that, the room overlooking the canal on the first floor was warm, comfortable, quiet and had a great view.The stairs take a bit of negotiating, but are soon got used to. The staff were extremely pleasant and helpful. Would highly recommend, and hope to return next year. Amsterdan and the canals are wonderful!It was so easy to get a train from Schipol, the station is below the airport. We had planned to get a taxi, but everything is so simple, we caught the train to Central Amsterdam, then got a tram outside the railway station (No. 1.2 or 5) to Konigsplien, to the hotel.

<Content>Nice Hotel I stayed at this hotel November 25-28, 2004. My room was #35. The room was a bit small and the covers a bit threadbare. The room was slightly drafty, but o.k. (how much time are you going to spend in your hotel room?). The bathroom across the hall was EXCELLENT. Looks like it was just refinished. The room and bathroom were always clean. Breakfast was o.k. The staff were very nice and helped with any questions I had. There are many bars and restaurants in the area. Tram stop for trams 1, 2, and 5 are just around the corner. The hotel is very easy to get to from Central Station, and you can get to the the museum area, or any other destination very easily as well. The location of the hotel was very good. I felt safe at this hotel. FYI there is no elevator, so if you do not like stairs, you want want to find another hotel. This was my 3rd time to the city and I had a pleasant time. I would stay here again. kilmistr@hotmail.com

<Content>Charming, comfortable  We chose the Agora having read other reviews on this site and were happily not disappointed. We stayed for a 3-night stay, and, having arrived early were able to check into our room at 1030 am. Check in was friendly, speedy and efficient and secure, the room we had booked was a double with ensuite facilities we did not pay extra for canal view and as it was had a view of nearby offices, allowing plenty of people watching , the huge windows were screened by full length voile and long lined curtains. the room was of average size with a huge comfortable double bed, wardrobe with safe deposit box - at no additional cost - and bureau and chairs. The bathroom was modern and clean with a massive walk in shower dispensing hot water every time we used it. There was a hairdryer  shaver point and large soft white towels which were changed daily. We were situated on the 2nd floor and the stairs were quite steep but we soon became acclimitised to them. We found the hotel to be quiet at night times even allowing for its central location . The room was warmly heated and we were able to open the windows to allow additional ventilation. Buffet breakfast was available from 730-10 and there was a wide varied selection to choose from. The Singel is a very pretty canal and the location of the Agora is very handy for Spui , and the Flowermarket about 5mins. away ; the Leidesplein, Vondel Park and Dam square are about 10 mns. away and Red Light area and Station about 15-20 mins walk. There are lots of bars , cafes and a wide choice of varying eteries all close by. Just watch out on the walkways for the bikes !

<Content>The Hotel Agora, Very unsafe, beware The rooms at the Hotel Agora are uncomfortable, there are no screens on the windows, no air conditioning and mosquitos are rampant at night. We were bitten from head to toe. If that wasn't enough, the doors on the rooms are made out of particle board, the locks are flimsy, front desk security is non-existent, and we were robbed! The Hotel did nothing to help us. Don't stay here; its' unsafe!

<Content>Great place to stay First time I've stayed at the Agora but would definately stay there again. Staff helpful and welcoming, great location, very clean. Has the charm often lacking in chain hotels but retains the high standards.We stayed in the attic room - a long haul up the stairs but definately worth it!

<Content>Altogether OK July 2004: We arrived very early on our first day in Amsterdam from an all night transit from London. We were tired and the owner offered us some breakfast-even though we were not entitled to it on that morning. We thought that was nice, however, the owner and her assistant proceeded to talk about us in Dutch as we were only a few feet away eating (about how we were poor backpackers and had booked the cheapest room, what was she to do but give us breakfast etc-She offered the breakfast!) Not realising my husband is Dutch and he could understand everything, it was an embarrasing situation. We went to see the city and came back when our room was ready, the owner asked us where we were from etc and my husband spoke to her in Dutch, her face went red and that said it all. As for the room and location, that was all great, but our first experience tainted our stay and made us wonder if this happens with other guests who can't understand what's being said. We thought it was very unprofessional, rude and altogether uncalled for. Next time, we will stay somewhere else that will hopefully appreciate our choosing to stay at their establishment, not put us down.

<Content>Nice Hotel I recently stayed at the Agora with my partner and found it very pleasant. The location, as other reviewers have said, is excellent with most attractions in walking distance, if not a tram stop is a stones throw away. The staff were friendly and helpful and we were made to feel welcome. Our room was of adequate size, nothing fancy, clean with a nice bathroom. A variety of food is provided for the self-service breakfast, including cereal, breads, cheese and ham. I personally found the same selection for breakfast a bit tedious after a few days but I'm sure it is adequate for most. All in all this is a very nice Hotel, I cannot think of anything bad about it!
