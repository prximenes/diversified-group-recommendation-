<Content>Good price/quality Liked: room, location (10 min. walk from Sants Station and in front of Sants Metro green line), toiletry set, personnel, price.Didn't like: smell in the corridors, internet prices, bond they place on your credit card when you reserve through their website.Internet apart, would make a good business hotel.

<Content>Excellent hotel. I stayed at this hotel for 1 night during a business trip in Spain.It is located just opposite the train station Sants, so it is ideal for people travelling by train. Even if it is not right in the city centre, there is a metro station right outside the hotel, allowing you to be in Las Ramblas in few minutes.The room was nice and comfortable.The front desk staff as well as the room service staff was helpful and polite.It was not expensive for a 4* hotel and definitely worth the money.I would go to this hotel again and would recommend it to business travellers as well as tourists.

<Content>Excellent Hotel Could not fault the Abba Sants Hotel! The beds are big and comfy, the rooms are spacious! Staff are polite and helpful, the hotel was sleek and modern and it was located right beside an underground metro station! Had a great stay here and would definitely return again!

<Content>Very nice Business trip i Barcelona. Stayed at this hotel i Barcelona during feb 2008. Had a room in 7th floor, who is the executive floor. Nothing special with that.Very clean, but hot. The air condition was not working. Maybe because it is out of season for that. So the room was very warm, and I had to have the window open during the night.The hotel restaurant is expensive related to the othe restaurants nearby. Very good food in this hotel restaurant.The hotel is not in the tourist part of Barcelona, and you need to take a taxi to get to the beach.

<Content>IDEAL for large groups. Stayed here for a Stag weekend with 20 other lads in our 30's and 40's. Found it to be a good quality ,well run, clean hotel. Staff were all very curteous and welcoming (even when returning from nights out at 5.30AM) and rooms were clean and adequate.Didn't sample the food - plenty of cafes, restaurants and bars within 50 yards. Steps to (excellent) Metro system are outside the front door and this takes you anywhere in the City including the Airport (get a day card - about 5 Euros or a T-10 ticket that allows 10 journeys).Would definately recommend this professionally run place - especially for large groups - only down side was the cost of the breakfast - 15 Euro's a day is a bit stiff.

<Content>Very good business hotel The Abba Sants hotel in Barcelona is in a good, but not spectacular, location near the Sants Railroad Station in Barcelona. It has excellent access to the Metro (only a few meters from the hotel entrance). The hotel itself is very clean. The rooms are comfortable, though the lower floors can have depressingly dark rooms. It is very nice that most of the rooms in the hotel are non-smoking (though this may be a problem for some smokers - so be aware of this).The bathrooms have fixtures that function very well. Beds are comfortable - though I did have one problem with a broken bed. This problem was resolved by accommodating me in an executive room!The reception staff was particularly impressive. They worked very efficiently, were very friendly and went out of their way to make my stay very pleasant. Indeed, I have not been in any hotel with more accommodating staff!

<Content>Great hotel in a very convenient location I really enjoyed my stay at the Abba Sants hotel. It is very comfortable, modern hotel. It's location, a few minutes walk from the Sants train station, is very convenient for travelers who are visiting the city. The hotel staff was great about giving restaurant recommendations that locals actually go to. The only downside was that the rooms were uncomfortably warm and the only way to cool down was to open the window which unfortunately let in the noise from a very busy street.

<Content>Great Hotel Booked this hotel as we extended our weekend in Barcelona (stayed previous 2 nights at Gran Torre). Just up the street from the Gran Torre(see review) and although we had been spoiled by the previous hotels views we found the Abba Sants excellent. The staff were very friendly and helpful.  As we were transferring early on a Saturday morning we were hoping to just be able to store our bags but our room was ready and waiting for us. Although we had a room facing the street there was no noise. After a day sightseeing I don't think anything would have woken me. The breakfast the next morning was full of choice..the fresh pastries were excellent!! Would recommend this hotel wholeheartedly as it is excellent value for money and within minutes walking distance from Sants Estacio with a metro station just outside the door!

<Content>A good choice Having now stayed at Abba Sants I think previous reviewers' praises are quite justified. It lived up to our expectations of a modern four star hotel when we were assigned an executive room on the top floor.Firstly, the pluses. The habitacion comprised a bedroom that was adequately spacious and clean, along with large and comfortable beds. A cupboard was provided in the entrance lobby and the bathroom was quite big. There was a bath having shower facilities but do see the note later about the WC. There was a 20 feet x 8 feet private balcony outdoors with table and two chairs having a view over the city rooftops and the hills. The staff were friendly and attentive, and provided us each with a key card. When the inevitable problem with the keycards arose on day 3 they solved the problem quickly with a minimum of fuss.The minuses with the room were mostly in the bathroom. An additional wall encloses the WC in a tight squeeze. Although two people can use the bathroom at once, anyone communing with nature will be crammed into a tiny space with no room to swing an amoeba. The jacuzzi attachments in the bath didn't work. The room safe was temperamental and unpredictable so important stuff had to be kept elsewhere. Although not a fault, the room would have benefitted from tea/coffee making facilities and enthusiasts of hotel goodnight chox should note these only seem to appear Monday-Thursday excluding festivals.Breakfast was a good choice of breads, fruit, cheeses, yoghurts, cereals and an adequate selection of Bacon, Scrambled Egg, Sausages and Chorizo. The toaster needs a test run and you may have to run toast through twice. Coffee is supplied as SAE20/50 but blends well with the hot milk. Coach parties are known to use this hotel, and breakfast can be so busy at 8-8.30am they run out of tables and institute queuing. The message is that if this is Sunday and this must be Barcelona, get down early for your breakfast. If using the WCs in the public area round the back of the restaurant, do make a note of where the light switch is in case the energy saving system prematurely activates.A few words about the area. Whilst this is not the most upmarket neighbourhood, we did not feel at all worried. There is some graffiti here and there, but the outside wall you may see from the breakfast table on your first morning should not be immediate cause for panic. Although this is a four star hotel, local restaurants with linen tableclothes and no smoking policies are extremely rare in the local vicinity, and for a four star evening meal experience you should either travel into town or use the hotel restaurant, which whilst serving excellent food, has a limited choice from the posh evening menu. There is also an adjoining coffee shop/bar in the hotel which has a menu featuring light mealsThe hotel is a five minute walk from Barcelona Sants station (on the line to the airport) and direct access to metro line 3 is from a staircase immediately outside the hotel.

<Content>good hotel good area Stayed here with five mates from the ages of 21 to 78. Very good stay. Close to Metro - buy a T-10 ticket AND buy it at the airport railway station - it can be used on the train to the city saving a couple of Euros. Hotel spacious well run with nice rooms and very good buffet breakfast. If you want a few good basic bars get the Metro out to Can Vidalet and Via Julia, plenty of local culture.We've booked to go back in March 2007.

<Content>Could not fault the Abba Sants Obviously a hotel catering for the business traveller in a business area of Barcelona. That said with a Barcelona Travel Pass and the Bus stop, Underground yards away, and the Railway station 200 yards away - everything in Barcelona is within easy reach. Never used a taxi yet. Good cafes across the road but good quality meals are cheap in Barcelona typically 3 courses with wine 12 euros. Even late at night the area appeared safe - we never were aware of any hassles.The Hotel staff are friendly, polite and very helpful and the modern marble decor thoughout was spotlessly clean. Our standard double room was a king size bed with loads of space and a well appointed bathroom. Breakfast was magnificent with a buffet for as much as you wanted.We were from Scotland on a FlyGlobespan deal and could not rate the whole package any higher. If we ever go to Barcelona again it will be back to the Abba Sants.

<Content>Try the Irish Coffee!! The Abba Sants is not in the most obvious location in Barcelona - you're not especially close to the Ramblas or any of the other main attractions. However, it's right beside the underground and the main train line so it's incredibly easy to get around.In essence, it's a business hotel and we didn't see a great number of tourists there. The rooms have that 'business traveller' feel: they're well appointed, and definitely classier than a travelodge, but there's nothing extraordinary or special. The service was exceptional. The staff were efficient and friendly, despite our broken Spanish. At times, we felt the business clients got preferential treatment in the bar, etc, but it was hardly a problem. Particularly when they served such spectacular Irish Coffee!!! A great hotel for those visiting Barcelona on a budget. We'd certainly go back.

<Content>Fantastic! We stayed here in May last year and it exceeded all expectations, very clean, well presented rooms, friendly staff and conveniently located next to the Metro.I can without a doubt say that I will definately be coming back here very soon.I cant comment on the breakfast as I was on a room only basis but the cafe across the road was beautiful. Your only a Metro ride away from the Las Ramblas so nights out are easy and just catch a taxi back.I would recommend this to anyone.

<Content>Nothing special, from my point of view.. Well, guys, I really do not understand why all of reviewers here are so happy with this hotel. I booked it purely due to very positive comments here, but now I wouldn鈥檛 say it is so pretty place. To be clear 鈥?the hotel  services aren鈥檛 bad, even more, they are quite good 鈥?but nothing more than that. So let鈥檚 say 鈥?just a bit above an average 3+ or 4 star hotel and I would really doubt that this hotel is worth to be #17 (right now) in total of 300+ hotels rating鈥?br/>Yes, location is good if you are like to be close to Sants Estacio or come in to hotel or get out from that very often through a day and use a metro for these trips. Marble bathrooms are looking nice too. What else good..? Nothing from my mind 鈥?see in details below.Rooms 鈥?not that big and spacey (had a standard double), just Ok in size, although for 2 people I would like to get more space, especially considering that this hotel is a new building. Bedroom and bathroom are clean at 1st glance, but do not look deeper. Lack of toiletries (hair conditioner), lack of complementary water or drinks, no kettle in room with coffee / tea / choco, no chocolates on pillow with 鈥済ood night and have a nice sleep鈥?. (ohh, Renaissance, why you aren鈥檛 here in Barsa..?). Air-conditioning is very tricky one 鈥?I didn鈥檛 get it to work properly and actually had a feeling that it is just centrally switched off, although visually it made of lot of noise and even tried to push some air, but that wasn鈥檛 enough to change the temperature in room. So I succeed with opening a window for couple of minutes and thus getting a fresh air into the room (thanks to winter time). Lobby is very small and restaurant is literally behind the lobby, joint by lobby bar. This actually means that on evenings this area is very crowded and smells like hell due to many of smokers and real lack of good ventilation. We only had breakfasts (buffet) in the hotel and those I would rate as 3 on 5 levels scale. Only one choice of juice (orange), limited choice of cheese, limited choice of hot meals (forget about beans or grilled tomato), no any fish, limited choice of milk products 鈥?all these are not that critical, but really not up to good 4-star hotel in my opinion.Staff is just Ok, I would say neutral 鈥?nothing especially good, but nothing bad too.Finally, there is no wi-fi in rooms and there is no internal pool or at least Jacuzzi.As a final word, I had a chance to be shortly in two more hotels in Barcelona 鈥?Fira Palace and Hotel Icaria. I found Fira Palace very cozy and much more attractive for relaxed stay / tourist type visit. As for Hotel Icaria, positioned as business type of hotel, it is modern, but not particularly convenient and also feels like have some lack of good management. Probably next time visiting Barsa on personal I will go for Fira Palace, which was just a couple of euros more expensive.

<Content>Good hotel I recommend this hotel. Great for those who want to take the train in from the airport. You can wheel your bags two blocks to the hotel and avoid the taxi fare. A small bakery across the street is great for breakfast. There is an internet shop one block away. I paid 40 cents for fifteen minutes to check my emails. The subway stop stairs are right out the door of the hotel. We stayed on the 7th floor and the room was fine and quiet. The bus touristic which I dont recommend stops at the train station by the way.

<Content>Great place to stay Stayed here over the Bank Holiday Weekend. Its a great hotel with everything you would want. The rooms were really nice, really comfortable king size bed, great bathrooms, breakfast is superb. The location is great because its right outside the metro station and you can go everywhere from there. Also, if your looking to travel to other areas within Spain theres also a railway station close by. Service was good too.Its not walking distance to the Ramblas and Beachside (although thats certainly possible if your in the mood for a long stroll) but otherwise its great! Its closer to Lilla and the shops around there.

<Content>Fantastic Stay @ Abba Sants Hotel 8 lovely ladies from Glasgow, flying over to the wonderful city of Barcelona for my hen weekend. Our ages ranged from 24 to 58, so finding the right hotel that would suit everyone's tastes and expectations was going to be a challenge. The Abba Sants Hotel proved to be the perfect choice. The hotel was stunning. It was immaculately clean, the bedrooms were freshly decorated and the staff were so helpful and polite, even when it was quite obvious that we had had one to many champagne cocktails!!I would highly recommend this hotel, and would seriously consider booking again either for a romantic weekend away or for another girls weekend.

<Content>Good hotel, great location Just come back from a 2 night stay at the Abba Sants. Hotel in a good location for travelling from the airport and for getting around the city - the main train station (20 mins direct train link to the airport) and metro are virtually on your doorstep.Rooms are clean and functional - not what I would call 4 star, although the bathrooms are nice. We didn't find the beds that comfortable.Felt the hotel was lacking in atmosphere - had quite a 'corporate' feel and we didn't find the staff particularly friendly or helpful.The breakfasts are excellent with plenty of choice.This is an ideal hotel to use as a base for exploring Barcelona and would recommend it for a weekend stay. However, if you are staying any longer or if you want to get the real Barcelona atmosphere then this hotel is not for you.

<Content>Wonderful hotel! My wife and I stayed at the Abba Sants for one night pre cruise in May. We got the room for about $140 including breakfast on alpharooms.com. We were given, at our request, a quiet room with a large bed. The towels are wonderful and the breakfast was delicious. The hotel is right near the Sants Station which is a 20 minute train ride from the airport. Be forewarned, however, that if you have a lot of luggage, the walk to the hotel with your luggage will be difficult. A cab to the airport was about 25 Euros. From the hotel, the subway takes around 15 minutes to La Ramblas. There are 2 subway lines right outside the hotel which is terrific for touring. We highly recommend the hotel. The staff were very courteous and helpful, even bringing us fresh towels within 5 minutes late at night after we returned from a night of sightseeing.

<Content>Great 4* hotel with personal service I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights over a weekend in April 2005 with 10 guys and had great time.The buffet breakfast is superb, rooms clean and very well equipped with excellent bathrooms. Staff very friendly and eager to help, from the receptionists to the bar staff to the waitresses in the morning. Excellent hotel for barcelona - and literally 10m from a Sants underground entrance. Shame its not nearer to the Ramblas, but thats probably a good thing. Managed to get decent deal on the internet which made all the better value.

<Content>almost perfect for a city break Have to echo what everyone else has said here: the rooms and beds are very comfy and the reception staff very helpful (we got our bag nicked, as per usual in barcelona, and they couldn't have been more helpful dealing with the police etc for us - although I don't recommend this as a must-do in Barcelona if you can avoid it).It's a little way off the main tourist areas, but so close to the station that the convenience of getting there in the first place from the airport, as well as getting to where you wanted to be in barcelona, made up for that. (Just don't think that you can wander out of the hotel to find a handy lovely restaurant or similar - we plodded the streets for ever one night...)OK, so it's not exactly crammed with character, but if you're out and about and just want a convenient, clean, friendly place to hang your hat, you can't really do much better.

<Content>Great modern hotel The Abba Sants is a good quality modern hotel. If it had a pool, it would be a 5 star establishment.The rooms enjoy good quality toiletries, are well sized, extremely clean and are quite elegant, though with a corporate accent. The staff are great, very helpful, and even urged us to try the cheap tapas bar in the small street across the road (which was great). The staff also urged me not to eat regularly in their own excellent restaurant, which is quite dear but very good - the restaurants they suggested were off the tourist route and very good and not too pricey.The hotel isn't far from Estacio Sants, the city's main railway station, but it is quite far from anything else. This is more a business district rather than a tourist district. I know Barca quite well, and every taxi driver I hailed chose to take the long way back to the hotel from Ramblas, adding a few euros each time, and late at night, a taxi is the only option you have.I can't really sing the praises of this hotel enough. Stay there, but be prepared to add quite a few euros in taxi fares if you stay out beyond the last metro.

<Content>Great Hotel in Barcelona Within yards of the railway station, this is a great hotel at a great rate. This is a regular 4-star business hotel - its pretty formal, very clean, and the rooms are a good size.We flew in, got the train to the Sants Estacio and walked a couple of hundred yards with suitcases - couldn't be better.I'd recommend going room only because breakfast is expensive and there's a neat little croissant cafe right across the street.Be aware that Sants Estacio (railway station) is not right in the heart of the city - its about 1 mile away form Las Ramblas - and I liked that because at night the hotel was very quiet, and you can get the underground into town very cheaply.

<Content>Couldn't be more helpful Due to a reservation hiccup my wife and I only spent two nights in this hotel when we should have been there for five. However the Reception Staff of the hotel and the Manager could not have been more helpful. They arranged transfer of our luggage from an alternative hotel, arranged for fruit in our room both at the alternative hotel and at the Abba Sants and ensured we had one of the best rooms at the Abba Sants when we arrived. Our room and indeed the entire hotel was spotlessly clean and all staff were extremely pleasant and cheerful. The Breakfast Buffet was to a very high standard and the Dinner we had in the Hotel Restaurant on our final evening in Barcelona was excellent. The hotel couldn`t be better located only around 300 metres from the Barcelona Main Railway Station to and from which regular (every 30 minutes) trains travel to Barcelona`s Main Airport - a 20 minute journey. In addition around 150 metres from the hotel entrance there is an entrance to the Sants-Estacio Underground Railway Station and hence access to Barcelona`s comprehensive transport system. This hotel is a real find in a major tourist city like Barcelona and we would not hesitate to recommend it to other visitors to the city.

<Content>Great stay at the Abba Sants! I stayed at the Abba Sants in November 2003. The hotel was excellent and my room was very clean. The hotel staff was courteous and my stay was very enjoyable. The room actually had three large beds and it was spacious. The bathrooms are very nice. One really great feature was the proximity to the Sants Train and Metro station (just down the street). I was able to catch the metro daily and an overnight train to Paris quite easily. I would definitely stay here again!

<Content>Looking for 5* comfort? Hi! We went to Barcelona for the valentine weekend 2004, we stayed in the Abba Sants hotel, it was lovely, it was so clean, friendly and very close to the city centre. The breakfast and room service was brilliant. The rooms were fantastic too. very big, king size beds, completed marble bathrooms. For very high class and comfort this hotel is a must!!
