<Content>Take Very Great Care in Dealing with this hotel! Last August I needed one night's cheap accommodation in Amsterdam, and booked at the Nieuw Slotania. Unfortunately I mistook the date, and booked it, not one month and three days ahead, but just 3 days ahead.I immediately realised my mistake and telephoned the hotel to ask if they could alter the date - they instructed me to alter the date through the website I had used. However I found the website had no facilities to amend or cancel the booking and instructed users to contact the hotel directly. I emailed the Nieu Slotania to point this out, but got nowhere, so I emailed them again formally cancelling the booking unless they would amend the date at no additional cost to me. I got no reply to this email. All this was completed within the next 36 hours, that is, shortly before the forty-eight hour deadline for cancelling the booking.Some time later I realised that I had been charged the full room price on my bank account. I emailed yet again to request a refund, but again got no response.I eventually turned to the UK office of the Dutch Tourist Board, and finally I got my refund in response to their intervention.In summary - I can give no review of the hotel, but report the above as simple fact - and record my thanks to the Dutch Tourist Board.

<Content>Center of amsterdam dont make me laugh bad hotel bad prices worse service Firstly Everyone has different reviews of this place but I think you need to look at the whole picture, would there be so many bad reviews if it was so good. Secondly I travel a lot and have to say this is right up (or down) there with the worst of them. So we arrive in amsterdam 14 of us and get the taxis to the hotel no problems about 20 mins from airport. We arrive at the hotel and are told that we cannot check in until 2:00pm, fair enough we are only 10 minutes outside the center of amsterdam (or so we are led to believe) so we decided to go for a walk some asian guy outside the hotel points out the direction to walk in, looking round the immediate area it looks rough and is predominantly turkish, all the women are in hijabs, anyway we walk for 20 minutes and Im thinking where are the canals and great architecture? its basically all pre fab concrete buildings and the turkish area is big. Eventually we spotted a bar and went in. The lady behind the counter seemed surpised to see us and was quite happy to help us out and made us welcome. So we asked for directions to the main area of the city, Dam square is a good place to start, she told us another 15 minutes on a tram. Nice. After eventually getting to the middle of amsterdam we spent a couple of hiours there and managed to get back to our hotel to check in, taxis ranged between 20 - 45 euros to where we were. We went to book in and gave our booking reference, the guy behind the counter said he had no record of it even though we had paid 230 euros deposit, he said we should have had the confirmation sheet, upon producing this he still denied we had paid any deposit so basically we lost our deposit and all had to pay an extra 15 euros each per person taking our original price from 80 euros for two nights to 95, I have never met such unhelpful people in my life. Our hotel rooms were cramped little dorms with pillars in the middle of the room, the sort of room you'd pay around 15 to 20 pounds for in the uk, beds were metal bunk beds, no wardrobes or storage and the tiniest window ever so it was like a sauna. I checked hotel rates in the middle of amsterdam and I'd say this even at peak time you can get cheaper than this place for 2 people 4 people or more, also you will save cash on your travelling. 3 star is a joke for this place and it gives a bad first impression of the dutch people.If you are in a small group i would avoid this place after daylight hours, unles you get a taxi right up to the front door, at least 2 of our taxi drivers asked us why we were staying so far out and one, a very helpful iranian guy said the place was rife for muggings and stabbings he told us a bunch of rowdy blokes that we should be careful, so girls and smaller groups take care.

<Content>very bad, shocking. This hotel seemed good from what i had seen on the internet, but most of all the price did draw me in. you really do get what you pay for, its cheap, dirty and nasty. the staff were rude and then pretended not to know english when i complained about our room. we booked a double onsuite room, but the bathroom was down the coridoor with no lock on it so all the men in the next room would use it and left it dirty.the breakfast was basic but more like a car boot sale then a breckfast.this hotel is situated in a very dirty scary neighbourhood, and it took 30 to 40 minutes to get in to the town each day, so that was an added cost when their website told us it was 10 minutes. basically if your looking for a cheap hotel in amsterdam, then its worth paying a small amount more to be situated in the town, if you think of how much you will save on the bus fare then its worth it.this hotel ruined our stay in amsterdam. do not stay there!!!

<Content>Not that bad! My partner booked a weekend in Amsterdam for my 30th and we stayed at the Nieuw Hotel Slotania in Amsterdam. The accommodation is basic, but clean and comfortable. We had a double room, with a TV (several English channels available - not that you want to waste time watching tv!). The hotel also had four computers which you can use to browse the internet and check emails. These are vey popular though, so you might want to jump on one before breakfast! (ie before the teens get up!)The hotel serves a continental breakfast of cereal, plus bread, jams, cold meat and boiled eggs.The downside is that the hotel is a little way from the town centre. (about 20 to 30 mins by tram or bus). The buses and trams do run every 10 minutes though. Your best bet is to get a travel pass for the duration of your stay so you can jump on and off trams and buses without worrying about getting tickets for each trip. These arent very expensive - works out about 拢4 a day. Another tip is to buy the I Amsterdam card as that includes an unlimited travel swipe card, plus free entry to 20 of the museums and two canal boat cruises.You can buy thiis here: [--] or at the tourist info at the airport.This costs from 鈧?3 for 24 hours, or 鈧?3 for 48 hoursOpposite the hotel are several shops, inlcuding an Aldi, where you can stock up on essentials. There is also a Febo right next to the hotel - one of those famous vending machine takeaway bars! I didnt try these though as Im vegetarian and wasnt sure what was meat free! ( all instrucitons in Dutch!)

<Content>Do Not stay here!!!!!!! This hotel is incomparable - it is located in a bad area of Amsterdam and you will regret having chosen this place! It will ruin your time in Amsterdam, which has so much to offer! As said before, the neigborhood is dangerous and dirty, a less afluent area of Amsterdam. The staff of Nieuw Slotania is not friendly: our room was not cleaned once!!! We asked them to clean it a few times and they said they would - however of course they did not. The breakfast was really bad, but we were mostly angry about the dirty and ugly room. When we left we told them that we were dissatisfied with the service: we exchanged email addresses and they promised to get in touch with us. We emailed explaining our situation again and they only replied once saying they would investigate in our case. I emailed many times but never received a reply - they do not provide their customers with service. Why would they care about someone who has already left anyways? While we stayed and complained about the dirty room they called the cleaning lady to explain the situation - she said she wasn't responsible to clean our room and our mess!! We only wanted her to make our bed and give us new towels. Unbelievable! Do not stay here, it will make you angry and leave you with a bad impression of Amsterdam/Netherlands and it doesnt have to be that way!!

<Content>Ignore the bad reviews in here!! Its a nice basic Cheap Hotel We stayed in the Slotainia from 16th-20th May. After reading some of the reviews left by other people after we had made the booking - We felt like we wanted to cancel but we thought we would just see how it went. The hotel its self is nothing flash. You basically get what you pay for - Cheap accomodation with friendly and helpful hotel staff. The rooms are of a clean standard (very basic) you get a bed, bathroom with Shower and a TV in the room. Also there is a complimentary breakfast of a morning between 7am - 10am which is continental but enough to set you up for the day. The only problem you may find is that from the hotel to the centre of Amsterdam is a 20minute bus/tram ride away, which can get pretty costly if your doing it 2-3 times a day or there are more than 4 or you. I would highly recommend this hotel and enjoyed my stay. In the future i think I would look for a hotel closer to the centre of Amsterdam to save time and money on the Bus/Tram journey times. Overall the hotel is cheap friendly and excellent choice for a cheap trip to amsterdam.

<Content>Not the best, not the worst I have stayed at this hotel twice now. Once in May last year and April 2007. On the first trip, they gave me a twin room even though I called to confirm the details of the reservation for a double room the day before . The phone in the twin room didn't work but the bed was comfortable and the room clean. Second night they moved us to a double room where the hair dryer didn't work and the bath was dirty.For the second stay this April, the room had the most uncomfortable bed I have ever slept on and the sheets were too small so that I kept waking up on a bare mattress. The shower also leaked all over the floor. For those who are there for the weed, there is now a big sign up saying that marijuana can't be smoked in the hotel.Having said all that, for the price, it is not the worst hotel in the world. The tram is right across the road and it takes about 15 - 20 minutes to get to the centre of town. If you are on a budget, it is better than a lot of hostels.

<Author>marisa_free_spirit
<Content>not the best well before me and my partner went to the Dam his sister managed to get us a great deal for flights and the hotel, I read a great review and saw the pictures and thought it looked great, the hotel actually looked lovely in the foyer and up the stairs. We arrived at 9am so we couldn't book in until 2pm so we had a look round dam square etc. we found that it costs 16.50 euros for a 5 day tram/bus/metro ticket that can be used unlimited day and night on any of the above. when we arrived at the hotel i was a bit disappointed at the room but it was mainly just somewhere to kip for the night, we did have a leaking toilet and when we used the shower it flooded the bathroom but we soon sorted that out. the no food drink or smoking in the room bit did put us off but we smuggled them all in put a shower cap over the smoke detector and smoked in the bathroom, that included cannabis, we never got caught. i was very upset to realise the cleaners had been through our luggage while we were out and also opened two of our cans of beer, but then nothing else was missing and we couldn't really complain cause we was breaking the rules!! i wouldn't use this hotel again mainly for the reason it was so far out but at a push and nowhere else available i suppose it would do. i never thought it was a dangerous area but i did see police outside the hotel every day. it didn't put us off enjoying our stay in amsterdam!!

<Content>The other reviewers must have stayed in a different hotel! I booked this hotel without reading TripAdvisor's reviews, which I normally do all the time. Just after booking it, I realized my mistake and went online to check it out. Confronted with one absolutely terrible review after another, I was understandably anxious about my stay.Luckily, I can say that the previous reviews are completely unfounded. It may be that the place has come under new management, but I didn't experience any of the problems other reviewers had.First, the hotel staff was helpful. The hotel offers complimentary breakfast buffets downstairs in the mornings, and while it's nothing to write home about (coffee, toast, eggs, bacon, etc.), it's filling.I rented a double room with a friend for somewhere in the range of $40 a night (per person, so around $80/night). The room was small, but neat. It featured free TV, with quite a few channels, including CNN, National Geographic and more. Shower supplies are provided (bath towel, shampoo, conditioner, etc.).The hotel also offers free internet access via a computer set up in the upstairs lounge. It was a nice gesture, so you can check email, or figure out places to go.The only downside was it was quite far outside of the city - a good 15-20 minute ride by tram. You can get there from the city center very easily, however, by taking the Number 21 tram. The stop for the Slotania is three stops after the Flughaven stop (you go under a bridge).Also, warning to marijuana smokers: There is NO smoking allowed in the hotel or its rooms. If you are caught, they kick you out. Just a warning.Overall, I didn't mind staying at the place at all. If I were to return to Amsterdam, I'd probably try to stay somewhere inside the city itself for convenience if it cost the same. The hotel was nice, but a bit too far for my tastes.

<Content>Beyond belief Please do not go here.Be warned,it needs a complete overhaul before it could be classified as a dump.If a hurricane were to hit this hotel I would imagine it would cause about 拢500.000 worth of IMPROVEMENTS.We had to change rooms 3 times in a 3 night stay .We actually looked at 7 others (all of which were wet from leaking windows)It advertises free bus service cocktail bar room service we saw none of thisWhen we did complain to the manager (I took down the wet bedding as proof) he knew of these problems but did not seem to care.After complaining all he said was  if you dont like it dont visit Amsterdam try a country-side hotelI will never go there again.I think I will go to the centre of Holland in future and use the hotels there instead (staff much friendlier and hotels a lot quieter)Amsterdam Tourist Board should take this hotel off there list as it does them no justice , Amsterdam has much more to offer than this sort of accommodationDont say you have not been warned!!!!!!!Adrian

<Content>100% awful I arrived with a colleague for a 3 night conference in Amsterdam .Yet when the cab driver who picked us up from Amsterdam Slot station said 'Now be careful, this is not a good area'. .. we were worried 'After all It was supposed to be 3 stars. The boys hanging around outside...the men inside who called out ' pretty ladies ' as we walked by ..no not a compliment ...just threatening. Thank goodness I was with someone or I would have been totally intimidated . Well we ended up getting out after breakfast and not returning til late. It was difficult to sleep and yes we did wedge our doors. Noisy, no air...very smelly. Absolutely 100% .awful

<Content>back to basics I booked this through Last Minute. I don't know where they get the 3 stars from - it's very basic, but you get what you pay for. We travelled by tram into city centre every day, cheap and cheerful takes about 20 mins and they arrive every 15 mins. Get a bus/tram/metro map and you're sorted. It is a rough area but as a place to sleep it's not a problem. As for the sound proofing maybe it depends what floor you're on - wasn't a problem for us. We saw about 50 US kids arrive at one point but never, heard or saw them again!Cheap and cheerful sums it up.

(it is bad promotion) Then he told us that they have one more hotel and there is a free rooms. He told us that we have paid in advance 60 EUR per night in single room. Then he called a taxi for us to drive us to another hotel. When we arrived a taxi said that everything is ok we dont need to pay (ther was approx 30 EUR on taximeter, can you bellieve this!!). And finally when we have entered IT WAS A HOSTEL!!!! Inner Amsterdam. I have a room with four beds!!!! Disaster!!!! And I paid for this ----!!!, 60 EUR/per night in HOSTEL!!!

<Content>It wasnt that bad My best friend and I went to this hotel for 3 nights in Feb to celebrate my 30th birthday. We read all these reviews a few nights before flying to Amsterdam and were dreading the hotel. But we were pleasantly suprised. The staff were very friendly, the hotel was clean and our room and bedding was very clean. It wasnt the best hotel in the world, but we got what we paid for and I dont think the reviews on here are very accurate. Yes the hotel is quite away from Amsterdam centre, but the number 21 bus stops just across the road from the hotel and goes every 15 minutes. The bus journey into Amsterdam is about 20 minutes. It wasnt any hassle at all. There is also a nice shopping centre opposite the hotel and on tuesday mornings there is a little market opposite the hotel.We wouldnt hesitate booking a room in this hotel again.

<Content>A Real Piece of Work!!! STAY AWAY We arrived at the hotel in the afternoon, and it was quite far from the centre of Amsterdam and the area was pretty run down. The hotel lobby was okay and looked pretty good for a cheap place to put your head down. The room was simple but big. Now thats all the pleasantries out of the way. As we walked through the upstairs lobby seating area, there was a group of men smoking joints. We then entered the room and the cupboard had a rotting pizza left on top of it and the room had a very strong smell of smoke, and i dont mean cigarette smoke. I told reception and they cleaned the room properly. We didnt think anything more of it as we just wanted to get out. Later whilst we were asleep we were woken by scuttling noises in the ceiling. When we checked out in the morning I told the manager about the noises which I said sounded like rats. He didnt apologise and I quote said  No, no, there are no rats, they are mice in the roof. We were so appauled but he was just not interested. Since I booked it through a broker I will be in touch with them about my stay for a refund. This place is beyond reproach and I have no idea how it has any stars at all. It truly is a real piece of work. Its not suitable for anyone to stay in.

<Content>complete joke, Please stay away My girlfriend and I booked this hotel since it was rated as a three-star Hotel.  It was a good thing i spoke Dutch , since the receptionists English was very poor and abrubted.  Upon arrival, our room was not ready yet, and we were given alternate one, promising that our original room would be bigger and ready at 3 PM. The room we were given was claustrophibic, walls white, same with the sheets, NOT as displayed on all the photo's placed on the website. There was a TV, but it had poor signal, the make up mirror was nowhere to be found, the bathroom was to small for an infant to fit in, and half of the ceiling was lowered, overall NOT a very welcoming room. But the worst and most profanic thing about the room was that the windows had a measurement of less than 1m2 and the foundation of the windows was home built. Of course we went back to the reception at 3 PM and asked for our original room where we payed for. however, we got told that our room would be even smaller. It didnt leave us with a good feeling about Dutch hospitality and we would advise evryone to avoid this hotel at all times , since no one would like to spend 50 pounds a night on a room worth of 1 star.
