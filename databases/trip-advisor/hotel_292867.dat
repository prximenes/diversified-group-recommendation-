<Content>Warm Sun, Freezing Showers My boyfriend and I have visited the Dominican Republic before. We pretty much know what to expect when booking a stay at a 4 star all inclusive resort down there. Clearly, the star system that we use in the US doesn't translate but we're not picky so we went ahead and booked at the Caribe Club Princess even though we read the mixed reviews on Trip Advisor.The resort lobby is nice and the staff at the front desk were very nice and helpful. Our room was nothing special but we had a balcony overlooking the pool and it was clean. The biggest issue I had with our room and the entire trip was that we did not have hot water in our room from the moment we arrived until the moment we left. We started out thinking it was funny, calling to the front desk to complain and then thinking the water would get hot within a few hours. By day three, after calling the front desk, tracking down maintenance on our own and talking to our travel agent, it was no longer funny. Let me tell you that nothing ruins a wonderful day at the beach like coming back to your room to get ready for a nice evening and taking a frigid shower. It is just absolutely ridiculous that in six days, they made no headway in fixing the problem and made no apologies about it. The worst part is that on our last day, they were extremely eager to flip our room. The fact that they were going to put another pair of unsuspecting vacationers in that room with no hot water, no warning, no explanation seemed like awful hospitality. The entire hot water situation made me seriously question the hotel's management. The Dominican Republic is not the place to go if you want to eat gourmet meals. The food at the Caribe Club Princess is not stellar but it is exactly the same as it has been at other, more expensive and better reviewed hotels in the DR. They have french fries, hamburgers, pizza, etc at the buffetts. so if you are really nervous about local foods, you can always turn to the basics. The food is nothing special but is the same as you would get at any other resort. The Mexican restaurant (El Sombraro) and the Italian Restaurant (Mama Mia) were quite good. You have to make reservations at these places but it's well worth it . The first night, the only reservation we could book was at the Dominican Restaurant which was I was not a fan of. With items like snail meat and goat on the menu, you may want to avoid this one unless you are an adventerous eater. My boyfriend and I spread the food around on our plates and then hit the buffett.As far as other hotel ammenities. The shows at night were much like the shows at any other hotel. The security was fine. We definitely felt safe during our stay. The beach and pool areas were great. When there's sun, waves, and free yummy cocktails, I'm always happy! Afterall, the beach and the sun is the real reason for the trip, right?I would absolutely visit the DR again BUT would likely try another resort. The service could have been friendlier but it wasn't a deal breaker for this resort. The kicker was the hot water and the resort's inability to do ANYTHING about it. Our trip was still wonderful but there was nothing about the Caribe Club Princess that makes me want to go back. It's not the priciest hotel and I understand that mediocrity goes along with that but I'd rather have mediocrity and a hot shower somewhere else.

<Content>The Good The Bad And The Cockroach My husband and myself together with another family stayed at the Caribe Club Princess from November 14, 2008 to November 21, 2008. Adult ages 24-27 and kids 2 and 7.We booked this vacation thinking that this hotel in fact was a 4 star as represented by Sunwing Vacations. We were very disappointed to discover that this hotel in fact should not be rated as a four star hotel for the following reasons. To commence once we arrived at the hotel we were told that our rooms were not ready, fine no problem here as we completely understand that it takes time in order for the rooms to be cleaned etc. We were told to return to the front lobby desk at 3pm. At 3pm we returned to the lobby desk to be told that yes are rooms were ready and that we would be on the first floor. We advised that neither couples would like to stay on the first floor (we had specifically requested a 2nd or 3rd floor room) and the other couple that travelled with us had two small children and didn鈥檛 want to stay on the first floor for the fear of having one of their children open the sliding doors and walking out. While we were awaiting to see if we could be accommodated on a 2nd or 3rd floor we witnessed a complaint from a couple staying at the Tropical Princess that their room had been broken into via the sliding door. They were located on a first floor room. We then went back to talk to the front lobby reception and were advised that all they could offer us was a room on the first floor and on Saturday, the next day, they would move us to another floor. At this point a lady came out and advised the gentleman we were dealing with in Spanish that he could not offer us those rooms as those rooms have 鈥減roblems鈥? Both the gentleman and the lady then disappeared and once the came back they told us that they had found another room for us on the second floor.At this point we were all very happy to know that we could finally go to our room. Once we arrived at our rooms we discovered that we had been placed on the Tropical Princess side of the resort when we in fact were booked for the Caribe Club Princess side. It is not that this was a big issue but considering the fact that we paid more money to stay at Caribe Club Princess we were very disappointed. We expressed our concerns with the manager of client relations and she advised that at the moment these were the only rooms available. We agreed to stay in these rooms until the following day when we were told something would become available on the Caribe Club Princess side. The other couple travelling with us went into their room and we went to do the same. Well once I scanned my card to be let into the room I discovered two naked ladies in the room which I had been assigned. They didn鈥檛 speak a word of English and luckily the manager was still on the premises and I advised her that the front reception had issued me a key for a room that was already assigned to someone else. On top of this being unacceptable behavior it is also a great security risk that the hotel doesn鈥檛 even know which rooms they are allotting to which people. At this point I was very frustrated and this was not the dream vacation I had envisioned. I then went to the front reception with my friend and advised them of the trouble. They found other rooms for us but were unable to explain why the mistake of giving me someone else鈥檚 room key happened in the first place. The rooms we were assigned on the Tropical Princess side were utterly disgusting, they were outdated, the balcony door lock was broken and the front door lock had been tampered with. At this point I did not feel safe in the hotel at all but told myself that it was only for one night until they could place us on the Caribe club Princess side.The next day we were thankfully as promised moved to two rooms on the Caribe Club Princess side and I started to feel that this vacation was going to be a good one after all. Well that is not what happened at all.On Tuesday November 18, 2008 we made a reservation to go to the Mamma Mia (Italian) restaurant for dinner with the other couple we were travelling with. We arrived at the restaurant and everything was going well and we all ordered appetizers. Everyone except my husband order calamari and my husband ordered bruschetta. When the appetizers were delivered I saw that my husband was staring at his plate. To my disbelief on his plate was a cockroach. I could not believe what I was seeing. We were staying at a 4 star hotel and my husband was delivered his bruschetta with a cockroach on it. Not only was there a cockroach but it was dead with its legs up in the air and appeared to have been cooked with the cheese on the plate. At this point all of us lost our appetite and got up and left the restaurant. We called our server to the door and advised him of what had happened. When this happened we could have made a huge scene about it but didn鈥檛 want to disgust the other patrons in the restaurant. At this point we went to the buffet to have some fruit as we were all starving. After being at the buffet for a little while we were greeted by the foods and services manager (Milton) and the chef of the Mamma Mia restaurant and we were apologized to. We were offered a complimentary dinner at El Pescador or La Cava because of our worries. We advised that we would think about it and let him know the next day. The next day while we were having breakfast Milton approached us and asked if we had made a decision we advised him that we would go to El Pescador that same night. That night we went to El Pescador but dining at this hotel was not the same for us after we had seen the cockroach. We didn鈥檛 eat the same and were disgusted for the rest of our stay, needless to say that we were not able to eat normally for the rest of the week.On Thursday November 20th we were approached by the concierge lady advising that the hotel had been told of the incident and that the hotel wanted to offer us a dinner in compensation for what had happened, we advised her that we had already been to a dinner the previous night and that in no way did we feel compensated for what happened nor were we able to enjoy our meals since then. She asked us to please consider this and advised that if we accepted this offer we would have to sign a release form which basically stated that the dinner was in compensation for the cockroach being on the plate of food and that we were not to make any claim with the hotel, management or tour operator because of the situation that had occurred. We advised her that we would not be signing the release form as we felt that everyone including the tour operator should be aware of the type of food that is being served to people at this hotel. She was not very happy about this.Needless to say when Friday morning came we were more than happy to be leaving this hotel and at the same time very upset that we spend our money going to hotel that was rated four stars but yet are serving cockroaches with their food.We are very disappointed with all that happened at a time when we were supposed to be resting and on vacation and because of this we will never again visit a Princess resort.Hope this review helps someone realize this is not a sanitary place to be !

<Content>The worst service  After staying at the Paradissus hotel next door for 3 days we moved to the Caribe Club Princess...That was a BIG mistake.All inclusive there does not mean all inclusive, 2 restaurants areexcluded, in room safe excluded, water spots excluded...and the list goes on. customer service is completely null ...they simply don't care. The bed in the room was awful with a sinking hole in the middle and the room smelled like urine...YES the beach is beautifuland all and all the staff is nice but they don't have a clue what the word customer service means. I understand that it is one of the oldest hotels in the area but the 4 1/2 stars is a TOTAL overstatement...Don't go there with any expectations.It is just not worth it!

<Content>hmm..where to start?? brother got MUGGED ON RESORT?..[--] front desk??... Well let's just start off by saying that the resort was beautiful and we had a prime spot close to the buffet, pool and beach. But it was too bad that their food was garbage, and although we had access to all 5 a la cartes the portions were very very small and everything tasted like garbage.I must say that the best thing about the resort was the activities staff!!...always smiling and having a great time around the pool and on the beach!!!And i must say that that was the best lobby parties i have ever been to before. Thank you activities staff,, you guys are awesome!Although we had an amazing time with the activities staff and bar staff, we had a horrible experience when we were ON THE RESORT....my brother ended up getting mugged outside of the disco and the man held a HUGE MACHETTE KNIFE to my brothers throught....my brother thought that that was the end of his life then and there. But thank god he could run as fast as he did. So the man got all of my brothers money, his bank card, which he somehow managed to withdraw over $1000, as well as his silver chain and braclet. We were just disgusted of how something like that could happen on a 4 star resort...doesn't make sense to me at all. It's horrible when something like that had to happen on the resort right in the middle of our vacation. To not even feel safe on the resort that we booked our 1 week vacation on is the worst feeling to have especially having 3 days left to spend on that resort.Bottom line, the front desk lobby staff and guest services staff were absolutly horrible. They didnt help us out at all. They screwed us around more then anything. HORRIBLE when you have to go to the front desk for help and no one is capable or willing to help!! DISGUSTING...so due to the mugging incodent and the usless front lobby staff I STRONGLY DO NOT reccommend this resort to anyone. STAY AWAY, it's NOT SAFE!!!!

<Content>2nd Time Round Here- Still just as FANTASTIC!! This is the second time my partner and I returned to the Caribe Princess, and we certainly didn't regret our decision to go back.When we went last year it was amazing, and this year was the same, if not even better!!!On arrival you are greeted with tropical juice and such a warm and friendly attitude from the staff! They seem to bend over backwards to help you in any way, they cannot do enough for you.Again our room was spotless...even better this year as we had a pool view and a view of the sea which was brilliant. The fridge was stocked up EVERY day with PLENTY of water and soft drinks. Our maid did a fantastic job at cleaning our room and ensuring every day, we had clean towels and bedding.The pools again are just faultless. We found that you did not need to fight for a sunbed or even lay your towel out early in the morning. There was plenty available for everyone without being at all cramped.In my opinion the food was fabulous! They had an amazing selection for any food lover. Different kinds of meats, vegetables, desserts and fruits.Throughout the week me and my partner dined at 3 of the all inclusive restaurants in the resort: The chinese, Mexican and Italian, and again they were excellent. At one point during our dining we had the choice of 3 drinks placed in front of us!! water, wine and soft drink! The staff were so kind and friendly and the food served was just like your excellent 3 course Italian restaurant u get in town that you would pay lots of money for!!! The resort itself was faultless again. The gardens are so well kept, beautiful gardens with trees, plants flowers and wildlife running around all over the place- gives you something to look at and admire while you are walking around. Everytime u passed a member of staff they always greeted and smiled at you, no matter what they were doing! They really made u feel like one of the family.We took advantage of the tennis courts and had a great time. They have so much to offer you. The lobby is a fantastic place just to sit and chill out any time of the day or night, with the bar open serving plenty of yummy cocktails!The entertainment was very amusing- they even put on a show of the infamous thriller dance by Micheal Jackson which was really good and showed so much effort!Finally- the best part- the beach. ABSOLUTELY STUNNING...again! Again u did not have 2 fight for any sunbeds as there were plenty available any time of the day. The beach was clean and the waters sparkling blue. The beach hut is really good too if u just fancy a quick hotdog and chips at lunchtime, or a nice sprite to cool u down! Again this is all at your fingertips, you pretty much don't have 2 walk anywhere.On a particular choppy sea day, we borrowed some body boards (which is included) and had a great time surfing the wavesSo as u can see, theres plenty to do in Caribe Club, and I would DEFINATELY recommend it to anyone, and WILL definately be going back in the near future.Caribe club has everything u could need and want.Do not listen to the fussy reviews...its absolutely perfect.

<Content>Enjoyed this hotel very much!!! First of all after reading the reviews I was a bit nervous about going to this hotel but I truly believe everyone's experience is not the same but I did get a load of good solid informatiion from the reviews that I did read.Upon arrival our room was ready and our bags were taken directly to our room and the trolley that passes by the hotel periodically will get you to anywhere you would want to go around the resort. Our room was very cold and very clean thanks to the wonderful maids like Mirta. Our fridge was always stocked with bottled water and diet soda which is what we requested. The hotel pools and beach were magnificent and the people and staff like Jose from the pool bar were very pleasant and made our stay enjoyable.The breakfast, lunch and dinner buffets were all excellent and always had a good variety of selections and good service from our waitor Alberto who always greeted us with a smile.We took advantage of the resorts tennis courts, shows, archery, pool table and bicycles for extra things to do and they even supplied the trolley to take us to their casino for free which is only 5 minutes away. We went on 2 tours the monster truck safari a full day which was awesome and for the low price of $70.00 per person we did everything including riding on horses and it included a delicious lunch. The other tour was the atv crazy wheels which was a blast and that was 1/2 day.To shop for souvenirs you best bet is to go to plaza bavarro which is also about 5 minutes away to bargain with the locals and we got good prices for our items including $2.00 key chains and shot glasses. You do pay a one time fee of $10.00 to enter their country and these people work very very hard all day long and they deserve tips and they appreciate anything you give to them.All in all our trip was excellent and you should bring your own suntan lotion and bug spray etc because at the resort they are very expensive. We would definitely go back to this resort in the future and again our stay was truly wonderful.

<Content>Lovin the Dom Rep 08 having only just returned from our first trip to the caribe club princess i feel it only fair to add to the generally positive feedback of this beautiful resort. a seamless transfer and welcoming check in were followed by two weeks of excellent service, smiling faces and fun activities for all. fair to say that the food may be somewhat questionable as almost all in our party of 17 travelling from ireland spent all too long nestled on the loo's!! this may also have been helped along by the fairly harsh tasting alcoholic drinks available, an upgrade to premium would be advised altough a little pricey at $22 per day.however all in all a charming resort complex with sprawling gardens with very frequent transport from end to end. excellent pool facilities and daytime games, and a stunning beach that will eat up ur days and a broad range of restaurants and bars to take care of the nites!!holidaymakers range from north and central america thru to most european countries being represented, and most seemed pleasant and ready to enjoy the party.i certainly would return to the CCP, altho next time i'd bring a stronger stomach.kevin mc g N.Ireland

<Content>Booking for next year... Firstly ignore the bad review that has been written! I have just come back from 2 weeks at the Caribe Princess and it was fantastic!!!!! The hotel is great, very clean and tidy(maids we're cleaning in the lobby at 10pm), rooms are very spacious, cleaned everyday, mini bar in the room which is re-stocked everyday with soft drinks and water. Theres 3 pools to choose from the main pool by the buffet resturant has entertainment allday, the animation guys work very hard and try to get everyone involved, their also very friendly and will just come over for a chat. Evening entertainment was good, shows every night in the Theatre, then on to the lobby for some tropical music which was fun! There are many different restuants to choose from, the main buffet resturant has different themes every evening, but is repeated each week, wasnt a problem though. The waiters were very happy to help couldnt fault them at all. The Le Matica bar served food during the night so if you got hungry from all the dancing then head on down.The main lobby is about a 10 min walk from the rooms, theres plenty of wildlife around including 2 ducks that never left each other. There is a bus service that runs frequently, just stick your hand out and jump on, it will take you around the complex. Overall this has been the best place ive stayed in and ive traveled alot! Take advantage of the things to offer and you'll never be bored.

<Content>Loved CCP Punta Cana If you are looking for the best staff on earth CCP Punta Cana is the place to be. The staff especially the animators were friendly and extremely accomodating. The overall quality and cleaniness of the rooms were average, the mini bar was stocked with soda  water. I'm a bit picky when it comes to food so to me the food wasn't all that great but there was an abundance of food so you will not go hungry. My husband loved the food as did my 16yr old and her friend. We all at one point suffered stomach cramps/diarhea(can't avoid this if you are from the U.S.) read Dept of State Background notes for Dominican Republic or anywhere you travel outside the US to get reccomendations on shots or preventive meds to take before going abroad. Everyone we met from the U.S. had some type of stomach ailment but it doesn't last long. Most of the tourist were friendly with the exception of the Germans/Italians they were snobbish and they were extremely territoral but we didn't care because the area of the beach that they seemed to take over was soooo boring as with the area that they commanded in the buffet area. The theater was entertaing and the disco was lively.Overall, my experience was great., I felt safe (plenty of security) my (16yr) daughter and friend were free to roam the resort without my husband and I worrying . I highly reccommend spending the extra $$$ to upgrade to VIP, free massage, rum and cigars, motorized sports and internet access.Would I go again? yes indeed, I'm booking a group of 20 for next year

<Content>Love it and coming back soon!!!! I don't know where did all those bad reviews come from!!! It's very beautiful, food is amazing (every day different menu). yes, rooms are four stars, but how much time do you need to spend in the room? I was there with three kids and they are begging me to go back! But most of all animation team is amazing, I took streching classes every morning, then salsa lessons, then at night amazing parties in the beautiful lobby. I am going back toTropical Princess for sure!!!

<Content>Forget it........... (The only one good department,which is owned private,is the diving and water-sports base)I had 14 days 鈥淗olidays鈥?booked over BOOKIT in Caribe Club Princess, and I would like to place this complain about the Hotel, it鈥檚 simply awful...I am working since 11 years in tourism and in resorts, and I never saw a so bad serviced hotel...I works by myself as a Entertainment Manager in a lot of Resorts,4 Star, 5 Star, 5+ stars, but this Hotel deserves not any 4 Stars, even 2 stars have to be decided really carefully......!!!! A call to the reception for a Dr. for a friend of me was ending up in 40 min. calling numbers they gave without answers and a Dr. who showed up in 1hr 45min....!!! 1. The Room: The Hotel Rooms (Room 1335) are divided by a wooden door to the neighbour room which has at the bottom 2-3 cm free place so You can even look into the neighbour room and You can hear the smallest noise which is made by neighbours, complaining 4 times over 2 sleepless nights to the reception couldn鈥檛 make the 4 young guys in my neighbour room quiet, 3rd day a personal visit to Guest Relation Services which is very arrogant, unfriendly and not ready and able to help, could say just that if I want I can change MY room, why should I live the discomfort of change all my stuff to another room when it鈥檚 not me who is disturbing anyone during all the night until the morning 06.00???In the 3rd night of my stay in morning 05.00 I called the reception and said to them if they are not able to get quiet 4 partying guys I鈥檒l do it myself in any way!!!Than just they sent a security guy to make them quiet... And when it was raining 2 nights during my stay there it was raining into my room from the roof!!!2. The Restaurant, Bars, Service: The Main Restaurant is in questions of cleanness very bad and unhygienic, cooks preparing the food are wearing very dirty shirts and the quality of food is very bad, I spend simply 14 days by eating Pasta, Pizza and Omelette cause the food variety was very poor and every day the same food...The Bars are very very dirty and the service in restaurant and the Bars are very slow cause they haven鈥檛 enough personal to serve, a order made in the beginning of lunch or dinner arrived after lunch or dinner was finished already or simply never arrived...And the service personal is very unfriendly like Your not welcome...The Staff is not speaking English at all, just the reception, and some Animators, but the service staff speaks no one word English and simple orders like a bottle of water or a coke was trying to be explained few minutes or simply came wrong drinks...3. Transfers was excellent, no problem with that...

<Content>Overall trip was OK We were traveling in the month of July. The hotel was not bad. The beach was beautiful. The sand was nice and soft. Great for playing with sand toys. Children had a blast! The pool was also very nice. There were a couple of different pools to go swimming in. However, the food and drinks were not that great! The drinks all seemed to be made with too much heavy syrup. We have been to Riviera Maya prior to this for an all inclusive and the Riviera Maya definitely had better alcoholic drinks. The children ordered virgin strawberry daquiri's and they did not like the taste of them. A couple of times, they made strawberry daquiri's with a pina caloda mix and strawberry syrup. Also, the food was not that great in the buffet. We all received upset stomach's and diaharria while on vacation. The food in the restaurants was OK. Overall, we had a good time. However, don't be surprised if you have stomach problems.

<Content>Great time, great trip- almost perfect... Just returned from Caribe Club Princess on Sunday, June 29. We had a group of 8, twenty-somethings, and overall, it was a great trip. Short version, we would return to this resotr. Relaxing time and enough going on that there is always something to do. Here is the long version:Arrived to beuatiful lobby. Rooms weren't ready, but we were there before check-in, so that was to be expected. We headed to the buffet for lunch and then headed to the bar, then to the pool. Pools (first and third specifcally) could use some cleaning. They are not your normal swimming pool blue. That being said, a large part of that is probably the sunblock and drinks from the swim up bar. Water was a good temp, no complaints. Beach is gorgeous! I am more of a pool person- hate sticky sand, but this is soft, smooth sand. Nice sea breeze all the time made the temps there, even in June/July very reasonable. We had heard there were lots of bugs, so we came prepared with bug spray, listerine to spray doorways, and afterbite for once you were bitten. Didn't need any of it. I think I was the only one in the group to get any bites, and I had two all week there! I would have gotten more then that at home. The constant breeze helps keep them at bay. We upgraded to the VIP package- booked through Apple Vacations, and apparently this isn't an option for everyone. If you can upgrade, do it!! It's well worth the extra $ up front. The first night there it rained, so instead of eating at the buffet, we ordered our free 24 hour room service (part of VIP) and headed to one of the rooms. We had our robes, a big umbrella, rum, beer, and cigars in the room when we arrived. One of the four rooms was missing theirs, but it was brought up a coupe of days later. Also, two of the four rooms were missing alarm clocks- strange, but they were eventually brought back to the rooms. We made dinner reservations for the rest of the trip. Tried the Chinese- probably the worst food on the property, I wouldn't waste a night on this one. Next night was Italian- not too great either. Mexican and Brazilian were both great. We repeated at the Brazilian restuarant as that was the one location that seemed to agree with everyone's systems the best. About that- someone (another guest) told us on arrival not to eat the eggs at breakfast. They had been there for over a week, and avoided the eggs, and hadn't had stomach problems. Most of us avoided them leaving for a very boring breakfast day after day. (think dry toast, boiled potatoes, and cut up hot dogs). Those that ate the eggs were in no worse shape then the rest, so if you like an omlet, go ahead and try it. We did the steak restaurant for our VIP dinner, and it was great. Good presentation, good service- long meal. We were there for over 2 hours, and did this the last night. Might have been better to do that during the middle of the trip, but good none the less. Within the first 3 days of being there, we had all gotten sick. Stomach cramping, nausea, etc. We tried forever to figure out what we had all eaten in common, and the only thing we can figure was the beer! We all avoided it the rest of the week and didn't have any more significant problems. Do take you imodium from home, and lots of tums- you will need them!!! I travel frequently, and often have some minor stomach troubles, but nothing like this, and never have I seen a whole group affected. They do have a shop on site that provides this, but they are expensive- $9 toothpaste. We did two excursions provided through our tour group. We did the Marinarium excursion- well worth it. Boat ride, snorkeling with sting rays and nurse sharks, and a booze cruise back to the bus. Good time had by all. We also did the ATV excursion. 2 in our group had been to Punta Cana in the fall, and said it was amazing. The one offered at the hotel was not the same tour. we saw a golf course, an old abandoned hotel, a rock quarry, etc. Not worth the $, and really not worth the open air bus ride with the exhaust pipe pointing in the passengar area the entire hour ride there. If you do an ATV excursion, make sure to get clarification before hand about what you will see. There is supposed to be a great one that takes you to a cave with a natural pool in it- not ours!Last few days were spent taking advantage of our motorized watersport (1 hour boat ride) and complimentary massage on the beach. Both were great. Don't do the boat ride if you are suseptible to sea sickness, or are not a frequent boater. It's a rough ride. We took drink containers with us with coolie cups around them to keep drinks cold. They were a big hit. We had a lot of people asking us where we got them, and even offering to buy them from us. (We found them at Walmart)- not quite a bubba keg, but perfect for what we wanted them for. Take something to put drinks in. The service at the pool bar was very slow. In fact, often, we got out and went to the beach bar b/c it was quicker. The bartender at the pool bar is constantly force feeding mamajuana shots to the guests, and he is the only one there, so forget about getting a regular drink. On the topic of bartenders- Kelvin is awesome. He works at the 24 hour bar in the afternoons and evenings. Very attentive and friendly. The bathroom near this bar is disgusting- probably the worst on property for good reason. It's closest to the swim up bar, the snack shack, and the 24 hour bar, so it gets pretty constant use. The day we arrived, there was no toilet seat in the women's. That was replaced the next day though. Rooms- our room was great. Since we were VIP, we were in rooms with balconies, partial pool and ocean view, vaulted ceilings, and a sunken living room. Great, and large enough for all 8 to sit and play games at night. We never had a problem with bugs in the room despite a few spills the first night- we were on the third floor. 2 of the other rooms did have very small ants. Not enough for them to complain about, and only really bothersome when food was left out. American applicances plug in with no adapters, take small bills for tips- it will greatly improve your service throughout the trip, and enjoy yourself. The facility as a whole is beautiful. Trip was relaxing, and we are ready to plan another adventure. If you have specific questions, feel free to write.

<Content>Beautiful Place, but terrible food and got very ill! Stayed at the Caribe Club Princess from July 3 through July 6, 2008. The beach and pool was beautiful. The staff was friendly and helpful. But the few positives cannot outweigh all the negatives.We used Apple Vacations and their staff was friendly and helpful. The Punta Cana airport was nice and easy to navigate. The Apple staff took us to the resort via airconditioned bus and it was about a 30 minute ride.Check in was easy and we had no problems with the front desk. However, I read all the tripadvisor posts before leaving and found many of the same situations occurring during my stay. The room keys assigned by the front desk didn't work upon check in and it took about two hours for a new set of room keys to arrive.The resort is fairly small, but the front desk/reception area is located a long distance away from the resort/rooms/pool area.My biggest dissatisfaction with the Caribe Club Princess was the food. It was awful. I have travelled everywhere (throughout the caribbean and mexico) and have been able to find something to eat to survive. Not here. Buffet was terrible. Snack bar was even worse. Only thing edible was a the desert bar (ice cream). I pretty much starved for 3 days. The food was prepared very poorly and the Caribe Club did little for variety. The same food on the buffet showed up at the specialty restaurants at night.The bread was always three days stale, the soda was watered down and the meat was always questionable. The service in the buffet was terrible, they pretty much ignore you (I was always polite and offered a tip..still didn't help.) On the second day I got very sick to my stomach and spent the rest of my trip sitting on the toilet. My wife had many of the same ailments, but not as bad as mine. I am still sick (3 days later) as I write this review. I did not drink anything but bottled water and only at the buffet once. The best part about the Caribe Club is the pool area and beach. The beach is amazing and one of the best I've seen. The pool is great. The activity staff goes out of their way to keep everyone entertained. The pool bar is staffed by Jose, who has a great personallity and aims to please. His drinks are strong and fast. Jose pushes a native drink called mamjuana, which is served as a shot. Mamjuana is a rum based drink with honey, cinamon and some local tree roots or bark. Jose was a bright spot for our trip everyday in the pool.This resort is primarily habitated by non-American guests. People from Canada, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, Germany, UK and Italy were all represented during our stay. Some of the guests from Puerto Rico were rather rude at times and became annoying at the pool, but they are from a different culture than Americans. Some of the travelers from Europe were not so courteous as well.We left the resort one day to tour a local cigar-maker since we were told that many of the cigars sold in the local stores in Punta Cana were forgeries. The prices at the local cigar-maker were much cheaper and well worth the money for the cab ride.Check out was easy at the Caribe Club. Apple provided a large air-conditioned bus again and transportation to the airport was very good. Leaving the Dominican Republic is much more of a hassle than getting there. They only had one crew working the security check point that was servicing the entire airport (probably 10-15 flights within a 2 hour period). This took forever and was not air conditioned. Therefore, all visitors were boarding their airplanes uncomfortable with sweaty attire.Overall, I would consider returning to the Dominican Republic in a few years, but would not stay or recommend the Caribe Club Princess. On the flight home another couple told us about their stay at the Paradisius and they had identical complaints.I will probably go back to the Mexican Riviera Maya for a quick inexpensive getaway next time.I am not generally a negative person, but I felt compelled to write this review. If you are going to Punta Cana, I would suggest paying some extra $$$ and going to a resort that is 5 star or better....then maybe this won't happen to you.

<Content>Nice for the money After reading some of the reviews on here I was apprehensive about this trip, but overall it was a good place especially for the money. First the good.... The rooms were all close to the pools, beach and restaurants which was a big plus for me. My room was always clean, the firdge was always stocked with plenty of soda and water and most importnatly the air conditioner kept the room VERY cold. Jose at the pool bar made the day at the pool fun and entertaining, the local beer is pretty good. The mexican specialty restaurant was EXCELLENT I could eat there every day (I suggest the chicken fajitas). One nice thing was they did not limit the number of nights you could eat at the specialty restaurants you just had to make reservations.Now the not so good.... If you can get a soda in the restaurants when they finally came out they were so watered down you might as well drink water. I was beginning to think that maybe Domincans did not drink anything with their meals because there were times we had our main course of food before they would even take a drink order. The food on the buffet was not good, lots of fish and other items most americans arent accustomed to eating. There were lots of locals from Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic that came in Friday night and took over the pool bar on Saturday, I say took over because they were so loud and obnoxious that no one wanted to be there anymore. Overall this was a good trip and I would definitely go back to Punta Cana, adn would consider going back to Caribe Club Princess if the price were right again.

<Content>Excellent hotel We arrived at Punta Cana on 9th June and after collecting our luggage made our way to the Caribe Club Princess. On arrival we were served juice and checked in pretty quickly. We got a safe key and hopped on the transport and were taken to our rooms. The bellboys followed on with our heavy suitcases.Our room was on the top floor of the building and overlooked the back which was fine. The room was clean and tidy and the air conditioning was great. All staff were friendly and I'd like to say hi to Clifford down near the beach area selling trips, he was always polite and said hi. We had a massage near the pool which was great. We loved the bar down next to the beach after the shows and the lobby entertainment. It was so nice to chill out on the beach. The entertainment/shows were good especially the lion king and the dancers were fab. We had such a great time and we thought the food was fine. We also booked into the Brazillian Restaurant and the Chinese which were both very good. All in all a great holiday and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone. I especially enjoyed all the rum and coco loco's.

<Content>Very Nice Hotel, Food needs Improvement!!! We returned home Tuesday June 24 after 7 night stay with party of 7, 4 adults, 3 children. Overall the physical plant, buildings,pools and grounds are in very good condition. The beach is beautiful, the rooms clean. Basically we had a delightful time. The only major complaint was the quality of the food. Having stayed in all inclusives in Mexico and in Puerto Plata, DR and elsewhere this was the WORST food we have ever encountered. The best meal was breakfast, as for lunch and dinner forget it. The staff is very poorly trained both at front desk and dining room, however bars and housekeeping staffs were well trained. This hotel could be excellent with an improvement in the dining room.

<Content>Caribe Club Princess Stayed at the caribe club 1st week of June. Was very concerened due to many less than complimentary reveiws. What very seldom is mentioned is how beautiful the resort grounds are. After passing the lobby and row of little shops, a winding paved path takes you through tropical mangroves teeming with birds and wildlife. The rooms have open vieling hallways where the rains drop onto indoor gardens. There must be something about the food that not everyone can tolerate. I was able to eat more than I needed with no problems, yet my wife took ill later on in the week. The rooms were nice, althought the pillows were a little lumpy. The staff were very friendly, any time I called for a problem I usually gor a quick response, including the time I broke a bottle of soda in room. all in allhad a great time, and thought it was an excellant value

<Content>Had a good time! OK...the first thing I want to say is read the reviews with an open mind! We read all the reviews before our trip and we were somewhat concerned. But after our trip, I can offer you the details which I think is pertinent.1) Airport....The airport is nice for a destination airport. Plenty of porters to assist with the luggage. Entry to the country was quick and easy. Exiting the country was a little longer but the process is fairly streamlined and easy.2) Bus to resort....The transportation provided to the resort was on a comfortable air conditioned bus. The bus, provided by Apple Vacations, provided an Apple representative that gave a brief description of the country and the Punta Cana region. Very informative and fun as well.3) Check-In...This was also quick and easy. The staff was extremely helpful and spoke english very well. The bellhops quickly loaded our bags and transported us to our room.(we, myself,wife and oldest daughter (9), travelled with another couple and their 2 boys (10,12). 4)Room... OK..here is where we had a problem. The first set of room were on the second floor. There was a musty odor as soon as you hit the second level. We entered our rooms which were 4 doors apart(they were supposed to be connecting) and found evidence of mold and mildew in the HVAC units. One room had a puddle of water on the floor. We immediately found a resort employee and told them this would not do. He called the front desk and said he would return in 2 minutes. 10 minutes later the wives took the kids to get a snack and my friend and I trekked back to request a room change. At the lobby, we found our Apple rep and he (Tony) was AWESOME in assisting us. He scheduled room change and we went to look at our 2nd room, along with some gentlemen from Dayton that were in a similar predicament. We went and looked at the 2nd room on the 2nd level and same conditions. By now I was frustrated and quite unhappy. While awaiting a ride back to the lobby, ione of the guys from Dayton came down and told us that the 3rd floor rooms were MUCH nicer. So we went back, met with Tony and arranged ANOTHER room change. The desk staff seemed gracious, but we allowed the Apple rep to handle the discussions, as I was not in an appropriate mood to deal with them. The desk arranged for two rooms on the 3rd floor that were interconnecting and we went to inspect the rooms. WHAT A DIFFERENCE. The 3rd floor has cathedral ceilings and feels very spacious. Air quality was also much improved. The rooms are fairly nice, but the resort is dated. The room was clean and relatively insect free as we had a couple of small ants in the bathroom. We did spray OFF around our door frames to inhibit insect access. Beds were ok...not great but not terrible.5)Food...The food was relatively good with many different selections. With three children, we were concerened, but the kids enjoyed themselves and even tried different food choices that even surprised me. Now I have to say, our group did have a touch of the runs intermittently during the trip, but immodium was a saver. We did know of others at the resort that had stomach trouble. It would not be fair to blame it on the resort, as the food seemed good, but it should be noted that we did experience a little tummy trouble.6)Service.... Maid servic was very good. We did pack some little gift bags for the maids and we received great service. There are no wash clothes so bring your own. The white towels are dingy, not crisp and are fairly worn, but the did the trick for drying off after a shower. Bar service is good. The bartenders are more than willing to make any number of drinks for you and will recommend any drinks for you. Jose, at the pool bar is great. He is always fun and full of energy and you can hear him at the pool bar every day. He loves to give out the country's signature shot of mamajuanna.....an interesting concoction. Waiters were great and polite, but they have a tendency to grab your plate before you are finished. We did email and fax requests to the front desk prior to our arrival and never received a response and we also found out that my wifes father had called and left a message that we never received. Other than that, the service was quite good.7)Entertainement... The entertainement was good. I wouldn't call it world class, but we enjoyed ourselves. The entertainment crew works hard...ALL DAY. The try to have fun with the guests all day and offer a different program each night at their auditorium. We enjoyed the various shows we saw. I know the kids definately liked the magic show and the resorts presentation of the Lion King. Just remember, the entertainment is for fun and you need to make the most of it. You will enjoy it as long as you are not expecting /vegas quality entertaining.8)Excursions....We took 2 while we were there and had an EXCELLENT time on both. Tony the apple rep recommended the 2 that we took. The first was the Bavaro Runners safari tour. This tour takes all day. They pick you up and take you throuugh a guided tour of the region, showing you horseback riding, shows you a school, cigar making, sugar cane fields, an actual dominican household along with its growing of cocoa and coffee beans, provides luch and a swim at a private beack location. Alex was the tour guide and our entire group had an absolute blast. The other tour we took was a boat/snorkle trip at the Marinarium. FUN...we snorkeled with nurse sharks and stingrays, enjoyed a catamaran cruise of the various beach resorts and enjoyed a shallow swim in the ocean. This was a 4 hour tour and was fun for all.All in all we enjoyed our vacation. We would definately recommend Punta Cana for a vacation destination. For the money we spent, we all felt like we got a good deal on a good vacation. We intend to return. We might spend a little more money on a different resort, but we would go back to Caribe Club knowing what we know now. ANy one with questions can feel free to contact me and i will gladly answer any questions that I can.

<Content>Great service, great time! CHECK-INMy fiance, another couple and I checked into the Caribe Club Princess on May 31. This was our first all-inclusive VIP vacation (the fourth for our worldly friends!) We were greeted in the lobby with a refreshing glass of punch. There is somewhat of a language barrier, but the check-in process was smooth. We learned that most of the front-line waitstaff, bartenders and front-desk staff are multi-lingual. APPLE REPRESENTATIVEWe booked our vacation through Apple and received a flier at the airport stating the name and time that we were to meet with the Apple rep on the first day. This is important as he will give you a great deal of information on the country, resort and day excursions. You will also receive information on the hotel restaurants. Advance reservations are needed. You can visit the hotel concierge located in your buidling to make reservations. We stayed in rooms 2207-2208 and Jasson was our very friendly concierge. Our VIP package with Apple included massage (three huts located on the beach and around the pool), watersports, internet access, rum, cigars and top shelf liquor throughout the week. The massage was excellent!DINING/FOODWe dined at Mama Mia (Italian), Sombrero (Mexican), Shanghay (Chinese/Japanese) and La Cava. EXCELLENT FOOD at all four. There is also a Brazillian and Dominican offering, but we did not have time to try all. The restaurants only seat around 50 people which makes for a very intimate dining experience. Breakfast and lunch is served in the main buffet area. The offerings change daily and there is something for everyone. The service was excellent. Be sure to look for Eduardo who provided us with a daily Spanish lesson. The food was tasty even at the main buffet, however you do have to keep in mind that you are in a foreign country and the food is prepared differently that what you are used to. We all experienced bouts of intestinal problems. Be sure to pack plenty of Pepto, Alka-Seltzer and Immodium. You will be thankful. If you forget, the gift shops offer these items. DRINKSThe water at the restaurants is safe to drink, but we requested bottled water at the pool and beach bar (Bar la Matica). Remember to stay hydrated...one bottle of water per every 1-2 drinks. We witnessed some rather intoxicated folks throughout the week. Make sure you visit the sunken pool bar. Jose is the bartender and you cannot mistake his Ayyyyyy Amigo everytime you walk past or swim up to his bar. He was alot of fun. He will introduce you to a Dominican classic, mamajuana. This is a potent mix of bark, rum and who knows what else. You have to try it once. If you like it, the gift shops and airport sell it. Also, the specialty drink in the Dominican is the Coco Loco. It is a milky, coconut drink. Tasty. You can also enjoy daquiris, margaritas and pina coladas. Anything you want. The bottled beer offered is Presidente, Miller Genuine Draft and Heineken. Stay away from the Soberanna that is stocked in the room fridge. It's awful.ROOMSOur room was oceanview/poolside so we were very close to everything. Other reviews have stated this was disruptive, but we did not feel so. You are still far enough removed that it should not be bothersome. The pool closes at 7 pm so it is quiet in the evening. One tip: Pack your own washcloths. The hotel provides bath and hand towels, but not washcloths. The maids will also come around at night and distribute fresh towels. We did appreciate this. You will be given two blue beach towels and an additional two cards that are redeemable for two additional towels at the activities hut between the beach/pool. Don't lose these cards. You are required to turn them in with your room keys at check-out. There is a $25 charge per lost card. The rooms were clean and the maids were very friendly although they speak little to no English. Also, request the lock to the room safe at check-in. We never felt unsafe, but it is nice to have the option to lock up passports, cash and jewelry. SHOPPINGWe did not venture off of the resort except for an excursion. If you don't mind bartering and haggling then there are beachfront tents set up down from the resort. There are also vendors that the hotel brings in 1-2 times per week. They set-up outside of the main buffet. My friend and I purchased bracelets, but I'm not interested in the haggling aspect and probably wouldn't stop again. Larimar and amber are the stones native to the Dominican. The larimar is a gorgeous teal stone. There is a very high-end jewelry counter located in the lobby area. They have some very nice pieces. I found everything I needed at the hotel gift shops and didn't have to make a deal. American currency is accepted everywhere on the resort and expect to get American change back, not the peso. The prices are listed as peso so just know that approximately 33 pesos equals one American dollar.EXCURSIONSThere are many day excursions offered. We tried the Marinarium which is a party boat/snorkeling adventure. HIGHLY RECOMMEND this 1/2 day excursion. The crew was extremely friendly and fun! We snorkled, enjoyed a variety of drinks (including Coco Loco) and were able to wade in a natural swimming pool in the middle of the ocean. The price was around $80 USD per person and it was worth every penny. My fiance danced the macarena and won a trivia contest. We all had a great time. Bring extra cash for the excursions as they are not included in your package but are well woth the money. My fiance befriended a family from Cincinnati and they also recommended several excursions. There is something for everyone. Parasailing is also offering. OVERALLWe had a great time! The resort is rated 4 stars although I don't feel that it was 4 star by American standards. We went to celebrate our 30th birthdays and my engagement and that's exactly what we did. We relaxed and had an overall good experience. I would recommend the Caribe Club Princess to friends and family.

<Content>best beach # 1 What can I say, went on a girls getaway to the Caribe Club, May 2-5, 2008, weather was awesome, and probably the best beach ever, no shells, no seaweed, no fish, and best of all clean, if you are from the east coast you know what I mean, blue, clear, warm water is the best, had a blast with Nadine and her gang at the scuba shack, went on a catamaran, and the banana boat, props to Ramon and his crew on the entertainment, animation staff, they couldnt have been nicer, Kelvin in the beach bar, everyone we met was so nice, the food was a bit of a struggle for us, not much taste, kind of bland, we had the VIP package so we at at the seafood restaurant, lobster just okay, Italian, like Ragu, at home, but again we werent at home, massage included, great and on the beach if you choose, love the coco loco drink, great value at this hotel, not budget, not extravagent, just right.

<Content>5 Days it was awsome My hubsand and I took our belated honeymoon, May 19th-23rd and it was amazing. It took a lot of convincing to get him to go out of the country but now he says this is the only way to go. It was great that everything is all inclusive. Like some others I was nervous after reading some reviews but I just took some information, took bug spray which we didn't use, wash clothes I took my own b/c they did not have any but other than those this it was great. I don't need to break everything down but I did want anyone that is wondering if they should be nervous not to. We are 26  27 we went with the intent on having a great time we were careful of what food we ate b/c we knew it was forigen to us and we came out all right with an amazing experience I have nothing bad to say about this resort and I would go back.Also, I was worried about tipping I thought the workers would have their hands out but they didn''t, they definatly remembered who you were if you did tip, but did not get terrible service if you did not.

<Content>overall holiday was good We stayed in the resort from 28th april - 12th May 2008Overall the holiday was very good.The staff are very sincerly freindly, and very accommodating, especially in the bars and restaurants.I travelled from England with my wife and her parents and we all agreed that the resort had something for everybody.There are three pools of which one has a pool bar and is very lively, the other two are quiet so are idael for children or older people who require some peace and quiet to relax.The hotel caters for mulicultural tourists and we befriended quite a few people of which were mostly American and Canadian.There were a very small minority of ignorant guests but you get that in every hotel that you stay in no matter where you are.The beach is picture postcard quality, i would go as far to say that is the best beach i have ever seen.However there was an issue with the food,All the English (and others) i spoke to, all complained of stomach problems , which affected all four of us at some point in the two weeks we were there.I have to say that we found the alternative restraunts dissapointing ie chinese, mexican although the Italian was proberbly the best of a bad bunch.If you want a relaxing holiday with sunand sea then this is definately the place for you, but if you want to go on trips then i wouldnt recommend this resort.I dont think i would recomend this hotel to any of my freinds because in my opinion a jamaican 4 star hotel is a lot better than the caribe princess which is a 4 star+.

<Content>Never Again This was our second visit to this resort and it will be our last. We booked the VIP package as we had on our first visit. On our first visit, everything was great which was why we decided to return. What a difference two years makes. Firstly, the check-in service was poor at best. None of the VIP extras were included in the envelope. When we were shown to our suite, it was situated on the ground floor next to the bar pool; we had requested upper floors away from the pool. The ground floor rooms, especially the bathrooms, are crawling with insects. They will send someone to spray but if I want to sleep with insects, I'll book a tent in the jungle. We checked in on a Saturday and it wasn't until Tuesday evening after numerous trips and calls to the lobby that we finally got things straightened out. It seemed to us that the whole aura of the place had taken a steep nose dive. Things were left undone, some of these were safety items like missing boards on hot tub decks, and the general cleanliness of the place had dropped. On our first visit, we had a problem with the AC in our room. I called the front desk and a repairman was there within a short period of time. On this trip, we made many calls to the desk and were promised right away, sir but nobody showed. It was really, really frustrating.One of the biggest differences that we found were the quantity of vendors walking the beach and almost every one of them in your face all day long. On our first visit, vendors set up on the property for one night only and we found it kind of interesting and indeed, made some purchases. This year, they were there almost every night - it was like trying to run a gauntlet to get to the restaurants. We didn't want to be unfriendly, but there is only so much of this that a person can stand. I could go on and on but you get the picture and you can decide for yourself. As for us and our friends, who by the way, have been here on more than one occasion, we will never book another vacation at the Caribe Club Princess.

<Content>Nice Resort We stayed at the Caribe Club Princes during April school vacation with our two boys (11 and 15). Overall the resort was very nice. The grounds were beautiful and our VIP suite was comfortable and clean. The VIP suites are conveniently located near the pool with the pool bar and the beach. We tipped the maid service 3/day which gave us reliable cleaning service. Room service could be improved, we asked for an extra blanket and never received it.The food at the buffet was good with a decent variety, however the adults in our party did experience stomach problems where the Amodian AD we brought came in handy. Make sure you bring your own medicine since in Punta Cana you will pay a lot more for any medicine and trying to find a pharmacy is a challenge. We only tried one of the restaurants since reservations were required and we didn't like to commit to a time, we wanted the flexability of eating when you felt like it. We did try La Cava and got the Broiled lobster which was saltier than we prefer. The water sports were a bit of disappointment for the kids because again you had to make a reservation even if it appeared as though the equiptment was not being used. It's difficult to have a time scheduled for kids only to find the kids are in the middle of a volley ball game once the time arrives. The teenagers wanted to try Parasailing but it wasn't free because they required you to pay for a lesson in advance, also true with wind surfing. The banana boat ride wasn't available unless you had 4 or more people. So overall the free watersports was a challenge to say the least and it was obvious that they were reserving water sports for the paying customers. There is some solicitation on the resort, selling excursions and jewlery and hand-made items which can be annoying at times. Overall the kids still enjoyed themselves. Tip when traveling with older teenagers, the alcohol is a little lax so keep an eye on them.

<Content>A nice resort My husband and I stayed at this resort April 17-24. First of all I would say that like many/most resorts in the Caribbean or Mexico the rooms in this resort would be more like a 3.5 star but the rest of the amenities would be a 4 star including food. The room was very clean though and we only had a problem with one pesky mosquito on a few occasions. We had upgraded to the VIP, which although not totally what I thought it would be, was still great because it was soooo close to the main pool (and on the main floor) so going and putting a towel on a pool chair was the easiest thing in the world and I was grateful for that. And yes -- bring your own facecloths, I don't know if employees steal them or what, but it is really tough to get one. This is not the first time I have encountered this in my travels.As stated, the beautiful lobby - which is really spacious and has a very nice bar is way too far from the rooms. I think this really puts a damper on night time socializing with other guests. I really believe that in light of this design, they desperately need a good size beach or pool bar so people feel they have an alternate entertainment option to the nightly shows. For this reason, don't be looking to party to hard at the resort.The grounds are beautiful with the ducks, birds which make calls like monkeys at night and peacocks. It's nice to walk around there but bring comfortable shoes as it is quite a trek from the lobby to the rooms.I found the food to be very good and I have travelled extensively in the Caribbean, Mexico and also in Europe. The variety is fantastic at the buffet restaurant and we ate there every day for breakfast and lunch, and the first night for dinner. All other nights we ate at the a la carte restaurants, with the Italian and Mexican being our favorite. I didn't want to try the Chinese and Brazilian because I had read/heard that both were not as good. Surprisingly, the Ribeye steak at the Mexican restaurant was very good - not tough, although the steaknife might as well have been a butter knife. We also ate at the one gourmet restaurant (french)- can't remember the name. It was very nice, and I found the service at the a la cartes to be very good - and much better English at these restaurants. Pool bar - swim up bar is really fun and Jose is very fun even though his English is limited. He really needs some more interesting shot glasses for his never-ending MAMA JUANA shots. If anyone is going, I think he would love a new shot glass or two. He is very entertaining and we became fast friends. He even called us at home when we returned. You have to realize that they get more French guests, so they don't get to practice their English as much. They are eager to learn so make the effort and they will too. Be nice and tip if you feel it is deserved. These people work 11-16 days in a row without a day off. How nice could you be after all that time on your feet? The beach is of course second to none. Shopping is ok but I was disappointed by the lack of quality of the silver (spoiled by Mexico obviously). Barter religiously. We bought 2 paintings (unframed) at the market down the beach - about $190 for both - one was an oil and both were quite large. Also bought coffee beans by the pound for $4 each (4 of them) at the same place. Don't be stupid and forget to pack the immodium you bought (like I did) or it will cost you $9 for 4 tablets. Fortunately, I was fine after taking one. Bring lots of sunscreen, we did and never got burnt, which was nice. Bring bandaids for those new shoes you may be wearing for the first time (or aren't used to walking in) - ladies you know what I'm talking about.There's a guy at the beach bar who makes a delicious drink he calls especial with bananas and chocolate - it tastes like a banana split. He got tipped everytime I asked for that.Went to the casino the first night - there's a free shuttle there and back - it was nice. Did have a spa treatment - forced my hubby into it too. The body scrub was awesome and massage -- Julia is probably the strongest if you like a deep massage like I do. Wouldn't recommend the manicures/pedicures - they are quite ammateur for the money.All in all a really nice getaway. I would go back with my kids next time and hopefully it will be in April also because it isn't too crowded then (except Easter week - beware around that time).

<Content>Beautiful Place This was a girlfriend getaway. We were there from April 30 - May 4th. It was beautiful. I have read several reviews some good but most were bad and I have to admit I was SCARED!!! But don't take the other reviews for granted, you have to experience it yourself.When you first arrive at the airport, you'll be greeted by women dressed up and willing to take your pictures with them. You will be able to purchase these when you leave for $8. They come out very good. I wanted one, but my girlfriend beat me to it it and they only make one copy.. :( After that, you go through and pay your $10 tourist card and get your luggage. You will have men trying to take your luggage and carry it for you. I wouldn't of done it, but my girlfriend had already gave our stuff. They help you to your information desk and YES they expect a tip, so if your not a big tipper, then I suggest you carry your own luggage. They will try and bug you, but be strong and keep walking.Once we got to our apple vacation desk, he showed us to our ride and they took us to the hotel. It's about a 20 minute ride from the airport to the hotel (unless you have other stops on your bus as well, then a little longer).Once we got to the hotel, we checked in and it was BEAUTIFUL... The lobby was so nice, the staff was friendly. Everyone said HOLA. It didn't take us long to get our room and since we were VIP (which I sugget), we had to meet with the guest services to get all of our information, such as (internet, motorized sports, and massage) coupons.It was beautiful weather all week. It only rained Friday night really hard and Sunday morning (for like 5 minutes) dispite what the weather channel said. The beach was GORGEOUS... I have never seen a beach more beautiful. Water was great. Yes, you have women walking around topless but this isn't just at the beach, they also do this at the pool. It didn't bother us though.The food - well that is a different thing. At the buffet, they have a lot of different things, I didn't care for the buffet, but for breakfast I got an omlet and potatoes, nothing else. For dinner, I only ate cheese  pepperoni pizza. The Seafood restuarant - NASTY!. The Mexican place, DELICIOUS, as well as the Italian (momma mia).The rooms - they were very nice  clean. They are dated like in previous reviews, but very clean. Our mini fridge was stocked every day and we didn't have to request nothing. The only thing I suggest is, if you plan on tipping, do it when you leave. We didn't tip until 2 nights before we left and on the last night, they didn't give us our turn down service. We were in room 2222, our balcony faced the family pool and ocean, GORGEOUS!!The pool bar was good, JOSE  OZZIE are the men at that bar. The manager Carlos was very nice as well. The Beach bartender was KELVIN, he was MY FAVORITE. If you gotta try a drink, try the banana mama or ask Kelvin for bed breaker, very good. Also ask Kelvin for Killing Me Softly.They will keep trying to have you taste their mamajuana, some liked it, I HATED IT. Too strong and NASTY.Over all, a very nice place. If I had to say a bad thing, it'll be about SOME of the guests. We met some very nice people from England and all over the states, but then we had met some ignorant guests from London, but you ignore the ignorant people and enjoy yourself. I would love to take back my husband  daughter. I hope you enjoy yourself if you go and I would consider upgrading to VIP if you haven't already. Well worth the extra money.I hope you find my review helpful.

<Content>Would not stay at the Caribe again Customer service at the resort does not exist, when we asked for towles, or extra soap they would tell us in 5 minutes and they never show up.The bedding, blankets,e.t.c. was old and worn, there were 3 tiny very soft pillows in a king size bed.My husband's brand new polo shirt with the tag still on was taken from the room, we reported the incident but they came up with nothing, if you do stay at this resort, please lock up your valuables in the safe box.We've been to Punta Cana 3 times prior to this, we never had any problems.. the staff at the resort needs to be educated in customer service and learn to speak some decent English.The food was nothing special, leftovers from dinner were made into a different dish for next day's lunch.The specialty restaurants were anything but specialty, we went to the Italian restaurant, (Mama Mia) and ordered white wine, the waiter comes by and before I could stop him he re-filled my glass with red wine, the waiter had no clue what he did wrong..At the Chinese specialty restaurant I hadn't finished all of my soup, and when the waiter came to take the bowl he was looking inside and stirring the left over soup with the spoon, I was mortified, I thought he might pour it back into the pot, that incident was very creepy and weird.The maids were more polite than the customer service at the front desk, they deserve a tip every day.My husband and I have been to most of the islands in the Caribbean, our stay at the Caribe Club Princess in Punta Cana was the worst.

<Content>A lovely resort After we booked, we looked at some of the reviews and the mixed comments gave us some concerns. We needn't have worried.We travelled with Thomsons and had an excellent flight. It was on time and their extra legroom is great. Transfers were a bit slow, and the other hotels we dropped off at were huge. Ours was a bit smaller, but not much.The reception area is big and open and airy and efficient. Then we had the train ride down to the apartments. This is nearly half a mile through the mangroves, but didn't take long.The room we had was conveniently placed, quite near the restaurants, pools and beach. We had some teething troubles with the air conditioning and with a water leak in the bathroom, but these were resolved reasonably quickly once reported to guest relations.The main buffet restaurant served an extensive range of dishes which should be enough to satisfy most palates. The biggest difficulty was getting a cup of coffee at breakfast - they always seemed to be running out of cups! They also didn't quite seem to grasp the concept that you need hot! water to make tea.The a la carte restaurants were a varied bunch - from excellent Italian and Mexican to poor Chinese, with Brazilian and Dominican somewhere in the middle. One problem we found was that apart from the lobby bar (nearly half a mile away) there was really nowhere around the restaurants to sit and have a quiet drink before and after your meal.The beach was lovely - and was kept exceedingly clean. The animation team was really aimed at a much younger audience than us, but they put in a lot of effort. The multi-lingual evening entertainment was mixed in quality - but nevertheless popular. Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our two weeks here and would recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Loved the Caribe!!!! I gotta say this resort was great. The rooms are simple but for the families like ours that basically slept and changed there they were fine. If your looking for pillowtop matteress's and down pillows your out of luck. Our room was cleaned everyday and the sheets changed when we wanted. The enterance was impressive and the walk to the rooms was wonderful and pretty, there is a wetlands and lots of birds. Grounds well kept, grooming was constant while we were there. This is a resort where everything is close by. We had a room on the third floor in building one and when we walked out there was the buffet, the main pool and the beach( the most important) We got chairs on the beach everyday. The people were wonderful who worked on the resort and special thanks to Jose at the pool bar who entertained and took care of us and to Stephenson on the animation team who took the time to get us to participate in activities and made it alot of fun. Look for them both if you go. The staff all gave a smile and a Hola as you passed by , take the time to do it back if you can, they work long hours which makes the effort even more meaningful.The buffet was great and we stuck there most of the trip. The food was tasty and alot of it prepared fresh in front of you. You got sat promptly and were served drinks quickly, not that it mattered we were on vacation and not in a rush.We had no problem with mosquito's although they were there. Just take your repellent. The beach was absolutely beautiful, and we spent as much time there as possible. It made the whole trip worth it. On the whole we liked the size of this resort, the proximity of the facilities, the friendliness of the staff, had no problems with our needs being met at all. There was a good energy to this place and we would go back no problem. So if you are booked or are booking you will be fine here.

<Content>Loved the Room, Hated the Service We vacationed at Caribe Cub Princess from April 12th - 19th. Well I'll start off by saying that when we arrived the host asked us to leave our luggage in the front. We really didn't trust leaving them there, but we did. We checked in and since we booked the V.I.P. package they sent us to the concierge. They gave us everything we needed for our stay. We went back to our luggage and the trolly was there to take us to our room, but we were still a little confused on what or where we were going. We arrived at our room (2111) without our room key, the front had forgot to give us our key. The room cleaning lady had to open our room door while we waited for our keys. We were amazed at the view. We had a great view of the beach. Room service brought the key quickly. Well that night I was waiting to see a fight of Cotto vs. Gomez and 2 weeks prior to our vacation I personally called to make sure that they had HBO and they told me they did. To make the story short I missed a very important fight. That night they also showed us how important customer service was to them. They told us that they would send a technician over to our room and he never arrived. The room cleaning was good. The A/C was cold, worked very well. The other dissappointing thing was that from the time we got there they told us that they had Corona beer, but that they still hadn't distribute them to the bars. We asked all week long and never saw a Corona beer. The Higuero Buffet food is not very appetizing, but I guess it will do since there is nothing else for breakfast and lunch. Let me correct myself, for lunch there is snacks at El Pescador, which isn't very good either. Not all the food was bad though, all the restaurants were great but the best was El Pescador. Make sure you make your reservations for the restaurants for each evening so you can try them all. With the V.I.P. package it includes 1hour per person on the internet, 20 minutes massage per person, and one motorized watersport per person, plus a bottle of rum and 3 cigars. My wife and I definately thought that the massages were worth it. Just remember that when they say international drinks they mean Heineken and Genuine Miller. For the last thing don't go to the disco thinking you can drink whatever because that was one of the only places that we found Corona beer but they wanted 7 dollars a beer. VERY RIDICULOUS Other than that the beaches were very clean . The gardening was very well kept. The shows were ok. Hope this iformation was helpful.

<Content>4 stars, maybe out of 10 !!! First of all, all the talk of mosquito's and bed-bugs. We did not personally have them but saw and heard of guests that did. I guess it's the luck of the draw for your room.My wife came down with a mysterious rash on our second day there. It completely covered both legs and kept spreading. She had to seek medical attention on site for $400, get the vacation insurance!! It won't help you though when you go to buy sun block in CCP gift shop, $35 dollars!!!There is no place on site to get cash, none of the excursions accept credit cards so your pretty much out of luck unless you take a taxi into the city to get cash. Even then all you can get is Peso's which actually is preferred over the good ol US dollar, it fluctuates everyday.The food is way below average. The buffets are pretty much the same thing every day but with a twist. Your going to see hotdogs sliced, diced,fried,boiled etc. EVEN FOR BREAKFAST!!!!!The a la cart restuarants are a little better but still nothing special.The service is OK but the language barrier is quite a problem, if you know Spanish you'll be fine!The bar drinks are different, the bartenders always but their own Dominican twist on your drink, you'll never have the same drink twice. So if you find a bar and your happy with the drinks, stay there!! Forget paying for the VIP, I called room service twice for American beer and never got it!! You only have the choice between Miller Genuine Draft or Heineken(which is'nt American anyway).The rooms are plain, even VIP, the bedding is paper thin, sheets come off the bed every night. Pillows are as described by other guests, like rolled up towels in a pillow case! Everything else in the room is what you would get in a hotel, nothing special!!The grounds are well kept and beautiful. The beach is the best part of Punta Cana. I found Americans to be scarce here though mostly Germans, French and Russian.We did not go to the shows, did not have the massage. The internet was always down when we took the 15 minute walk to use it.We would not go to this resort again, we may go back to Punta Cana but search for another resort!!

<Author>REDSOXRULE99
<Content>Fabulous resort ! Like everyone else, I was nervous about the review of mosquitos and getting sick and musty hotel rooms and so on..... but I was pleasantly suprised to find that the Caribe Princess was even BETTER then any pictures I saw or reviews I read.Ok.... there are some small things that a few people allow to ruin their vacation like a cold shower here and there or too many Europeans. That is why the price is so reasonable.... if you want the Plaza in NYC then you have to pay PLAZA prices. We walked the entire hotel strip on the beach and there was not one resort that could hold a candle to the CP beach. And.... only the CP has rooms on the beach. Or on the pool. If you happen to get a bottom floor (and yes it will smell musty since you are in the Caribbean) then simply ask to be moved. The turnover is daily so another room will open up. The staff work 14 hours a day and for 12 days on - 2 days off.Their weekly pay equals two hours of minimum wage in the US and yet they never look tired or cranky. The only crank people I saw were guests wanting more and more and more ..........Bottom line -- this resort blew away any other place we have stayed. We relaxed, ate, swam, watched the activities, met a few people (they are as nice to you as you are to them) andall for a price that would not get you a weekend in NYC ! As far as mosquitos -- I think I saw two. Two. The Caribe Club Princess is what you make it. You can pay double somewhere else but you will get the same thing.So - trust the good reviews and ignore the bad ones. I will be going back next year !

<Content>Service??!! On arrival at the Caribe Club we were shown to our room which smelt, only had one bed (not ideal for a mother and daughter) and the patio door had obviously been broken into previously as the lock did not work and was bent. The porter rang reception and was told they would bring in a single bed. Nothing happened so we ourselves walked to reception - a ten minute walk in the wind and rain - and were told we could not change rooms as they were already overbooked and had sent another couple to an alternative hotel for the night. We were told that if we returned at 2pm the following day, we may be given a different room if there was availability. Our Thomson rep was of no help either! We went back to the room to find two maids dragging a filthy bed into the room and balancing the coffee table precariously into the wardrobe - leaving no room for hanging clothes. Not that we would have hung anything in the room anyway as the room smelt so awful. We dragged our tired selves into the buffet restaurant, only to be seated and have to wait several minutes to be served. We asked the waiter for water and wine and when it did not arrive 10 minutes later, we asked again. And again. Oh and again. Only then to be given the impression that we were a nuisance and we were really asking too much for any amount of service. This happened repeatedly, in fact the only meal time we received service without asking for it was the last day at breakfast. Unsurprisingly, this had followed a customer satisfaction survey being passed around and I'm sure numerous complaints! Bar the service, the buffet was exellent. The food was always fresh and varied and there really was little point in venturing into any of the a la carte restaurants as the food was nowhere near as good as in the buffet, however you were attended to far more quickly!! I can't recall seeing any flies - very impressive considering it was fairly open air - and we always thoroughly enjoyed our meals. We managed to change rooms the next day and whilst there were two beds and no smell, there were several issues that were never really resolved. The towels were always a grey colour - a little off putting when you are jumping out of the shower! We were also only ever given one small bath towel each, with no consideration of hair or hand towels. The fan in the room continually clicked so was really unusable. The air conditioning control box had no controls on the outside so we had to remove the front panel to exposed wires, changing the temperature and switch on/off this way. Not ideal! When the repair man came to 'fix' it, he simply shook his head, pulled off the front cover and showed us how to fiddle with the controls this way. When repeating the story to the Thomson rep, she simply said 'don't go near the wires with wet hair'. Useful? Thought not. On check out day, we phoned down to Guest Services (if that's what you can call them) and asked for a porter to collect our cases. Not an unreasonable request as their were no lifts and the rooms were a 10 minute walk from reception. Five phone calls and an hour later we were still waiting for the porter. Luckily, we saw someone walking around so he could take us and our luggage. Absolutely appalling. After that extensive moan, we both enjoyed our holiday very much but I really feel that the service lets the Caribe Club down significantly. Many people moaned about the language barrier, I don't feel this if fair as they are a Spanish speaking island and we should not expect them to speak English. I think if the service in the restaurant had been of a higher standard, this would be a much better review. And ultimately, I think Thomson need to provide a better service in their reps. Whilst she was friendly, any problems we presented her with she did not deal with at all. Highly recommend Thomson long haul flights, planes are fantastic and far roomier than Virgin Atlantic and BA.

<Content>nice hotel...not a place for people with disabilities!! Hello...My friend and I stayed at this resort for one week (women ages 26 and 42). When we arrived we were given a room with one bed but had reserved a room with two double beds...it took quite abit of talking to get a double room. My friend is recovering from a car accident and is not able to walk the stairs or great distances. This hotel has NO elevator even though it is three stories. NO availibiltiy of a wheel chair for use...but they do have ramps beside the major buildings..There is alot of walking needed to get from point A to B but you can catch a mini bus if you wait long enough. There is not alot of food for the vegetarian as most dishes are meat/fish based. Most times I could not find someone in the dinning room who spoke enough english to tell me if the dish I was interested in had meat or fish..beware of the lack of labeling for the person with allergies. The pillows were absolutely terrible!!!!!!!! I think they used the old towels to make pillows as they were so lumpy. This is a difficult resort to go to if you only speak english. If your a single woman ...well thats another story!!.....the staff that work by the pool flirt and proposition you so much you are ready to scream by day 3. But overall my stay was nice...could have done without the all firting to have some peace.

<Content>From Boston, MA My boyfriend and I just returned from our stay in Punta Cana at the Caribe Club Princess. We stayed there from 4/4-4/11. We had a good time on our vacation, but would not return to this resort. Before going I read several reviews on a few occasions regarding the hotel, some praising it and others not so much. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I always went with the positives, and would judge the place myself based on our stay. The positives is of course, the beach is beautiful. The weather was great. Mid to high 80s and sunny all week! The grounds at the resort are very well kept and beautiful. The walk is long from the lobby to the rooms and you can take a little trolley bus if you want, but we chose to walk on every occasion for the exercise and that the grounds were nice. There were mosquitoes at night however. We didn't have an issue with finding a seat at the pool or beach. We would get out there at around 11am too, and had no problem. Most of the time we were able to find a seat under the shade in the cabanas. The employees were also very friendly. They always said Hola! in passing. We had no problems at check-in. The gentleman that helped us was very nice. We went down to the bazaar/flea market on the beach, which is about a 15 minute walk. If you go, definitely low ball them and barder. Every place has the same thing so you can definitely find the price you want.Do beware though, they do allow being topless at the beach and even the pool, and we saw it a lot. It seemed like the majority of the tourists were from France, so it was difficult to make friends because they didn't speak English.We went to the shows at night down by the lobby. They were pretty lame and started around 9:45-10pm. Which was late. But it was something to do. The food wasn't bad. It was edible, they had a big variety. The fruit is good and the waffles at breakfast. The Dominican restaurant was also good. Every night at the buffet they had a different theme. So there was changes in the food but there was always the old standbys of pizza, pasta, and french fries.The only issue we really had revolved around our room. We didn't get what we asked for. The pillows were lumpy!!! We had to request new ones, they were a little less lumpy. The beds were hard. You only get 2 English speaking channels on TV-- TBS and Court TV. There are a total of about 12 stations. I also had a cold shower both Fridays we were there, which was very aggravating.You probably get what you pay for though, if we decided to expand our budget we probably could have gotten another place. I would consider staying at the Bravaro Princess next time, their sister resort. We heard nothing but good things about it from the travelers with our charter group who stayed there.You have to make your own opinion on the place though.

<Content>Great Vacation! My husband and I, along with another couple (the four of us are between 26-32 years old), stayed at the Caribe Club Princess Feb. 3-Feb. 10, 2008. Before we booked our trip, I read reviews of the resort and was very nervous to book our trip because it had received poor reviews- well, I am glad I kept an open mind and booked the trip anyway. We had a great trip! My husband and I have been to Punta Cana before, but the other couple had not. They had a great time as well. The resort and grounds were gorgeous and it was nice that it was pretty well spread out. It was nice to walk around and have a lot to see. The food was also good. My husband and I have stayed at several resorts in Cancun and Riveria Maya, Mexico to compare too, and this food was very good also- some of the best food we've had. We liked the Mexican, Italian  Chinese speciality restaraunts. The buffet was your typical buffet- nothing major. We ate at the main buffet for breakfast. Then we liked to eat lunch at the snack buffet (it was the seafood restaraunt at night) and we made friends with the watier, Edguardo! He was so much fun and remembered what we were drinking the whole week. We would tip him well and he always took care of us! He was alot of fun and we were sad to leave him on the last day. The beach in Punta Cana is GORGEOUS! It was nice to escape the cold winter in IL and be in the warm sunshine! The pools were also nice. There were 3 different pools- the one with the swim-up bar was the fun one- they had daily activities and played music. The only bad part, was there was hardly ever an open chair at the pool. The other 2 were very quiet (although the four of us were a loud group!). We spent the majority of our time out by the beach- that's what Punta Cana is known for- a gorgeous beach!! We had to enjoy it for the 7 days we were there! The only trouble we had with the whole trip, was check-in. Our room wasn't ready, but the other couple's room was. It took almost 3 hours for our room to be ready. We were tired and hot (ready to change clothes!) so that was the only frustarating part. But we had a few drinks and waited in the Lobby for it to be ready. Then the rest of the trip was very enjoyable. We went to the disco one night and the locals that come in made it a little scary. We didn't stay long because we didn't know how safe we felt. But they played pretty good music....American music at first, but then it changed to local music. (I wouldn't let any teens go there by themselves- especially girls- we saw a few things and it made us uncomfortable!) My friend and I also went parasailing! That was a lot of fun. Otherwise we didn't leave the resort and take any excursions. We've done that before and just wanted this trip to be a fun, relaxing one. We all in all had a great time and recommend this resort, and might possibily return someday. It was rated a 4 and that's probably what I would keep it at... But we had a great trip and for the price we paid, it was definitely well worth it!

<Content>Still daydreaming about paradise March 5 through March 12, 2008Rated a 4 - should easily be a 5. Friends thought this place was awesome but I had doubts about booking after reading some of these reviews. Please read the reviews but keep an open mind. Check in went smoothly. We did VIP which was well worth it for the room alone. VIPs all in 1 building. Upgraded from a pool/sorta ocean view to full ocean view for an extra $190. A bargain for the view! Room had a slight musty odor but at night we left the patio door open (we were on 3rd floor) and had the greatest breeze and wave crashing sounds. No bed bugs or mosquitoes as mentioned in some other reviews. Buffet food not always warm but certainly edible and mucho variety. The ala cartes were exellent. Tried Chinese, Italian, seafood (included in VIP-otherwise a $25 charge), and Brazilian. Don't miss the Brazilian-its quite a different dinner concept. Food available somewhere 24/7.VIP included top shelf liquor (still ended up with Presidente beer as husband liked it better than the Heinekin - never did see Budweiser), 3 cigars, bottle of rum, 1 hr motorized sports, seafood or steak ala carte, 2 massages (never did), free safety deposit box use and a great room, had a step down area with a couch, table and chairs. Ask for room 2311 if you go.Nightly show at 9:45 kinda hokey but fun to laugh at/with. Party then moves to lobby until midnight with entertainment staff mingling/dancing with guests and then on to either the disco (too loud for my old ears) or to the beach bar that is open all night (also serving food). Beach was the nicest I have ever seen. Very active waves. Not a shell to be found - not even shell pieces - only pure white soft sand. Had no trouble getting beach chairs under palapas or getting beach towels as mentioned in some reviews. If boobs offend you - Punta Cana is not for you. All ages from sweet young things to old grandmas stroll up and down the beach with just swimsuit bottoms. Flea market is to the left when you stand in front of the ocean. They pretty much have the same things. Also, vendors set up at the resort on Friday and Tuesday. You might want to check prices at the gift shop near the lobby before buying from the vendors to get an idea of pricing. I bought necklace/bracelet/earrings for $6 more from the vendors than the gift shop had it priced. All of the staff were friendly and helpful. Bring plenty of 1's for tipping. These same staff members are on duty from early morning breakfast hours to the end of dinner hour daily. We were there for 7 days and saw same staff every day. Supposedly they work 9 days and get 1 off, before sun up to after sundown on their feet. It is my feeling if you can afford a vacation like this, you can afford a little more to show your appreciation for fine service given. We did the boat trip for our 1-hr motorized outing included in the VIP. Eight vacationers on boat - no one but us tipped. I gave the guy $5 and he hugged me as if I was one of his long lost relatives-he sincerely appreciated it. Did zip line trip. That was a lot of fun. Long and short of it - Caribe Club Princess is absolutely beautiful and we will probably be going back next year.

<Content>Great Place---- No lie! To those who are going to this hotel, please DO NOT listen to the negativity about the Caribe Princess! The hotel is above average and a beautiful place to stay. Only a few problems.The food is excellent and the waiters are funny and attentive to your needs. The main buffet had food to suit anyone except perhaps a spoiled Paris Hilton type. The specialty restaurants were very good, especially the Brazilian  Italian ones.Our room was clean  furnished with soaps, shampoos  amenities  towels. There was a free mini-bar with soft drinks  beer  bottled water.DO not drink the tap water in your room or brush your teeth with it, use bottled water.There was no screen on the balcony door though, and the electrical system was hard to figure out!The biggest problem were loud, drunks who fought outside in the halls late at night. They were rude Americans with no class, and the front desk did take care of the problem very quickly. It's no wonder we Americans have such a bad reputation in the world.Entertainment was very loud and annoying, the music never stops nor does the loud mouths of the activity staff.The beaches were white sand, turquoise waters,  great waves. Only problem there was there were too many people on the beach. The pools were very nice, three of them. If you want a quiet room, and are not a Spring-Breaker, ask for a room in one of the Villas, they are in the quiet part of the resort and are geared for older, less wild types!

<Content>Ignore the bad reviews, this place is great! Four of us, all 20 year old males, stayed at the Caribe Club Princess for a week from March 10-17th. I read the reviews on this site before we left, and was worried that they would be true, however was more then surprised to find out that the CCP was a great place, and none of the bad reviews held any merit. We ate at the buffet at least once a day, and quickly made friends with one of the waiters. We tried the Italian, Dominican, Brazilian, and Chinese ala-carte's, however really only enjoyed the Italian and Brazilian. There is snack bar near the beach that is open from noon to 6am that has hot dogs, hamburgs, nachos, salads, etc. We usually had a snack there in the afternoon and then a snack around 2am after the night was over.We mostly sat on the beach during the day, and then moved to the swim up bar in the afternoons. The bartender there was awesome, we quickly became friends with him, and he gave us excellent service. They key point here is to be nice to the staff, and they will do the same to you. We encountered a lot of young people our age on Spring Break ordering multiple drinks and yelling rapido, rapido. This is not the way to do it; just wait your turn, be polite, and you will be fine.At night, the lobby gets going around 10pm til' midnight once the nightly show is done. There is music and dancing, and then people head to the Arieto disco or to the beach bar. We tried the Disco a few times, but it is excessively loud to the point you can hear it from a long way. There are also tons of local prostitutes inside, propositioning the males. We were in there for less then 10 minutes before it started. We only went to the disco with friends, and otherwise avoided it and chose the beach bar instead. The beach bar serves drinks all night, and the bartenders were nice to us, we gave them a tip a few times and they would serve us immediately before any one else, which was nice.We did one excursion. We went on the Caribbean festival excursion which is a snorkel tour and booze cruise, and includes swimming with nurse sharks and sting rays. It was an alright trip, but a little pricey at $80 usd but I would do it again.Finally, the rooms were more then adequate. We had 2 rooms on the 3rd floor which gave us vaulted ceilings. The rooms were updated and kept clean every day, and the fridge was stocked with water, coke and sprite. Bathrooms were clean and new, and no complaints there.I read the reviews before I left, and was worried that my friends and I would not like this place. If you are young and want to have fun, or would like to be able to drink until the early morning hours, then this is the place for you. It is a 4 star resort, and a lot of people I met said that they could not tell the difference between the CCP and a 5 star, so like I said, take the bad reviews with a grain of salt.

<Content>Caribe Club Princess is only a 3 star resort We stayed at the Caribe Club Princess the last week of Feb, 2008. There were 2 couples aged 30-34 travelling together at this resort.Overall - the resort itself was good. The beach is fabulous which can be expected at any resort in Punta Cana. The buffet and a la carte resaurants were all good (except for the Chinese resaurant). The resort ammenities (i.e pool, grounds etc) were well kept and clean.The major negative aspect about this resort would be our room. The room was clean, but definately a 3 star and not a 4 or 5 star room. The hotel is made up of several 3 level buildings. We were on the bottom floor and our room (and our friend's room) looked out onto an alleyway that was used regularly by staff members. Also, there were mosquitos in our room, and our light was broken when we arrived (however was fixed later in the week when we complained about it). There is a mini bar that is stocked every day.Also - there were not enough safety deposit keys for everyone who was staying at the hotel the week we were there. Our friends had to wait 2 days before they were able to get a safety deposit key.One of the best things about the resort was the La Creperie snack shop. You can get crepes (ham/cheese, or fruit), ice cream etc from 1:00-6:00pm every day. Delicious!!Also, if you are looking for a shopping market on the beach - go to the one that is to the left of the resort it is only about a 5 min walk. There is another one to the right of the resort, but it is about a 45 min walk, and not as good as the other one.Overall, I would go back to this hotel, as long as I got a different room (I think the rooms on the upper floors are better).

<Content>nice place overall All staff were very friendly, food was pretty good loved the buffet, didn't like the chinese at all. mexican was very good. we had a basic room nothing special. but it was kept clean if you tip or give your maid something like a candy bar you get some specials like flowers and extra pop and water. we did have a few probs with the bed bugs but its the tropics so what do you expect? the beach was just beautiful with no shells and very little sea weed. if you go to the shops go the the left on the beach not the right or you are in for a LONG walk. the shows were ok. very nice well kept grounds. most the staff really tried to keep you happy. loved the guy at the pool bar he was great. went on the splash tour with the mini speed boats and snorkling it was so much fun i would do it again!! not really a place for kids unless you want your children looking at all the topless women on the beach guess wherever they come from its normal . nothing i want my kids to see. overall it was a good time, dont know if i would go again but it was a nice place.

<Content>Only OK Went to the Caribe Club Princess in the DR Feb 27-Mar 5.We have been to the DR twice before, 1st stay was the Palladium 2nd was Ocean Blue. I wish we would have been at either of those two this trip.The good about the Caribe, The staff is very freindly and helpful and I believe they try there best it always helps to tip a buck or two. The food was good at all the resturants and the buffet.The bad, The rooms need renovation. They are overused and not tended for, they have no dressers for your clothes the door that covers the mini bar fridge didnt close in either room (we went with another couple) and the mattresses where wore out. The walls in the rooms are paper thin you hear everything, hard to sleep. You can see light thru the cracks in the doors to your room. The Apple vacation rep, during the oreintation made it seem like you could get a hold of him any time, however, even when he said he would be at his desk at certain hours you couldnt find or contact him. Example We made reservations for Cocotal Golf course thru him and payed him. When we went it was overcrowded so after 4hrs and only finishing 9 holes we quit we turned in the cart and was told to contact our Apple Rep for a 9 hole refund then went to the club house for drinks,lunch and our ride back. After 3 days we finally got a hold of the Rep he said it shouldnt be a problem contact him tommorrow after 2hrs of hunting for him he said Cocotal was giving him problems and he would see us when we leave and get it staightened out. Needless to say he wasnt around, were home and still no word.The pool bar didnt have it's own bathhrooms so you had to walk to the nearest ones that were the beach bathrooms and then there's only 1 seater for the women and 1 for the men.In our opinion the Caribe Club should only be a 2 to maybe 3 apple compared to the Palladium or the OceanBlue.

<Content>Beb Bugs! Although the resort is spectacular, the food is good and there was no problem with the water, we will nor return because our room was infested with bed bugs.We advised the concierge twice to have the room sprayed but it did not alleviate the problem.

<Content>very disappointed and so frustrated I never thought that I would feel strong enough about a resort to post on this site, but after our experience I felt I had to. My husband and I just returned from 1 week at Caribe Club Princess. We refer to tripadvisor often before booking vacations and we happened to book this resort right before the last few bad reviews were posted. We were expecting a decent resort based on the earlier reviews. We also booked the VIP package. Our flight and transportation to the hotel were fine, however the resort was not at all what we expected. When we arrived we were greeted by staff who seemed inconvenienced to take care of anything. We were brought to our room, only to find the resort maid tidying up. After she left it was clear that she hadn't cleaned the room at all. Our bathroom light was out and neither the maid nor the person carrying our bags seemed to think that this was a big deal. There were quite a few mosquitoes in our room and the hotel room was overall very dirty. We complained to our concierge whose response was, You have a bed, you have a TV, you have a coffee maker, what more do you want? Needless to say we were furious at this point - if we hadn't paid what we did for this vacation, then yes we wouldn't be asking for lights that worked in the bathroom and a mosquito free room, let alone a clean room. That first night we spent over 1 hour killing mosquitoes in our room. When we finally climbed into bed we were so disgusted to find sheets with several unsightly spots which closely resembled bodily fluids on them (no I am not exaggerating here!) That first night we barely slept, due to the mosquitoes that seemed to pop up no matter how many we tried to kill and the fact that the two of us were huddled in the clean corner of the bed not wanting to touch the rest of the sheets. We met with our Apple representative the next morning told him our concerns and he said that he would send someone to FUMIGATE our room and send the maid with clean sheets. He said that if we were not happy after that then we could POSSIBLY change rooms if there was one available. Those were our only two requests and he seemed frustrated by the complaints. We spent the second day at the beach and returned to our room at approximately 4:30-5 only to find it in the exact same condition as it was when we left in the morning - the same sheets and still many mosquitoes. My husband called the front and complained and the maid did come with clean sheets and a can of bug spray that she handed to him for HIM to spray the room. At this point we were both so angry and frustrated that we ended up spraying the room ourselves and leaving the doors open while we stood outside for 15 min to let the room aerate. I had to laugh at the situation at this point because I was about to break out into tears and I didn't want to ruin what was supposed to be a relaxing vacation. Aside from the situation with our room, we found the food to be disappointing in most of the restaurants (other than La Cava and the Brazilian restaurant... the Italian was also not bad) and were greatly disappointed by the staff service. We can only think of 2-3 people who were friendly and did not seem inconvenienced to be doing their job. We are not picky people, nor are we demanding and it seemed as if we were trying to please them more than they were us. If you haven鈥檛 booked your vacation yet I would definitely NOT recommend this resort. If you have booked then I would ask for a room on the 2nd or 3rd floors when you get there. We met people that had rooms on these floors and they did not seem to have the same mosquito problem that we did although some complained of the shower not having hot water. Also, if you have booked and can upgrade to the VIP then I would highly recommend it. It is definitely worth it as other people have mentioned. The food at the restaurant (La CAVA) that comes with the VIP was really good and you don鈥檛 have to pay for things like the safe and bottled beer. The breakfast buffet was good, however the lunch selection was not so great. Also, they have a crepe place near the beach that serves crepes and ice cream. That was good but the service was not. We didn鈥檛 get sick during our trip but we were both careful about what we ate. Also, we highly recommend bringing 鈥淥FF鈥?with you for the mosquitoes. The night shows are later (9:45) and we had to buy OFF there because of all the mosquitoes outside and in our room. The one great thing that we both enjoyed was the BEAUTIFUL beach!! The water was crystal clear and the sand was white. It was wavy as someone else mentioned in another review but we still went in every day and had a blast! It almost made up for the resort鈥?. almost! The weather was also perfect. We ended up making the best of it so if you have booked already don鈥檛 be too discouraged. If you keep a sense of humour about it then you鈥檒l have a good time.

<Content>Great Vacation My wife and I got back last night after a wonderful trip. This was our first time to Punta Cana. All of our other trips have always been to Mexico. The best thing about the trip are the beaches. Soft and wonderful. We are beach people and spent 90% of our time there. We went on long walks each morning and afternoon. The food was normal for an all-inclusive, not great, but we could always find something to eat. Breakfast was definitely the best. We ate at La Cava, Italian and Brazilian. The Italian had the best food, but the experience at the Brazillian was great. We felt that the VIP was well worth it. The room was much nicer and in a better location. The maids kept our refrigerator well stocked at all times and gave us fresh towels every morning and night. Not having to wait in lines to sign up for reservations. It was also nice to have a Budweiser or Heineken now and then without having to pay extra. We tipped regularly and usually got better service because of it. We brought insulated mugs so that our drinks lasted longer on the beach. They did not have a problem filling them up with the tip. We thought that the people at the resort were good, except for guest services. They did not know anything. The front desk personnel were the best. The bartenders were always fun and entertaining. All and all a great trip and a place that we would recommend and visit again.

<Content>Great Vacation at Caribe Club My boyfriend and I stayed at the Caribe Club Princess from January 27th to February 3rd, 2008. We had a great time and would return.The buildings where the rooms are located is a good 5 minute (or a little longer) walk from the main lobby, but the stroll down the walkway is truly beautiful with an array of different birds (peacocks, cranes, ducks, etc) and trees and bushes to stop and look at. There is also a little bus that comes by regularly for those who don't want to walk or are unable to.We took the VIP package and had a lovely room on the main floor just steps from the sandy white beach. The a la carte we had at La Cava was delicious (we both had steak), and the atmosphere was romantic. We also enjoyed the Italian a la carte (the 4 cheese gnocchi was unbelievable!!), and again the atmosphere was perfect. The service at both was great. We did not enjoy the Seafood a la carte as much as the lobster is prepared differently. The main buffet always had a large selection with something for everyone. I wish I had of tried the fresh banana juice at breakfast before our last day there. No wonder they were always filling it up...it was a hit!!The variety of drinks was great and we enjoyed them all (banana mama's, coco locco's, daquiris, etc.) We've actually got recipes off the internet for many of them.We had visited Cuba last year and I was impressed with how friendly the staff and people had been there, and I was not expecting that on this vacation. I had no need to worry, we found all the staff and people we came in contact with to be very friendly and helpful.We joined in a variety of games around the pool and on the beach, enjoyed a massage at the spa and went on a couple excursions (swam with nurse sharks and stingrays).The shows in the evening were much what you'd expect - you'll enjoy some more then others. The one I didn't think I'd like (Gothic) turned out to be my favorite (Michael Jackson's Thriller, Rocky Horror Picture Show, Queen and Phantom of the Opera).After the show you have the option of going to the disco (we never did), to the lobby for some dancing, or down to the beach bar where you can also get snacks (hamburgs, fries, nacho,etc.)Take some of the reviews with a grain of salt.

<Content>Wonderful Experience We just returned from our stay at Caribe Club last night! We took another couple who have been at 4 other resorts in DR last 4 years. Loved the room right by the pool and just steps from the beach! Loved Mamma Mia, the Italian restaurant, and the Asian restaurant! Both great! Loved the concierge who can book your dinners every morning at your building. Excellent employees who always smile. Won some money at the casino too. I did get many mosquito bites though, they were fogging the grounds at night. Didn't get any last year. The in-room safes are broken and need repair. The patio doors on ground floor need some lock repair. However, the rooms are very clean, a little dated, but it does not change the beauty of the beach, the ocean and the experience. The food was better than last year. We took tours and rented jet skis and had a ball! We will be back next Feb. Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>loved caribe Loved the Caribe stayed there from 2/5/8 to 2/15/8. Glad I ignored the negative reviews. We did VIP suggest that for anyone going to the resort it is worth the few extra dollars. Our room was spacious and having the additional sitting area was a plus our room overlooked the pool and could see the ocean from our balcony.No problem with the food people have to understand that they are in another country so the style of cooking will be different and they will offer different forms of food, try them they are pretty good. A La Carte restaurants were great the only one we did not try was the Brazalian. Went twice to the dominican and the steak there was so tender and great. Ever restaurant was small and intimate which makes it a nicer atmosphere and you can enjoy your meal.We did the Le Cava restaurant for Valentines day and it was very romantic, the lobster was excellent so try it. I could go on and on but try the resort and have your own great experience we did and enjoyed our stay. We bought into the royal vacations package so will be coming back.

<Content>Had a great time at Caribe Club Princess. Just returned from a 7 day stay and had a great time. The staff was very friendly and the resort was very clean. My wife and two (young adult) sons went for a winter escape, we had two separate rooms. The beach was our main focus and it was very nice, clean, with lots of activities, etc. We ate at the mexican specialty resturante once but decided to just use the buffet after that since there was so much variety and flexibility. We never bothered to attend the evening shows or the disco since we were too tired from playing all day. I didn't travel 7 hours to see a show or attend a night club, if that's what I wanted I'd go to Vegas. I just wanted an escape from the winter cold. I wanted sun, sand, beach, water, food, and drink. All was delivered to our satisfaction!

<Content>not worth the money, stay away I stayed with my family at Caribe Club Princess first week of December of 2007. I traveled with my husband (we are both 28), our 3 year old son and a couple in their 40s. We were tight on the budget and were not planning a vacation last year, however when I saw the Carible Club Princess deal I jumped on it with no hesitation. We arrived at the hotel from the airport few minutes after noon and were told that the room will be rady at 3:00. We decided to grab something to drink, I ordered pinacoladas and mohitos at the lobby bar, they were the worst drinks I have ever tasted. Both drinks were not made with fresh fuits and mint, but some artificial green syrup. Finally at three we went to get our room key, we were supposed to pick it up at the entranceto one of the hotel buildings. It took us 20 minutes in line, were all we were breathing was sewer, it was discusting.Our room was ok, nothing special, just a standard hotel room, bathroom was ok too. There was iron, hair dryer and remote control in the room. If you want to use the safe, you need to ask for a key at the front desk during check-in, and they are going to charge you around $25 during your check out. food: we went to two specialty restaurants, chinese and italian. Italian was good, the desert was delicious!, the chinese however, was really bad, but the desert was excellent if you like fried ice cream, if yougo there for the food you will be really disappointed, if you like fried ice cream then I recommend it highly. After these two we decided to try the main buffet for dinner and it was not bad at all. The food was exactly the same as at the specialty restaurants becasue they have a different theeme night every day, one day its mexican food, then italian, chinese and so on. There was something for everybody, the desers were good also.Drinks and Bars: bad, bad, bad no matter how much you tip. they might give you more alcohol but the way they mix the drinks is horrible. Pinacolatas were bad, mohitos, mamahuanas, miami vice, cosmo, dirty monkey, it did not matter what you ordered, I asked them for a slumer after everything else failed, they did not even know what it was ?! so if you are a drinker bring your own alcohol or stay awayEntertainment: bad, unprofessional, silly shows. The evening entertainment at the theater was not good. Very amateur, bed costumes, bad jokes , bad music. I love to attend these evening events and this was the first hotel that I did not like and first hotel that did not have a Michale Jackson showService: service was ok, rooms were cleaned nicely, the towels were always there, the waiteres were quick to clean up the table and every one was very friendly and nice, easpecially to the kids, I liked thatresort area and beach : beach was nice, huge waves, maybe it was just the season, we were always able to find a beach chair.Towels, however, was a problem, if you did not get them first thing in the morning, then you had to wait until 12 for the secod batch. There are few pools in the resort area, all vere nice, water was warm and clean ( except for the swim up bar).Overall I do nto recommend this hotel. We have traveled to PuntaCana twice before and stayed at the riu resorts, which were excellent. We have never stayed at a 5 star hotel. Riu Cancun in Mexico was the best hotel we ever styed in, so we are not not picky when it comess to accomodations or food, we try to travel on a budget, but if somebody was offering me to stay at this resort again for free, I would not go.

<Content>Don't eat anything!!!! Don't eat anything at this place... because if you do, you'll end up running out to the balcony to vomit while your roommate has uncontrollable diarrhea in the bathroom!!! Then, after you have no more food and water in your system to throw up, you'll start with the bile... which is very unpleasant. And, once the hotel has made you so sick that you cannot keep anything down, they will charge you about $250 for a doctor to put an IV in you. Even though 10 other people seem to have come down with the same thing and have not left the premises of the hotel, they refuse to acknowledge that you've gotten food poisoning and should not be forced to pay for them to put some water back in your system. Aside from this, there are two positive aspects of the hotel. If you are interested in seeing improper cooking standards, this might be a good place to go for a field trip. And if you do happen to get the most terrible food poisoning of your life, complaining to a manager will probably get you a box of cigars and a few bars of soap.

<Content>Loved it !! :) My husband and i stayed at this hotel for our honeymoon, we had spent most our money on having a brilliant wedding day and had little left over for our holiday!Ive been to The Dom Rep 5x before and my husband had never even left britain!!This hotel was a 3* at the time so i expected 3* not 4* or 5* like some people do!All i will say is the room was clean, sheets changed regularly and the air conditioning was out of this world - so cold i had to turn it off at times!! The maid was a Gem, i left her a little note on my first day asking for diet coke only in my fridge, and a small tip 2 -3 dollars and my fridge was 'packed' solid' with the stuff every day!!Plus she left us flowers etc in our room!!There were 3 pools! one with a bar which was a little busy and too loud for myself!!One between the two hotels which was quiet and then there was the pool next to the Tropical Princess, this was amazingly quiet with little fountains and a bridge!! Very easy to get a sunbed, however there was lots of Americans who used the free pool towels to reserve sunbeds at the pool while they went to the beach!! - So we played them at there own game!!The beach was lovely, the sea was gorgeous the best so far, (do not go to the North as the beach is not that nice!!)The food in the hotel was 'typical 'all inclusive pizza, pasta, chips then rice salad etc with a few dodgey looking meat dishes!! - use your common sense when eating, people seem to leave this at home on holiday!! (Its not the uk and Hygiene standards are lower - GET OVER IT!)Which brings me on to a review i read earlier about the birds, Yes birds fly into the Buffet restaurant, its open air .... What do they expect!!Occasionally a family of Peacocks would walk past your table, personally i found this quite charming as they were cute!!There were other restaurants that you had to pay a supplement for and when you check out you pay for these, about $10 a head - except they didn't charge us at all!! If you are looking for excitement at night then this is not the place for you! The animation team try and put on a good show but by the time they've spoken in 4 - 5 languages youv'e missed the punchline or your just totally lost!! - we gave up!!The one bad thing i would say about this hotel is the 'lucky lucky men' who come into the complex with there stalls. They come in about twice a week, and they can get quite pushy and occasionally rude!This would have ruined our holiday if we had not made it into entertainment for ourselves - getting from the pool to our room was like running a gauntlet!! - it was Funny!!If you go on any trip go on the 007 speedboats, you drive your own mini speed boat over the sea and go snorkelling!! - this was amazing however i did have to tell my husband to slow down as he thought he was a speed demon!!!!When taking into concideration reviews from this site remember people are after different things and have different expectations!!We ignored the bad reviews and am glad we did!!You get what you pay for we only paid around 拢600 each and loved it!!To say my husband had never left Britain - now weve booked to go to cuba!!P.s One last thing, we visited the shop near the lobby most days for an ice cream - Dont bother its free in the creperie!! Which is right next to the pool we were at!! We didnt discover this till two days before we left!!

<Content>Bug Bites! Stayed at this resort from Jan 17 - 24. The room was ok, seemed to be clean, but was dated. The restaurants and the food were very good. We ate at the Italian, Chinese, Mexican, Brazilian, and the creperie and enjoyed them all very much. As well, the buffet was fine, especially for breakfast........ made to order omelets were great.However, almost everyone on the resort was covered in but bites. We landed at 9:30 Thursday night and woke up with bites friday morning. Made us think they were bed bugs. We stripped the bed down and didnt find anything but we are still not sure. We saw the maintenance people fumigating a number of rooms which caused us great conceren.i have stayed at many resorts in the caribbean and have never had this before. The resort told us it was sand fleas and mosquitos, but as stated, i have never ever experienced this before.Has anyone else experience this at the Carib Club Princess? As a result of this i cannot recommend this resort to anyone until they get this under control. One member of our party had over 40 bites.

<Content>They lie They said they would have beer stocked in the room daily.. they lied about that. No matter what tip i gave them.. they would not bring beer to our room and stock the fridge like they said they would in the ALL INCLUSIVE PACKAGE! They give you a metal box secured to the wall for your safe keeping box , but charge you $25 for the key and the actual lock.

<Content>Another wonderful time at CCP Well i just returned from my 6th stay at CCP, i had another wonderful vacation. I guess not too much to get into because i write a review every time. SO highlights.Negatives.Check in there was a mix up, new front desl manager, was quite unfriendly!!, SO the next day i went to the guest services manager whom i deal with every year, and she took care of every thing as always, Ingrid, she is fantastic. A little quieter this yr, not as many animation, the shows were not as lively , and there was NO lobby parties any more, which i made sure to complain about!!...hee hee, but other then those few things, i am a pretty laid back relaxed traveller. Positives. VIP was wonderful again, and i say well worth it just for the massage and dinner at La Cava, Lobster salad is AMAZING. Ingrid, Dominga, Jose Anthony, Winston, all called me by name when they seen me, really makes a customer feel special and welcomed. Beach was amazing, Buffet was actually alot better this year. Room was good and clean.....So any questions, i am always willing to help if i canLisa Caribe_Princess

<Content>Mixed Review This is a VERY late review, I went in April 2007. Just wanted to add my two cents to the mix. As someone who has been to Punta Cana twice and also to Cuba, and someone who is not fussy, this was a nice place but probably the worst resort I have stayed at. Why? The staff!! Nice at first, but LOOK OUT! Two ladies we knew were robbed by their maids.Another woman was nice to a guy all week, tipped him etc..., and then when she asked if he could get her some bags of coffee beans he took advantage of her and majorly ripped the poor lady off. Tripled the price, like - what a sleezeball. My friends and I befriended a guynamed Carlos at The Creperie who was sweet, and then within a few days became super nasty when my friends and I turned down his advances...I actually think he spit in my crepe, made us feel really uncomfortable and laughed and spoke Spanish to his buddies and pointedat us, threw the food on the table etc.., He was actually scary when he said: I showed up at the disco and you weren't there! bla bla bla... We had to avoid the Creeperie as we now called it for the rest of the trip. Also, this staff is annoying as all get-out - they literally pull you by the arms and drag you to play the games on the beach or by the pool. One guy stole my friend's purse right off her shoulder and held it hostage until she would play some crummy bingo game, even as we insisted we were late to get ready for dinner reservations, until she finally snapped and just said listen, give me the freaking purse!! The staff was really quite annoying sometimes. Even saw one physically drag a lady's loungechair down the side of the pool (with her in it!) to where they were starting a game,and she was in the middle of relaxing! She did not look pleased.HAVING SAID ALL THIS....That was the major downfall (more to come). For now, some pluses: The beach is beautiful. GORGEOUS. Full of straw palapas to sit under, lovely white sand, awesome. The restaurants and buffet are DELICIOUS. Pools are beautiful, landscape is beautiful, andif someone complains about walking to the lobby they must be hacking their way there through the forest and ignoring the beautifully manicured stone walkways that are lit up at night, and often serviced by golfcarts to drive you. Sometimes they have fun dance parties in the lobby, and there's an all-night beach bar to drink and eat at, so you can have fun if you're willing to make your own fun but it ain't wild-party-crazy-Cancuun. There is a fabulous casino that a free shuttle will take you to - roulette, blackjack, slots, clean and friendly, and drinks only a peso or free if you're playing. Ok, time for a few more downsides: the hall outside our room STUNK. There was an open air courtyard at the end where they let garbage pileup, and I swear to you - I'm not fussy - but I would almost throw up every time I walked back to my room. Gross. We put up with it though, the rooms were really nice inside and stink-free once you made it in. Invest in the safe (see robbery comment above). Balconies lacking, furnished only with plastic chairs. But after a few cervasas these are as comfy as the next....Entertainment is pretty lacking...the disco sucks (full of creepy locals, and the guys we met said that every night they went to the disco they were propostioned by prostitutes). So....pass on the disco, I would suggest. Oh! Last complaint: The mixed drinks were pretty crappy. I'm more of a beer drinker, but anything that needed to be mixed was just swimming with too much sugar. Premium liqour was not free - couldn't get a Bailey's and milk, for instance, like I had enjoyed at previous resorts. Couldn't get a nice caesar. Tip: they had free champagne! That almost made up for the lack of a good mixed drink, but if you are fussy aboutyour drinks this place might be a deal-breaker.Overall - if you get it cheap go for the beach, the landscape, and thegrub!! Be wary of staff that seem friendly and are only trying to use you (for sex or money). If you like crazy dancing nightlife, it's not the place for you b/c the disco is sketchy (I hear Grand Paladium has amazing nightlife and is just down the beach). ummm... Great casino! Walking distance to Bavaro town. If you get even the faintest whiff ofgarbage from the hall outside your room - move ASAP b/c it will getmuch worse!Good luck!

<Content>Great Resort! The Perfect Vacation! As a family of 5, after our stay at Caribe Club Princess from Dec 22-29, we have only good things to say about the place.First of all, don't let any of the bad reviews discourage you!A run down of everything... Check in: Smooth. The shuttle bus from our travel agent with TMR was ready when we were. In the airport, there's a little booth where they direct you to your bus. As well, porters offer to bring your luggage. You also have a rep from your travel agent whose available an hour a day at your resort to answer your questions, and who gives a welcome meeting to go over everything to new guests. Our room was ready when we arrived. We took the VIP package, so we got the coupons we needed right away (massage, motorized water sports, and Internet.)Food: Excellent. The food is prepared differently than in mainstream North America, but it definitely is good. Breakfast is, as other reviews say, pretty much the same thing daily. However, there is so much available, that you don't get bored of it. The fresh omelettes are delicious! You choose what you want inside (tomatoes, red/green peppers, ham, cheese) and the guy makes it for you on the spot. As well, you can have eggs easy over... There's also muffihs, bacon, potatoes, scrambled eggs, waffles, pancakes, rolls, and so much more. The fresh juices are also really good.Lunch is also really good. There's 2 snack bars at either ends of the Tropical/Caribe Club beach section, which are only about 3 minutes walking distance from each other. The food there is delicious, there's always pasta, hamburgers, hot dogs, nachos (with cheese or salsa), and more. As well, there's a bar at each lunch buffet spot. (The buffets are at the seafood restaurant, and the dominican food restaurant.) As well, there's always the lunch buffet at the place where the breakfast buffet is, which is just a wider selection. However, you need to have shoes and a shirt to go in there...You will not go hungry at Supper either. There's the buffet at El Higuera (the place where the breakfast is), and a choice of 5 restaurants that anybody can use, and 2 that cost $25/person. (Or if you have the VIP package, you can choose 1 of them once per week at no extra cost.)The supper buffet is always great. They have a different theme each night (like Italian, Brazillian, Dominican, etc), and the food there is always good. There's easily 100 things to choose from there. They seem to always have some things made on the spot too, like fried vegetables, or fresh pasta with the sauce of your choice. If you see something made on the spot, get it. It's usually a hint the food is good. There's also icecream at the supper buffet.... Once you bring your food to the table, a waiter will get you your drink.As well, the restaurants are also good. In some regard, some of the food you see at certain buffet themes you get at the restaurant. We ate at the mexican, italian, chinese, and steakhouse (VIP extra).Mexican (Sombrera)- Food was great. They come and sing you a song while you are eating. Nice variety.Italian (Mamma Mia)- Really good. Pasta with seafood sauce was great.Chinese (Shanghai)- Alright. Certain parts were great, certain parts were alright. They serve you sushi and beef on a stick when you sit down, which is really really good. However, the main meals are only alright. Nothing amazing. The fried icecream (vanilla icecream, with fried dough around it, with chocolate sauce on the side) is amazing!Steakhouse (La Cava)- This was included with our VIP package, and definitely was amazing! The food was delicious! The steak was cooked perfectly! The apetizers and main courses were humongous and delish! The shrimp surprises (apetizer) and the steak were amazing. Definitely recommend this place.The other VIP restaurant, or $25/person one, is the seafood restaurant which we didn't try. (El Pescador)Now onto other stuff...Staff- The staff were always very helpful, and wanted to help you. The waiters at the buffet were usually on the ball and got you your drink pretty quickly. As well, they kept the place clean for you when you arrive. The waiters at the restaurants were always on the ball, having a new drink ready for you basically as soon as you finish yours. The bartenders also were great. There were a few instances where the staff only spoke Spanish, so it was a bit difficult to communicate. But usually they would know some English or French (french was a bit more common).Housekeeping was usually on the ball. If you leave them gifts and a tip, they make up your room fast and sometimes leave towel designs (like a heart or a swan..). One day they forgot about our room though, and didn't make it up until we got them in there at 5 PM. Animation staff - Amazing. Always on the ball. Throughout the day, there'd be water aerobics, step up aerobics on land, merengue dance lessons, darts tournaments, pentaca tournaments, bowling down pineapples with coconuts tournaments, etc. If you win a tournament, they present you a diploma at their nightly show (more on this soon). They'd always try to get you to participate, and they definitely are fun to be with.Beach - Spotless. Therea are people there picking up garbage all throughout the day. The sand is so soft and clean, and the water is a beautiful blue. The water is always warm too. You can get a boogie board free for 1 hour a day. As well, there are some excursions that you can sign up for at the aquatics hut (at a cost), that we didn't bother with. Some were snorkeling with dolphins or whatever... The beach is also cleaned throughoughly at night. There was never ever an issue trying to find chairs or getting a hut. And this was during their high season...As well, with our VIP coupons for motorized water sports, we tried the banana boat ride. Its basically an inflatible long tube that everybody sits on with a handle per person. And one of the water staff on a motorboat pulls the tube fast throughout the water. Only try this if you like moving FAST, and getting wet. Definitely a lot of fun, and recommended....The pools were also always clean. We only used the main pool (the one with the swim-up pool bar) where all the action is, but there definitely was never any issues here. Only thing is the water is a bit cold because it's not heated. Bars: Tons of fresh drinks, fruit punch, soft drinks, slushy drinks available that don't have alcohol. Also tons of alcoholic drinks available for adults. If your VIP, you get access to all the liquors free of charge, whereas non-vip's only get national alcoholic drinks.Besides the beach, everywhere else is clean. There's a kid's club that we saw doing activities throughout the day, but never really looked into it. There's also teen club with foosball tables and pool tables. There's tennis, and mini golf available at no extra charge for those who are interested.For those who aren't sure, the VIP package is definitely worthwhile. First of all, all the VIP people stay in one hotel. In this hotel only, every room has a *private* balcony. Elsewhere, balconies are not completely private or sometimes even shared. There's a concierge in your hotel from 9-4 PM daily to answer questions or for you to reserve your restaurant. Much easier than having to wait in line with everyone else to reserve. And overall, you don't want to have to pay more for anything during your stay. The massages are so worthwhile, as well as the motorized watersports if you like that. Also, at the bars, you don't want to have to be charged for a drink if it costs extra. As well, your hotel is perfectly located. You're right at the beach and the main pool with all the action. There's no real walking distance.Nightly shows: Most of them are good. We were fortunate to be able to see the Lion King, and that was fantastic! They always have nice sets, lighting, costumes, etc. However, they mouth the words to any songs or dialogue in the show. Luckily for us, the Lion King was all in English! They also have many dance shows with different themes (Carnaval, Christmas, etc..). Their comedy show skits were cute, at most. They also give the tournament winners their diploma before the show. After the show, the animation staff (who perform in the show) invite the audience to come and dance with them for a bit before they send you off to Areito Disco which we never went to. Don't make our mistake. The theatre near El Higuera (the buffet place) is NOT the main theatre. That's for a little show guests put on that we never really figured out how it works...Everything is really close to each other. The only real distance is about 5 minutes to the lobby and the theatre with the nightly shows. And there's a shuttle that comes often anyways...The lobby is beautiful too. They clean it so often.Something else they have is a photographer who goes around during the day with a different animal or model to take your picture. There's a little monkey, iguana, parrots, beautiful white birds, or sometimes a male or female model. He takes your picture with whatever he has, and then the print is available in the lobby at night or the following day. The pictures always come out great because they use a great camera, and they add to it a nice border with Caribe club... dec07 or whatever)... but pictures are $15/each. If you buy more than 10, its something like $12/each. Although there's no committment to buy it...Also, after 4 days they throw out any pictures unpurchased.Tipping- No obligation, but if you do, people definitely make an effort to offer you better service. $1 goes a long way here. No need to tip more than $2-3 at at a time. These people work hard and don't get paid much as it is.Checkout- Also went smoothly. We purchased a late checkout (at 6 PM) because our bus left only at midnight. You can only get this though the day before or day of checkout. Otherwise checkout is at 12 PM. You' re still able to get access to all the resorts features until you leave. They can also lock your luggage in a safe room so you don't have to worry. With TMR, our shuttle bus was on time. After a few stops at other resorts, we reached the airport. 30 minutes to go through check-in and security. It's a bit different than other airports, as in, you get to see planes taking off because the airport is just one giant hut of sorts. Anyway, I think that's it! If you have any questions, feel free to contact me. Don't worry, relax, and have a great trip!

<Content>Paradise! This was a dream vacation! We have three kids (two are teens) and we all had the most wonderful experience. The resort is beautiful, the food was delicious and there are numerous activities for all ages. We highly recommend the VIP package, which entitles you to free massages, motorized sports, dining at specialty restaurants and access to internet. The beach is gorgeous, the people are friendly and the staff animators have more energy than you can imagine! There are daily tropical dance lessons on the beach, land and water games, organized sports of all kinds and fun nightly shows. Money extremely well-spent! We all came back tanned and very happy!

<Content>Satisfied with the CCP experience Our visit to the Caribe Club Princess was a 5 day, 4 night experience booked through my company (travel company) via Apple Vacations. I selected the VIP package based on the minimal amount of price difference between that and the standard room. I requested a king sized bed, and an upper level room, and got both with no problems. We were situated in 2311 with a wonderful ocean view. In our opinion, the VIP package was worth the extra money-- a great massage, internet (which we did not end up using), an hour of motorized watersports (took the boat excursion up and down the coast, circling the shipwreck and heading south past the hotels for a dip in the shallows), and of course the premium dinner. We ate at El Pescador and it was definitely worth it. I had a massive platter of fried lobster that was fantastic. I found that most of the positive reviews on this website held true. We had no issues with the maid service, our concierge Alex was great and very helpful, our Apple Rep. Tony was also great. We did two nights at the buffet for dinner, and one at the Italian restaurant. The food was serviceable enough for our tastes. What else can I say? The activities staff was nice and did not press you into anything you didn't want to do, and the two Jose's at the pool bar were very entertaining! All said we had a wonderful getaway, well worth it!

<Content>What a Blast!! 11 of us stayed at Club Princess Nov 26 to Dec 3rd, we all had a great time!! This hotel is rated a 4 star, I don't know why, it was beautiful, our room was really nice, the grounds were just gorgeous, the staff work so hard to please everyone, alot of activities during the day and the beach was breath-taking. I know this hotel is an all-inclusive, but we did tip the staff and the maid, they so appreciate it, when you see how these people live outside of the resort it is so sad, it really makes you realize how lucky we are!! I also brought a suitcase with toys and gave them out to the dominican children when we went out on the excursions, it was a christmas for them, be careful if you do this, when you give to one child, you are swormed by so many others. As far as the excursions, the Safari trip 1/2 day was alot of fun, you visit a dominican family home and see how they live and you also get to see thier culture, I really liked this trip and would probably do a full day next time, we also did the speed-boat/snorkeling excursion, this wasn't for me but everyone who went loved it, the dune buggy excursion was alot of fun, if you do this one, wear something dark, you will be full of mud, what a blast though. There is flea-markets on the beach, but a little bit of a walk, I went to the one on the left, it was probably a 15 minute walk, you can find great gifts to take back home, but bargin with these people, they start out really high in price. My friends also went to the one on the right, they said it was a really long walk and it sounds like they have the same stuff. The beach was so pretty, we never had any trouble finding a seat. The weather was beautiful, about 85 and sunny, it rained at night so it really didn't affect us, the last day we were there it started out really cloudy, this was the day I got the most sunburn though, be carefull, the sun is strong. The food was very good, a large selection, the Chinese and Italian restaurants were the best, the buffet was also very good. We only went to one show, they do the shows in four different languages, so everytime they speak it is long, it was funny though. Be carefull, don't drink the water, one of our friends got very very sick. I have been to Mexico, Rivera Maya twice and loved it, but the beaches in the dominican are nicer. We booked our trip thru Apple Vacations for a great price and all had a great time, we would definetely come back to this hotel, when I read some of the reviews, I was scared, don't be, you will be amazed how nice it is. Have a geat trip!!!

<Content>family fun been to this resort twice first time as a family vacation loved it so much brought more family back.Found the rooms to be ok not a five star but you only sleep in them. The pool was ok spent a bit of time in it but we went for the beach which is what made our vacation. Loved the beach and the sand. enjoyed everyday playing in the warm water, lying on the beach or going for a stroll. If you stroll far enough to the left or the right you will find some shopping venders. You have to haggle with them but you can get some great deals. Did'nt buy too much just a few items. Pretty jewerly but remember to haggle down alot. The food was great. As with any resort you will find some food not appealing but at the buffet we always found something that we enjoyed. Was not too fond of the al a carte restaurants preferred the buffet. Loved the staff and the nightly entertainment. They really tried to make you comfortable and join in on the activities. Some we joined in on some we did'nt. Went to the disco one night had a great time. Overall we did not want or need for anything. As I said we enjoyed ourselves so much that we have gone twice. I have booked again for 2008 but we are trying a different resort hopefully I won't be disappointed.

<Content>Tried it, but won't go back My friend and I stayed at Caribe Club Princess from Dec 7-10th. We were looking for a fun and rather inexpensive long weekend getaway and we definitely had fun. ARRIVAL - Upon arrival, we were immediately helped, but were told that our room was not ready (12:30PM). We were told to leave our luggage, go have lunch, and come back in an hour. We returned and were given our keys. When we went to the room, housekeeping was cleaning it still.GROUNDS - We decided to tour the resort - our initial impression was that the grounds were well-kept, with more of the natural landscaping than others in the Punta Cana area, and a lot of very exotic-looking birds calmly walking around. Multiple pools mean no waiting and no overcrowdedness, but I was surprised by the lack of pool cleanliness. There is a lot of dirt on the walls and floor of the pool that is noticeable. Public bathrooms are also pretty gross - we just kept going back to the room instead.FOOD - We visited the buffet - definitely lots of choices, but as we experienced at lunch and during the following dinners, the food quality is not high. Seafood dishes are fishy smelling and tasting, red meat is fatty, and general appearance or types of dishes are not that appetizing. My friend and I are both very adventurous eaters, so we tried almost everything and at most meals, we ended up sticking to mashed potatoes, pizza, french fries, pasta, and salads as these items tasted the best. Sad to say, we did waste some food but it really was inedible. Breakfast was pretty good - made to order items are delicious. Everything else is cold (all three days). Croissants and waffles are delicious! We also visited the Mexican and Chinese restaurants. The Mexican had fantastic soup and entrees, but the appetizers/salads/dessert were poor. The chinese was awful - everything was cooked and flavored with an abundance of soy sauce. We had 4 different entrees - they all tasted the same. DO NOT GO THERE! The creperie was nice, but not as good as the reviews of others suggested. THE BIGGEST PLUS - Both my fellow travelers and I got stomach sickness the last 2 visits to the DR. We were not sick at all from this resort - they do an excellent job of making sure that you are protected from bacteria, etc.BAR - unbelievably nice bartenders, very quick to get a drink - you can get champagne all day long which is nice, although not until after 12:30PM, so that leaves out mimosas at breakfast. Beer is Presidente which is great. Chocoloco is a phenomenal concoction! Either way, bartenders will make you any drink you want, shots are available if you want to do them, etc. No top shelf unless VIP, but I don't think anyone we met really missed it.BEACH - so gorgeous! Beautiful sand, warm aqua water, plenty of chairs. We weren't bombarded by vendors as some other guests were. If you said no, they did not argue with you and just walked away. We encountered maybe three per day. The beach is the reason to go to this hotel (and this country)!ACTIVITIES - Staff was pretty annoying about getting you to participate, but I think they were harder on us because they are all young men and we are female 20's. Lots of volleyball, water aerobics, salsa/merengue lessons, etc. We didn't go to the shows or the disco, but our friends that we met at the resort loved both. Casino is at a neighboring resort - very simple - BJ, 3 card poker, slots, roulette, craps was pretty much it.HOUSEKEEPING - really friendly, but awful. Worst I've experienced in my 3 DR trips. Not sure they change the sheets, definitely do not pick up after you, barely restock the minibar. Tips don't matter as we left some large ones. They folded up the towels we put on the floor and pretended they were new. We didn't get service at all one day. The other day, they came at 4:00PM. The next day, they came at 8:30AM. Totally inconsistent. No pretty fresh flowers, towel designs, or fantastic service as we have come to expect from housekeeping in the DR.THE ROOM - probably the worst part of the trip. The worst linens ever, air conditioning that would not shut off (we froze), and definitely a musty smell to the room. Towels were short and of very low quality. We saw a MONSTER black spider in the room one day. Tons of mosquitoes - each of us have at least 15 bug bites, but the other tourists from the other hotels had this as well - so I think it is the time of year. I traveled in April the last 2 times and did not get one bite. The location of the room was fantastic! We were in the 2100 building and we were steps from the buffet, beach, and 2 pools. Highly recommended location. Room is stocked with water and sodas. Doors to rooms are very thin - you can hear everything in the hallway. Every room that we saw has a small deck or balcony which is really nice.MISCELLANEOUS - Service at the buffet was awful - you may or may not get a drink (including water) with your meal. Hardly any of the resort staff speak English, so brush up some Spanish or French. Almost all European and Canadian guests at the resort, which we (as Americans) loved! If you are a girl in your 20's, be forewarned that every male staff member will flirt with you constantly. Which some girls probably loved, but I thought was very annoying. They ran out of beach towels every day. We always went early to get ours, but our friends sometimes had to wait hours for theirs.OVERALL REVIEW - for what we paid for three nights (inclusive of everything) - $515 USD per person - round-trip non-stop flight, airport transfers, and all-inclusive hotel, I'll say we did ok for our money. We came for a quick trip to enjoy the beach, pool, and warm weather and that's what we got. I was ready to go home when we did - I can't imagine staying a week or more here...I would be so bored!! If you are looking for friendly people (both guests and staff) and beautiful scenery, this is the place for you. If you are looking for a culinary and resort experience - this is not it. Great place to escape with friends for some alcohol and fun in the sun. I won't be back, but that's primarily because I won't go back anywhere unless it is spectacular. There are too many places to try!!!!

<Content>pleasantly surprised! We booked this trip following the advice of a travel agent. She was definitely right - this is a very nice resort for the money! From the moment we arrived everything far exceeded our expectations. Our room was very nice and had a mini suite, complete with a fruit tray and bottle of rum (we think this was because we told them both our friends and us were celebrating birthdays and anniversaries, but we're not sure). The maid was excellant, and provided extra towels, bottled water, beer and soda upon request (we did tip her!) Since it was just a short trip, we spent most of our time on the beach or in the pool. The beach was very nice, and plenty of chairs for everyone. The pool was also, and Jose Alamarez, the pool bar bartender was fabulous!! He really made sure everyone was having a great time, and made them feel welcome. Most of the staff were courteous, but it appeared their level of friendliness depended on how comfortable they are with the language barriers. We met many nice people; it appears there were more Europeans, and Candadians than Americans. The food was fairly good. Breakfast was pretty much the same thing each day, though there were plenty of selections. We thought the buffet food was better than the restaurants, though it's nice to sit down and be waited on during dinner after a long day on the water. We took one excurions dune buggying, which was an absolute blast! Be advised -do not do this if you don't like dirt and mud! I typically don't, but after the first puddle, it just didn't matter and I enjoyed it! All in all, this is a great resort for the money!

<Content>Fun time! My husband and I stayed at the Caribe Club from November 10 - November 17th to celebrate our 1 year wedding anniversary. We were a litte worried going there based on some of the reviews that we had read but I am happy to say that we had nothing but a wonderful experience! The staff from the minute we arrived to the minute we left were AWESOME! Their english was great and their personalites and humor were great! We did get the VIP package and we were very pleased with it! I would reccommend that package to anyone! It provided us with a great room, great drinks, a wonderful massage and a delicious dinner at La Cava! we went to almost all the restaurants and La Cava was hands down our favorite! Chinese was our next favorite. We didn't care for the Mexican though but that is what the buffet was for ;) The only bummer we experienced was the weather. I know that we went during rainy season but still! It rained all day on Tuesday which we really didn't mind since we had already scheduled a shopping excursion for that day. It then decided to rain all day on Thursday so by the afternoon we said that we are here on vacation and we are going to go play in the ocean while it was raining! So we did! Other folks had the same idea and we had a ball! It wasn't thundering or lightning so we were fine! We had a blast catching the waves and just having good old fun in the rain and water! It then decided to rain all day on Friday so we went and got massages at the Spa. We can't say enough good things about the spa! Go! It is beautiful! We tipped our maid $2 every other day and we never had a problem. She was great!Food - buffet was good. Always something there to satisfy ya! Room service was good and timely too!Pools - all 3 were great! It was nice to have an option of getting away from all the action at the main pool....Service - WonderfulWe would definitely consider going back...Have fun! No worries!

<Content>Great Holiday After reading all the negative reviews and having stayed at a 5 star hotel in Mexico previously, I wanted to add a quick review of our stay.My family and friends just returned from a 7 day stay at this hotel. My nephew was married at the resort during our stay. Our party had a fantastic time. We would recommend this hotel for anyone who wants to have lots of fun around the pool and can't afford a high end hotel.We did not take the VIP upgrade on this trip as it has not been worth the extra money at other resorts we have stayed at. But you definitely should take it at this resort if you can afford it. Some of our family members did have it and I counted at least 15 improvements that we did not have.Generally the VIP rooms have newer furniture, whiter towels, better stocked refrigerators and other various things. VIP also includes rum, cigars, two 20 min. massages, free water sports, and the list continues. All VIP rooms are in one building.Our building, across the pool, was all non-VIP rooms. The furniture was a little shabbier, the towels grayer, only water and pop in the frig. And to be frank, our room was musty smelling. But the rooms of other family members in our group, were fine. It didn't matter as we were there to be by the pool and the beach and didn't spend much time in our room.The main floor hallway at the end of our building had a very bad sewage smell but was easily avoided by using one of the other hallways. The buffet food was good, although definitely not 5 star quality. More like 3 1/2 star . But you could always count on fruits, breads, cooked veggies, eggs, pasta.The restaurant food was above average to excellent.Service at all food venues was absolutely wonderful. A tip goes a long way. Try to sit in the same area of the buffet each time you visit and you will soon be recognized and with a healthy tip on your first visit, will be given extra special treatment each time you eat. Keep in mind that these servers work all day and evening for 12 days with 4 days off. And they always have a smile.The beach was out of this world. And the main pool had a great acitivity staff with lots of action. The smaller pools were quieter for those that prefer that.A good resort for a good price.

<Content>Horrible service I couldn't wait to get back home. What a horrible time we had down there. After being recommended by our travel agent, at Red Tag. Where do I begin. Let's start with the condom on the door, upon arrival. There was a freak'n condom wrapped around the door handle to one of guest's bedroom. A/C did not work in any of the rooms. We were not upgraded to our honeymoon suite. By the way this was our wedding. They promised a VIP treatment because of our wedding, but was very far from it. Travel agent book our wedding at an adult only resort, when we had children in the wedding party. They could not attend the wedding, only by standing on the public beach, away from the ceremony. The wedding dinner was a huge disappointment. I saw cockroaches at this restaurant the next day. You know how disappointing that is. I could not tell my wife this, she would cry. They just took advantage of us and made me pay for all these ridicious upgrades for the wedding, (that I thought were standard), I could not tell my wife this as well, (I couldn't ruin her day). They tried to charge me $800 US for the cd of the wedding photos, and promised me great quality, but they lied and the quality was horrible, not even 2 mega pixels. I paid extra money for guest to attend the wedding and eat at this fancy restaurant (with cockroaches), pretty much paid for them to be VIP guest at the resort, but did not receive any of the VIP bonuses. Our travel agent told us that this was a 4-1/2 star resort, but our friends told us they stayed at a 3 star resort and got better service. I understand that everything works a little different on Dominician Time, but it seems like the front desk hotel staff was not very accommedating at all. I would not recommend this resort for anyone, wedding or not, unless you go for very cheap, ie. $500 CAN or less.Thanks,

<Content>great holiday We had a two week holiday in the caribe club princess and were more than pleased with every aspect, meaning rooms, food pools, activities, gardens and beach. Contrary to the last review there were lots of activities on offer all day long, ranging from archery to Yoga. Even though we did very little because we liked sitting on the beach so much, it was obvious that they were all run professionally and people were enjoying themselves.Everything was very clean, well-kept and rather wonderful. There is no need to worry about anything and the few people who disliked this hotel must have had a very negative attitude. As for the traders in the grounds, they are a nuisance but here is the way to handle them: Show courtesey and respect by shaking hands and talking to them, they are just human beings! Then be assertive but pleasant. If you don't want to look say something like: We don't want to buy any jewellery/carvings/pictures etc. because we already got it/don't like it/have run out of money. Be honest and pleasant, make eye contact and ask about their family and have a chat. After about four minutes (and what is four minutes?) they will be happy to say adios. You have met a local, you have acted politely, and learned something about a fellow human. That is the way to be. Thye dominicans think that people who just quickly walk past and avoid them, are rude, sad, and stressed. The resort is relaxing so why not be relaxed in your attitude? Many tourists seemed frightened but there is no need. Enjoy your holiday and make the most of it. The one thing that was surprising was that the sea was quite rough and we couldn't do the kayaking and snorkeling we had planned to do, bit of a shame but what can you do?

<Content>no way it is 4 star We belong to Royal Holiday which is a vacation club. When we purchased our contract it was to stay at the Ocean Blue. We loved it there. Apparently Ocean Blue had enough of Royal and now we have to go to Caribe Club. Our first 3 nights we stayed in a terrible old section where the air did not work. According to my deal with Royal i get 2 rooms. Caribe gave us a family suite. It was gross.After all the locals checked out they moved us to the new section. That, unfortunately was after 3 nights. The new rooms were very nice and were connecting. The staff was helpful. The food was basic all inclusive fare. Would i go back?? I have to since my vacation club is based there. But now i know in advance what building to stay in.

<Content>Had a great time Just returned last night from our stay at the Caribe Princess and I was nervous after reading some of the reviews. No need, the staff was great the hotel was clean, the service was very good. We always had clean towels, and they even brought us more each night. We had the vip package, which I would do again. The VIP package includes premium drinks and my husband likes Bud, so it was included for us. The rooms were clean an spacious. The pool was always clean. The hotel does have some wear and tear but that is expected. The beach area is clean and there were always plenty of chairs. The food was always good. We ate at all of the restaurants except the seafood one. La Cava was the best. You have to pay for it if you don't have the VIP but I would say it was well worth it. My least favorite was the Chineese, but even that was good. A couple of things I didn't like. On Saturdays and Wednedsays they let people from the outside set up tables to sell you things, They are very aggressive and tough to get a round. If you are not interested just keep walking once you stop it is very difficult to leave. They also try to get very high prices bargin bargin bargin. Threaten to leave and you will get your price. If you travel with travelers checks they exchange bank will only cash them for pesos. Make sure you use all of your pesos because they will not exchange them back for you. Also, the rate is different at the exchange bank than it is when you buy something. 31 pesos to the dollar at the bank but you pay 33 pesos to the dollar at the store. We tipped everyone so everyone was happy to see us and gave us great service. The maids go out of their way for you if you tip them.. If you can bring crayons and coloring books or school supplies to give the maids or other staff they really appreciate it. I am all ready booking my trip to go back we had a great time. Oh yea I should say not a lot of night life but there is a disco that opens at 11 but you have to pay for drinks after midnight and they are expensive. Next time we will stay for 2 weeks. Remember a vacation is what you make of it.

<Content>Loved It!!! I stayed here for 7 nights and it was great. (10/14-10/21/07) Everyone was so courteous and pleasant. The weather was great. There were problems with the hand towels, but I brought my own after I read other comments before I traveled. I only experienced that problem two out of the seven days. No big deal since I planned accordingly.The room was clean and spacious. The view was good. If you are looking for peace and quiet, this is not the resort. I didn't mind the noise because it was calm from 6:00pm - 10:00am. I would recommend this resort and I will return. The staff does its best to ensure that you have a good time if that's what you are seeking. Highly recommend!

<Content>Great Value at a Great Resort I just returned from the Caribe Club Princess, our 9th stay in Punta Cana. We have stayed high end (Riu Palace Punta Cana, Secrets) middle (Iberostar Punta Cana and Hacienda Dominicus, Sunscape the Beach and the Grand, Riu Bambu, Melia Caribe)...I had a group of 23 with me. This was the only 4 Apple in the Dominican we have visited. Having sold it many time and having had happy clients I was not worried., even with a few bad reviews.All I can say is I had 23 happy clients with me even with Tropical Storm Noel at our resort the first few days. This resort had quite possible the nicest and most accomdating employees I have ever dealt this!! The staff is wonderful and people make the place! A nice resort with unhappy and unhelpful staff does not cut it with me!Rooms were fine, clean and nice, and very spacious.Service-Beyond all expectationsFood-good everywhere we went, buffet and ala carte.Beach-SUPERB!!Entertainment-great at the beach and pool, the 2 evening shows I went to were okay, but that is not my thing to begin with...Several of my repeat clients could not figure out why the resort was not rated higher-and quite frankly neither could I. My new clients who had never done all inclusive loved it also. One friend who NEVER returns to the same resort, said she thinks with this one she might break her rule, she would like to return!There just was simply nothing to complain about...as a TA I am always looking for things that need improvement, and really they are doing it right at this resort. Some fans in the lobby, cause it gets warm would be nice, and better lighting when you go to the theater...would be all the fault I could find!This resort offers fantastic value for the money

<Content>Great Hotel For The Price We booked an Apple vacation at the Caribe Club Princess during the week of October 22-29, 2007. We had great weather for six of the seven days, then the storm came in. It did rain a few nights, but that is to be expected for the area and time of year. It was our first time in Punta Cana and after reading some of the reviews, I was hoping I didn't make a mistake booking that hotel. Well, I didn't!! It was a great vacation. The staff was friendly and helpful, the room clean everyday. We ate at the buffet for two dinners and always found something good to eat. The restaurants were also very good, but you have to make reservations early. We had dinner at the restaurants on five nights and found the Chinese our favorite. I don't understand how some of the previous writers could complain about the food unless they are extremely picky. There was always something good to pick from whether you like fancy or the plainer fare. Some people will complain no matter what. The beach was the best beach ever, even nicer than Cancun, although the water in Cancun is a little prettier. The water was warm and clean. There are no shells, stones, etc. on the beach which made long walks enjoyable. We had no trouble finding chairs or huts to sit under during our stay. By all means, if you are looking for a great vacation without going into debt for it, go to this hotel and use a few dollars that you saved on tips for the staff. They deserve it. We would definately go back to the Caribe Club Princess and recommend it to others.Joanne and Ed from New Jersey

<Content>Loved everything about it! My husband and I stayed at the Caribe Club Princess for 2 weeks in Oct 2007 and we had a great time!! The hotel was beautiful, colourful and the vegetation looked amazing. They had all kinds of birds around the hotel site (white ducks, little ducks, peacocks, roosters, herons, little black birds, etc) which you could feed. The walk from the front desk to the hotel was about 8 minutes but they had shuttle services for those who didn't want to walk. The lobby was beautiful and they offer internet services ($10/hour). The food was delicious and had something for everyone! Their buffet was great (and had a wide variety-they had a section where the food was always different but also had a couple of other sections where they served pizza and pasta everyday at every meal) and they also had 5 a la carte restaurants. We tried 4 out of 5 restaurants (mexican, brazilian, italian and chinese) and were happy with each one fo them. They also have a beach bar which starts serving food at 11:30 a.m. for those who can't wait until the buffet opens at 12:30 pm. The beach was beautiful and well maintained. There was plenty of chairs for everyone but of course, we were there during the slow season. If you walk 20 minutes to the left of the hotel or 40 minutes to the right of the hotel, you get to little shops on the beach were you can buy souvenirs. The only thing that we found annoying with those is that the vendors will come and grab you right off the beach to come see their shops and they will not take no for an anwser... When they would do that, I would ask if they would give me what I wanted for free as I didn't have any money, then they would let us go!The staff at the the hotel was very friendly and helpful. They always had a smile on their face and were always happy to assist you in any way they could. If you tip them (bartenders, buffet servers, restaurants servers) $1 US, they will remember you. We didn't even have time to order a beer that it would be sitting in front of us. My parents came with us for the first week. They usually travel in 5 stars hotels so I was scared they would not enjoy a 4 star as much. To theirs and our surprise, they loved it. The only thing they didn't like is that they bought the VIP package, which was a waste of money for them. The package gives you 1 hour of banana boat, 1 hour of internet (which needs to be used in one time or else you loose the remainder of the hour), 20 minutes massage, free premium liquor and a free dinner in a paying restaurant (value of $25/person - steakhouse or seafood). All of that for an additional $200/person. To them, it wasn't worth it and they do not recommend it to anyone. I would go back to that hotel in a heartbeat! We were afraid that 2 weeks might be too long in one resort, but it wasn't long enough! I would have stayed another 2 weeks! Have fun if you decide to go there!

<Content>avery  Different strokes for each traveler. Our experience at this resort is one of great pleasure. The food was wonderful and the scenery was breath taking. You can never please all travelers. People bring their issues with them, and they become magnified with any small problem. Enjoy your vacation. We don't speak spanish and had no problem getting what we needed during our 7 nights stay. The staff was very helpful, especially the front desk clerk Ivanova. This was my first trip out side the United States and my girlfriend 2nd time to punta cana . We will be returning to this resort in the near future.

<Content>fantastic vacation This was our second time at the caribe club and it was a great time again. We stayed 10/7/07-10/14/07. We lucked out, weather was great. We really enjoy this resort and like the lay out of the rooms. Rooms are close to all pools and the beach. All the specialty resturants and buffet are near the rooms and not up by the lobby. This hotel does not put a limit on the specialty resturants so we were able to get a reservation every night, including the day we arrived. We have stayed at much more expensive ai and have been limited to only 3 times for a 7 night stay. We enjoyed the food at every resturant. The pools, beach and grounds are very beautiful. Great service every where from the front desk, buffet staff, and bartenders. We did do one excursion. The half day Outback Safari. Perfect amount of time off resort and a very informative and enjoyable excursion. We also went to the market down the beach and the plaza down the road.This is our 8th all inclusive and I would rate it as 5 star and definetly would return for a 3rd time.

<Content>Not bad at all! Don't let all the negative reviews scare you. I was sick with concern before we went on our trip, wondering what we were getting into. Read on...We arrived in Punta Cana on September 26. We received our luggage and got our transportation to the Caribe Club Princess relatively quickly. Check-in was no problem and before we knew it, we were in our room. We had no issues with the room. It had everything that they said it would. No surprises. The pool was great. It seemed clean and there was always someone attending to it. The staff was great. They gave alot of attention to the visitors and made sure you had what you needed. The beach was beautiful. We ate at the Chinese restaurant twice and enjoyed it both times. The Italian restaurant was good also. We didn't care for the Mexican restaurant, but that's just us. We are all picky eaters and couldn't get used to the fact that the food would be prepared differently there. We ate most meals at the buffet, but there again, we would pick and choose. We had our old standbys and so in that respect it got a little boring. Most people we talked with loved the food.I was very concerned about reviews that I read regarding the flies on the food in the buffet area. I did not see one fly on any food when we were there. Maybe it was a different time of year, but that was not an issue for us. The only negative thing I would say is that there are some areas of the buildings that could use some TLC, but when you consider how many thousands of people use this place in a year, I can expect some wear and tear.Do visit the vendors down the beach. There's alot of shopping to be done there. Make sure you don't pay what they are asking. You must barter with them or you will get ripped off. Shy about bartering? Don't go.All in all, for the price, this place is very nice. The grounds are pretty and well taken care of. The staff was very attentive.

<Content>Beach was nice Upon arriving we were told that the room with the King size bed was unavailiable, after some arguing we were given the room we wanted and had booked.Food was ok, nothing special. Some kind of small black birds like to frequent the main buffet. This seemed to us to be kinda cool. Its not till you see them hopping on the tables and picking at scraps that it becomes bothersome and downright unsanitary. Breakfast tables had cloth placemats placed on them. When a table was emptied, these placements were used to sweep the table of crumbs and them flipped upsidedown to be reused again. Small streams run under pathways from the lobby to your room. The first stream had a smell of something like sewer or something rotting in the mangroove. This was especially noticiable late at nite. The smell once was so strong we had to hold our breathe.Hospitality overall at the resort was not very good unless you tipped them.Rooms were very clean.

<Content>Definitely Not The Best Resort Out There! My 3 girl friends, and I stayed at Caribe Club Princess at the end of September and to say the least, we were quite disappointed. We are a well traveled group and have been to the DR on a handful of occassions and have stayed at many beautiful resorts. We're a very easy going group in our mid-20s and love to have fun on vacation but I would say this resort ranks the lowest in all the resorts we have ever stayed at. Check-In: We had to wait almost 2 hours to check-in to our rooms. It wasn't even like we arrived in the morning but early in the evening and were expecting our rooms to be ready. We made the most and had a couple of drinks. We finally got our rooms but waited another 45 minutes for our luggages to be delivered to our room. Not to mention, the room was very hot and felt like there was no air circulation in there. Definitely wasn't a good start to our vacation.Restaurants/Food: When you don't have to cook your own meals, I guess that's always a good thing. Lots of variety but you pretty much had to make reservations first thing in the day for the a la carte restaurants or you'd be out of luck. We ended up eating in the buffet for the most part.Beach/Pool/Grounds: Nicer part of the Punta Cana beaches but defintely not enough palapas. The pools are nice but they can use some touch up and needed better cleaning from the debris that accumulates in them.Entertainment: It was your typical Animacion/Entertainment team with various activities throughout the day and nightly shows. Overall, friendly staff as the Dominican people always are and many of the reasons we love this country. And we love all the cute Dominican boys but we did encounter a couple of them that were to aggressive and way too flirtatious that it actually became annoying - and never had anyone asked us for money so bluntly. Other than that, all the other staff were always friendly and smiling.Overall, the resort attracts more Europeans and found ourselves, Canadians, being minorities amongst the tourists. Not a bad resort but I would never go back. We got a good deal for our vacation package but I would have paid more to stay at another resort if I had known better. I guess you get what you paid for!

<Content>Great Girls' Getaway! We were 7 girls (OK, so we're 50 YO women, but we still think of ourselves as 'the girls'!), looking for somewhere inexpensive and complete for a long weekend. We settled on the Caribe Club Princess in Punta Cana. The weather wasn't great, but the trip was, regardless. Our accommodations were spacious enough for 2 (6 shared rooms), and the staff could not have been nicer. We upgraded to the VIP package which included dinner in the theme restaurants-- we had seafood, Chinese and Italian over the three nights we were there, which I strongly recommend. I don't think three breakfasts, lunches and dinners in the buffet would have cut it. (There's also a creperie and poolside pizza for lunch.)If you're going to these restaurants, book your reservations the day you arrive. They are tiny and tend to have limited availability.Pools and bars are plentiful, but there wasn't much opportunity for dancing, as one of 'the girls' wanted but the rest of us were tired after dinner so it didn't bother us.There's souvenier shopping on the property, and if it's t-shirts you're looking for, they're fairly priced at $8 for children's and $10 for adults. You might do a little bit better by negotiating with the guys on the beach, but if you don't like bargaining, go to the stores. I bought some larimar (which I swore I wouldn't do, but it's beautiful and I couldn't resist!). I went to the Harrison's jewelry story at the mall. (It rained one afternoon so 6 of us took a taxi.) If you go, they have a beautiful selection of excellent quality larimar. But be prepared to negotiate. I got great prices, esp compared to the best I could get in the hotel lobby. (Even they will bargain with you though not as much.) Wherever you shop, don't pay retail. And don't compare the pieces the vendors sell with what you find in a fine jewelry store. It's not the same.I wish I'd had more time on this trip. When we lost 1.5 days to travel, and another to rain, it really cut into the fun. October is still part of the rainy season-- June to Oct. It's also extremely muggy and very humid. If you have breathing problems, go another time.We went thru Apple and for a place that was largely unknown to us, it was the way to go. Their reps and drivers were professionals. USA 3000 was our airline and I'd use them again in a heartbeat. As a charter, we were able to take off early by 30 minutes each way. (So don't get to the airport at the last minute-- your flight may be gone!) I would strongly recomment a non-stop flight, if it's available. We stopped at BWI on the way back and even tho it wasn't our final destination, we had to get off there to clear customs, collect our luggage, clear security and re-enter, then wait to reboard the same plane. (And then 45 min later, we did the deboard and wait for luggage part at home, again.) (I'd make sure it was direct next time, even if it were more expensive.)For the price, this was a good value. I like the island and the people were very warm. As Americans, we were in a tiny minority. This is a very cosmopolitan vacation spot with Western and Eastern Europeans, as well as Russians. I thought that part was fun. The language is Spanish, though a number of hotel staff spoke perfect English and some spoke it with a heavy accent. Brush up on some Spanish phrases before you go. They appreciate you trying. And PS, watch out for the boys on the banana boat. They say they won't dunk you, but they do :)

<Content>Just O.K. The transportation to the airport went just fine. Our check in went smoothe. The greeted us with mamjauna upon our arrival. We had a nice room near the pool. The room was clean. If you leave tips, the house keeping does a good job.If you're looking for a party, this is not the place to go. The entertainment was not too hot either. If you've been to one all inclusivie rosort, you've been to them all. The same layout. The food gets tiresome after a few days. There is basically not much to do accept for lay out on the beach (which was dirty) oy by the pool and get tanned. The disco played all Dominican music which was no fun considering I couldn't understand anything they were sais ying. There is an internanitonal part also but the good american drinks, you have to pay for.We went on an excursion The Outback Safari, it was alright. Not a whole lot to rave about to me. We stopped at this one place that supposedly made homemade mammajauna which iis popular there. Got that stuff home and it was some fake stuff that taste like MD 20/20 with wood chips in it. Don't buy it. Of course while you're there they let you tast it but its not what's in that bottle. You don't know what you're buying until you get home. Oh I forgot unless you run the air at all times, the room becomes really wet and dampre. We couldn't figure out why our room always smelled moist until the 6th day were there.The Buffet was o.k. but the Shangay was horrible and the Dominican restaurant uuummm it was bearable. Our last day there we had the Mexican whihc was by far the best restaurant there. Stick to the buffet to be safe. It was really not much to do there. Maybe because we were single. Depending on what you're to do; if its rest and relaxation, you'll definetely get that. Checking out went smoothe also. All of the staff were really friendly.

<Content>Great Place -- Great Value We stayed at this resort 8/31 - 9/7. We enjoyed our experience very much. I was a little concerned due to some poor reviews -- but that certainly was not our experience. We booked through USA3000 vacations and for $75 more pp, had the VIP Suite upgrade -- well worth it, I feel. Our room was on the 3rd floor (no elevators), but directly overlooked the beach -- very lovely. It was large -- with a nice sitting area and balcony. The room was clean and well appointed. Several reviews stated that they had to get to shaded chairs by 6 am -- I find that hard to believe! We never had problems getting a shaded chair (the ones around the pool with the bar filled quickly, but there are two other very large, and quieter, pools where we never had a problem). In addition, most shaded chairs on the beach were empty. The resort was only about half full, so this could have been the difference -- but even full, there appeared to be ample shaded chairs. There were 5 speciality restaurants and a buffet. In addition, there were two premium restaurants -- La Cava and El Pescador, which required a $25 pp fee. We had one option apiece for these with the VIP package, and it was good (La Cava), but I would not pay $25 extra pp. You needed reservations for the other 5 restaurants, but a concierage was available in the buildings all day, and we had no problem booking. The food was good and varied. We really enjoyed the Dominican restaurant -- typical Dominican food. We enjoyed a complimentary 20 minute back massage on the beach (part of the VIP package) and since I was a certified diver, had a complimentary dive with the VIP. The grounds are spacious and well kept, the staff very friendly and accomodating. There is a shuttle bus to and from the main building from the room buildings, but we always walked. We did not go to the shows -- they didn't start until 9:45 pm and we preferred sitting on our balcony and listening to the surf. This was a great time to go (albeit the threat of hurricanes) -- the weather was great and far less crowds. We did three off site tours: the Marinarium (swimming with nurse sharks and rays), Outback Safari (an all day journey to the rural area of the DR), and an on the beach horseback ride. All were good and worthwhile. All and all, I feel this is a good choice and great value.

<Content>Great time! Highly recommended Great time overall! Stayed there Aug 31 - Sep 7, 2007 and had hard time to go back.Pluses:- fabulous beach (this is a beachfront resort)- good variety of water sports available (including parasailing and scuba diving)- very friendly and nice hotel staff and animation team- good variety of entertainment programs (pool daytime, theater and lobby evenings)- international atmosphere (visitors from many countries, speaking many languages)- beach bars open long at night- good food in general (main restaurant has dinners from different parts of the world every day), other restaurants - Brazilian was the best- wireless internet available in the lobbyMinuses:- the main restaurant, the theatre and the lobby are poorly ventilated, sometimes it gets uncomfortably hot- music in the discotheque way too loudTips:- book restaurants ahead of time (2-3 days in advance), otherwise they get full quickly- go to Higway for shopping, much cheaper than duty free at the airport, a town an hour away. Also an opportunity to see a typical Dominican town, we went there ourselves with a public bus, no safety issues, you may hire one of the kids there for 10-15$ to show you the city- if you bring your laptop, make sure to say it to the guy selling internet access, there is a different pricing plan for laptop users (10$ a day) vs. regular internet users (10$ an hour). Regular access will not allow to connect your laptop to the internet

<Content>best value for the $$ We just finished staying at the Caribe, from Aug. 27th to Sept. 3rd.What a buy for the $$. We certainly got our money's worth.We booked thru apple vacations and my local travel agent.We flew usa 3000, both flights were great, ontime, transfers were good, hotel check in, we arrived early about 11:20 and our room was ready, easiest check in we have had.I don't know were the other reviews come from on things like towels, beach chairs and huts, we had not problems . Fresh towels every day, although the washclothes were scarce, we did not have to get up at the crack of dawn to reserve beach or pool chairs, each day after breakfast, around 9 or so there were plenty, even mid day..there was not shortage to be found. We did find the lunch buffetts to be a bit boring..but there was plenty of food and choices, just not to our liking, but we didn't go hungry at all. The best place for lunch, The Crepeorie.The service was very good. we didn't have any trouble getting reservations for dinner, itilian was our favorite. The people were very courteous and helpful, they don't speak much english, but they will try every attempt to figure out what you need. check out was a breeze too. Our 2 kids had a great time too..plenty to keep them busy, from boogie boarding to mini golf to football on the beach...all in all a very good trip. oh i forgot, the beach, absolutly wonderful!, pure white sand...great water....

<Content>Not Bad We stayed at the Caribe Club Princess from 08-17-2007 through 08-24-2007...not a bad experience definately had its perks and downsides....but as many people have said in this forum... 'a vacation is what you make of it'...keep in mind you're not in the usa or canada...so OBVIOUSLY things will be different....(language, food, culture etc)...here's what I can think of as far as reviews go:Food/Buffet/A La CarteBUFFET The buffet is exactly like any other all you can eat restaurant....bland, plain etc...however extensive in its options every night....it can get to be a bit repetative but thats why you should explore the a la cartes for variety.....they have themed nights and sometimes you may find the same dishes on the a la carte menus in the buffet....(i.e. mexican night, chinese night, seafood night etc)..but with the buffet you obviously cant predict what they will serve....overall it was good.. the set up was nice, it is a really big restaurant....shared by both resorts (the tropical princess/caribe club)...this resort is big but thats because it is a lot with two resorts combined in one...the wait staff was nice always very receptive, they made sure that for the most part nobody was at the buffet with their swimsuits on (thats great! i think)... there is a bit of an issue with flies around the food displays.. but its an open concept..so its hard to avoid bugs..you sort of have to suck it up...and not think about it...i know its hard!...but its either that or starve the week that you're there...A LA CARTEHere's where I get my money back :D...forget the buffet.. the A LA CARTE restaurants were amazing...we did Chinese, Brazillian, Mexican and Italian....with the Caribe Club we had 5 a la carte reservations included....we didn't bother with the restaurants that were not included (la cava, and seafood)...here's what I thoughtChinese: it was amazing! we did it twice....the food was well prepared, very flavourful, and presented in an elaborate display..the restaurant was always quiet..which is a nice change from the buffet...portions were a great size! and the staff for the most part was really nice..and treated us well...Brazillian: i won't lie..this was not anywhere near being a favourite for me...none of the wait staff spoke english..which is fine for staff you don't have to communicate with (i.e. entertainers etc)...but when it comes to ordering and having questions be answered..forget about it....this restaurant was different than the other places....it was a 5 part meal...and you were basically served everything on the menu...waiters would come with platters and service everyone all at once...like one guy would come out with chicken and go around each table serving whoever was interested..then the next item on the menu came out and so on....this was a long process especially because nobody spoke english...people were confused as to how to order the food....we didnt realize that you have to wait for everyone who reserved to be there..before dinner begins...NOT COOL! i definately did not like this concept....Italian and Mexican: it was great! food was nicely prepared, some variety... nice cuts of chicken...im a big fan of white meat..so to have this sort of quality at an all inclusive resort was nice... DESERTSI liked the buffet for deserts, you can take as much as you want...and it is the exact same thing that is served at the a la cartes, except you can have more of it...oh and apparently the a la cartes are creperies during the day time, but we couldn't be bothered to find out...so we didnt go...SNACK BAR:Average...I thought it was the least clean, because people served themselves..usually right after they got out of the pool or returned from the beach..I stayed away...but sometimes you're starved and there's not many other options...Service/Maids/Receptionists etcOur maid wasn't the best....they dont change your bedsheets..so be sure you request a fresh set of sheets...otherwise you will have sand, bedbugs and god knows what else creep up on you in the middle of the night...its not good if you have little children.. Receptionists were great at the front lobby! The man at the front desk really hooked up a nice room for us infront of the pool with an ocean view... no complaints!...Bar staff were always great, and they spoke english which was a nice treat...the service wasn't too bad....our signature vacations representative was not the greatest..we felt a bit mislead...i suggest really reading up on the reviews for excursions etc..before spending an arm and a leg.. the excursions were overpriced and nowhere near what was described...my friends went snorkling and took pictures with sharks and stingrays..that I was told was worth the money.. other than that...I would really think twice about some of the excursions..such as Saona Island...it takes two hours by bus to get to the boat ..then another hour and a half by catamaran... but on the way back to the bus lot they take you one speed boats which is a bit of a relief..but its really tiring!..and the last thing i want on vacation is to be tired..Pool/Beach/Entertainment/ShoppingPOOLNice...a little smaller than I expected...not too deep its deepest area is 5 feet...so you can basically walk across..which is fine.. as my friends put it..you're not there to do laps in the pool..you're there to relax which is just what the pool is for...The main pool gets a bit dirty, and I wish there were more staff available to maintain it...because you end up stepping on cups, sand and god knows what else....the swimup bar was cute...sort of small and crowded...strange enough the majority of the crowd at the swim up bar were little children..who liked to sit up on the bar stools....figures because it was in the shallow end...the other pool was nice, definately quieter might even be bigger..im not sure..we liked the music and games so we didn't bother with the second pool....but it was definately cleaner!BEACHGORGEOUS!..no complaints..soft sands....little sea weed.. friendly people..lots of chairs..we didn't ever have any trouble getting a chair for ourselves at the pool or beach..there werent many vendors...nobody bothered you..so it was really just paradise.. :DENTERTAINMENTThey played great music by the pool, lots of mainstream music, reggae, spanish etc....large variety for everyone to enjoy...the pool games were silly..and get repetative..was fun to watch though.. The night time plays were just okay....sort of a disappointment... the kiddie shows we didnt care for..since we were all adults there.. but it looked cute from far..and the kids seemed to have a good time..but again..not what i was there for...the adult shows were average...a lot of them involved members of the audience who were pulled on stage...they had similar shows everynight.. so they didn't really stand out....the lion king was a good show... keeping in mind that it's obviously not broadway..but it was probably the only show we stayed to watch until the end..SHOPPINGThey have plazas outside of the resort, that we did not bother with..we walked across the beach to the flee market.. I had more fun bargaining...as its something you never get to do here in North America...always offer 1/3 of the price..and hey flirt with them...if you're cute...i guarantee you will get a good deal.. we didn't have to beg too much..the people at the shops want to sell what they have...so they'll settle at a good offer that works well for the tourist...STAY AWAYY FROM THE GIFTSHOP!...we bought calling cards that were 300.00 pesos but the card said 250.00 pesos! so they rip you off ....and there is nothing you can do or say... its a rip off!....dont buy anything unless you need to..and are desparate... $15.00 for a bottle of sunscreen?..it's almost theft! i feel...just be well prepared and pack of of the necessities in your bags....ahead of time otherwise they will rape you with their high prices...NIGHTLIFEWe spent our time in the lobby..it was always entertaining they usually had live bands play..the lobby was massive..it was nice to sit on the couch and enjoy a nice cold drink which watching the festivities go on...lots of people dancing..it was beautiful!.. probably one of the things i miss most....The disco was okay.. Areito was what it was called and it was on the resort...I heard Mangu was better..so if you're there to party! go to Mangu it's apparently THE spot...We didn't enjoy Areito...crowd was boring.. nobody on the dancefloor...and too much spanish music.. I prefer mainstream, reggae...and that's what you will find at Mangu....Room/Amenities etcShower: no pressure..but hot water was availableFridge: Stocked up on a daily basis with non alcoholic beveragesTowels: Not always replaced unless you throw them on the floor, thats how the maid knows to replace them...if you keep them hung up they will assume you don't need new ones!Pillow Cases/ Bedsheets:ASK for new ones..otherwise you will never get them changed!Internet:Is offered to you for $10.00 for a whole hour that you can use over the span of 5 days...it's not bad especially when you're homesick and just want to pop onto messenger to update everyone at home about your trip...Phone/Calling Cards:You will get ripped off..but if you must..then buy a calling card its 10.00 us and you get a half hour...hotel charges 2.00 connection fee..but once again it is sooo worth it when you get homesickOVERALL:Great experience! I enjoyed it....I made the best of it..some downfalls but they are soo minor..the beach is GORGEOUS and the people are friendly...this resort was nice..and I would recommend it for famillies...and people maybe a bit older than myself...like age 30+

<Content>excellent value We had a wonderful vacation; this is not a five star hotel but for the price it was definately worth it. I have stayed at much nicer resorts for more money and for travelers on a budget the Caribe Club is well worth the money. Do not listen to all of the complaints, we had a great time. Check-in- Perfect and fast. We had three rooms next to each other. The hotel staff immediately brought us beer while we filled out paperwork and such. We changed into our bathing suits and enjoyed the gorgeouos beach until our rooms were ready. Rooms- clean and comfortable; yes the pillows are lumpy but whatever we were so tired every night it did not matter! Fridge stocked daily- if you want beer in your fridge just ask the maids they are very helpful (you need to speak Spanish to them though). Beach and Pools- beach was awesome and the staff very fun; many games all day long very entertaining. Pool bar gets crowded, a few dollars helps :) The partially shaded pool on the Tropical Princess side nice and quiet if you need a break, although the bar that is there has the only actual frozen pina coladas (the beach bars and pool bars can't seem to keep up with their frozen drinks, they were always watery). The shaded spots on the beach are usually all gone by about 8:30 or 9:00- so if you want one go out earlier.Food- We got tired of it, but that is normal for any all-inclusive. It was average, definately make reservations at a restaurant each night. The buffett was nice for lunch since they have fresh salads. My favorite lunch was the creperie- it opens at 1:30 but is well worth it. Mushroom and cheese crepe- they used fresh shitakke yummm. We paid for the seafood restaurant not worth it. Lobster way overcooked and drown in butter. Domincan restaurant was very good; italian okay (don't get lasagna so salty) although the antipasta bar at the beginning awesome. Overall it was fine; fresh fruit always available and absolutely wonderful. We don't go on vacation to eat so we really didn't care. Staff and other guests- staff very helpful and friendly. Guests from all over the world, we met so many nice people that we partied with all week and will keep in contact with in the future. I would not recommend this resort for singles; it is a great place to meet people and relax.Check-out- well this was the only bad part of the whole trip; but hurricane dean delayed our flight and there was some miscommunication with our apple rep but we got out just in time! The direct flight on USA3000 was awesome. Would definately go back to DR- although I would try a different resort just because I like change.

<Content>Had a great time We visited this resort Aug 11-18. This was our 4th trip to DR, but our first stay at this resort. We were very happy with everything. We did keep in mind that we got a great deal and weren't staying at a 5 star hotel. Our check in procedure went smoothly. We had a room facing the pool and with an ocenview. The room was very well airconditioned and very clean. We had no problems all week with anything related to our room. The door to the balcony did not lock, but there was no handle on the outside door, so we didn't have any concerns about anyone getting in. We also did not use the safety box and had no problem with anyone bothering our stuff.The beach was beautiful and the pools were great. The beach actually reminded us of Myrtle Beach or Daytone Beach with the waves. It's was lots of fun to play in. Unfortunately it was a little too rough to snorkel in which is one of our favorite things to do. We could have taken an excursion, but we had so much fun on the beach we didn't miss the snorkeling. We had no trouble getting beach chairs either. We usually got lounge chairs down close to the water on the beach in the morning and then moved around later in the day. It wasn't a problem to get a covered area later in the day. We found the wait staff to be very friendly and helpful and even playful at times. We enjoyed the buffet for breakfast every morning and then ate at one of the beachfront grills for lunch. We maybe had to wait a little bit for drinks, but you could see the staff was busy so we didn't mind the wait. It is also obvious that they do work long, hard days and most of the time don't receive a whole lot of thanks for what they do. We always tried to leave a dollar or two for our wait staff and they were always very pleasant and did everything they could do to make us happy. We also tried to learn a little Spanish so we could talk a little with them. From other reviews we thought most of the staff did not know English, but most everyone we ran into knew enough to understand what we wanted.We ate at the Dominican, Italian, Brazilian, and Mexican specialty restaurants. We enjoyed all of them especially the Brazilian. The wait staff at each of these restaurants were also very good.The resort itself is beautiful. The walk through the mangroves is very pretty, lots of lush palms and trees and water areas. They also had music piped in which was very pleasant. The buildings were very pretty and there was a little water garden area out in front of the specialty restaurants that was very nice. The staff tried hard to keep the resort looking good. The thing that we noticed was there were lots of cigarette butts on the beach and lots of trash, but that was because people don't know how to clean up after themselves and can't use the ashtrays that are very readily available as are the trash cans.It didn't seem that the hotel kept you very informed of activities going on in the evening. One night there was a beach party that we stumbled upon, then one night there was fire works at midnight. It was very pleasant thing, but a little shocking to be awaken out of a dead sleep with exploding fireworks. We enjoyed this resort a lot and would be happy to come back to this resort anytime!

<Content>Sorry, I dont speak Italian. We spent in this hotel barely 2 days of weekend, taking voluntarily temporary assingement form our Occidental Flamenco Hotel due to overbooking. And theses 2 days reassured us how lucky we were choosing Occidental originally.The only good thing was a room. Clean spacious and bright, we ended up in Junior suite what was very comfortable having 2 children with us. No problems with any bugs/mosquitoes reported here by others. AC working great, 2 decent bathrooms etc.Main problem was food. Can only say about main buffet and beach restaurant. After spending prior several days in Occidental Flamenco, we found food in Caribe Princess mediocre. To make it worse, they have serious problem with bugs and flies in buffet area. Literally dozens of flies walking over tables, sometimes we felt like eating @ barn.On top of it, the waiters there are... well, problematic.. Dont count on any decent service in buffet, be prepared to serve yourselves with drinks, otherwise you could end up dehydrated. Waiting half an hour for drinks , coffee or anything is a norm, not an exception.The beach area was OK. Had to reserve the palatas very early in the morning. Its also very crampy, the lounges are so close each other its sometimes hard to find a way between them.And, till we came in, had no idea it is so heavily italian oriented hotel. Kinda funny being greeted Ciao, not Ola by most. Did not bothered us at all.After spending 2 days in Caribe Princess, we could only truly appreciate the service we received in Occidental Flamenco, where we enjoyed far superior quality and overall satisfaction.

<Content>have a great vacation and relax!!!!! I was extremely skeptical regarding this hotel especially after seeing the mixed reviews. I tried to cancel through US 3000 and Apple vacations and was unable to get a response from either group. Thank goodness that I didn't my family and I had a wonderful and relaxing time. The weather was beautiful. The hotel room was clean, comfortable, large and overlooked a clean pool with a ocean view to the left side of balcony. The resturant staff was courteous and pleasant. It does help if you know some basic Spanish words however. I highly recommend the Japanese, Brazialian, and Mexican resturants on the resort. The Domincan, Italian and Buffet were nice and the food was edible but not anything different then home. There is something for everyone to eat and enjoy however. The staff appreciates tips but they do not expect to be tipped. I took 50 one dollars bills and left the maid $2.00 a day we had a clean room, towels and a refrig stocked with beverages everyday. You do need to be up early to get a sheltered beach chair or to get a seat around the pool but by early my husband went down at 8am or so and we never had a problem getting a chair or we went later in the afternoon and found seats on the beach they just may not have been under shelter. We did not buy any gifts at the hotel we bought everything from the beach venders which were located to left when you went onto the beach. REMEMBER barter and bargain to get the best deals if you can't agree on a price don't budge on YOUR price because 9 times out of 10 they will look for you as you walk to another shop and you will get YOUR price. We left the resort for a shopping tour which included lunch for 25.00 pp and it was nice and worth the money. We went to San Domingo on another tour for 48.00 pp and it was a nightmare. The people are very poor and you are constantly being tugged on, followed, or asked for money. My adult son had suede shoes on and a small child (approx 10 or so) started cleaning his shoes with a brush while he was walking after repeating No several times and trying to walk it was easier to give him a couple of dollars at which time a large amount of other street children and young adults appeared for money. Be prepared for this. The tour features alot of culture, churches and sights but also the poorness of its citizens is appreciated on this city tour. The shopping here can also be bargained but not worth the aggravation of fighting through multiple shop attendants who are trying to get your money. So in closing go to this resort, have ones, enjoy the grounds, gardens and the beach, eat, take your mosquito repellent, and enjoy your vacation because customer service is their goal and we received it with flying colors. We'll be back next year!!!!!

<Content>Not bad for a first time Our first trip to DR and to an all-inclusive resort. It wasnt bad at all. The food staff was very attentive. The tram was not bad of a wait. Food was good especially when we got lucky in the buffet with tiger prawns. The beach needs cleaning though. A lot of cigarette butts. We visited another resort on north of the island and it was cleaner and less seaweeds. However, you would really see that the staff are really taking care of the facilities.

<Content>i'll let you decide for yourself if you want to stay here or not. Ok so instead of telling you don't stay here or stay at this hotel i will let you be the judge after reading what happened to my fiance and i during our stay here. We stayed in the hotel from august 6th to the 10th, 2007. the first day we arrived early and was told that check in was at 3pm but we would still have full access to the resort. so we went to eat and i was going to go to the beach but realized my swimsuit was in my big suitcase (don't know how i forgot to put it in my carry on but whatever). so we wondered around the grounds for an hour until i could not take the heat. we went back to the lobby and the front desk man saw us and said we could check into our lobby. this was 2pm so we were very greatful because we so wanted to take a shower and change. well everything was fine until i realized that the sheets were dirty. unfortunately this was not until the evening when i realized this. so we had to sleep on top of the sheets instead. there were old blood stains on the sheet and in various locations of the sheets. i called houskeeping around 9am on tuesday morning and reported this. i specified that the sheets were dirty when we checked in and was assured it would be fixed soon. i left the room to eat and then go to the beach. we returned at 3pm and our sheets still had not been changed. i called housekeeping again and the guy told me he had sent someone. i said no the sheets are still dirty. he said he would look into it. so i waited until 3:30pm no one came. we decided to leave again to keep from getting too upset. i walked out and saw the maid. i tried to tell her to change the sheets but her english was bare. fortunately i had looked up some common phrases to say in spanish in case i needed the maid to change something. so i left her a note by the bed as well asking to change the sheets with a tip. when we returned to the room at 5pm the sheets were changed but one pillow case was dirty with a blood stain on it. the maid changed the sheets everyday though without us asking after the first day. so that was good. we tipped her $3 a day although she did not replenish the toiletries that the hotel leave. in fact one of the items was empty. i was shocked. i thought she would replace it but never did. oh and it is true the pillows are lumpy. at least one pillow was lumpy for us. as if having dirty sheets when we arrived was not enough we had a mosquito problem our hole time there. we stayed in room 2140. this is on the first floor in caribillo (right in front of the pool with the bar). it took us two days to realize the mosquitos were coming from under the door. so we slide a towel under the door to stop them from coming in but when the maid came the mosquitos got back in. my fiance and i actually made a game out of killing the mosquito's. we played to see who could kill the most mosquito's. the last night was the worst. the mosquito's did not care that we had OFF on. They ate us alive. i woke up with mosquito bites all over my eyebrow, face and ear. my fiance got bit twice on his lip.he barely slept on thursday night because of the mosqito's. he also thinks there were bed bugs because he kept itching the whole time we were on vacation (i wouldn't be surprised). then to top it all off when we were leaving friday morning i went to remove the towel from under the door and i saw something move away when i did this. so i opened the door to see what it was and saw a lizard. i was like i cannot believe this if the towel had not been there a lizard would have gotten into our room as well. ok enough is enough time to go. my recommendation never stay on the first floor of a hotel and especially not this hotel. avoid this room. the room was big and nice but the mosquito problem made the trip bad. i know it is a tropical island but you shouldn't have to fight off mosquitos inside your room. i expect that when i go out to the events at night. but on a bettter note the beach is beautiful. we had a blast playing in the water for hours on end. it's true the huts fill up fast but i didn't care. i like being in the water and not sitting on the beach. my fiance and i always found chairs and we pulled it close to the water to watch our stuff. no one ever touched our stuff. we did one excursion outback safari. it was great. i would definitely recommend all to experience this. you meet families from the dominican republic and see how they live. they provide you lunch and at the end you go to another great beach. i personally thought the beach they brought us to was much prettier than the beach we resided on but my fiance disagreed with me. i think something about this beach being less polished for tourists made it more appealing and the view was exceptional. the food is alright. i would suggest signing up for the various restaurants because buffet gets repetitive. to me breakfast was the worst. it was always the same. i ate omlets everyday. i would suggest they have more meat selections for the omlets as well. not everyone wants ham. buffet at dinner is good because they have different themes everynight. we ate at the mexican, italian, and chinese restaurants. i wanted to eat at the brazillian restaurant. i even got to the station at 9am on the dot to be the first person to sign up for brazillian and i thought i did until i check my slip the next day and realized the man signed me up for chinese. how he got chinese from brazilian is beyond me. so i went to try to correct this the next day when i saw it but the person just called the man who scheduled our dinner to see if we were telling the truth or not. the guy that made the reservations said we were confused we said chinese. i said no we don't i hate chinese i know i didn't say that. needless to say i wasted my breath because they refused to squeeze us in. i was so upset. my fiance convienced me to give the chinese restaurant a shot. so we did. it was the worst restaurant i thought. they make everything with soy sauce and call it soup or sauce. i had chicken and brocolli with curry sauce. the curry was soy sauce with some spices. this made it gross. my fiance had lobster in oyster sauce. the sauce again was soy sauce with some flavoring but the lobster itself was good. i also had a chicken and egg soup that was basically soy sauce with chicken.mexican was good. i liked what i ate but my fiance did not like what he had. i had chicken fajita's. he had shrimp quesadiah's (sp?). we both loved our soups. he had the spicy one and i had the non spicy one (there are only two types of soup). italian was by far the best restaurant. i loved everything i had. i had the fish and my fiance had pasta. his appetizer was great the fried seafood platter. so must go to the italian restaurant. oh warning do not go to the resort store for anything. they over price so bad in there. i forgot my off and had to buy some for there. it cost $16 for a $5 bottle in the u.s. then my fiance got sun bburn so i needed to buy cream for him. the cheapest one was $14. do buy your liquor before you get to the airport. they overprice the liquor there too. i wanted to get my mom a bottle of anejo liquor her favoite but it was priced up by $15. i asked Kelvin, the bartender at the resort the cost and he told me. that is how i know the airport marked up the price by $15. oh you must visit Kelvin, the bartender, if you do go to the resort. he is great. he always went out of his way to assist us in anyway possible. he works hard and long shifts as do other workers. we saw people that were there from morning to morning sometimes. the woman that greeted us at breakfast greeted us at dinner in the late evening. so tip. the staff really worked to make our stay nice. they were always so friendly and nice. my boy jose was great. he gave us drinks we didnt ask for but they were always great. his speciality drinks. oh try kelvin's specialty drink as well. it is excellent. oh we did not do the safety box thing. we kept our stuff in the bag and we were fine. our maid nor anyone else ever touched our stuff. oh one last comment. we saw one activity the Lion King play. it was cute. it is not broadway but the staff worked really hard to put on a good show. i thought it was so cute. i liked it. that was the only one i actually stayed up to watch. so after reading this you can decide to make an informed decision about whether you would like to stay or not.

<Content>stole my digital camera and cell phone!! I stayed in caribe club princess resort and spa 07-09-07 to 07-16-07. I got all inclusive with apple vacation (the resort want it to charge me for room service, it was with the package)Room # 2334. Everything was good until 07-15-07 we went ( the family) to a beach party 9pm left my sony digital camera on the dresser $600.00, my husband cell phone charging next to the coffee pot $150.00. We got back aroung 11pm the cell phone was gone, then I realized the camera was gone too. call management and the tourism police, of course I couldn't make a police report because the police station was closed. They open the next day at 9am. I was leaving on the 07-16 had to be at the lobby at 8am. so now my family does not have any pictures of this vacation that's what hurts me. the memories does not have a price. somebody that works in the resort went to my room and took my stuff. they knew what they were doing, they are the ones that knows when you are leaving. and nobody did anything about it!!!

<Content>The worst Nightmare of my Life!! Well, first of all we got there from the airport and we had to wait several hours for our room. It did not seem like the hotel was well organized, and no one really knew English well! We thought we would be treated better since we were VIP members, and paid more for it which was NO WAY worth it! The hotel room seem outdated, the shower had terrible water pressure, the TV did not work, and it was not very impressive . The beach was delightful, however it was impossible to find a lounge chair at the beach and at the pool, people would wake up at 6 am to save a chair, is that what vacation is about?????? The pool was very dirty paper floating in it, stuff on the bottom of it, and it was not well mantained. The pool area was so loud, it was impossible to relax. I also found the grounds to be pretty however you can wait for a tram car for almost 45 minutes, and when you walk to the lobby its so far you sweat to death. The ground were very pretty like everywhere else.The service was poor, it seems like the workers were annoyed they had to wait on you, and did not go out of their way to make you feel confortable. You had to wait forever to get a drink, water, whatever! Hardly any of the workers understood English, it was very difficult to communicate what you needed.The worst part of this so-called vacation was the food. So many people that week got ill, 3 of our family memebers were deathy ill. So ill they wanted to put or 2 children into the hospital. They ate bad food by thepool cause the food is out all day, and in that heat of course its not healthy. We spent almost 600,00 visitng the resort doctor, and she confirmed that the food caused their illness. It was either a parsitie or bacteria in the food, that made them so ill for the entire week and even when we came home they were still sick for another week. They were thrwoing up/diharra/high fever/ so weak that they could barely walk . This was our worst nightmare of our lives. We saved for 1 year to go, and I felt it was not worth it even if we were not sick. The hotel management did NOTHING, about our family getting deathy ill due to their food. What a disapointment and nightmare. I felt it to be annoying before my family got so ill to try and make reservations for certain resturants at the resort, they were always filled! WHAT IS THAT ALL ABOUT?? The water sports were very expensive, and I found anything extra you wished to do was extremely expensive. It was cheaper to get a massage in the USA/nails done/and you hair done. It was out of control the price for these thing at the resort. It was a huge disapointment and so were any excuriions were very expensive.Don't go there and risk your families well-being!!!! We travel yearly to different islands and have never experienced such a horrible place/week! Save your money and look elsewhere!

<Content>Great Time For a Small Price! Okay...So I was one of the people who read these reviews months ahead of time to see what I was in for! Me and my boyfriend went and had a blast. Anyone who had negative things to say should have realistically spent the few extra dollars to get the luxury they were looking for. We paid a fairly cheap price for our stay and received more than our moneys worth. The service was excellent, the people were great. This is an all inclusive resort, so the food was not the best, very repetitive, but like I said for the price we paid we were grateful. There are several restaurants to choose from, and we went to them all. The beach is beautiful, and the pool areas are alos great. I would recommend this resort for simple people looking to enjoy a relaxing week. If you atre looking for 5 or 6 star, then find a 5 or 6 star to stay. Get it???

<Content>very pleasant After reading many of the reviews here, I was very nervous about going, but shouldn't have been. First, I should say, that we've only been to one other resort, and don't usually go on the type of vacation, where you just stay around the hotel. Nevertheless, our goal was to just have a few relaxing days with our 4 year old at the pool and beach, and we had just that! I guess going in with low expectations helped us. Even though our room wasn't supposed to be ready until 3, it was ready when we arrived at 2, just when our daughter was melting down from fatigue. Our room, (the supersaver standard size) was much bigger than I expected, with a sunken seating area extending past the beds. Everything was clean, but the pillows were quite lumpy, as if stuffed with cotton balls. We had one instance, where the maid forgot to refresh our towels and water, but as soon as we called, it was sent to us. I enjoyed the fact, that it was an international clientele, not just Americans, although some of the Europeans didn't even try to speak Spanish with the staff, which irked me. I speak very limited Spanish, but everyone can say gracias, right? I agree with everyone else, that the pools and beach were lovely, although seeing the pool strewn with used straws and cups, is not a pleasant sight. We found the staff to be always attentive and super friendly. The buffet was always satisfactory and provided something for every taste. We also dined at the Dominican and Brazilian restaurants, which were very pleasant experiences, both due to the service and the food. Another suggestion to the hotel would be to provide drink menus at the bar, so that one could explore something beyond the standard pina colada. In summary, I think because we did not arrive expecting a full luxury perfect resort, we had a great time and would recommend it to another family with the same expectations.

<Content>Not great My daughter and her family went with us to Punta Cana, it was there first time and our seventh. We've stayed at different hotels everytime, this was the worst.We didn't get the rooms that we had requested, but after some time they agreed to switch our rooms on Fri, we had arrived on Wed. The first 2 days we didn't get any towels for the bathroom until 5 PM. On Fri. they moved us to our new rooms on the 3 rd floor instead of the first. We had mini suites, the rooms were nice, but don't try to use the sofabeds, the mattresses are awful.I had to get up at 6 AM everyday to get a palapa and lounge chairs, they were all gone by 7 AM. They cleaned the seaweed everyday, but not the beach. The pool was cleaned everyday, but was still full of trash by afternoon. We ate at the Italian, Asian, and Mexican, they were OK, but nothing to write home about. The day we checked in our room was not ready, they told us to eat lunch and it would be ready when we were done. What we didn't know was how far the buffet was from the lobby, it started to pour, we didn't have umbrella's with us and there were no shuttles. We got soaked to the bone.The beach is very small, not near enough lounges, the grounds were not kept clean, the food was OK. The employees were great.We will not go back. It's just a shame that out of all the times we've been to the Dominican that the first time my daughter and her family went it was the worst of all. My son-in-law got very sick with a parasite, had to go to the Dr. there, she was very nice, but he's still ill and has to go to the Dr. here Again

<Content>Beautiful Resort, Beautiful Gardens, Friendly Staff Nice place, beautiful beach, I don't have a single complaint. Everything ran smooth and as expected. Though I have to agree with some fellows about the chairs by the beach and pool, it would be nice if they were to add more chairs, you just can be chasing for chairs on your vacation. I did not go through that, but I did see what was going on a daily basis.Also those fellows that complained about bugs (ants), I never saw them around food. I think people exaggerate, like they never seem ants. Don't forget you are in the tropics surrounded by trees, plants and flowers, not in a high rise building.I live in the USA and have been in places like South Beach Miami, where you pay more per person per night in an average hotel - not food included - though you get all the mosquitoes and ants you could think of; and that's USA.Go there and have fun!!!

<Content>Don't go here!!! We booked this through Apple Vacations, and they highly recommended this resort. We let them know we were on our honeymoon. We got to the resort on Thursday at 3pm, it took us over an hour to check in. We upgraded to VIP package as per the suggestion of the front desk. VIP doesnt mean anything. We were informed that you had to make reservations for dinner the day before, or else your only choice was to eat the buffet. Noone told us this,and since we arrived at 3pm we had to eat our frist night in the buffet which has no fans and was HOT and disgusting. We were also not informed that there would be a dress code for men in all the restaurants, which we were told was strictly enforced. After making my husband adhere to their rules, there were plenty of people eating in shorts. If you did not wake up at 7 am to put your towel on a chair you didnt get one. One morning I woke up at 7am to put towels and reserve chairs, wehn we got there after eating breakfast someone had moved our stuff and put there stuff down. When we went to the desk abotu it the guy said it happens all the time. Very frustarting when all you want to do is relax. The staff was not helpful to us at all, and we are very generous tippers. We tipped everyone and did not find that we were treated any nicer. Of course we r in a different country and dont expect them to speak our language but some were not helpful at all. We also had ants in our room, which they came and sprayed 4 hours later, with us in the room. We had to call to request all of the things included in the VIP package more then once. The food was terrible. We both got sick, which as I said is expected to a degree, but when you eat in a buffet thats outside, hot with bugs crawling all over the food, obviously your going to get sick. We were told the VIP package include 24 hr room service, when we called at 11pm one night they had only hamburgers.We made reservations at the spa, walked all the way over there to be told they had no record of our reservation and we had to come back 4 hrs later.They gave us two keys that didnt work. After dinner we walked back to our room to find our keys didnt work. We called the front desk, (which is a 10min walk at least) and they took 1 hour to come with a new key. It was 110 degrees, and we had to stand and wait, then they came with the wrong key. After we finally got into our room 1 hour and 15 min later, we called to complain and they told us there was no manager at the time and nothing they could do about it. The pools and beach were beautiful. The brazilian restaurant was the only good dinner we had all vacation, and as stated in previous reviews thank god for breakfast. We travel all the time, and go to many places. We wanted a nice relaxing honeymoon, and instead had a weekend filled with stress. This was one of the worst vacations I have ever had, thank goodness they have nice beaches and nice weather or I would have come home early from my own honeymoon. I would recommend spending a little more money and going elsewhere.

<Content>Average, but Nice This hotel is nice, but average. My husband and I travel a minimum of once a year on a family trip and sometimes 2 and 3 times a year depending on the destination. We visited Punta Cana with our daughter from 6/16-6/23. The best part of this hotel is the beach. The beach is one of the best swimming beaches I have ever been to. Our first day there we saw a sea turtle playing with the ropes in the swimming area (on the beach). The water and sand are perfect. Also, the grounds are well kept and beautiful. The hotel was nice, and our room was always clean. Our maid was Yanelly, she was great! I miss you Yanelly. Make sure you tip your maid, and the wait staff. We tipped our maid $5/day and $10 our last day. She was so appreciative, she gave us a big hug and kiss when we were leaving. They work so hard cleaning those rooms, they deserve a nice tip. Although this is an all-inclusive resort the people that live in the Dominican Republic are very poor. We always had wonderful service when we tipped our maid and wait staff. We upgraded and did the VIP package. We thought it was a good deal since they upgraded our room to an oceanview suite. That alone was worth the extra money. You also get topshelf liquer and rum in your room, turn down service at night, in which they will restock your fridge and make sure you have enough drinks. They also give you a beach towel, that you can exchange for a fresh one at the activity center. We also got a massage on the beach. I would advise that you do it first thing in the morning before the pool activities start (they get loud). We did ours in the morning while it was still quiet outside. You also get 1 hour internet service to use for the week. This is nice if you want to check back with family at home, and don't need to actually make a phone call. The shows were average, some were just really bad, but at least they provide some type of entertainment. They should have more shows that feature latin dancing; especially Bachata and Meringue, since we are in the Dominican Republic. It would have been nice to see some really good dance shows...no lip singing. The beach party was awesome! We went to 2 different beach party's and I wish they would have had one each night. It was so fun to dance on the beach, at night, to latin music. Food is good but average. You have to sign up for the theme restaurants, the food seemed to be a little better at the them restaurants, than the buffet. We ate at the Italian, Seafood, Brazilian, Mexican, and Chinese. They were all good. You have to pay additional for the Seafood restaurant, unless you are VIP. I had the Lobster, and it was delicious. The portions were big, I do not like to waste food. I would rather have smaller portions and order more if I'm hungry. If you are going to eat at a theme restaurant you have to sign up in the morning at the concierge (on the first floor of your hotel room building). They will reserve up to 2 nights in a row. You cannot make reservations for the entire week. Also, try the Craperie for lunch, or a sweet treat. They have ice cream and gelato's...great flavors too!If you want to shop for some gifts, there are vendors located on the left or right of the resort. I thought the shops to the left of the ocean were a little closer (about 20 minute walk). The shops on the right, near the pier, are about a 40 minute walk.You also have access to the bikes (for free), but they are very old and it is a little scary riding off of the resort. Everybody is trying to sell you their stuff and most of the people speak Spanish. It would be nice if they had a guided tour and better bikes. If you want to do something fun, without going to far off the resort, they have a great snorkeling trip for $20. You leave right off the beach and it is only for 1 hour. They took us to an area about 15 minutes away called the Aquarium. We saw a lot of beautiful fish. I would advise if you really are a snorkeling enthusiast, Soana Island would probably be the best, but this is an all day activity. I think you go to 2 snorkeling spots. I will have to arrange a trip to Soana next time I visit. If you are going to do any excursion at all, I would advise that you do the Outback Safari. This is so informative. It gives you a chance to see how the Dominican family lives. You also visit a coffee/cocoa plantation and a rum/cigar factory. A children's school, the local clinic, and meat market, and other fascinating places. You get to see the countryside, it is so beautiful, but very poor. You will appreciate the things you have in life. This is an experience you will never forget. Candido was our driver and Omar was our guide, they were excellent. If I go back, I will do this excursion again. Make sure you bring your camera, you will take amazing pictures. This hotel is a European chain, so beware for all of those that are afraid to see topless women and men/women in thongs and speedos. This does not bother me at all. The hotel was nice except for the over-the-top party goers. I like to drink, but there were some out of control people there that were hanging out at the swim up pool all day, drinking all day, and getting sick in the pool. I quit swimming in the pool for this very reason. Also, the bartenders are not quick enough to serve all of the people who would like to have a drink in the pool. I would not go back for this very reason. The hotel is cheap enough to attract the younger 18-21 people who can afford it. They act like they have never drank before and get out of control, puking drunk. We saw 2 different incidents with young kids getting sick in the pool. Next time, I will pay the extra money to go to an adult only hotel, that does not have such a party atmosphere. I do not want to feel like I am at Spring Break when I am on vacation, I just want to relax and have a few drinks, and not deal with out-of-control annoying drunks.

<Content>Go and enjoy After booking our holiday I read a lot of mixed reviews about this hotel and some of the really bad ones did un-nerve me before we went so I thought I would give you an honest opinion of our trip so you know if this hotel will suit your needs. We had a fantastic holiday at this hotel but I think it helps if you know what to expect!We flew from the UK for a 7 night stay at the Caribe Club Princess in early July. All in all I found the staff and the hotel very pleasant, the main reception is very grand and the gardens are beautiful. It is not one of the most luxurious hotels I have stayed in but it was comfortable and we had a really great time.The food was good, however we specifically booked this hotel for its 7 a la carte restaurants and we thought the main buffet one served much better food than the themed restaurants. Generally the food was luke warm at the a la carte restaurants so after eating in three of them we reverted to the buffet for the rest of our stay, although you may get a little bored with this if you go for two weeks.The pool and beach are absolutely gorgeous, clear water and white sand so you will not be disappointed here. My only warning to people would be that if you want a sunshade, prepare to get up REALLY early. I was forced to get up at 7am some mornings to try and get two beds under a sunshade and even at that time in the morning I struggled to find space on the beach (getting up at that time is not something I would usually even consider on holiday but as the sun is so strong there and I have really fair skin I had no choice). People must have been up before dawn reserving beds with towels!The only other tip I would give people is when it comes to bartering for souvenirs, we stuck by the rule of offering quarter to a third of the price they start at and this seemed to work most times! Personally I believe a holiday is what you make it and about a lot more than the hotel itself. If you want a hotel that is very luxurious with plush decor in the bedrooms then this hotel is not for you, if however you are happy to stay somewhere comfortable with a good atmosphere and beautiful surroundings then this is hotel will suit you fine. Overall I would rate this hotel 7 out of 10.Go and enjoy!

<Content>Wonderful Vacation We just returned Saturday, July 14 after spending 7 nights, 8 days at the Caribe Club Princess. We had a wonderful time and met allot of nice people throughout the week.We had a great room on the second floor facing the ocean, couldn't be more perfect! Housekeeping usually came around the same time every day while we were at the beach except just 1 day it was done later in the day and had to wait till done.We ate at the Chinese, Mexican, Italian, Brazilian and Steak restaurants. I would have to say the favorite was the Italian. Service was very efficient and food was very good, in fact, ate there twice during the week. Our least favorite was the Brazilian. Seemed like it was all the same food that was in the main restaurant only it was served to you.There were 3 pools, our favorite was the main one right outside our building with the swim up bar. We would spend a few hours on the beach and then hang out at the pool till ready to take it easy before dinner.The beach was beautiful with hard to claim lounge chairs. If you didn't get to the beach early, you didn't get a lounge till later in the day. There were beach activities as well as pool activities during the week also. Weather was perfect all week also. Couple days it rained early morning and cleared up the rest of the day.Didn't do any excursions since it was the first time there and had heard earlier about some of them and just decided to pass on those. We had nothing to compare to since it being the first time there so really have no negative feedback.

<Content>Don't do it!!! If you are planning to visit this Resort, DON'T DO IT, GET YOUR MONEY BACK NOW or change resorts.My husband and I are not high maintenance. We arrived this resort, Saturday, 7 July. We paid way too much money for this (all inclusive) trip, at over $1500 each, we expected better service. Upon arrival, we go to our room (VIP suite), the bedpost was broken at the head of the bed. We called 5 times before someone came to see about it, then he began fixing the door to our patio which nothing was wrong with. He didn鈥檛 understand what the front desk told him because they obviously didn鈥檛鈥?understand us, but they said they understood our complaint. We called the front desk again to ask them why the person is fixing the door when we didn鈥檛 call about a door. Eventually, after us doing sign language and showing him the problem, he then turned his attention to the bed. After which he called for help because he could not fix it. Beds were very uncomfortable for your back, like as slab of wood with awful pillows. Bed dressing was awful. The table in the room was full of ants, we asked to exterminate the room, no one did anything about that. The phone didn鈥檛 work in the bedroom, we had to run in the bathroom to answer or make calls, no one responded to this complaint. The towels are dingy and no one should ever use them or put on the dingy bathrobes hanging in the closet, which were suppose to be luxurious . Out of all the people working there, 1 or 2 could understand our needs and we had the hardest time getting the simplest questions answered or problems solved. We continuously called about the TV which had very few channels and it took them until Wednesday to come and load the channels. There was a broken tile in our room, it had been cemented back to the floor but this was just tacky. The maids never really cleaned, they just tidied up. The toilet and tub was not fully cleaned the entire time we were there. We asked for another suite and they refused us that. I wish there was a way to recoup some of our money back. I will not ever refer anyone to that resort. It was nothing we could do about it, so we sucked it up and made the best of it. The food was OK, activities are great and the pools and beaches are fun. We wanted all around service and we did not get it. We understand this is a poor country, but it was very expensive for what we got. Be sure to bring what you need because if you buy anything out of the shops, everything is overpriced. Be careful when you go shopping off the resort because the vendors think all visitors are rich and they remove the prices from the merchandise and then tell you to get everything you want and they will give you a good price. BEWARE, YOU DON'T KNOW THAT YOU ARE GETTING A DEAL, BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PRICE IS.

<Content>Perfect vacation! I just got back about 2 weeks ago and our vacation was absolutely amazing! anything that you might be concerned about doesnt even matter once you arrive and are greeted by the most amazing people you will ever meet and see the gorgeous grounds for the hotel! We took care of the workers and in turn were treated amazing our entire stay. If you want a high class american hotel with american food...then go somewhere else, its as simple as that! if you go to have a good time, to experience a different culture, try new things and meet new people then this place will be perfect! If all you need is reassurance that this hotel is a good choice, then go no further, we, as were most people we met were all completely satisfied and wouldnt change a thing! Best two tips i can give for this place is.... bring ziplock bags to keep your money in so it can stay with you at all times even in the water and not get drenched. We put ours in my boyfriends pocket of his swimming trunks and it worked out great and was easier to tip at the pool bar! Also rooms 2311and 2312 are both 3rd floor complete ocean view rooms and it is well worth it to request them! Any questions feel free to ask!

<Content>Caribe Club Princess - Honest Opinion I usually dont listen to the comments people make about resorts because they are negative but I will give you my honest opinion from my experience at the Caribe Club Princess @ Punta Cana. First I list the positives of the resort....the staff were friendly and very helpful, also the scenery was beautiful...white sandy beaches and clear blue water...a few things that made the trip a bit frustrating was the european people...not to be rude, but the ones i ran into (literally, because they wouldnt move) were rude and not friendly and it was difficult to find english speakers, but I understood that considering I was in another country. The euro tourists language barrier just made it a bit frustrating. Also the food was not the best, and if you are not informed about the way reservations are made or just arrived, you are kind of stuck. Another thing that was negative was the local people trying to sell you things in the middle of the resort. They literally hound you to buy things. Also when we first arrived at the resort (about 11am) we were not allowed to check in until 3pm, so we were kind of left to entertain ourselves. Overall, this resort was not bad, but i think i would look at various resorts and compare before making a decision. I would give 3 out of 5 stars

<Content>it was brilliant!!!!!!! First and foremost let me just say DO NOT LISTEN TO THE BAD REVIEWS THIS PLACE WAS BRILLIANT!the people who wrote those reviews we're obviously stuck up and snotty..... ok!booked with Thompson flight was great, they've upgraded everything on the plane, seats, entertainment food etc.. good startArrived around 3 o'clock and the sun was beaming down, headed straight for the beach, which was pure paradise.The weather was pretty much perfect all 2 weeks around the 35 C mark which is very hot you will agree.The hotel wasn't too busy the 1st week but got busyer the 2nd. All the staff we're amazing, if you go, speak to Johnathon and Edwin both fantastic blokes who made our holiday something else.Food was good, a good selection most nights, tried nearly all the restaurants and both agreed that the Dominican food was the best.spend most of your time in the sea and still go home with an amazing tan.... it's well worth it!won't ramble on just to say GO THERE!!!!Liam  Helen - south London, England

<Content>Caribe Club Princess is great all around! We went through apple vacations for this trip. I'll try to break it up by sections.Hotel Grounds: BEAUTIFUL! The grounds are so expansive and are so beautiful. There are tons of birds to see all throughout the walk from the lobby to the pool/beach area. Also, I noticed a lot of people writing in reviews how it was quite a walk. The walk from the pool to the lobby has to be over just 5 minutes and it really seems like nothing. I actually appreciated the grounds being larger as it is not really a good idea to leave the resort. Rooms: I was surprised how big the room was. We were on the 3rd floor and our room was always clean. A note to many there is a bottle opener on the inside of the dresser door that leads to the fridge. We did not know this until day 4 or 5 so we were sruggling to open bottles as even their pop is in glass bottles. The beds were comfortable, we did have a problem with hot water but they took care of it by end of day 2. The maids do not speak english but I know some Spanish so simply leaving $2 and a note asking for beer and extra towels did the job. We didn't do the VIP route and it was not necessary at all. Food: The food is different, a burger there is not like a burger here but there is something for all. We actually did the buffet to avoid reservations at sit downs and the buffet always had a special theme as well as options for everyone. The pizza in DR happens to be my favorite pizza I've ever had. During the day there is a buffer in the afternoon and on Saturday they had a cookout grill buffet by the poolside that was neat. Activities: The pool was great. We stayed at the main one wtih all the activities going on. Yes the music gets repetitive and after a few days the animation team gets on your nerves asking for activities but they had water aerobics, pool volleyball, beach volleyball, water olympics, beach olympics, and all kinds of other activities going on every day. We found it hard to get a drink at the pool bar but the other bars were less crowded. A lot of middle aged people not wanting to be out in the sun all day would sit at the pool bar in shade all day just dishing out dollars so they not only blocked the bar but the bartenders would pay most attention to them. The beach was so beautiful and the pelicano divers hut is for CCP and you can get snorkel gear, boogie boards, kayaks, etc. Also if you want to snorkel go here! It is only $20 and they take you out to a reef with great tropical fish plus it doesn't take your whole day only 1.5 hours. All the other trips are $65+ and some take up half your day which we didnt want to do. We wanted to do the four wheeling trip but the week went by so fast. Service: The people at CCP really work so hard and long hours. Most work 6am-Midnight. Some workers were even climbing palm trees to get coconuts for people by the pool, they are always trying to take care of you. It did take awhile to get drinks sometimes at dinner but you'll have that. One downside... Apple Vacationers received invitations under the room doors about a beach party that yo had to RSVP for and everything and we were really looking forward to it as it's hard to change up your nightly activities and it just kinda fell apart. We were a little disappointed about that however this resort is great and I'd definitely go back!

<Content>Did not love the Princess Just returned from a week at this resort and we took our 3 year old. First the positives; BeachThe beach was great, lots of chairs and tiki style huts for shade, they need to clean the sand around the tables and chairs as no ash trays are provided and there are a lot of butts around, it was also the only place where you would get a breeze, none of the open air restaurants have fans so it is really hot. PoolThe pool(s) were great, but they too could use a good cleaning it did not seem as the skimmers were on during the day, so a lot of hair and other floating debris. The wading style entry was great for our 3 year old and they brought out animals and other characters every day for pictures, no charge to have the picture taken, but $10 (US) or 10 for $8 (US) and they have them posted in the lobby every evening. Our daughter loved the monkey and the snake.Now for the not so good;Suite/RoomWe upgraded to VIP so we had an extra large room on the top floor (3rd), no elevators, but it had a little sitting area where we could set up our daughters DVD player and toys. The refridgerator was stocked everyday with water, diet coke, and other sodas and beer. The AC barely worked but we had a ceiling fan that made it just tolerable. We only had one day out of 8 where we had both hot water and water pressure, it was like showering under a bathroom faucet the rest of the time with little or no hot water. Bathrooms had plenty of towels and hair dryer and other amenities even though the shower/tub control was broken so the shower worked sporadically (when there was enough pressure to keep it on).Resort LayoutThe main lobby area, as well as the disco and stores are a fair walk from the room, pool and beach areas and there is no scheduled tram service so you have to try and stop one when you see it, not an easy process.Meal ReservationsTo get into the non-cafeteria style restaurants one has to make a reservation and if you are non-VIP you pay extra to go to the (La cava or la pescador) but even then you can only go once per week to these two or you pay $25 (US) per person at the La pescadore. You need to make reservations 2 days in advance at least and you will not be able to ask other people you meet to join you as they have a strict seating policy. Each building had a rep during the day to assist in the process, but you need to read the reviews or better talk to people who have eaten at the restaurant's to decide on your first day where you want to try and eat the rest of the week.The bad;The day we arrived we asked a couple who just stayed a week how the food was, the only positive things they had to say was they looked forward to breakfast everyday (cafeteria style) and the seafood restaurant (la pescador) was not that bad, but by all means avoid the chinese restaurant, which was closed at least 2 or 3 nights that we were on site.We had a large group and at least 25% of the people got some type of food reaction or poisoning resulting in days inside or a visit to the medical clinic (which is very good but expensive). Overall I would rate the food as poor to terrible, with the exception being the Mexican restuarant (OK) and the Pescador (OK), the lunches, dinners in the main cafeteria style building were terrrible. The wait staff were good and very accomodating but could not make up for the just warm and questionable food. Room service which is included in the VIP package had limited choices and we could find nothing that any of us including our 3 year old liked, she would eat the french fries, but not touch the hamburgers or chicken(?) nuggets.The other problem with the open air restaurant was the lack of any fans, so they were hot. Also there was no place where you could get something cooked to order so at least it was hot.BarsWith the VIP package you get premium bottled beer vs draft and higher end wines and liquors, not a bad deal. However, none of the bars have any type of music so there is not much night life with the exception of the disco, which opens at 11. The disco however only allows or participates in the all inclusive package for one hour to 12, after that you pay, so much for all inclusive and one reason why they may not have music in the other venues.There really is no place to escape to that we could find outside the resort, there is a small shopping area 5 minute (cab ride - $6 [US] total) with restaurants where we had the best meal of the trip, this is also the area to buy anything you need or forgot back home as a litre of milk in the resort store is $6 (US) and 3 large bags of Doritos and Cheese pufs were $15 (US), aspirin, advil or anything else other than t-shirts were over priced by 3 times the amount one would pay at home.WeatherThe weather was great but it would have been better if the rooms had AC that worked properly and the restaurants had fans.I have not seen any place in the DR where food is not a problem, it may take a few more years for food to catch up to Mexico or Jamaica or other previously cautious food locals.

<Content>Very poorly managed We just returned on 6/9/07 from a one week stay, 5 nights of which we were barely able to get 3-4 hours sleep. Our first day was absolutely lovely, great staff, ala carte restaurants, sandy beach, nice pools. The second day the nicety ended and the ugliness began when a huge group of high school seniors from Puerto Rico arrived. They were promised a party week which they got and we lost all possibility of a resonable night's sleep. The property has a disco and when the kids left the disco between 3-4am, it was rampage of the spring break Cancun variety. The kids were yelling and whistling in the halls, banging on doors, misdialing phones (we got 2 phone calls at around 4am). If it were not for the loud laughing I would have been fearful that we were in a riot situation. The total lack of management was apparent when there were at least 75 kids in and around the pool at 4am, of course yelling and splashing in a pool that is closed after 7pm. I assume 4am use of the pool is OK if you are promised a party week. Then the situation got worse. I got a room change only to find out that night I was now surrounded by the party week kids. A Polite request to the kids across the room from us to close their door while 8 of them were partying was replied to by that's your problem, not mine, at that point we felt threatened and backed away. After numerous complaints the Apple rep. said the Guest Services Manager would be in touch with me. Not only did she not contact me, I could not track her down. The long  the short of the whole situation was that mangement chose to suspend and not enforce basic hotel rules. The rank  file staff were at the top of their game. We witnessed waiters escorting kids out of the buffet restaurant who felt sandy wet bathing suits  bare feet were acceptable dress at the dinner hour. We travel often and this is was our 3rd trip to the DR. We have never written a negative review or traveler warning, but this needs to be said. Oh, witnessing Pam  Joe's renewal of their wedding vows was a positive highlight of the week.

<Content>A Relaxing Holiday When we finally arrived at the hotel the reception staff dealt with us quickly in a very friendly manner. We had requested a room on an upper floor but got one on the ground floor, immediately we rang reception and they changed the room straight away. So if you are not happy say something, they are only too pleased to help. The room was very comfortable and air conditioned, a god send in the hot weather. The grounds were very clean around all pools and other area's. The beach and the sea were exceptional, nice to cool down in. Plenty of loungers, only complaint most loungers around the smaller pool were broken. The main restaurant was buffet style with plenty of choices, and there are also other themed restaurants. We tried the Chinese and LaCava. Chinese so so, but the meal in La Cava was awful. We waited nearly 3/4 hour for the first course and again before the second. Finally leaving without the sweet course.We had to pay a $25 supplement to eat at La Cava and then found out we also had to pay tax on this when departing. We suggest eating at the main buffet restaurant (more choice and if you don't like it, get something else)Except for the bad experience in one restaurant we had a brilliant holiday and would recommend this hotel to other's.Also if you get chance go on the Monster Truck Safari, long day but well worth it. Weather was good all the holiday, unfortunately no air conditioned area's to sit and have a relaxing drink.

<Content>Loved the island and the resort!! We just returned from Punta Cana and stayed for a week at Caribe Club Princess. This resort is absolutely beautiful with its bright colors and exotic landscaping. Our room was nice and had a view of the ocean. Maids do not speak english so communicating was a challenge but seemed to work out fine. They are very eager to make you happy. The beach was the best I had ever seen, even better than the Mayan Riviera, which is hard to beat! Powdery white sand and a large beach that you can walk barefoot on because the sand is cool to the touch and there aren't any shells on it. There is alot of topless women and old men in speedos but if you don't shock easily you will be fine :o). The food was good but it was alot different than you get here. I recommend getting reservations and eating at those restaurants at night so you can be in the air conditioning and the bugs don't chew on you............I did use Off but it didn't work, I have several bites on my arms and legs. The pools were nice but sometimes the main pool got crowded. They could have skimmed it more but other than that it was nice. If the naked people on the beach bother you the pool is the place to be. We purchased the VIP package. To us it was worth the additional money. We received a bottle of rum and 3 cigars in our room, dinner for 2 at one of the pay restaurants (the best and biggest lobster I ever had!), a private beach party and a private cocktail party, free motorized watersports and a massage for each of us(loved the massage!). If these are things you think you would like to have it is worth the money. Also free room service whenever you want it. Our Apple Rep was Tony. He was great and very helpful. We went on two tours......the Marinaquarim and the Outback Safari. The Marinaquarim was okay but not really worth the money. The Outback Safari was fantastic!! It was worth every penny and probably more. It was a long day 845am thru 445pm but it was so much fun and our guide was great. We learned alot about the DR in this tour and would highly recommend it to anyone going there. The one thing that we didn't like there was the aggressive salepeople. They are grabby and I don't like that. If you are firm with your no they will leave you alone usually! All in all I would return here (and will return). The price was great, it is so pretty and the people are happy to have you. There are some language barriers but that is part of the charm!! I hope they do not Americanize it too much because that would take away so much from the island.

<Content>If only they had better food! I will try to make this short and simple. This resort could be good at best. We stayed in the Royal suite at CCP it was a nice 2 story accomidation, the grounds were nice and the pool and beaches were great! The majority of this resorts problem is with its food.The WORST food ever. I mean from the buffet to the sit down restuarant, it was tough to find something to fill up on, the drinks were good and Kelvin was the best. This resort also needs an air conditioned spot to sit down and have drinks. But i can say the waters helped ease my hunger pains:)

<Content>Great Resort.....just some minor changes needed. We recently returned from our trip to D.R. It was my first trip to a Non-english speaking country so I had prepared myself for an adventure. Overall my fiancee and I had an absolutely wonderful time. The service was great, the drinks were good (Im not much of a drinker so it was mostly wine and a rum tonic or as they say ron tonic for me) and the disco was really fun as well. The property in my opinion is bigger than most. I think they were going for a more tropical feel and I think they did a good job. They had many different animals around the property like peacocks, ducks, woodpeckers, swallows and many different types of fish. It is a huge property but they do provide a little shuttle service that runs a route on the resort that will take you to the reception area from your room or you could choose to walk through the mangroves for a scenic route that took us about 5-10 mins. because my fiancee kept stopping.To maximize your stay I would suggest a couple of things,1) Get the V.I.P package. We felt as if we got a little extra from our trip than what most people were telling us who didnt get the package. Plus if you're not used to their drinks having a cold heneiken or a glass of bailey's as my fiancee did really makes a difference. And you would have to pay extra without the V.I.P package.2) If you dont do this already, prebook your seats. Its ok going down but coming back it gets tricky. I had one couple who acually ended up with one sitting in the fron of the plane and the other way at the back. Trust me its one less thing to worry about.3) Tip the staff. I know a lot of people have a problem tipping especially when we already paid what we paid for the trip. But common sense will tell you that with the many workers that they have its hard to monitor good customer service. And dont panic, it does not have to be much. I took about $50 US in singles and the most I tipped one person was $3 and we felt like royalty. Was that fair? Maybe not, but we just added that to the cost of our vacation and everyone was happy plus remember too that this is a poor country and the money you spent on the trip doesnt go to them directly so a litle bit to us, goes a long way to them.4) You dont have to get a safe. They charge $4US a day or $25 flat for the week. We didnt do that. We just locked everything up in our suitcase when we left the room and everything was fine and plus we left a $1tip for the same housekeeper everyday and she was really nice to us.5) Bring small bills. The biggest bill we brought were $20's. You will have a very difficult time getting anything larger changed.6) Be prepared for very little English. Im surprised that some people get upset at this. You're going to a non-english speaking country, just try to sit back and enjoy yourself. Also there are a lot of Europeans, especially French. So you're surrounded by Spanish and French all the time but the French isn't so bad, its kinda like being back home in Toronto.Those are the major things. If you can do them I pretty much guarantee that you will have a great time as we did.

<Content>Don't Do It! A friend of mine and I decided to take a getaway to the carribean. After hearing that Punta Cana was nice and finding a good deal at the Caribe Club Princess, we decided to check it out. We booked through the USA3000 website which turned out to be through Apple tours. Our flights were nice and we actually arrived ahead of schedule. We then were directed to the tourbus which took us to the Resort. This was our first taste of dominican time with many to follow. The ride was supposed to be 10minutes but turned out to be over 1hour. When we arrived at the resort, it seemed like a nice place. The lobby was open air and very pretty. We were told that our room wouldn't be ready until 3pm so we grabbed a drink and sat on a couch. The clerk found us within 30 minutes and told us that the room was ready. We took the tram over to the room and when we entered the room we noticed that the sliding door to the balcony wouldn't open or shut. The room was also old and run down. I wondered how the maid didn't notice this or why she didn't notify somebody to fix it prior to our arrival. We called the front desk and told them of our situation. They said that they would send somebody to fix it. We tried to wait but got bored. Thank god we left because we would have been sitting there for 6hours. I had to make another call to get somebody there. This was only the begining. We attempted to eat at the buffet and it was nasty. We found the pizza, rolls and fruit to be good so pretty much lived on that all week.  We chalked the door incident up as being a one time problem but boy did we learn. This place is not service friendly for the most part. The maids would clean our room daily (if that's what you want to call it) and take our dirty towels as they usually do-the only thing is that they forgot to replace them. They also didn't replace anything in the fridge including drinking water. So, I would make daily phone calls to get these items. I had to start calling early because they usually said they were on the way but didn't appear for hours if at all. That was only after 2 or 3 more phone calls for these items. We even tried to tip well the first day and they still didn't provide these necessary items. So save your money. At times I would go find a maid in the hall and ask for these items and they didn't understand what you were asking for. The communication barrier was difficult in many ways.  The food at the restaurants wasn't much better than the stuff on the buffet. You had to make reservations with the concierge before 12pm and could only make them for 3 days at a time. We didn't have the VIP package (I think that means you get towels in your room) so we had to pay $25 pp to eat in one of the so called better restaurants. We chose to eat in the seafood place. I had langastinos (small lobsters) and my friend had a shrimp meal. Wow were we disappointed. They use margarine rather than butter-nasty. My friends shrimp plate was something that should have been served with peeled and deveined shrimp. They came in a sauce unpeeled. How are you supposed to eat that? So back to the buffet for pizza. We also were told to eat at the crepe place so we tried it. The food wasn't bad but the service was terrible. The one woman approached our table and appeared to take our order. She didn't speak english but we pointed, she nodded yes and took our menus. I ended up fighting with the waiter after he yelled at us. He told us he took the orders and not her. How am I supposed to know that? I could go on about the quality of food but I think you get my point. we did meet a good bartender. Calvin at the lobby bar. He took care of everybody including us and was very service oriented-one of the few in this resort. The apple tour rep at the resort was pityful. She gave us a lot of wrong info about shopping and shuttle schedule and phone cards so we were pretty much on our own. When we checked out our bill ended up being far more than we expected, when we asked for an itemized bill, I got a fight from the clerk. She was actually throwing things behind the counter. I was never so happy to leave a carribean island in my life and vow I will never go back. Especially to this resort. If you are the type that likes to stay on a resort for your whole vacation find a good one and stay there. There is nothing outside of that compound. The shopping is terrible. The people are trying to get you into their shop and will actually touch you. This completely turned me off. The island has many less than safe areas so stay within those walls! And pick another resort because the Caribe club princess was awful.

<Content>Had a FEW drawbacks, but overall, this place is SWEEEEETTT! Like many others on here, I pour through reviews of any destination I book......prior to booking and after...up until the trip. Good reviews, bad reviews.....most of the time, the trip is what you make of it. If you mentally have no idea where/what you are getting into too...you leave yourself WIDE open for disappointment. But, then again, some folks just arent happy unless they are complaining about something, right?That being said........my husband and I just returned from Caribe Club Princess last week. We had a marvelous time! Had a little trouble with flight delays...but that had NOTHING to do with the resort....and that stuff just happens.PUNTA CANA.............When you arrive in Punta Cana....you must expect to pay a $10 tourist fee per person. Your booking agent should have told you this. Dom Rep has had this in place for years. Dont complain, dont get mad, it is not a rip off. Tourism is this country's #1 source of livelyhood....it is only $10 one time....it should not make or break your trip.Also....tipping just a dollar here and there will get you a LONG way. This country survives on tourism......just a dollar or two to you... is MUCH to them. At the airport, there are several fellas waiting around for the very reason of helping you with your bags to your transfer. I would suggest letting the FIRST one carry your bags (and give him a dollar or two for doing it)....saves the hassle of having ALL his friends ask to do the same thing over and over and over.  If you have tranfers arranged....STICK TO THEM! There are several booths at the airport for many of the travel agencies......find yours to meet up with your transfer arrangements if needed. There ARE reps out there offering transfers in exchange for timeshare demos....watch out for them......unless THAT is what you are looking for.Once you have met up with your transfer and you are off to your resort..........please know that you are in a third world country. I saw several reviews complaining of the scenery in route to the resort. Yes, the roads are a bit underdeveloped, the fields...some are baron and there are shacks no bigger than my living room housing entire families....but it is in its own way beautiful. We like to take in the culture of other places......but if nothing else, it should make one feel fortunate to have what they do. If seeing this bothers you, then dont look at it.OH....on the way to the resort, our driver pulled over and let my husband purchase a cold beer. How thoughtful! Also, we had asked him a question....rather then just tell us he didnt speak much English....he got on his phone and found someone who did.....so that we could ask and he could translate. I was impressed that he cared enough about what we were asking to make that much effort.CARIBE CLUB PRINCESS!!!Our check in went well.....only took about 15 minutes. We arrived at 4pm...so not sure if you arrive early (check in time is 3pm) if your room will be ready. If it is NOT ready yet....go check out the bar right in the lobby....and relax! DO DO DO purchase the in room safe....this is NOT included in your stay...but pay the extra for it. It runs $4 a day to have it, but OOOOOHH the headaches it saves. Keep your passports and valuables in it!The resort itself is absolutely gorgeous! This was our second time in Punta Cana....and we liked our first resort...but of course wanted to try something new as well. This place had vibrant colors everywhere...the buildings red and yellow...with some blue. Nice because there was enough blue in the ocean and pools! The pools were always clean, and the beach.....oh my! I have never stepped foot in better sand. Totally like powder! no rocks, broken shells or anything. You MIGHT get tangled in trivial seaweed down by the water, but that is it. Absolutely fabulous! The resort grounds are fabulous lush gardens....with wild peacocks walking around! We even saw a mom and baby! how cute!Oh, it is a small hike from the lobby to the rooms.......but they do have a trolley that goes around constantly 24 hours. I saw the review about carrying your own bags...you dont have too! Just wait for the trolley to come around again! ROOM............. was very nice....nicer than I expected actually. The floors are a marble tile....even out on the balcony. And they looked clean and somewhat new. The room was clean, bed was comfy and we had clean towels.....daily. Even washcloths...two of them.....so yes, the DO have them!Our fridge was stocked daily, and the maid could figure out quickly what we drank and didnt drink....and left a few extra of what we did drink (that make sense?). We left her a dollar or two every day......it goes a long way!Two downfalls to the rooms.....at least potential downfalls. The first....if you plan to shower for dinner......you could be in for an adventure. When showering anytime up till about 4pm...I didnt have a problem. But in the evening during the 5pm and after.....hot water became an issue......or lack there of . The second potential downfall to your room MIGHT be location. My husband and I were on the third floor. If they have elevators, I did not see them....but that worked for us. It did my booty good going up and down those stairs. But third floor also had its advantages......I gathered by the smell.....that the door at the base of each set of stairs might be where the trash accumulates during the day....till it is taken away from the building. In the morning, the smell wasnt that bad, but as the day went on......ugh!! It was bad! I had read a review or two about smell....and if they got one of the rooms around the stairs on the first or even second floor....I totally can see where they were coming from! But the third floor.....you really didnt smell anything up there.FOOD.......once again, keep in mind you are in another country. Burgers are not gonna taste like McDonalds! My husband and I are not picky eaters....and we actually make a point of trying new foods. But if you are picky, you can still find something you like...but might have to look for it....and then wait in line to get it. The omelet bar and pasta bar (in the buffett) were obvious favorites...as there was always a line! But I heard it was worth it....ESPECIALLY the pasta bar!Anyway..the buffet is a nice open air buffet.......and the food was good. But if you sit at one of the outter tables (restaurant is surrounded by gardens)...make sure you have on OFF or something! At night....the 'squitos ate me while I was eating!There are several specialty restaraunts at the resort ....but many you need a reservation to have dinner. This would probably be my BIGGEST negative....the reservation system they have. SUGGESTION!......Once you check into your room...I recommend the first thing you do ...THE FIRST thing you do is go make your reservations. Otherwise, you may not get to eat at a place you want. They book up fast! And I agree with other reviews on this...I dont understand because you can walk by those restaurants that are so called booked....and you will see TONS of open tables!You make your reservations at the conceirge desk ( I believe their hours are 9-5) at the opening to your ROOM building (not the lobby!).......FIND him/her as soon as you get into your room. I think you can book up to two days ahead of time....so book what you can, and go back every day to book another day, etc... Kind of a pain, I agree....but if you want to eat at those places.....We did the Chinese and Mexican. We wanted the Italian but could not get in......bummer. The Mexican was FABULOUS! The Chinese was 'just okay' to me....but if you are a real fan of Chinese, I say try it out! The French is more of just a Crepe place......11am to 11pm. You do not need a reservation here...but you had better want crepes....ha ha SHOPPING.........there are several really cute boutiques just outside the lobby. They have clothing, artwork, cigars, souveniers, etc. They also have stuff like sunblock, shampoo and snacks, etc. They are way more expensive there, but if you need it.......and dont want to leave the resort, there you go.You have other options though.......if you want a stroll on the beach...and shop...there are several market huts up the beach on the left. It is about a mile up the beach.....15-20 minutes. HAGGLE! They expect it and love to do it! Guideline is start your price at about a THIRD of what they quote you first.....and work from there. Most of the time you can meet fairly in the middle....and if you are aggressive enough, you can even get it less than half.If you want to venture out of the resort....there is a decent size shopping plaza very close. You can walk or take a $7 cab ride (recommended) to the plaza only about 5 minutes away. There is a big building that is a flea market ......and across the street has some of the finer shops.Once again...HAGGLE! They expect it and want you to do it!Sometimes the resort hosts a market night...where local merchants set up tables on the sidewalks. These are nice...but many of the items here....you can find at the flea markets starting at a cheaper price. You can haggle here too.DRINKS.........if you are into beverages......what a place to indulge...try something new! Drinks varied in all ways from place to place. Each bartender has his or her own specialty, so if you liked a rum punch from one.........know that it may be different from another. We like to try stuff.....so we usually tried the bartenders specialty....and then went from there. There is a very popular local SHOT.....mamajuana. Worth a try, just to say you did it. It really isnt that bad....it is rum, with a cinnamony taste....not red hot cinnamon...but like danish cinnamon. It has a slight zing going down, but really not bad at all. Overall, be nice to the bartenders....and they will be nice to you. There are many guests that just yell at them....totally uncalled for, these folks work the hardest...and are usually quite friendly.LANGUAGE...........I read a review complaining about the language barrier.....and it was really nasty....condeming the workers for not learning English to cater to their American guest. One must know that the native language is Spanish. For the past 20 years...they have been catering to Europeans.....French, Dutch, Spanish, etc..... The Americans have only just started coming to the area in the last 7 years! If you get an opportunity to talk to one of the staff members that has pretty good English....you might learn that in order for these people to work at these places, they have to take quite a bit of schooling. Many of the workers know not one, or two but THREE AND FOUR languages! English being their newest one.....give them a break!ACTIVITIES......there are a ton of things to do if that is what you are looking for. There are games all day by the main pool (if the noise bothers you, there are quieter pools you can go to).....can be just as much fun to watch as to participate. There are beach games, activites...as well as water activities. The entertainment tries really hard. There are shows each night.....we caught only one...the Magic show. It was pretty amazing actually. Many people just hung out on the beach or at the swim up bar. Oh, and it is true....many people throw their towels over chairs on the beach and at the pool to Reserve them. Many times, my husband and I saw these chairs stay empty all day....but some were occupied all day as well. For what it is worth, there ARE signs posted by the resort stating that you are not allowed to do this. I wouldnt want to just walk up to any chair with a towel and decide it was mine.....but if you watch one for a while and no one shows up...I would say it is fair.All in all, I would absolutely come to this resort again. It had so much to offer for what we paid for it.....and very pretty as well. I know this review was long-winded, but I hope it helped.

<Content>Stay some where else! We stayed @ this resort for our 2006 spring break with our 13 year old son. Upon arrival was told that we were on the the third floor .Problem: My hubby has had numerous knee surgeries  there is no elevator. No other room was supposedly available. Next we had no washcloths for bathing  believe me they don't have any. Room was at least clean  had a softer bed than any I ever had in Mexico. Food was not very good. Lived on beans  rice for the week. Fresh fruit was anemic  bananas overipe by a along shot. Had to make reservations each a.m. to get settings for specialty resturants  many days we were refused . Said they were booked, but looked through the doors on the times /days we had requested  saw numerous sitting available. Next, pool area is supposed to be family-friendly, but son went blind when 70 year old Helga dropped her swimsuit top. Unbelievable. We had expected this on the beach, but not @ the pool. Any complaints went unnoticed. Only thing I can say about this area is that the beaches are to die for. If you want to visit Punta Cana, stay @ Ocean Blue, Iberostars or Bahia Principes, in other words the best you can find.

<Content>Fun - If 25 people all liked it then what more can I say?! Ok, we went with a group of 25 aged 24-34 from april 15-20. I planned the trip back in November and have been reading this site every week since then and stressing myself out that everyone would hate the place and be mad at me. I mean the review about being trapped....I was terrified about what I had gotten everyone into!Well, forget about it! Sure we can all be picky and complian that we had to wait for towels one day at the beach, but the sun is so warm and inviting you can dry off while taking a walk to the flea market or joining in a game of volleyball, or sit at the beach bar and enjoy a Presidente!Bottom line is all that worrying I did for 5 months about if all my friends would have fun was a waste of my time, I should have been thinking about how much fun we would all have instead!I am a very compulsive Type A person so let me try and do what others have done to break down our vacation.Arrival - Checked in at the lobbey, make sure to ask for the safe key so you dont have to make another trip once you get to the room, it was $18. After you get your room info, walk across the lobbey to the bar and order your first official Caribe Club Princess drink....you are now on vacation! They have a shuttle you can take to your room, but the walk is not bad.Room - Our room was fine, I am not going to say it was perfect and beautiful, but it had a bed and a tv, huge bathroom loveseat, mini fridge (mmmm Coke Light) and other than changing or sleeping please tell me how much time you actually spend in a hotel room? All others had fine rooms too, sure some had better views than others, but what do you need a view for when you can walk a few feet and actually be on the beach?Pool - It was nice, never really crowded, pool bartender's nice and they dont seem to mind if a little bit of your drink sloshes into the pool, they close it around 7pm anyway to clean it I think. Bring a beach ball it's fun to toss around with your friends.Beach - well all brought our own towels and just laid them on the beach anyway, usually chairs opened up and as they did we would start to gather them....obviously not gonna get 25 all together but we never seemed to have a problem getting chairs and even 1 or 2 beach huts. The water is awesome, just enough waves to make it fun but not worry about losing your swimsuit. We did the kayaking, also fun. And there is a $20 snorkling trip that leaves right from the beach, its a fun boat ride and then fun snorkling. I will say to make a reservation for the banana boat, the BEST $7 spent on vacation, sit in the front if you want to bounce around a lot! Walking for 15 minutes to the left there is a flea market, nice tourist type stuff to buy, and tons of art. Like everyone said bargain and you will get what you want to pay for it.Food - Ok i am super picky about food already in the US, so i understood what i was getting myself into coming to the DR. Of course things tasted funny or bad, but the best part is you can go get another plate of something else you like and eat that. I never went hungry, but i did eat really fast as soon as i got the Atlanta airport, hahaha. It's not like i am going to live in the DR it was just a week long vacation and for all the fun and everything else, the food was a non-issue. Restuarants were nice cause they were not crowded and didnt feel like cattle in the buffet lines, nice to have people serve you since you did spend a lot of money to go on vacation, and nice to get dressed up.Nightlife - we went to the disco our first night and it was fun, they played fun music and we were there to have a great time. our free drinks stopped at midnight and we left shortly after to head to the beach bar which must be open 24 hours cause i never saw it closed! Nice to hang out with all of us under the huts drinking all night long. we also went to the casino one night, had some winners and some losers but overall it was fun. Lobbey bar is the happening spot until it closes at midnight, then just head to the beach bar.I am sure i am forgeting something.....but i generally just wanted other readers to know that if i could like it so much anyone can!!

<Content>Nothing to worry about Our group always goes on vacation the beginning of June every year. We are lucky as far as the amount of people that go at this time of the year. The resort was pretty much empty and we were all upgraded. We go in a group of 20 or more---mostly family. We were at Caribe Club Princess last June and will say it was Awesome.Our flight was fine--not that has anything to do with the resort. Check in for us was smooth. Room was good, we switched rooms after a few days only to have an ajoining room with another family member. The rooms I considered very clean, maid service every morning with fresh towels and nice animals made out of towels. Stocked refrigerator with h20, coke and sprite. We had a coffee pot and iron/board in our room as well. I am not really very picky about the rooms as we spend very little time in them. The view was ocean for us but really does not matter again as we are not in our rooms much. Food- The restaurants were all good. It was fun to dress nice and go out to eat. Men must wear pants and closed toe shoes to the resturants. We were able to make reservations for 2 days at a time, go to the lobby at the bottem of your hotel building--NOT the main lobby. The buffett was good as well---even if you are picky there is something for everyone there. In the am there are made to order omlets, pancakes, frenchtoast, bacon and on and on.... Lunch was always good with a variety. THe little snack area was just OK for lunch--not that good really and dinner in the buffet was always good with variety. Yes, it is an open air buffett---most places are, this is not out of the ordinary. The nicer reserved restaurants are all air-condiioned. The entertainment staff was good. We enjoyed many activities throughout the week during the day. I have to say they do not cater to children as much as they do in Mexico though. Our kids do like h20 polo and playing together with the adults and staff here did not include them nearly as much. They did however have a nice show after dinner in the eves that the kids always participated in. Adult entertainment was going on every eve but we did not see one show for adults as we were way too tired and just could not stay awake for it. Beach--was the most beautiful I have ever seen!!! Pink/white sand, warm sea h20. It was the best ever!!!Drinks---not the greatest variety menu, but what they had really were always great. The mamajuana was great as well-try it. There are shops by the main lobby as well (expensive). We went down the beach and bought from them---make sure you bargin with them, they may trade you for something and you can get prices down if you work at it.We did not do any off resort excursions so we can not comment.Pools---they were great, always clean. Lots of activities happening all of the time. No snorkling off the resort-the beach is NOT rocky at all--to nice to snorkle at.Hair braiding-offered all over te place.Internet is avalible for a fee however we did not use it.This is a nice clean resort you can go to and really relax at. It really is what you make of it. We usually stay at a 3-5 star and are never disppointed with it. I am amazed when I hear of the bad reviews that are posted!!! Although we never stay at the same place twice(just because we want to experience a different place every year), we would not hesitate to come back to caribe club!!

<Content>Will never return nor recommend to any Couple! My husband and I just returned from our short four days trip to DR. We stayed at Caribe Club Princess for three nights. This trip has been a huge disappointment for both of us. This resort may be ok for people that are traveling in search for a party or ways of getting loaded on drinks from morning till dawn, but for a couple looking for a way to relax and enjoy stress free vacation this is highly NOT recommended place. It is way too overcrowded, and its lack of solid organization causes issues on every step of the way.. like getting a lounger on the beach or by the pool or even getting a dry clean towel. We got a room on the first floor in the second biggest building complex (Catollira smth), cannot vouch for other rooms, but ours was really outdated and not cozy. It was big, but useless. Also, it was unfortunatelly located in close proximity to the kitches, so all the cooking aromas was lingering on our balcony. We tried to spend as little time as possible inside, but that was somewhat difficult due to the afternoon showers. Bottom line: if you are a couple that is looking for a getaway resort to enjoy your time together away from everyday buzz, this resort would not provide you that...

<Content>Extremely Fun The Vacation Was Amazing dont listen to the poor reviews after all this is a 4 star resort so if you want everything perfect then go somewhere else. We Stayed 5 nights, 6 Days. Our Room was 1177 lower level but great location, we were across from the main pool  restaurants! We booked our trip though apple vacations and our flight was real good out of chicago, no problems. the punta cana airport is awesome, it is all outside there are huge fans inside so the airport stays cool. our apple rep was named tony, he was extremely cool and very friendly. he made sure your trip was how you wanted it. there were no bugs, which was a good thing, but we packed off just incase. bring lots of sunscreen because in the gift shop for a 2.5 ounce bottle, it is 19 us dollars. RIP OFF! anyways, there are 7 restaurants, 5 are included in the all inclusive, andthe other 2 your have to pay 25 dolars for. the italian restuarant is realllllly good, the dominican was alright, we are very picky eaters so we skipped the others which were mexian, brazilian, chinese and sea food. the buffet was real good too, they had lots and lots of different foods, we always found something to eat. the earlier you go eat the more there is too choose from, it gets picked over fast but they are always refilling. the beach is the best part of the whole trip. it is huge and very clean there is beach bar and all the stafff are real nice. they speak little english but enough to get by. there are 3 pools and they are very clean and big, the main pool has a swim up bar which is real nice. if you want a hut on the beach, your best bet is to get up by 645am other wise they are all gone. our room was always very clean and we always had fresh towel and water. the resort has a casino near by and there is a little trolly that comes to the resort to take and pick u up. the lobby is a little ways away from the rooms but there is also a shuttle that comes alot. we hurd that the shows were very good but we never got a chance to see one. the drinks are very good, for some of the top shelf drinks you need to pay extra for. but the majority are included. the drinks are on ice, so if you want a more slushy drink you need to ask for it to be in the blender. we were very staisifed with this resort and we would return. we had no problems or complaints at all!! very fun!

<Content>Fantastic vacation Six of us stayed at the Caribe Princess for one week and had a fantastic trip. As you arrive the staff was very friendly, the lobby is incredible and the grounds were beautiful. Our rooms were very clean, large and the fridge stocked with water and coke. We did run out of towels one day but had them about 2 hours later. We ate at the buffet often, there is a lot of selection, plenty of fresh fruits, breads and several main courses to choose from. We ate the Mexican (the best, have the steak), the Italian (a close second), the Chinese (I loved the lobster pieces) and the Brazilian (great if you are a meat eater). The staff is great and we left a dollar or two tip at each restaurant.The evening entertainment was ok, the sound is really loud and there is about a 10 min wait between the intro and the main event.We did some shopping, there is a large selection of goods to be found on the beach. To the left is about a 15 min walk and to the right is a 30 min walk. Both are filled with vendors eager to show you around. Haggle a bit but remember these people have to make a living as well so pay what you feel is fair. We purchased 2 paintings; one for $10.00 and the other for $7, so shop around and don't be shy. Also, I got a great deal on a Lacoste t-shirt, so have fun shopping. Don't forget your $20.00 departure tax and enjoy! I would definately stay there again.

<Content>Practically Perfect Caribe Club Princess, March 17-24th, 2007 I have traveled extensively over the past 25 years with a special emphasis on beaches. Still, I was a bit concerned when booking this trip because of the wide variety of mixed reviews and because it would be just my 19 year old daughter and I.  We had an absolutely wonderful time start to finish. All of the staff was pleasant and friendly and helpful. Both check in and check out were simple and quick. We asked for and received a TV remote control. Our room was spacious and clean and everything in it worked correctly. There are no clocks in the rooms, but the wakeup call service is reliable, with a second call for snoozers. MEALS - The buffet meals offered an amazing variety of meats, vegetables, fruits, breads, beverages, and sweets. Something was always being offered freshly grilled to order, eggs, burger, fish, pasta, lamb chops, etc. Hot foods were hot, cold foods were cold. (However, it is not Cracker Barrel or McDonalds, if you are afraid of new foods or familiar foods cooked new ways, take your vacation in the states). The buffet waiters were always attentive. We never made it to the reservations desk for restaurants before 11:00 am and always had at least 2 to choose from. We also stopped by the buffet each night to see what we were missing and, !surprise!, the buffet offers a different theme each night reflecting the restaurants with the exact same food and a beautiful presentation, in addition to the regular variety. So, while the restaurants offer menus and personal service, the food is the exact same as the corresponding theme night at the fabulous buffet. If you think you are getting a superior meal in the restaurants, that is just an illusion.Based on various reviews we had read, we brought some snack foods from home just in case and never touched them. Between lunch and dinner and late night, beach bar offered nachos and cheese, salad makings, chicken, pasta, etc. BEACH 鈥?The soft white sand beach is deep and wide in front of this resort, spacious even when every chair is filled. Endless walks are available in either direction. We did bring our own beach towels which was nice only because we on the beach well before the beach towel hut opened, and had no trouble finding loungers as we were up for the glorious sunrise each day. I did notice that by 7 AM each day all the shade chairs were taken on the beach. We took our first sailing lesson on the beach from the resort beach/ocean toy guys and then sailed confidently every day on our own. The water was too choppy the day we wanted a windsurfing lesson, but they were great about letting us take one out anyway in the shallows to just get a feel for it. Yes, there is a small bit of seaweed/sea grass, it is an ocean.Volleyball games and soccer were easy to join into, and with the pool right on the beach, we could just lift our heads to see if that was an activity we were interested in as well.EVENING ENTERTAINMENT - The evening shows, well, ... the choreography lip syncing, and dancing were excellent. Unfortunately, the sound system is just awful, sitting in the very last row made it tolerable. The nightly lobby dances were great, lots of energy, enthusiastic, friendly animation staff. They do enjoy pretty girls and flirt extensively, but will concede to the boundaries set by the guest. They are incredible dancers and happy to gently and patiently teach everyone their steps.TOUR - We did the Apple safari tour early in the week. It is an excellent tour for seeing the country side, learning a lot about the dr, and seeing a completely different beach. We also met some great people who were with us on the tour and it was fun to run into them throughout the week and learn what they had been up to. We had pencils, crayons, colored pencils for the school children which they were very happy to receive. We also took several recorders (penny flutes) and these really lit up their little faces, wish I had brought lots more!!SHOPPING 鈥?Bargains are to be had. Haggle, and haggle some more. Try to pay 1/3 or less of the asking price. If you pay too much in one shop, you are bound to make up for it in the next. There are shops both to the right and left of the resort on the beach. The ones to the left are closer and a bit more relaxed with a wider variety of goods. They are all open approx 9 鈥?5.Of course the prices in the resort shops are high for things you could have brought from home; they have to pay shipping and import taxes and make a profit.TIPPING 鈥?We were haphazard about it, didn鈥檛 always have a wallet with us. Of course everyone likes and deserves to be rewarded for jobs well done, but whether we had a dollar ready or not, we always had a ready smile, good humor and a kind word and always got good service.LANGUAGE 鈥?Neither of us knew any Spanish beforehand. We did make an effort to learn a few basic travelers鈥?phrases on the plane ride such as please, thank you, good morning-afternoon-evening, how are you, what is your name, where is, what is, when is, how much is, too expensive, it鈥檚 delicious, etc, and picked up more as the week went on. It was fun to surprise the staff with our Spanish; they almost always answered us with a big smile and in English. It appeared that only the maids and a few of the wait staff knew very little if any English, but it was not a problem at all.MISC - We, nor any of the folks we met were on the VIP plan and did not miss it or feel the least bit slighted. Brought bug spay, didn鈥檛 need it, got 3 bites between us all week.Had drinks at various times in all the bars and always found the drinks delicious and bartenders fun and eager to serve. COMPLAINTS - #3. We were told by Apple that a hospitality room would be available for us to shower and change after check out on our last day since our flight home was not until 8:00 PM. We went to the desk an hour before our bus to the airport and none were unoccupied, so we had to take our hospitality shower in the open air shower by the pool and change in a nearby restroom. Really, no problem!#2. The maid left no clean towels one day. We called housekeeping mid-morning, but still had no towels in the afternoon. After a second call, we received towels within 30 minutes. We had been tipping her, but stopped after that. #1. Trash left all over the beaches by inconsiderate, lazy resort guest. Yes, there are workers who clean it all up, but why not leave it the way you found it for all to enjoy?OVERALL - This resort is large, but has a compact, cozy feel and is it very simple to find one's way around. The nature walk to and fro the lobby, stores, night show stage, is well lit, lots of peaceful wildlife and interesting vegetation and takes about 5-7 minutes. We always saw trams available especially at night, both after the shows and the lobby dancing. None of my pre-trip worries came true. I would definitely recommend this resort and I would definitely stay here again myself. It is safe, fun, clean, has good food, plenty of activities, wonderful staff, and a great location on a perfect beach. Sure there are ritzier, more posh, and more pampering resorts. You do get what you pay for and sometimes a little more. This resort delivers a lot for a little.Do read and learn from others reviews, but don鈥檛 let the whiners discourage you. We will answer any other questions we can, just ask.Go, Experience, Play, Enjoy!!!

<Content>Great Place!!! Ignore the reviews which criticize this resort, the food is great, the service is very good, the beach is awesome, the rooms are excellent and very clean, I could go on and on, I have travelled to nearly every Island in the Carib. and this is one of the better resorts you will go to for the money. I recommend tipping a few bucks here and there, it goes along way in a third/fourth world nation. People are very nice, go enjoy!!

<Content>Okay,probably will not return Punta Cana has an amazing beach! You can walk for miles! The grounds of the Caribe Princess are well maintained and beautiful as well. Peacocks, white swans, ponds, very nice.The hotel, well, it looks nice, clean spacious lobby. Our room was acceptable, important note: there is NO clock! Granted we were on vacation, but you do need to know the time occassionally. There are no books or even brochures listing hotel ammenities, activitites, restaurant hours, etc, absolutely nothing. Hotels we've stayed at in Mexico, Jamaicia and the Bahamas have asked for a deposit and provided a lock for your room safe, not so at the Caribe Princess! It cost $24.00. We had visited Puerto Plata in the past, however, this was our first visit to Punta Cana, so for the first time, we opted to do an apple vacation square deal. We found out where we were staying at the airport just prior to departure. Of course, we got the deal that isn't really an all inclusive. According to the apple vacation book, the Princess line appears to be the only one that has a VIP package of significance. Apparently for $21-24.00 per day per person, you would get premium brand liquor and one meal at one of the two restraunts not included in the regular deal. For $25 per person, you could eat at either or both places.The food in the buffet restaurant was okay, breakfast, unless you ordered an omelet, was always cold. The varitey was good, but cold. The five speciality restaurants were good! Food hot and very nice atmosphere.It wasn't just this resort, but yes, you have to get to the beach or pool to get a chair, especially if you want one with a back rest that actually works and if you want shade.The resort staff is nice, but much more reserved than in other countries. I did feel the Europeans were treated better than US people. In fact, interestingly, the Italians have their own section with a theater for evening shows.We did have a great time, weather was fantastic, the beach amazing, but we would not choose to return to this hotel. Most important, bring insect repellent! The bugs are terrible at night!

<Content>It all depends on what you want I researched Punta Cana and its hotels exhaustively on Trip Advisor and here is my take on the Craibe Club.Know what you want BEFORE you book ANY hotel. We were a group of five women celebrating our 40th birthdays and getting away from children, jobs, responsibility and husbands. We pretty much just wanted a place that was AI, clean, safe and had a consistent flow of food and booze. The Caribe Club did all of that.We were out to have a good time and could have stayed in a cardboard box to achieve that as we slept about 10 hours during our 4n/5d trip.CHECK IN: Piece of cake. Here's a tip: Coming from the airport, sit in the front of the bus. It seems like those of us in the front of the line had less issues. Not sure if that was a personality thing or just the stress of checking in so many people.Only one negative here...what's with the Luggage Nazis? After check-in, we wanted to grab our suits and shorts - we HAd come from 15 degree Pennsylvania, after all - and belly up to the bar. Well, they keep your luggage at the off-load site and do their best to keep you away from it. I am sure there is some security issue or some other reason for this, but hey man, it IS my stuff and it was way creepy the way they shouted and gestured to get away from our own suitcases. However, we just smiled and kept digging around until we got what we wanted, but it was weird.ROOMS: OK. Nothing special. Checked to make sure the toilet flushed - it was clogged -they fixed it immediately - and the shower had pressure and hot water. No problemo there. They were reasonably clean. No bugs. Cool. We were good to go. Fridge only had bottled water in it the first day...we had to track down the housekeeper after that. No big deal but even with a tip...no agua.FOOD: OK. There was always something you could find to soak up the endless stream of rum and mamajuana. Seems to be geared to Europeans...eggplant for breakfast freaked me out but we had a good laugh and the omelette station was good. We did manage to get a reservation at the Chinese/Japenese place - never did find out what it really was - but we cancelled then because after a few days of lying around with no responsibility, a dinner reservation felt like an obligation. Yeah, we were THAT relaxed. DRINKS: Lots. They have to be of a much lower alcohol content though...there is NO way we could drink 18 hours a day at home and not be in a coma. Which, if you ask me, is the way it SHOULD be or no one would have a good time...or at least remember it. The beer never seems that cold, but when it IS that Presidente is some excellent stuff. The coldest beer I had was in the buffet. When we got it at the beach bar, it was pretty warm. The mamajuana is some sharp liquid. If you like jaeger, you will like it. Mixed drinks were NEVER made the same way twice...even from the same bartender. It was hilarious waiting to find out what your next Pina Colada would look and taste like!LOBBY: FABULOUS. We liked it better than the disco...which was younger people. We loved the open-air and the dancing...we then would move over to the beach bar for some incredibly inspiring conversation with our Canadian friends. (Hi Roger and Bruce!)SHOWS: Who goes for that? Not us. Though we did have a blast chanting USA during the Broadway review. Other than that, no thanks.TONY, the APPLE REP: He was a charismatic guy, but we had no problems to report to him so I cannot tell you if he was helpful or not. Real pleasant though.LANGUAGE: We did ok with no Spanish. Agua and cervassa(sp?). Other than that, who cares? They even got the Rum and DIET coke we asked for, so what issues there are, can be overcome.TIPPING: IF you tip, please consider it thusly, I am tipping because these people work hard for little money. I do not expect any difference in service. Tipping made NO difference for our level of service. It was consistently inconsistent...just like the mixed drinks.This was one of the best trips of my life, regardless of hotel class. No, there are not many Americans, but so what...if you want Americans on the beach, go to Jersey. There are tons of Canadians - all of whom I LOVED! what unbelievably nice, laid back people! - and French...which, well, let's just leave it at that.We are certainly going back to PC...next year, in fact. But, for some reason - one I cannot really put my finger on - we would like to try a more upscale resort. Maybe better food or rooms...though again, we weren't in them that much. We had so much fun because we WANTED to and our group of five will be at least 5 times larger next year! If the price was stellar, I WOULD go back to the Caribe Club...but again, we will first check out either the Iberostar or Palladium, etc.Have a blast!

<Content>Pick another resort The first thing is be sure your travel agent gives you your choice of what type room you want. We asked for the VIP room because in the room discriptions on the web site Caribeclub princess.com they make it sound like the superior suites is the only type room that has the VIP package, come to find out any room can have the VIP package, The basic room on the first floor was disgusting. Cigarette butts in the bathroom sink drain, sliding glass doors off the tracks and would not lock, lamp in the room broken, toilet seat broken, dresser drawers all broken.... total nightmare! The front desk help barely speak english making the situation horrific! The food was decent. The beaches were beautiful but get up before 7:00 am to put a towel on chairs if you want one because if not you are out of luck! Also you practically have to beg for a beach towel even if you have the VIP package!!! My advice book your vacation some where else!!!!

<Content>no complaints well just got back from punta cana, and it was great!!! don't know what all the bad reviews were about, especially about the workers and the staff, they were so... nice and fun, its all about YOUR attitude, as far as tipping it was not an issue we tipped here and there a few bucks and the a la carte resteraunts a little bit more $5 each couple. We were 9 of us no one got sick, no one had any troubles, just watch the pina colda and drinks with coconut milk, there is a lot of fresh fruit so go easy as this can give you some bathroom problems, and of course the tap water avoid, otherwise we had a blast, drinks aren't as good as mexico if you like tropical drinks, but the rest of the drinks were great. The marinearium swim with the sharks and mantarays was a great trip and well worth it. the jungle ones well it depends what you like and which one you book on. All in all the food was good, and the a la cartes were all good. would go back, OH and the beaches and water and plants were the best i have ever seen!! you can walk for miles and no one bugs you..they love canadians but they love anyone who is nice and treats them the way anyone would like to be treated, and don't forget your not at home your in a different country! Hi to all the Rec guys on the beach, especially - Johnathan...we went for two weeks, feb 15- mar 1/07 and flew air canada which was on time and excellent plane and flite.... edmonton, Alberta -

<Content>Anything you are looking for...... Good times!! :) All I can say is that this was such a fun vacation. Punta Cana has everything you need. If you want to relax you can relax and if you want to go crazzzzzzzy, you can do that as well. :)Caribe Club Princess was a beautiful resort. Very good food  service with a good choice of A La Carte restaraunts.All you have to do is make sure you tip here and there and you are going to have the best vacation you possibly can. The nightly entertainment was fun and the entertainment staff make sure you have a blast.One thing I will warn you about is that if you go to the clubs, the drinks are not all inclusive and are quite expensive. Works out to about $8-10 US.We had the VIP package which was good but if you do go with it, it is better to book when you book the trip. There is a massage, watersports, one gourmet dinner, 1 Hour Free internet and all the room service you like. A big family resort along with the odd singles here and there. This resort had a specific entertainment crew for Italians. Felt like I was in Italy..... :) It was fun!!Would definitely go back!!!BEACH WAS AWESOME!!! Take a look at my pics..... :)I am heading back to Punta Cana in April.. (Shows how much fun I had) Hope this review helps.

<Content>Awesome time! My boyfriend, myself and five of our friends went to this resort Feb 17th-24th. We loved it. The resort itself is beautiful. The grounds are well kept. The lobby was really nice as were the rooms. We had a room on the third floor with nice high ceilings. Two of our friends had the VIP package, and other then the cigars, bottle of rum and beer stocked in fridge, we didnt notice too many differences. Oh they did get free room service. By the end though our maid was putting beer in all our rooms. The staff was very friendly. I couldnt believe some of the reviews saying that they were not. If you are nice to them they are nice to you. The food was OK, nothing special. We played it safe and ate alot of rice and breads. One day we had hotdogs and two people ended up sick for the night. Just make sure you bring immodium and gravol. It was nothing to ruin our trip but just becareful. We ate at the mexican, which our stomachs didnt agree with. The chinese which was amazing and the dominican one which was also good. The beach was absolutely beautiful, the waves were amazing to swim in. The pools were nice too, sometimes a little chilly but not too bad, its so hot that you dont mind. We went to a couple shows and they were alright. The magic one was really good. The Lion King was obviously catered to kids. I recommend going on the carribean festival, snorkling with sting rays and nurse sharks. The coral they take you to is amazing!We would definately go back to this resort in a heart beat. I wish I was still there :(

<Content>Loved It! Like many of you reading this review, I had read many reviews prior to vacationing at the CCP. I was starting to question my choice in resorts and wasn't sure what to expect when we got there because of the many negative comments I read. We usually travel to Mexico, so we were expecting it to be a similar experience. We loved the resort. We stayed at the CCP from 2/17 - 2/24 and had a great time. There were 15 of us traveling together (4 families). I'll give you a breakdown of the trip and try to give a few tips as I go. We traveled Apple Vacations. The arrival in the Punta Cana airport was well organized and uneventful. It was very easy to find our bus to the hotel. The ride took about 35 minutes. We arrived at the hotel around 11:00 p.m. Check in was quick and there were no problems getting to our rooms. The buffet was closed, but one of the restaurants was still open and had a small selection of food for us. It was just burgers, hot dogs and fries. They had been sitting for a while, and didn't look very appetizing. We are beach people and are very content just lounging in the sun all day. You do need to get up early and reserve a chair. We were usually out at the beach by 7:00 and reserved our chairs. We then went to breakfast and were back on the beach by 8:30 or so. As long as you put a towel or some sort of personal item on the chair, you won't have a problem. There was a problem with the towels at the beginning of the week. They didn't have enough for the amount of people staying in the resort, so towels were very hard to come by and a lot of people were complaining about the towel service. If this becomes a problem then once you get a towel, keep it overnight, reserve your chairs the next morning and when the towels do finally get delivered, you can change it for a fresh one. The beach is beautiful. There are waves and the kids had a blast body surfing. You can also use boggie boards which are available at the rental hut. The water was clean and very refreshing. The pools were nice. The kids did swim in them quite a bit, but we were very happy at the beach, so only went in the pool once to have a drink in the swim up bar.The food was a bit disappointing. We weren't expecting much as we had read a lot of the reviews - they were right. You could always find something, but we found that a lot of the food was cold at the buffet. We did enjoy the choice of restaurants and the quality of food was better, but they do require reservations, so book these early in the day. They usually start booking reservations around 9:00 a.m.The staff is amazing. They work so hard and really seem to enjoy what they do. They are always talking to the guests and trying to get people involves in activities. There is always something going on either at the beach or pool area so if you are they type that likes to keep busy, go for it - you are on vacation, some of the activities are a lot of fun, especially the dance lessons. The only excursion we took was the ATV's which everyone seemed to like. I don't have any information about anything else. Some people that were there said that the horseback riding wasn't great. A lot of traveling to get to your destinations. The shows were a lot of fun. If you don't want to get picked on then don't sit in the front row. Usually those in the front were targeted for the Ice Breaker which is the pre-show activity. We did sit in the front and had fun with it. The dancers are amazing.The weather was ok. We had two days of rain, but we made the best of it and hung out in the lobby and played cards. The rest of the week was nice. It was in the 80's with a nice breeze. About half of our party did get sick, but nothing debilitating. I guess that's what they call traveler's diahrrea. Make sure you bring imodium, pepto, rolaids, etc. You wil most likely need it. There is a store on the property, but it's very expensive. A bottle of pepto was $16.00 U.S. My daughter wanted potatoe chips and they charged me $5.00 for a canister of lays chips. We liked this resort because it was smaller and everything is close. We had s standard room which was very clean. We did not upgrade to VIP and didn't feel like we missed out on anything. You do get a few extra's but nothing we couldn't do without. We had a pool / ocean view and were about 30 seconds from everything. This was great for the kids as they had their independance to roam about on their own. We also felt very safe.We never really had a problem with the language barrier. Most of the staff speak spanish, so if you know enough to get by, you'll be fine. They don't speak a lot of english, so as long as you know a few spanish words mixed in the the english words, they can usually figure out what you are trying to say. Check out and the trip back to the airport was fine. We would definately go back to this hotel. It was a great week and one we will not soon forget. I was really freaking out after reading some of these reviews. Don't worry - it's going to be great. Just remember that you are in a differently country and things are very laid back. Go and enjoy.A few tips:Bring small denominations of cash - nothing bigger then a 20. Bring a lot of 1's - you are not required to tip, but it's appreciated.You might want to bring your own towel.Bring imodium, pepto, tylenol, air freshner, etc.Learn a bit of spanish before you go - it helps to know a few words.Have fun!

<Content>Great resort This resort was awesome, the weather was perfect 85 and sunny everyday. The hotel staff was very nice, especially the bartenders I highly recommend the mama juana (a rum based dominican shot). the food at the buffet was average nothing special, but the resturants that required resevations very good. The two best resturants that are included were the Chinese plase and the Brazillian place. you can beat the beach white sand blue water it was amazing. The main pool with the swim up bar was always pretty chilly so we did not spend a lot of time in the pool but the ocean was great. All in all this was the best vaction I have been on, it was very relaxing and and just a great time overall, and you cant beat the price. I would definitely return to this resort.

<Content>caribe club princess we stayed at the caribe club princess from feb3-10 2007 i am going to break down into seperate categories.Airport arrival: upon arrival we were led from the airplane to the terminal were we paid our 10$ tourist card fee we then went through immigration and on to baggage claim (watch out for the very helpful people wanting to carry your luggage for you they do not do this for free a simple no gracias will suffice! if you do not want this. after obtaining our baggage we then found our tour company which was apple they pointed us to the correct bus for our resort it was approximatley a 25 minute ride(hold on tight for the ride driving is a little rough)Resort: we arrived at approx 11:30 am our room would not be ready until the check in time of 3pm they gave us our bracelets and a map and showed us were we could eat and change until the room was ready. the front desk people seem a little uptight but we had no problems. I also reccomend the vip package it worked out well for us. At 3pm our room was ready it was clean and all the vip ammenites were there ie: bottle of rum,bathrobes,and fully stocked refreigerator with soda water and beer. never had any problems with towels or anything else that we needed. we tipped about 3-4$us per day for the maid and the remote for the t.v. showed up without being asked for as well as a alarm clock and nightly turn down service happened everynight without fail. the room was kept spotless and i am very picky about cleanliness.Food: we ate at the buffet for most of our stay because we did not like to have to be somewhere at a certain time but the food was ok you could always find somthing to eat. we ate at mama mias italian food we did not like it and ended up at the buffet. we also ate at La Cava which we had grilled lobster it was excellent!! we had one meal included in our vip package so we chose this one.there are two resturaunts that are not included the LaCava and EL Pescador. there is a japanese a mexican italinan barzillian and dominican. I did end up getting sick but it only lasted a day or so. the drinks that we had were really good especially the cocoloco!! the wine left little to be desired. my husband said that the beer was ok.the swiiming pools were all very clean but the water cold. the beach is the most beautiful that i have ever seen and that sand so white and soft. we never had a problem getting a beach chair we usually got there around 9am.nightlife: the casino did not impress us at all but if you get bored it is something to do. the shows at least the two that my husband and i went to were very good. we did not go to the disco but some of the people we met did and they were very disappointed.all in all we will stay at this resort again it its a very fun place to be it has something for everybody!!

<Content>More than we expected After reading some of the reviews, we were a little concerned, but couldn't have been more pleased! The resort itself was on beautiful grounds, and the beach is wonderful. The resort is planned well, with the pools, rooms, and dining areas all together, and the lobby, stores, and theatre in the same area.The distance from the lobby and theatre to the actual rooms is a good walk, but what a beautiful one! Especially in the evening. My husband is not a walker, and even he took to walking instead of riding the tram. And the trams run constantly, if you want to ride. Our rooms were large, with a step-down sitting area, and the bathroom was big. Our maid service was great. We did leave a small gift for the maid each day, along with $1, and our service couldn't have been better. We did have wash cloths everyday, without having to request one. We had packed washcloths, a cheap pack of 12, and didn't need them. We left them for the maid. One of the other couples room had a leaky ceiling when they checked in, and the next morning they were moved into the same building as the rest of us. We went with two other couples, and found the resort extremely small group friendly, with many places to gather to hang out both during the evenings and the daytime. We've been to other resorts where a table for 6 to be able to eat and drink for the entire evening was a problem, yet here, whether it was the buffet dining area, the lobby bar, or even the specialty restaurants, all they wanted was for us to be enjoying ourselves and each other's company. We ate at the Chinese restaurant--wonderful!-great sushi-and the Italian-delicious, and beautiful presentation-and the Dominican-very different. The buffet seemed to have something for everyone, breakfast, lunch and dinner. We found a table at the buffet dining area that we liked the first night, and tipped our waiting staff $5 per couple. From then on, anytime we went to the buffett, we sat at the same table, and wow! what bar service we had!! The resort was actually larger than what we expected, yet again, user friendly. There are 3 pools, each with a bar, one in the pool, and they range from very noisy to quiet! The palms and landscape surrounding them are lovely. The beach area is great, and very convenient to bars and bathrooms. We didn't have a problem getting chairs at the beach anytime, and at the pool,even at 9am, we could find them for 6 people together. The pool bar pool seemed more crowded, however, and saving towels were out there earlier. We usually used the pool in the middle of the resort. It was right next to the Creperie (good for a snack!) and the lunch restaurant. We did not find the language to be a problem, and the staff seemed happy, and willing to help with anything we needed. I think a lot of times your attitude will determine their attitude, if you know what I mean. A smile goes a long way. I know a little spanish, and would speak and ask them different things, and they were great! Tony in the house (if you're with Apple) is a great resource. We went on the Jungle Tour (1/2 day) and is was great. Highly recommend! This is our second trip to Punta Cana, and we would definitely return to this resort, as we feel that even after 7 days, we didn't get to enjoy all it has to offer!

<Content>Interesting experience We came back from the CCP yesterday and it was an interesting experience. The hotel was nice because it was compact, no excessive travelling to get to the beach, restaurants, or hotel room which was nice because we were travelling with 2 toddlers. Our kids loved playing in the sand and loved the pool because you could walk into it from the shallow end, just like the ocean. The water was a bit rough though and it tended to scare the kids. I liked it because it was clear and there were no rocks around. The food was better than I expected. I read the reviews and I was a bit scared of the poor quality. However, I was traveling with about 9 other people and 6 of us became sick, including both kids. We were very careful about not drinking any water and about what we ate. My husband and I had been to Punta Cana twice before at a different resort and we had never gotten sick before. This was obviously a low point.As for the service, it really depended on who served us. The lady making reservations in buiding 1 was awful. She screwed up tiwice on the dates, even though I speak 3 different languages, I tried in all 3 to correct her the second time which took some doing to put the the right date on our reservations. The pregnant lady at the beach bar was an absolute sweatheart though, as she went out of her way to play with my son as I ate.One of my big beefs though was lack of availabiity of chairs at the beach, they were all gone by 8. We tried saving them but someone took our chairs and our towels. Towels were Ok to get as long as you got there by 10. One thing that was interesting was that there are about 14 Italians in their late teens/early 20's that are paid to basically party it up with the Italian visitors there and they were pretty wild, everywhere from their drag outfits to the nurses uniforms to the human chain of 300 people they made on the beach. At times in the area in front of the 2 -3 buildings, I thought I was in Italy, especially hearingEros Ramazotti in the back.I don't think I would go back to this hotel though because we did get sick which puts a big damper on the trip.

<Content>caribe club princess We booked through TNT. The flight and getting to the hotel was fine. Checking in the hotel was an experience.Not english friendly.We arrived in our room to find outlets out of the wall and a closet door broken and light not working.We ended up paying for an upgrade for the week on the second day, costing $270.00. If you have new US currency change it before you get there.The front desk wouldn't change my $50 dollar bills because they thought they were fake. The property was nice, food was great and the beach was the best.I would just use one of the other resorts before I went back to this one, this resort catered more to french eastern and european guests.

<Content>Loved it!! We went to caribe club princess from Jan 6/07 - Jan 13/07. We went for a wedding. The resort was absoluty beautiful. The food was awesome. The best part for me was the beach. The waves were amazing. Any one who says this resort is horrible is wrong. We went VIP and it made a big difference. We got 5 restaurants to choose from for the week, which included italian, mexican, chinese, brazillian, steak or seafood. Every restaurant was great. 24 hr room service. 20 min message on the beach and 1hr of any motorized water sports. The people were great and were always willing to make your stay even better. The rooms were big. Our view was overlooking a pond filled with amazing birds, duck and even peacocks. All I can say is that I will go back in a heart beat and I would recommend this resort to any one.Ontario, Canada

<Author>We-B-Disappointed
<Content>Buyer BEWARE My wife and I stayed at the Princess Caribe Dec. 31/06 thru Jan. 07/07. As a well traveled couple we both conclude this was by far the worst resort we have ever had the misfortune of staying at.Punta Cana is a beautiful beach, one of the best I have seen in my travels, but the Caribe Princess Resort's food, service and most of the staff made it a very ugly week.Firstly I noticed that on many occasions the staff seemed to ignore female concerns in restaurants, room service, or at the front desk but yet seem to act when a male requested the same service.The food was horrible. Almost all the meat we had was under-cooked and when we asked to cook it longer, it always took a couple dollar tip to get results. The restaurants were always fully booked yet always half empty.The staff was always complaining how bad their working conditions were and their service reflected their lack of ambition to serve their customers. They always had their hand out but rarely justified the tip other than claiming poverty.Managers never acted on our complaints or blamed the travel agent for not properly explaining their amenities. The Apple Travel representative on site was also not really interested in our complaints. I asked management for a complaint sheet to voice my concerns to a corporate office and was denied.We purchased the VIP program and were charged for alcohol that was quoted free. We never received the free bottle of rum and cigars stated in the brochure. We never received the beach towels that were promised. Finally received the robes promised on the 6th day of our stay. Never utilized the free motor sports promised because they were booked for the week when you used the VIP bracelet. There were plenty of openings if you offered cash.Workers on the resort would ask us for food because they claimed they worked long hours without food. When some of the top staff came into the restaurants to dine, they were all given preferential treatment over the customers.Tried charging us for a safe in the room and only after a heated discussion allowed us one for free.We were charged for room service when it was told to us on the first day that it was included. This was room service that took two days to get four beers.When we returned home we both were very sick with symptoms consistent with food poisoning. I can list many more incidents that just seemed to accumulate during the week, but I think you get the idea of what kind of place this is.As I said earlier, the beach is post card material. This resort is definitely ruining a beautiful vacation destination and hopefully the other resorts discover how important service is for their tourism to survive.

<Content>Fabulous Vacation! We stayed at the Caribe Club Princess from Jan.1 - Jan.5th.I rarely write reviews, but after reading some of the negative ones I feel the need to comment.This resort is absolutely beautiful. The room was clean and comfortable. The towels and other linens may not be ready as soon as the room is cleaned because they are being washed. I think that the staff must get very frustrated by the amount of laundry to be done. Especially since there is a need for many self centered peope to get hotel beach towels, save chairs at the pool AND at the beach (some rude people get up at 6am to save seats and then go back to bed!). This is so foolish. It usually rains in the early morning, briefly. The towels get wet, the selfish tourists trade the wet towels for dry ones, then complain that they don't have towels in their rooms. How many washing machines do you think the resort has???It is annoying to get to the beach or pool and see rows of lounge chairs covered in towels with no one there. In my opinion, the only problem with the resort is the inflexible tourists who think of no one but themselves,The food..well.....it is very good. I recommend the buffet because you can see what you are eating and it is all fresh and delicious. The fish is amazing.I also recommend a trip to the spa. It is lovely.If you want the comforts of home...stay home!You must be flexible and kind. The Dominican people work very hard and they take pride in what they do. Go and relax, it is worth the trip!!

<Content>Great Time in Dominican This hotel and experience were awesome. I cannot believe how arogant some people are, i'm not really sure what they were expecting for the price, this hotel is just fine, believe methe food - the food was fine, i didn't love the buffet and we didnt eat there when we could avoid it. My boyfriend, on the other hand, was completely fine with it. The food there was just kind of lower-grade. The pasta tasted like beeferoni and not pasta like we're used to - that kinda thing. We went to most of the a-la-carte restaurants and they were awesome. I was so surprised at te selection, in the chinese restaurant there's even sushi! So we really enjoyed those and stuck to those most of the time. If you read the reviews further back, they say they had to wait in a longgg line to reserve a spot in the a-la-cartes for dinner, we did not have the problem and even booked in the afternoon for that night a few timesthe service - the service was awesome, the employees are just great, so much fun. of course there's the odd person with a chip on their shoulder, they're people too...cut them some slack. the worst part was the language barrier, there should definately have been some more english - speaking people in key parts...like check in. that was a a little frusteratingthe room- the room was great. we had a queen bed and our balcony overlooked the pool which was awesome because we could hear what was going on down there. We did have to pay 24 dollars for the key to the safe but it was well worth it. the safe's arent huge, about 1 foot cube, average size. The one thing that was annoying about the room was that everytime the maids would come and clean the ceramic floors would never really fully dry, i guess the moist air is to be expected. we left the maid 1 or 2 bucks every day and never had a problem getting towels or having the room cleaned. the drinks - unbelieveably strong. very good though!the language barrier - we came not knowing a lick of spanish,and did fine, it would have been useful to know some spanish though, like please, thank you, etc my biggest complaint of this hotel is the language barrier and second the food. there were a lot of people who only spoke spanish which got aggrivating, but we dealt with it and were fine. there were a TON of french-speaking guests and a lot of the staff spoke french as well so if you speak french, you're in luckthe beach - just breathtaking! we spent so much time there, my boyfriend played volleyball on the beach and water polo in the pool. you could walk for FOREVER on the beach it was awesome. Also if you come out of the resort and turn left on the beach and walk for about half an hour, there are little shops where you can get souvineers and stuff like that, cigars, booze etc. make sure you bargain with them! dont pay more than half of what they ask -- at least. overall - great experience, we both got sick though so by the end of the trip we just wanted to leave, but now i just want to go back. i would reccomend checking out Sun Village resort in Peurto Plata if you havent already booked this one. apparently it's canadian owned, with tons of english staff and gourmet food but not as nice of a beach. if you've already booked this resort. it is just fine, enjoy your vacation.ps: DEFINATELY bring sunscreen, aloe, advil, and immodium, these things are very expensive on the resort, bringing them was the best thing i did

<Author>OhperoWow
<Content>Horrible! (Terrible!) DO NOT GO THERE! I am a high traveler and not much of a complainer, but I think it is my responsibility to warn you and avoid you the problems of choosing such a poor, yet expensive resort.There were a total of 5 families traveling together (our first vacation together as group) so we had very high expectations and were looking forward to a relaxed 5 days. Little did we know what we were getting ourselves into.Here are things to expect:No towels! If you are lucky enough to have towels, you鈥檒l probably not want to use them!No beach towels, even if you get there by 9:00 a.m.Foods at their 鈥渞estaurants鈥?are less then poor, although when making reservations they always seem to be 鈥減acked鈥?but when you are lucky enough to insist in making the reservation, don鈥檛 be surprised if you are the only ones there.Resort employees are very outspoken of how unhappy they are working there, therefore their customer service is less than acceptable.People at 鈥淕uest Services鈥?DON鈥橳 CARE WHAT YOU THINK!You will feel obligated to tip everyone, even if they鈥檝e done nothing for you, since they intimate you that they鈥檒l do something to your dinner and/or service if you don鈥檛.I wouldn鈥檛 be surprised if you DON鈥橳 get food poisoning there (everyone in our party did and we are still trying to recover!)Here鈥檚 an inside tip (if you haven鈥榯 read any previous comments, make sure you read the following): BEWARE!!!!!!!The color of the wrist band determines the level of service you鈥檒l receive (told to us by multiple employees working there since we are bilingual Spanish/English). If you are not European, DO NOT GO! They treat you like S@%^! specially if you are an American; you鈥檒l definitely get the short end of the stick.P.S. Too bad that even though the beach is gorgeous and PUNTA CANA is such a beautiful location, it is overshadowed by such a horrible resort!!!!

<Content>Stay Away!! The worst resort I have ever been to! We stayed 11 days, and that would be 11 days to long. There was 8 of us. Everyone got food poisoning, and the staff was RUDE! The resort was dirty, the food was so so bad, the peope were so unaccomadating, and the service..... well there was none. I would NEVER stay here again. I would NEVER spend money to get sick and be treated like poop!

<Content>Relaxing beach vacation Let me start of by saying that I got far more than I expected for my money.. We booked through travelByBob and got a great price (685/person from detroit including flight/hotel/all inclusive)The beach is as beautiful as everyone describes. The water is clear (very salty) and the sun is mostly clear except in the early AM. The beach is cleaned every morning. If you get out early enough, you can save your choice seats with a towel. Dont get too close to the volleyball courts if you dont want to be hit with balls.. I expected a small room, but no, we got a HUGE room by my normal standards. Even had a small sitting area and a nice size balcony with a view of one of the pools. (Advice: Ask for a 3rd floor room - there are no elevators, but the high wood ceilings made it worth the walk )The walk to the ocean was about 30 seconds. The walk to the front desk was 5-8 minutes.. But the scenery is great so we enjoyed the walk. So while I loved it there, and will most likely go back - here are some things that you may want to keep in mind - - They dont speak much english there. Tony (the apple rep) was great and very helpful, but the average staff dont speak english at all. When we were there, MANY of the guests were french. Luckily I took 7 years of french growing up so I was able to get by. - There are free drinks everywhere. No problem getting them. Just tip a little and they appreciate it. However - the margaritas have no tequila in them.. they use a mix of vodka, triple-sec, and something in spanish.. While they do have frozen drinks readily available, they are the type made from actual fruit. I personally found it too sunny and hot to drink a ton during the day. Saw many people with sunburn. Wear sunscreen you fools. The food was ok for the first 4 or 5 days, but my stomach eventually rebelled and while I never felt sick, I found myself quickly running to the bathroom after meals.. (But taste wasnt a problem) The breakfast was OUTSTANDING.. I liked the brazilian restaraunt the best, and the chinese (while not really chinese food) was good. I had lasagna at the italian.. it was so bad I went to the buffet afterwards. The staff are all friendly, and greatly appreciate tips. They work entire weeks at a time and sleep in a small work room area at night.. I gave my main my old baseball mit for her kids and she was very happy. We had also taken some sample shampoo and such from various hotels and left them as a gift. The only excursion we did was the marinarium. I loved snorkelling through the reef. Even though you know a nurse shark wont bite you, seeing a 12 ft shark a foot away is still an experience. The host of the marinarium is from chilli and fluent in almost every language you can imagine. Pretty impressive. You have to pay $25 for the safe. we did and figure it was worth it. As far as buying souvenirs, the town is expensive. Go to the shops on the beach. Prices : T-shirts could be had for $5 if you buy enough. The little coconut shaved animals the same. Larimar is everywhere, as is amber, but beware of fake amber. Cofee you can get the big bags for 5, 3 for the small ones. Cigars - I bought a box of 35 cohibas for $35.. They start off at over $100. Even though they are on beach, still better than average cigars back home. I went on a 10 minute ride to the Don Lucas cigar factory. The host was very informative, and they give you 1 free cigar. Thats all you need to know you need to buy some. Far better than any cigar Ive ever had in my life. Im cheap and still spent the $40 for 10 of them. Oh yea - activities at the place: 1. Sunbathing. its great. You learn to block out the old people who seem to have lost their tops. ick. 2. Beach volleyball - so much fun. I normally dont play but couldnt resist. 3. water polo every other day - tons of fun and a great workout. 4 . (i never did these, but the GF did) - They have yoga classes, water aerobics, mereingui classes, etc. They also have beach games that are mildly amusing. Youll have fun if you go there without expecting too much.

<Content>Beach was Great I would first have to say that the beach was great , Not to rough and just enough waves to make it fun to play in, Food was plentiful and I thought it was very good ,Wife was a little fussy but worked her way through it, The first room assigned to us was dark and damp on the ground floor smelled musty , With much effort we managed to get it changed to the top floor ,this room was great with a view of the beach and pool, A bit noisy in the afternoon when they are getting interactive with the guests, and the only other thing I could complain about the room was there appeared to be some sort of bed bugs as I was quite chewed up by the weeks end, We did wittness quite a few people at the resort that got ill , We had a party of ten of which seven ended up sick and four were transported to the hospital, Must have been somesort of parisite or something , The resort itself was very well maintained and clean, I came into the room while they were cleaning and witnessed them on there hands and knees scrubing floors ,very impressed , Staff did not speak much english or cared not to so it was rather hard to comunicate , overall I had a good time but not one person in the party said that they would ever go back , I guess that they did not take the daily dose of booze to kill the bug ,myself ,, NO PROBLEM

<Content>Best Time Ever My friend and I stayed at this resort from dec10/06 to dec 17/06 and we had a blast. We mostly stayed at the pool but we spent one morning at the beach which was fun with the waves.(just hold on to your bathing suit) Our room was clean, no problems with air condioner, buffet was good although by the end of the week I was tired of it. It is a lot of the same stuff everyday but not a big deal. We ate at the mexican twice it was great and brazilian once and left half way through it was taking a long time to bing everything out and we weren't that hungry anyway. We did 2 day trips. We did the saona island which I would not recommend. It started at 0630 in the lobby then 2.5hr bus to the boat then 2 hr on the boat to the island. While at the island you are constantly harrassed by people trying to sell you things. Then it took 1hr back to bus by speedboat then back on the bus for another 2.5hr. When we got back we were so tired we went to bed. The other one was the shopping tour which was excellant for only $22. They take you to the rum factory and show you where to buy things so you won't get ripped off. My tips if you go to this place: bring bug spray, your own facecloth(they don't supply them) and remember if you go looking for faults you are going to find them but this place is great I will definatly go here again.

<Content>Excellent value Been there with my family of four. From the very beginning we felt welcome. The receptionist was kind and tried to accomodate us as quickly and good as possible. The room was what we expected, with the air conditioning in good condition (and not loud), thoroughly cleaned every day. The resort has three pools (all nice) so there was no way one couldn't find where to put down the towel. The beach was great (you'd expect that in Punta Cana!) and the ocean was clean and wavy, so 90% of the time we spent at the ocean. The personnel was professional and courteous. To those guys complaining about the fact that not everybody speaks great English: what if the Spaniards visiting your country would be annoyed at your lack of Spannish knowledge?!?! Be decent, because anyhow they understand more English than we understand Spannish! The service was great, with or without tips (mind you, I always like to tip them). Talking to other tourists (many Europeans and hardly, if any, Americans) and they were all enjoying their vacation. The a la carte restaurants were okay, with a little plus for the Italian. The Chinese was great once, but not so good the second time (we learned the chef took a few days off, so the replacement cook wasn't as...Chinese). Overall we had a vacation worth more than what we paid for (it was the third cheapest out of about 100 packages!)Lovely people the Dominicans!

<Content>Just OK...disappointing Just a short review. We have been to DR 3 years ago, and again recently Nov 9th for 3 nites. This hotel was average. My COMPLAINTS and WARNINGS would be, the lobby is much too far from the rooms/pool/beaches- you have to wait for a shuttle/tram to take you to the main lobby, or walk quite a distance. We called for pick up on our departure date, 45 min ahead of time, the shuttle came late (30 min) and we missed our prepaid transfer to the airport- and had to pay for a cab- no replacement was offered by the front desk staff, I think it should have been since it was their delay that caused our problem (we would have walked to the fornt desk if it wasnt 1/2 mile -literally- away.) There really should be more bilingual staff -especially at major points of communication- ie- lobby etc.Our 2 rooms left much to be desired. The 1st was dark and damp, and LOUD- being next to the main restaurant- ALL nite long- noise, loud talking. We asked for a new room, and the new one was nice, bigger, brighter, but the toilet ran constantly. Day and nite- no stopping. NONE of the linens smelled fresh to me! That includes sheets, pillow cases, towels and beach towels. Really, a freshly laundered smelling towel would be great. Food was bland, and presentation was dull and non appealing.Drinks were ok. Dominican restaurant smellled very musty.Drinks served on the beach would be nice, as would a bar directly on the beach. Entertainment staff was good, water aerobics was fun. Variety of nationalities visiting the DR is always is nice and interesting. The beach is BEAUTIFUL. The little huts on the beach are really nice.Activities center on beach was helpful. Massages and availability of them was wonderful. There seemed to be an expectation of staff to be tipped which was annoying after a while.I would not go back to this resort. I would not miss this resort, and that's not a feeling you want to have when you're done with a vacation. They need to work a little harder at understanding what the vacation experince should be for their visitors. The other all inclusive hotel we stayed at in DR was MUCH better.The beautiful beach was the best part of this vacation.

<Content>great vacation at ccp Let me begin by saying my wife and I have been to europe ,south america, over half the caribbean islands and more than 30 states so we are not new to travel.Our trip began on 6Nov 06 at phl airport on USA3000. Nice flight we even got in early. Transfer to the resort went smoothly. Once at the resort we were told our room would be ready in 1/2 hr as were we very early. We went and got a bite to eat. Upon returning to the front desk we were given our room key. We went to our room and were pleasantly surprised at the size of it and the location. We were on the first floor with a view of both the pool and the ocean. The room was very clean and very cool as the AC worked great. All week long trhe room was cool and clean. The staff at the resort couldn't have been any nicer when ever there was a communication problem they would try and find someone who could speak English. The food was good the only complait was that the choices at the buffet got old after a week. They did try though. The beach was always clean as were the grounds.We booked the VIP package and it was well worth it. I n all it was a very pleasant vacation the only thing I saw that was wrong was my fellow americans yelling at some of the workers because they didn't speak english well it is their country try spanish or stay home. If we ever return to Punta Cana it would be at the Caribe Club Princess.

<Content>Good Honeymoon My husband and I spent our honeymoon at the Caribe Club princess. We arrived Sept 11 and stayed until Sept 18.Lobby: Wonderful and beautiful lobby to hang out in. A nice bar and cocktail tables are located in the lobby along with couches and tables. We spent every night hanging out in the open air lobby watching the dancing and activities that would take place there. Great hang out spot!Room: Our room was a beach front room. Nice sunken living area. The bathroom was o.k. The ceiling was siding, but does it really matter? Our room kinda smelled a little bit, but I think its because all the vents are hooked together from room to room. Overall, the rooms are great. I read that if you bring gifts for the maid that you will get better service from them. So, I brought soaps, lipsticks, bubble bath, mascara....etc. We received extra beach towels the first couple days, and a fully stocked fridge every day. Might be worth to bring small gifts or tip. Our friends who did not tip or bring gifts, did not get more shampoo, or their fridge restocked.( Each room has a mini fridge that is filled with bottled water, glass bottled sprite, coke and diet coke). I reccomend getting the key to the safe. Its 24 dollars, but definitely worth the investment.Pool: Greatest hang out spot. The swim up bar with stools in the water was our everyday hangout. The pool is pretty big and there is always an activity going on at one end--either dancing lessons, volleyball, or silly games. Beach: The beach was pretty good. When we were there, there was alot of seaweed at our part of the beach, but we were told it was because of the hurricanes making the water churn up seaweed that eventually comes to shore. But the last day we were there was the best for the ocean. They have boogie boards on the beach free for anyone's use. Anything else, you have really have to pay for or be registered for. Plus, if you break a piece off of anything you use, it cost big bucks. We never had a problem finding a cabana--even in the middle of the day! Watch out for the locals walking the beach trying to sell you stuff--it can get pretty agravating. I suggest to just walk away. Snack Bar: Good drinks, bad food. The snack bar always has food out. The safest thing to eat is the french fries. The food pretty much sits out most of the day. You can ask for a hamburger and they will grill one up for you while you watch. Buffett: We ate at the buffett every morning. Good breakfast food. Pancakes, french toast, omlettes, and eggs are the best. They make the omlettes while you wait. Very good. I found that there meat tastes alot different. I heard a rumor, but I don't know how true it is--I heard the Caribe Chicken is iguana. Now, I can't imagine that it is, but I figured I would put it out there! We had dinner at the buffett a couple times--it was good, but I wouldn't say its the best. They have good pasta's and pork.Specialty restaurants: These restaurants have the best food on the resort! So make reservations. You can make reservations every morning for the next evening. We ate at the Chinese restaurant which was excellent, the Dominican was also very good-get the beef. We had brazilian as our honeymoon dinner-the beef and fish were perfect! We didn't make it to the mexican, but I heard it wasn't that good. The italian was supposedly awesome, but I can't vouch for that one since I didn't eat there.I got sick when I was there for a couple days. I couldn't say whether it was the food, too much sun, or just being plain old sick. My husband ate the same things as me and didn't get sick one day.Adventures: Be careful which adventures or excursions you book. We booked the ANIMAL ADVENTURE and it took us an hour to get there. They picked us up in an open air bus and took us through Dominican--the parts we went through were not very nice. Ask how far away the park is. The animal adventure park was not worth the money. We swam with the Sea Lions, but that is pretty much all there is to do at the park and the sea lions are only half trained to do what they are supposed to do. The snorkeling at our adventure park was cancelled and we received no partial refund. They just made us sit and wait for the next activity which was over an 1hr.Overall: The resort is beautiful.

<Content>Caribe Princess Paradise !! Ok all you really picky people. For all of you that were so negative I think you should have stayed home. I was there with my 15 year old daughter, my husband and my eldest daughter and her husband, from Aug/6 till the 13th/ 2006 and we had the time of a lifetime. It is what you make of it .The hotel room was large and clean and had everything you would need (except facecloths). The A/C worked just fine, the bed was fine, the pillows were fine (remember you are not at home).The maids didn't speak English, so study a few phrases before you go, they get a laugh out of your effort and eventually get your message. If you leave a tip and a little surprise for them on your pillow in the mornings they are so happy and you won't need for anything.The service in the restaurants was great. A waiter named Dionicio (at the buffet) was excellent , a great man, I wish I could have brought him home.The pool bar waiter (Hector) was another fine man and spoke English too.The a la Carte  restos were good, we preferred the Brazilian and Italian. The pool snackbar wasn't so good so we headed for the buffet. You are sure to find something you will like, it was great !Pools? Oh my! Clean clean. Only thing is they close at night, so there is no night-time swimming, didn't matter, there were so many other things to do.Shows everynight, earlier for the kids, and then we headed off to the lobby for fun or even just to sit and people watch. It was very comfortabe, and you could join in the dancing and fun if you wanted to.Their drinks were great, even the (Presidente) beer, They will suggest one of their native drinks called Mamajuana- it was good. Hubby that hasn't had more than 5 drinks in 21 years with me, had them everyday. Remember to try their pie pie drinks I won't tell you what it is, it's a surprise,and more of a ladies' drink though.The ocean? Turquoise, clear, everything I had only seen in pics or TV. I couldn't believe how warm the water was. It rained twice for 15 min. But we welcomed it for how hot it was, the heat hits you in the face as soon as you get off the plane. There are the occassional bare boobies, but you get over it, you know what I say  if you can't beat them, join them maybe you'll never see them again in your life.All in all, we can't wait to go back, at least we know we'll have a blast. I'm even thinking of taking Spanish lessons.The expeditions we took were great also. We swam with the dolphins at Manati Park and walked with the iguanas on the Safari.When you go shopping outside the resort, be prepared to bargain, they are aggressive but will come down drastically in price. A photo album I wanted, they wanted $50. US, I eventually paid only $15.If you have a potato chip craze be prepared to pay $7 US.Go and have a great time. We did!!Don't bother paying for the VIP package, it is not worth it, just rent a safe in your room and you will be fine.

<Content>Relaxing Vacation I had read numerous negative reviews about this resort but my wife and I wanted to try it anyway. We were there for 4 days/3 nights and we upgraded to VIP when we got there which was well worth it. Without even asking, we were placed into a junior suite which was awesome. We did not care for the buffet but there was always something there we would eat. The beach bars and snack bars were excellent. With the VIP, you get your choice of a meal at 1 of 2 restaurants that others must pay for if you do not go VIP. We chose La Clava and loved it. Very fancy and the food was great. When my wife and I go on vacation without our kids we only want a couple of things. We want a place with a beautiful beach and good drinks. Caribe Club Princess had both of those. This is not a 6 star hotel but I would suggest staying here if you're looking for a nice relaxing vacation with a beautiful beach. The staff is very involved with the tourists and they are very energetic. I read a review before I left that suggested tipping even though it is included in the price. I brought $100.00 USC in singles which went a long way with the maids, waiters/waitresses, and bartenders. I found that when you tip them, they remember who you are, what drinks you want, and how you like them. If I had to give 1 piece of advice, it would be to make sure you tip, even 1 or 2 dollars goes a long way for the locals. Overall, I would recommend this resort....

<Content>Great! Everyone ..this is still a very poor, third-world country. You cannot expect a lot from a 3 star hotel in Caribbean. They are still learning. And what's important, they are trying hard. Caribe Club was great, food was very good, and stuff excellent. Rooms were very clean. We were there 4 days, and had not even one complaint. I am in hotel management myself so I do look at everything with different eyes. I highly recommend it!

<Content>鈥?A Restful Vacation???鈥?#x201d; Caribe Club Princess July 26- August 2, 2006 I traveled to the resort with friends for a restful vacation. I originally stayed at this resort when it first opened under the Hodelpa management. At that time, I felt the resort was impeccable with the exception of the service in main buffet. Waiters used to walk all around you with coffee pots and not wait on you in a timely fashion. While we noticed this again during this trip, we managed to use some our Spanish and got to know some of the wait staff. We also tipped well. This seemed to remedy the problem for the remainder of the trip as we continued to sit where our favorite wait staff was located in the buffet. We loved the service in all of the ala cartes. Even though the resort is under the Princess chain now, they continue to serve Dominican specialties in the buffets which we loved. Other resorts seem to lack that Dominican flair when you look at their bland or greasy buffets geared toward certain nationalities. The food is still very good with plenty of variety but plan on repetition during the course of the week. Repetition was a good thing in this case. Don鈥檛 miss the morning juice bar, the rice and beans, twisted dinner rolls, fried chicken, fried fish, coffee with milk, and lobster night. The two beach snack bars were great. We loved the pizza, crepes and onion rings. The Italian, Dominican and Japanese ala cartes were our favorites. The food was amazing. I would skip the Brazilian which is simply the buffet meats served like appetizers on swords every few minutes. Really strange! We left that one hungry and headed straight for the buffet. We also disliked the Mexican. The sauce tasted like catsup to me.No problems getting reservations each day in our room buildings. We didn鈥檛 try the Gourmet La Cava or the Seafood place and chose to repeat our favorites. BEACH-The beach is still wonderful although the sand seemed tanner than it used to be. The weather was windy and cloudy for the first three days so there was some seagrass in the water. The water is still wavy. The water was great for boogie boarding. Don鈥檛 plan to snorkel on the beach. You will have to book a snorkel tour. We took the Marinarium tour with the sharks and stingrays. Warning!! Skip/Reschedule this tour if it is cloudy and or windy. We had a rough time out there in rough water due to weather. Nothing makes you more nervous than swimming with sharks and stingrays in dark water with no sun. There were plenty of beach chairs and palapas on the resort鈥檚 beach even when we arrived late. ROOM -The room was not without issues on the first day. When I arrived they allowed me to check in immediately without waiting around for hours. However, the toilet was not operational. The television remotes are stored at the front desk and so are the safe keys. I had to return to the front desk in the heat, toting my heavy valuables( documents, cd player, jewelry etc) to get the key and remote. After retrieving the needed items, and returning to the room, I discovered that the previous guest left the removable lock in the safe. I needed to have it removed before I could use the safe. I again returned to the front desk in the heat still toting my valuables. The lobby is about 陆 mile away from the rooms. They handed me a bag of safe keys and told me to try all of the keys and then return the bag of keys to them which required one more trip to the front desk in the heat. Now this was strange VIP service!! They fixed the toilet problem relatively quickly thank goodness. I thought they were going to hand me a plunger. I still lost a couple of hours on this adventure and lost some of my beach day with my friends. I wasn鈥檛 a happy camper on day one. The room was a jr. suite with a view of the pool. It was nice. Maid service was adequate, rum, cigars, fruit platter and VIP nightly turn down mint on the pillow service, which began after day 2 and ended after day 6. I liked the fact that the maids remade the bed and replaced towels when they did the nightly turn down service. I wanted to see them do a better job of getting the sand off of the room floor. It always felt gritty. Resort Appearance 鈥?The resort鈥檚 landscaping was better when it first opened. I was shocked to see a wooden bridge over water at the ala cartes blocked off with red danger tape. The resort grass was completely dead/dry in spots and full of debris( paper, cigarette butts) and rocks. This is not the norm for the DR at all. Ponds are unkempt and brown. Fountains are inoperative. The Dominican music that used to play throughout the mangroves is now inoperative in places. A couple of working speakers blared disco tunes. There were groundskeepers working but they really need to clean up. This resort was gorgeous when it first opened. Landscaping generally improves over time but not in this case. Another Problem- For about 3-4 days of the vacation, the resort which was calm for the first 2 days, filled to capacity with locals and guests from Puerto Rico. These guests took over all three pools and all of the bars. I have heard of this happening at other resorts but never experienced it until this trip. It appeared that entire families with children and extended generations descended upon the resort. We began to wonder what travel deals were available from Puerto Rico and questioned some of the guests. It became a problem because numerous children appeared to be largely unsupervised and continuously jumped into the pools splashing everyone. The also ran, screamed etc. and forced many guests onto the beach. You couldn鈥檛 even reach the swim up bar. The pools were full of loud, drunk people. It was like MTV spring break. Loud behavior could be heard in the hallways at night during this period and I even experienced strange knocks on the door late at night. There are no peep holes in the room doors( a safety concern) so I ignored the knocking. After a few days, this large group of rowdy guests, suddenly departed and a calm was experienced for the final two days of our vacation. ENTERTAINMENT- The entertainment staff is still top notch! They really worked to get everyone involved on the beach and in the available shows. We loved them. The comedy show was hysterical. The dance shows were wonderful and well choreographed. The stage is still the best in Punta Cana with its light and smoke effects. The did preempt shows one night because they brought in a Puerto Rican singing star (coincidentally during the crowded period) in the disco and charged a $10. cover and another night for a disco on the beach. We aren鈥檛 disco people and felt cheated out of two shows.Overall- I had a good vacation with my friends on the beach and enjoyed some great food and service. Unfortunately, the vacation was not as problem free and as restful as I wanted . I hope the Princess resorts works harder to reclaim the luster that this resort once had. It certainly has good bones to build on with decent rooms, food and entertainment. I will certainly return to the DR next year but will continue to search for a new resort to try.

<Content>Wonderful!!! My boyfriend and I stayed at the Caribe Club Princess from 7/706-7/14/06. Our trip was booked through Apple Vacations, which was one of the best things we could do. I read this site for about 2 months before our trip, and I did not know what to expect. Some said it was great, others did not have the luck of others. Our stay was wonderful. From the time we stepped off the plane, to the flight home, we had not one problem. We arrived at the hotel around 10:30, which was a little early considering their check in time is normally 3:00pm. When we arrived we were greated by the Apple representative...Tony.. and the staff at the check in counter. They were all very polite, and welcomed us warmly. As soon as we stepped foot into the lobby our vacation started. We got the VIP package, which was well worth it. We spent the day in the pool, drinking by the pool bar, and when 1:00pm came along, we were able to get into our room. Our room was basic, but nice. One of the junior suites. Great view from the balcony. I read in one travelers review that she brought little makeup down and gave to the maids... GREAT IDEA! I also brough little things down (eye shadow, lipsticks, mascara, etc) and left for the maids with a dollar or two. We had maid service each day, and our mini fridge was stocked the entire time. The people who work for the hotel work for the money, so if they do a good job, they are happy with receiving a dollar or two.  We went to the shows, they were good, the workers in the show work really hard to pull it off, and it shows. The food is ok, we ate mostly at the buffet, which is kind of like going to an Old Country Buffet back here. That is probably the only thing we could some what complain about, and it really was not that bad. The staff tries to get everyone involved with the entertainment, games, etc. The beaches are absolutly BEAUTIFUL! The water is about the same temperature as it is out of the water! Amazing.  We did a few activities outside of the resort, that we booked with the Apple reps. We went on quads on the ocean side (booked through Quadventure). This was great. The scenery was amazing. The tour guide was great, friendly, and showed us a lot. I have never been on a quad, and I drove it myself. It is automatic, and real easy. A little hint, if you decide to go on this, take the 1:00 tour, they make it a little longer since it is the last tour of the day. This was probably the best thing we did. We also went on the two seater speed boats, which then leads to snorkling. Again, this was great. The speedboats were cool, just a little too bumpy (wear sunglasses or you will have water in your eye the entire time). The snorkling was really cool. Our guide was Bito, and he took the most awesome pictures of us snorkling.  Along with the VIP package we received 20 fee massage. It was so good, we got an extra 40 min along with the 20min fee, and then the next day (the night before we left) we got another hour. Well worth it, and it is also beautiful inside the spa.  The weather was wonderful. If it rained, it only rained at night for a little bit. One day it rained during the day, and we stayed in the pool during the rain. Also, try going down to the flea markets. Haggle with them the best you can. One shop offered my boyfriend 10 ciggars for $120, and he got them in another shop for $25. Overall, our stay was wonderful. More than we expected. I suggest if you are going, to keep an open mind, and don't be picky. These people work hard, and it shows. We are already planning a trip back next year!!!P.S. When you get there, try a CoCo Loco~~ They are great!!

<Content>dont drink the water my wife and 2 children stayed at the caribe club princess from july 9-16. the resort is very nice and the beach is gorgeous. we loved the waves and the tiki huts. the pool was a nice spot with a sunken bar but you had to watch what you drank. i noticed that they fill the machines that had pina colodes and the bahama mammas with tap water which you are told not to drink. the food at the resort was okay. you had to just watch what you ate. the restaurant food which i was not allowed to go in because i had nice dress shorts on but people with torn jeans were allowed to get in . it just didnt make any sense. my daughters said the foos was terribile. so most of the time we ate at the buffet. i got sick for two days with the upset stomach and it was i think from the water. my wife also had stomach problems. we went on a excursion to siona island which was very nice. that was an all day affair. we dont think we will go back to punta cana any time soon. some people say the food is good but we didnt see it that way.it is not a cheap island and watch your prices. you need to bargain with them alot. thanks from cape cod massachusetts

<Content>It was good but some flaws My boyfriend and I just returned from the Caribe Club princess on June 28th. First of all I'd like to say we are both easygoing and just want to have a good time- we're not picky. Arrival -there was great, we got in our room early which was nice, the room was nice too. I think they messed up and accidentally put us in a VIP room, but oh well I'm not complaining! Staff- Overall the staff was a lot of fun. They made the trip better. The only thing I noticed was everytime my boyfriend would walk away from me for a second, a staff memeber or someone at the casino would hit on me. It didn't bother me too much, but it was kind of annoying. Oh and hopefully you know Spanish or you'll be in trouble. I knew Spanish pretty well so I had fun talking to them, but a lot of them didn't speak English at all.Beach- The beach was great! I had so much fun. We didn't have any troubles finding chairs or shade. There were decent sized waves, which I liked a lot, but some people didn'lt like it. There was lots of things to do, kayak, boogie board, and my favorite Banana boat- definately try that! Pools- They were all nice, we spent most of the time at the beach though. The only thing is you can't ever get a space at the swim up bar. Food- This is what made the trip not the best for my boyfriend and I. I read a lot of people saying on the reviews that the food was bad, but I thought they were being picky and annoying. Well, they were right it was pretty much awful. The buffet was okay because you could always find one thing you liked and live off that for the time, but all the food was barely warm. We only found one restaurant we liked, the brazillian. Everything else just doesn't taste good, the meat doesn't taste like U.S meat. Needless to say, I was sick about 4 of the 7 days we were there. I think it was from the food, that made my trip not the best too. Luckily my boyfriend and I didn't get bent out of shape about the food and just filled up on drinks! Drinks- They were all pretty good, but sometimes they gave you the strongest drinks or a different drink then you asked for, not a big deal though because you can just dump it out. We also did the Safari exursion, which was alright, but it poured the whole day non- stop. It probably would of been a lot of fun if it weren't for the rain. Thats about it, we probably had the most fun at the casino and lobby at night- quite the party. Overall we had a good time, but we probably wouldn't come back.

<Content>Caribe Club Princess is a Great Place Our family just returned from Caribe Club. It exceeded our expectations!The facility overall is very good. Some minor flaws with rooms but no big deal.The food was great, the beach was great, the ocean is beautiful, the drinks were great especially the coco locos, the staff was very friendly.The buffet was very good and there is not really a need to eat any where else. We did not go VIP and had enoughdrinks and food to satisfy us and our two teenagers.The grounds are very clean and well kept. We saw different creatures and small birds and animals everyday on the short walk from our room to the main lobby building.The Animacion Entertainment staff is very friendly and say hello to Jose Louis for us. We met people who were staying at other resorts and they were disappointed in the on site activities. Animacion keeps this resort fun and active.We would return to this resort without hesitation. Don鈥檛 worry-be happy here! We were!

<Content>Beautiful resort We just returned from a 7 night all inclusive vip package. Well worth the money. The grounds are very beautiful. We arrived at the hotel around 11:00am ,We were in the rooms by noon,which was great because check in is 3:00pm. They have shuttles that take you from the pool area to the lobby, theater,shops. The rooms very nice, we had a suite , king bed and step down area to sofa bed and table and chairs. Maid service was excellent, our room was cleaned and fridge was stocked by 10:00amevery day. There are 3 pools , main pool was whereall the acitivites are, the other two pools very nice ,quiet . We had no problem getting huts at the pool . Beach was nice , went boogie boarding , alot of fun, good waves.We have stayed at 2 other resorts in punta cana ,so we have something to compare this visit too. The speciality Restaurants are the best I've ever eaten in. We had Lobster, Beef filet all excellent. The buffet was not that good, needed more variety. We usually like the buffets for breakfast but we were disappointed with soggy bacon runny scrambled eggs,hardly ever any orange juice. The water sports guy didn't seem to want to let you do any of the things that were included, The water bike was broken (he said) It didn't look broken, just alot of trouble to push you out over the waves. We walked down the beach and watched the guys pushing out people on the water bike atthe other hotel (paradisus). There was always an excuse when we wanted to try something, so we gave up.The shows at night were good, The drinks we good. The had archery,ping pong,pool tables etc. mini golf always something to do. The tours were fun we did the snorkeling with nurse sharks and sting rays (they were big sharks rays, my husband and 12 yr old son went on the dune buggy tour. GREAT FUN. The koni tiki party boat was fun too.This was a great vacation overall , just needs improvements in the buffet and water sports center

<Content>Nice place to visit. I just got back from a stay at the Caribe Club in Punta Cana. This place is very very big and the grounds are very nice. The rooms do need some work and the buffet could be better. The beach is not the nicest beach I have ever seen, but the pool is pretty cool. The staff is helpfull most of the time, but some of the girls in the group thought that the men that worked there were alittle TOO FRIENDLY. The activities at the hotel are fun to watch and be part of once in a while, my only complaints on this are that the banana boat is more like a kiddie ride and the shows arent broadway. Food... the food as I mentioned before, could be alot better and safer I have been sick for three days now and I am still not sure what it was I ate, because I was sure to avoid the water and Ice. But overall, it is a good place and just beware of what you eat and what you do that the disco, it can get a bit rough.

<Content>Great relaxing vacation Our two couples went to Punta Cana and stayed here late May 2006. The resort was wonderful. Grounds were beautiful and staff was SO NICE. The suite was average but very clean and maid service kept up with our every need. The VIP package was worth it-- though keep in mind Snorkeling is NOT included-- only the equipment. Everything else VIP was great. Restaurants were good except Mexican(go figure), especially Brazilian and La Cava (incl. for VIP only). We ate at the buffet every morning and for snacks and they had a great selection. There are 3 pools, all beautiful and clean, with 2 bar/snack bars close by them. They have plenty of activities on site like mini golf, archery, ping pong, etc. They also have shows each night at the theater which were very nice. We did not go to the disco. Not much night life other than that. Dance lessons and activities during the day by the pool. We chose excursions to the Marinarium for snorkeling which was a GREAT time, and the Safari tour which was just as great. We heard plenty of horror stories from other people staying elsewhere on our flight home, and all we could say was that our hotel was Fantastic!!!!! I'd definitely stay at this hotel again if we ever go back.

<Content>Mediocre We travelled to the Caribe Club Princess from April 21st - April 28th. The resort is beautiful. The grounds are very well maintained (except minature golf) and the beach is phenomenal. We travelled with our 2 children ages 3 and 5. Our youngest was too young for the Kids Club and we chose not to use the Kids Club for our oldest because most of the other kids did not speak English. My kids had a great time just playing at the beach in the morning and early afternoon and then making their way to the pool in the late afternoon. All of the pools were beautiful with zero entry. The food was mediocre. We tried to never eat at the buffet - everything tasted the same. I was extremely disappointed with the buffet - even breakfast - the bacon was always shredded or crumbled. The omelettes didn't even have much taste. By the end of the week, we were eating croissants with jelly and some of the homemade juices - they were very good. The ala cartes weren't bad. We tried the Italian, Chinese (the best in our opinion), La Cava Steak House, and the Mexican. The were all decent. The food at the resort was overall disappointing. Since my husband and I were travelling with our children, we looked forward to our relaxing dinners and the food was just OK. I had read that many times on Tripadvisor and thought how bad could it be - we aren't picky people - the food was exactly as people on this website described it - not very good. We had the VIP package mostly for the bigger suite size room - which was nice and very clean. We tipped our maid daily plus left small gifts (lipstick, etc.) She always gave us what we asked for. We would leave her little notes (in Spanish, of course) and she always got us what we needed. I knew there would be no wash cloths, so we brought some from home. In our 4th night of our 7 night stay, the night maid came to our room for turn down service after we had left the room to go to the show. We did not have turn down service any other night that week. Unfortunately, when we left for the show, we forgot to pull the key out of the safe and our closet door was open so the maid could clearly see that the key was still in the safe. We did not notice until the next morning that our envelope with half of our cash (approx $100) was gone. We reported it as soon as we realized. We felt we were given the run around. The security manager felt as though this particular maid would not have stolen the money because she was just promoted to VIP service and did not have prior complaints against her. However, they checked the log of key cards entering our room, and she was the only one to enter after we left. We were told by the Guest Services Manager that when a staff member enters a room and sees the safe open or the key left, they are to call Security immediately and not enter the room. This obviously did not happen in our case because our beds were turned down. The ultimate result - we were told the maid was fired even though she never admitted to taking the money. I am not so sure she was fired. The hotel made no good will effort to try to compensate for our loss - they could have offered us $20 in free pictures or a coupon for a massage - they did nothing. I was angry and started telling people around the pool about our experience to let them know to be careful with their valuables and you wouldn't believe how many people had already experienced what we had. Shirts, DVD's, jewelry stolen. It was an epidemic there so if you already have this resort booked - be very careful with your belongings!! Even though we had this bad experience, the beaches were beautiful and our children had a wonderful time. I will definitely return to Punta Cana but not to this resort.

<Content>Families with kids: awesome We stayed at the CCP from April 16 to 30. For a better understanding of this review please take note of our profile: we go south for the beach, relaxation, sports and activities and not having to make any meals for the family. We do not go south for excursions, historic sites or for discovering the way of life of the natives. Generally, we were very pleased with our stay. This hotel is on perfect key with its rating: 4陆 stars. AIRPORT: Quickly processed upon arrival, no fuss with the departure.ROOM: Very large rooms that can easily accommodate one King bed (or two twin size beds) and two kids single beds. Was clean all the time and when we had the beginning of an invasion of hornig (ants), the maid repulsed them with a magical spray. Haven鈥檛 seem them thereafter.FOOD: This is always a tricky review because it depends on people鈥檚 tastes and adaptability to novelties. We are not fussy. The food was good at the buffet but not great. There was a lot a variety and, for the insecure, there is pasta, fries and meat and potatoes. In the 鈥溍?la carte鈥?restaurants, the food is great. The wine is of dubious quality especially the white wine that tastes more like Welch. To reserve for the restaurants you need to wait in line for at least half and hour in the morning, or to use your persuasion powers to get in at night when you see that they obviously under booked. Be careful, do not barge in with your dollars and with an attitude. Be comprehensive and resolved and after a choreography of-we-will-try-to-do-something, they will let you in.BEACH: You have to be more than an early bird to reserve a palapa. I don鈥檛 know if people are reserving them on their way back from the disco at 4:00A.M.!!! Anyways, there is none left at 7:00 A.M. After reserving, people went back to sleep or they went for a walk. Management tells us that if a person is not back after half an hour, you can ask the security to remove their belongings and take their place鈥?Surely a nice way to make friends!!! Nevertheless, we brought our own beach umbrella and never had to worry about the shade. The beach is clean, waves could be very nice on certain days (perfect for boogie boarding) and you can walk for more than two hours on either sides of the beach. Just a little comment for some pigs: the beach is not a gigantic ashtray, so for the smokers please pick up your butts.POOL: Irreproachable. The swim up bar is effective.HOTEL: The lobby is huge, impressive and open. The gardens are very nice and peacocks, ducks, some kind of roadrunners and a rooster are wandering freely around. The buildings are beautifully designed with interior gardens. They are also very colourful. SERVICE: Tipping is definitely making the employees happier. Just a dollar here and there is sufficient. We always had a quick answer to our demands. Tipping was not a prerequisite. I noticed that there are two kinds of people that gave tips: the heavy and early tipper that tells every employee to remember them (they make me puke). Or, the tipper that rewards good service after it was rendered. All the members of the personnel were friendly and caring. Try a word of Spanish here and there and they will appreciate.BARS:They have a limited choice of drinks. However, sufficient for a cerveza drinker!!! I noticed that impoliteness had no borders. There are many people that don鈥檛 notice if you were there before them and quickly shout their order to the barman. Had to remind some folks of elementary rules of etiquette.ACTIVITIES:The team is quite good. They will leave you alone if you want to stay quiet or they will integrate you in any of the activities you want to participate.MINI-CLUB AND MINI-DISCO: Simply the best entertainment I have seen for kids 6-10.

<Content>I cant wait to go back!!!!!!!! I just got back to the states yesterday and i am seriously depressed! I had the time of my life at the caribe club and i am already planning a trip back! I would start by saying that the treatment we recieved was nothing like in the usa. No attitudes, no eye rolling. They only wanted to make us happy and thats important! There were times when we didnt even tip and they were still so friendly to us! The food was soso, i am not a big food person so that didnt bother me in the least. The entertainment staff was awesome- those guys and girls get you involved and make you laugh! I rathered staying at the pool then go to the beach because i didnt want to miss any of the action! I had dance lessons, played darts, and did the aqua gym! It was nice to be friendly with them as well and by the end of the trip i felt like i was leaving friends! The lobby parties at night were great also! The staff once again always tried to get people up and dancing! Those guys work so hard and yet they always had a smile on their faces. I felt the resort offered a lot and you dont even really need to leave it unless you choose to! Its definatley not a place to go and party it up and go wild- its more relaxing and enjoyable! I had such a wonderful time and i was so pleased that i am actually looking forward to going back soon!

<Content>Great time! We stayed at this resort for two weeks and had a wonderful time. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable. They went out of their way to make sure we were accomodated and to speak English. The food was great and we had the opportunity to eat at all the restaurnants. We participated in a lot of activites and enjoyed all of them - scub diving, kayaking, boogie boarding, salsa dancing, Spanish lessons, the bike tour, beach volleyball, water polo, water volleyball, darts and archery. We also attended most of the shows. The Comedy show was a definite highlight that I would recommend. Dancing in the evening at the lobby or at the beach was also a great time! Highly recommended.

<Content>Caribe Club Very Nice But some drawbacks too! We visited the CCP from April 29-May 6 with our two children 8 and 11. Flight with Westjet was fine. Resort checkin was ok, we got there 11am in the morning and room was not ready until 3:30pm. When got room, was on bottom floor and not cot as requested. Desk advised booked for that night and come back next day for another room. Had to go to the Desk 3 times before they understood about cot!Thought we wanted a crib for our 11yr old. Finally, full single bed arrived which was better than a cot. Stayed in room for this reason and had no bug problems, water problems, etc in room. No wash cloths. I brought my own. Kids only went to Mini Disco couple nights as it started at 8:30pm and we were all tired. Also, did not wait up for Adult shows which started at 9:45pm. Too long to wait after dinner. P.S. Safe fee was $24US with tax.Beach was great and fairly windy but no problems. Went kayaking. Catamaran you must drive yourself or go on tour. Driver not included in AL unless VIP. Daughter got total head braided by beach spa staff. bartered and got it done for $30US. All 3 pools were great. 3 pool over at Tropical was nice but has palms, etc over it so debris gets in pool. Shopping- Walked left down the beach and went to the markets. Did some hard bartering there. Got windchime (bamboo $15) and some other things. Vendors come to resort on some nights. Got mahogany carving from vendor. Watch prices. They started at $175US and we got it down to $40US after walking away. Also walked out resort and to the left passed casino and to Bavaro Shopping. Got a few things there as well. Tours-Went on Bavaro Runners Tour- $80US per Adult and $40US per Child. Good tour, had gone before but wanted to take kids this time. Took things to the door of a school. Different ranch than last time. Better with horsebacking riding on the beach. Resort- Very clean and people friendly. Staff always working hard. We left gifts and money for maid. Buffet was good, but after 1 week was ready for our food. The big thing we were disappointed in was the A La Carte Restaurants. The restaurants are near the vacinity of the main buffet and they all run off of that for at least a portion of your meals. We went to the Dominican (terrible) Brazilian (good-lots of meat though), Italian(good-get friend ice cream) and Chinese (good). In every restaurant, either you starter (salads, etc would be stuff you had in the buffet already). Also, same for most of the desserts. Also the Italian, the pasta was the same they had in the buffet (pasta section, which they cook in front of you daily if you like). I know this is very long, but wanted to give you as much as possible. Any questions? Feel free. We had a great family vacation, nice resort. Would we revisit this resort? Not if going to the Restaurants, which is half the fun. This was our 2nd trip to Punta Cana. Our kids loved it this time and want to go back but will choose another resort next time.

<Content>Enjoyed the Caribe My husband and I booked the Caribe Club Princess from May 5-12th. The one and only complaint we had was the food. The buffet had many selections, but nothing had flavor and it seemed to cater to European types of food. Breakfast was probably the best of the meals. Even the specialty restaurants were just OK. Otherwise, the staff, grounds, beach and entertainment were wonderful. We had three beautiful pools to choose from and delicious drinks all day and evening long! We did not upgrade to the VIP package and were not disappointed with the local alcohol choices. We were glad we did not waste the money. We went on the outback safari and really enjoyed the day...worth the money. The Kon Tiki party boat excursion, we felt was a waste of money. We snorkeled but with at least 50 other people. Very crowded in the water. The weather was beautiful even though on the website that we checked daily said no sunshine and had only gray clouds with lightening bolts through them. It rained only one day. If you don't mind just OK food choices, this stay was otherwise wonderful!

<Content>Nice, BUTT.......... My husband and I go away every year. This was our third time to Punta Cana. we had two other couple join us from April 21 through April 28. I will start off by saying vacation is what you make of it. We had read several of the reviews on Trip Advisor before leaving for vacation and I must say I was a little nervous... The resort itself was very clean and well kept. Our rooms were standard, we didn't really care if we had an ocean view. How much time do you really spend in the room?!? (unless ofcourse you're on your honeymoon) The beaches were very nice, a little windy. We did the snorkel trip from the resort for $20.00, well worth it!!! We saw plenty of fish and Richard our captain was right in the water with us to show us the hotspots. The restaurants were great going down.... butt (no punn intended) bring plenty of Pepto. I highly recommend Mama Mias, Mexican, and Japanese. We didn't have the VIP package and paid extra to eat at La Cava we felt it was over rated and the service was poor. We took care of the waitstaff at all of the restaurants and bars and they definately took care of us! A few bucks goes a long way... Two of the six of us had to go on antibiotics upon our return to the US. My husband still hasn't been back to work as of 5/10/06. The rest of us bounced back. The stomach thing did cause us to have a few early nights but didn't ruin our vacation. Just be prepared!!There have been alot of negative reviews regarding the language barriers. Yes this is a spanish speaking country so freshen up!! Don't expect them to understand everything you say! My highschool spanish teacher would be very proud of my ability to communicate with the staff at the hotel. It was fun trying to dialect with the staff and found them to be extremley friendly and eager to please. They were all wonderful!!!Be sure to visit Isidro at the Beach Bar, he is so much fun!!!  Oh and beware of the Mamajuana, it creeps up on you!!I would recommend this resort but just be prepared for stomach related illnesses, I may even recommend packing your own bottled water from home to drink during your stay. Who knows what it is that makes you sick?!??Enjoy you stay!

<Content>Nice Place Needs fine tunning. Lets start with the language barriers. If you have some spanish it will help greatly. The room we had was a suite. Very nice and clean, spacious, but you need to keep 1 door key in a little box on the wall to keep the power on in your room. It took us about a half a day to figure why the alarm clock, refer, and ac was off. Their are no elevators and their is 3 floors. So if you can't do stairs ask for a 1st floor. Food was ok. What ever is supposed to be hot is warm or cold,and if is supposed to be cold it's warm. La Cava rest. Had bad meat. Others had good meat. Luck of the draw. Mexican, Chinese, Brazillian were very good. Buffet was ok. Lots of choices. The wine soso. The beer Presidente was really good. Had great sevice at the pool bar. The bartender was Smelin. He was great. Pools were very nice. The beach was very nice  clean. The Pina coladas, PiPi's  CocoLoco's were very good. Shopping was fun. You need to barter with them. They start 3 times higher then the real price so don't give up.The staff very friendly and lively. Shows ok but a bit much for younger eyes sometimes. Topples is all over you just deal with it. Overall nice place. We spent 10 days their. We didn't get sick but if you keep highdrated with water in between your drinks it will help. Use sunscreen 30 or higher it's hot. A little tip on saving chairs.Get up by 6 or 7 am and take your towels or beach bag and put them on the chairs. They Love hard candy and any Red sox or Yankees stuff. This is great for tipping. Bring a lot of ones for tips.

<Content>Awfullllll The island is beautiful and the beach was nice, but, the resort itself was awful. Most of the specialty restaurants were either never open or (as explained in very broken english) BROKE. We questioned this and never got the same answer twice. It was always at least five to ten minutes before we could get a drink. The buffet food was always the same. Usually the left overs from the night before mixed with a new ingredient. The staff was nice but very slow and always seemed to be confused. The room was very clean but came with major problems as well. The beds are lumpy, the toilet seat fell completely off. When the toilet was flushed, water poured out the handle. The tv had to warm up for ten minutes before anything was visible. Would not go back ever again.

<Content>Great time I just got back from here, we traveled with a group of 8 and everyone had a wonderful time. The beach is beautiful. The hotel and grounds was beautiful and the staff and people are very friendly and hard working and try hard to make you happy. The food was good for the most part, the pineapple was great. We ate in all the restaurants and enjoyed them all except for the italian ( service and food was to slow in coming) they are definitly worth waiting in line for but get up early because they book fast.We went on the jungle safari and the marinarium tours and enjoyed them both. The safari was a long day but saw the country side and had agreat lunch and loved the boogie boarding. the marinarium was awesome to swim with the sharks and sting rays and the boat ride back the music is playing and people are dancing and having fun. They make a coco loco drink for everyone and hand out fresh cocounut, pineapple and sandwiches. This tour was a half day and just the right amount of time. My friend and i had a massage and this was very relaxing. At night we enjoyed going up tho the lobby and watching everyone dance or they had a singer one night. from 11-12 this place was alot of fun. Our girls went to the disco at night and enjoyed this too. I would definatly go back here remember to just go with the flow and relax and you will have a great time.

<Content>every bit a 4 star!!!! My husband and I stayed from 4/13/2006 to 4/20/2006. We have traveled for several years to different places in the Caribbean. This resort is busy, with children. I've read these reviews every weekend for two months before we left. First of all there is alwayssomething to eat that taste very acceptable. There is buttered potatoes(almost every morning,'lunch supper).bananas,watermelon,canalope(every m,l,s).Eggs fried to your liking.pasta to your liking(alfedo,meat,or maranade) french fries lunch  supper. Buttered carrots at least lunch or supper.Packaged yougart.In other words if you cant find something to eat there you probably should have keep your self on your own soil.Mydealing with staff was above average compared to my 2001 visit to the Casa Del Mar onthe LAROMANA side of the Island.The beach was BEAUTIFUL!! little sea weed of some sort,but nothing awful, Resorts down the beach had a lot more(a lot more)thenthe Caribe Princess.The biggest pool with the swim up bar was very crowded  noisey.But not unbarable!!I If you can't tolerate children then spend that extra $1000.00 or more and go!!ve got grandchildren so children don't bother me you can always move whereDENNIS THE MENISE IS NOT.There was times when I thoughtthat they needed to pick up the straws and plastic cups a little better,clean the mirrors  hand prints more often.BUT i remember feeling that at times at home.I could go on and onbut i wont. I just wanted you to know that I purchased a 4 star package and I feel thatI got that and then some.I will come back to this resort at some time and as long as it is what it is now then I will every much enjoy my stay!!!!!!!!!

<Content>not a 5 star, but great place One thing to remember is that you are going to an underdeveloped country, with limited resources. Do not expect gourmet meals, and big city service. The staff was wonderful, everyone more than willing to help out and serve to the best of their ability. Our room was kept extremely clean, the wait staff very courteous and personable. Converse in Spanish, even if it is very limited, they appreciate it and get a good laugh at your translations. Most everyone speaks some level of English, but it is not the primary language of the island so don't be surprised. The food was adequate, be sure you get a good breakfast in the morning. The reservation system for your evening meal was a hastle, you can only book two days in advance for the theme restaurants, so be ready to stand in line every morning if you want something other than the buffet. All the food is prepared from the same kitchen, so again, if you do not have high expectations when you go in, you will not be disappointed. The Italian seemed to be the most popular, we did not dine at the upcharge restaurants as everyone we spoke with who did said not to waste the money. The beaches were the most beautiful I have ever seen! We heard of frequent water and power outages, but only had one brief experience of that in the eight days that we were there. All in all, a great place to go and just RELAX!

<Content>Holiday in the sun I must say I read just about every review I could find of this hotel and knew I would have a wonderful time based on what I read and the pictures I saw. Let's start with the positives. The setting at this resort was just beautiful. The beach was just wonderful with its white sand and clear blue water. The pools were very well maintained, had lots of activities and had just the right temperature. The landscaping is beautifully done, and the grounds include peacocks, koi, turtles, etc. There was plenty of food to be had by all. The resort offers a main buffet as well as numerous a la carte restaurants. I highly recommend the Chinese, Brazilian and Italian. We did not eat at the Steak or Seafood restaurant (more on that later). The buffet was fine, and like others has written, has something on it for everyone. I highly recommend a visit to the spa. They had many services to offer at reasonable (for a spa) prices. There weren't too many negatives. The beds in our room were of pretty pour quality, but we managed just fine. I would avoid the shows. One of the musicals we went to see had the performers lip-sync the same song in four different languages. The service is a bit slow so be prepared to be patient. HELPFUL HINTS: This is the most important part of the review. 1) Hopefully someone you're traveling with is an early riser. You need to be out at the beach or pool at about 6am to reserve a good spot. By about 8am, all the chairs have been reserved. Additionally, you have to reserve your a la carte restaurant reservations starting at 8:30 am. People show up as early as 7am to wait in line. If you end up towards the back of line, odds are you won't get the restaurant you want and/or will be eating at 9pm. Also, it is important to note that the reservation you make is for the NEXT night. The day you arrive, try to make a reservation that day. Otherwise, you're stuck with the buffet for the first two nights. 2) Bring everything you need. Do not forget sunscreen, aloe, zinc, chips, snacks, etc. If you do, the hotel gift shop will charge you more than you ever imagined. My wife bought a tube of aloe and zinc for $39!!! 3) VIP --whether or not this is worth it depends on who you're traveling with. Unless your companions drink lots of premium booze daily, it's probably not worth the extra cost (I believe it's about $300 extra a person) You also get a 20 min message, 3 cigars, a bottle of rum, and you get one night in the steak or seafood restaurant. If you are not VIP, the steak or seafood restaurant costs $31/person (kids too) and another 26% for the hotel fee. I'm told the steak restaurant was the better choice. Overall, my family and I has a wonderful time. They have a kids club where you can drop off your little one for most of the day. My son had a blast when he went. If you are not used to the Caribbean sun, protect yourself with plenty of sun screen; you will burn easy, especially on an overcast day. Please feel free to e-mail me with any questions.

<Content>Great Place, Bad food Great rooms, clean, nice gardens, nice pools, very nice beach. Food is so-so, the wine is very bad (taste like vinegar) Wine on the menu are expensive and bad. The music is loud and annoying at times (at the pool on the caribe side). It is somewhat quieter on the tropical side. Rooms 1358-1363 has nice oceanviews. Beach  room towels are worn. Get up early (6:00 AM) to grab a beach chair/palapa. Same for some pools. People will leave a towel on the chair for half a day before showing up.Get up early (7:45 AM) to reserve a a la carte restaurant EVERY SINGLE DAY!Do not choose this resort based on foodwine quality.

<Content>Beautiful...but very busy. Even though I鈥檓 giving the Caribe Club Princess a 3 star rating does not mean this is a bad review. My review is more like a 3+ star. We did like the Caribe Club! We booked the Caribe Club Princess through TNT Vacations (tntvacations) about 4 weeks before departure. We got a GREAT price and were upgraded to the honeymoon suite since it was our 5 year wedding anniversary. We didn鈥檛 know until we got there that VIP was also included with the honeymoon suite 鈥?we were pleasantly surprised. On a side note, TNT was GREAT! They were wonderfully helpful. The onsite rep Primi was superb. The flights were great and both on time. We do recommend TNT Vacations out of Boston, MA!Arrival:Upon arrival at Caribe Club you see this large open air, thatched roof lobby with a nice bar. Well landscaped, clean, and friendly faces to greet you! It was after 3pm when we arrived and our room was not yet ready. So they directed us to the bar and we waited 2 hours. We made the best of it 鈥?and got a good buzz going. Once our room was ready a wonderful woman names Santa (yes, santa) rode the shuttle with us and walked us up to our room. She said they had us wait because we had emailed them the week before about getting an ocean view 鈥?and they wanted to make sure we got it. Room:We were so happy. We had a complete ocean view from our Jacuzzi and a pool/ocean view from the balcony. It was worth the wait. The room was ok 鈥?nothing special 鈥?except for the VIEW! Room was stocked with beer, soda and water everyday. We also had a fresh fruit platter delivered almost everyday in the afternoon, it was a wonderful snack.Food/Buffet:We got over to the buffet as it was opening and were delighted with the meal. Service was great. As soon as we sat down they brought us water and a beer. Loved the fish, mussels and calamari. We went to bed very happy on our first night. As the week went on we got to the buffet about 30 minutes to 1 hour after it opened and the place was packed. Before when we arrived just as it opened the service was great. But later on in the meals it was horrible. The people working were wonderful, and when you got service it was great. But they were so understaffed in the buffet it was frustrating. For almost every meal I had to go to the wait station and get our own water. Sometimes we didn鈥檛 even get a drink with the meal. But the food overall at the Buffet was good to very good 鈥?we always found something good to eat.Food/Specialty Restaurants:Mid way through our stay we decided to try El Pescador for our anniversary. We got to the lobby of our building at 7:30am to reserve our dinner with the concierge and the line slowly formed. One hour later the concierge arrived and there were about 30 of us waiting. We were the first there and this man cut right in front of us and made a reservation. Then another man did it and the concierge said nothing. Then my husband spoke up and said, 鈥淗ey buddy, we鈥檙e next鈥? Thought there was going to be a fight. We made the reservation and went on our way. Two hours later there was still a line there. It was crazy! So we didn鈥檛 make another reservation that week because it was such a hassle. Every time we walked by there was a long line. The meal at El Pescador was good 鈥?but we liked the Buffet better, probably just because there was more choice.The last two days we were there a friend we met invited us to the Chinese restaurant one night and La Cava the next, we jumped at the opportunity. The Chinese meal was great and quick. Service was perfect. We were very happy with the meal. My husband even tried sushi and liked it! La Cava wasn鈥檛 what we had hoped. We sat for almost 1 hour before even placing an order or getting a glass of wine. Then 2.5 hours later we still hadn鈥檛 gotten our desert and we tried to flag someone down to see if we could leave but we couldn鈥檛 get anyone. So we walked out. My meal was so good (snapper), my husbands wasn鈥檛 edible (steak). We ended up sharing my meal 鈥?which was ok because the portion was big enough for two. Then around 11:30 we were in bed and asleep and they called us asking us to come down and sign for the meal. We couldn鈥檛 believe they would call us at 11:30 at night.Beach:Beach is gorgeous!!!! Water is warm and so much fun to swim in. Sand is soft in and out of the water. This beach is the most beautiful we have ever seen鈥e loved it!! The only problem with the beach was the shortage of chairs and other guests attitudes. We noticed from our room the first morning we awoke that all the chairs were being claimed. So we rushed down at 7:30 to claim ours under the shade. We went to breakfast and came back and found one chair and towel gone. By that time all the other chairs in the shade were gone. So we had to get another towel (luckily our honeymoon suite comes with beach towels in the room or according to our TNT rep, we would have had to pay $20 to replace it!!!). But we enjoyed drinking out of our BubbaKegs and really enjoyed the perfect weather. The following day we claimed chairs again and another chair was taken. This time the woman was sitting right in it. I asked her about and she spoke back in French and then looked the other way. She was so rude. So the whole ordeal on the beach was starting to get old鈥ast. My last gripe with the beach chairs was later in the week we went for a swim only to return and find that someone had pushed our chairs into the sun and put their own three chairs under our shade! They were not sitting in their chairs so my husband pushed theirs out and ours back in. When these people returned they wouldn鈥檛 even look us in the eye. It鈥檚 amazing how when some people are away from home they check their manners at the door. This is the first resort where we have had to save chairs. Shade on the beach was like gold. It would be nice if somehow they could get more chairs and a bit more shade 鈥?then there wouldn鈥檛 be such a battle everyday. The beach was very crowded and walking up the beach was nice but so many people were walking you had to dodge people all the time. The music at our resort was so loud! When they gave the music a break it was so nice. We loved the beach but it was over crowed and very busy鈥ome really like that but we like a quiet beach. So, if we return to Punta Cana we will research a bit more and find a resort on a quiet part of the beach.We loved the beach, loved every person we met working there, the food for the most part was very good, the rooms were ok (our view was spectacular), we all stayed healthy 鈥搉ot a sick one in the bunch, and we met some friends I鈥檓 sure we鈥檒l have for life.A lot of the downside was lack of staff, lack of beach chairs, loud music all day at the pool, a poor method to sign people up for dinner and some rude guests (which is no fault of Caribe Club).So you can see the good definitely out weighs the bad here. We are very glad we went to Caribe Club. We did enjoy ourselves but we won鈥檛 be back. If the price was right I would recommend it to a friend.I hope I didn鈥檛 discourage anyone from going to Caribe Club because it is worth a visit. We meet some on the plane ride home who did not run into the problems we had. In fact they are planning on going back again this fall. They adore the place! It is my own fault for not researching this place enough. It鈥檚 perfect for so many people, just not for us. Next time I will look for a place that is a bit quieter, set more in the mountains (like Puerto Plata or Jamaica), and find out the beach chair situation ahead of time. But I would like to take that beach home! What a beauty!Happy Travels All!Ash

<Content>Our time at the Caribe Club Princess My Husband and I went to Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, March 26 through April 2, 2006. We stayed at the Caribe Club Princess. We went through TNT vacations. We were pleased with TNT per se. When we arrived at Boston, there was a TNT rep there that passed out our Tourist cards ($10 otherwise when you arrive at Punta Cana). Also included was a $20 departure tax. We never received a voucher or anything, just nothing was ever mentioned of it when we left. Be advised that the picture they take of you when you first enter the airport in Punta Cana will be for sale for $7 when you leave, so look for the area selling the photos on your departure.  The morning of our second day there we had a meeting with our TNT rep. It is very important you go to this. Make a list of all your questions and be sure to ask him. He/She is a good resource. We scheduled two tours through him: Santo Domingo and Saona Catamaran. These were in the $80 per person range. Have your VISA with you to pay. I wouldn鈥檛 recommend the Santo Domingo trip. It is about a 4 陆 hour bus ride both ways. The ride itself was an experience. The roads and drivers are terrible. The trip didn鈥檛 really show the best parts of Santo Domingo. It took us to a memorial to Christopher Columbus where his remains are 鈥渟upposedly鈥?in this guarded 鈥渃asket鈥? We went to a church and through the house where his son and daughter in law lived. Then we had 1 陆 hours to shop, which was way too long! We went to a buffet for lunch at a local place that was pretty good. It was a LONG day. If you reserve a restaurant for that night, make it for the 8:00 or later time! The Saona Catamaran trip would have been better had the conditions been better. The TNT rep had told us it was an hour bus ride, but it was two. It wasn鈥檛 good weather to start, cold and windy. We took the catamaran to the island, which was the best part. The island was beautiful and we had a nice buffet there as well. Then began the speed boat trip back to the bus for the trip home!! The motors wouldn鈥檛 start. After several changes, we made it back to the bus. There is a shallow area in the ocean for swimming and seeing starfish. Everyone was so cold and it was so late, that no one wanted to get out of the boat. One of the Dominicans jumped in and found some star fish. So we did see the starfish. . The conditions were deplorable where we were supposed to change and go to the bathroom. I know it is 3rd world, but this was awful. It was a real challenge trying to change and not let anything touch the floor!! So another long day!! Some people we met went on the Bavaro Runner and said it was awesome, worth twice the price.The Caribe Club Princess was a very nice resort. Our room looked out to the ocean and pool. It was quite most of the time. One time there was no water for a short period. You could go about a 20 minute walk down the beach to a flea market. They weren鈥檛 too pushy there, but you have to offer half of what they ask. This resort is also within walking distance into Bavaro, a small tourist town. By contrast they are VERY pushy and you really have to watch what you鈥檙e doing. We felt safe walking there. It was about a 20-25 min walk.  We got the VIP package. I highly recommend it. Included in it is: Safe key (if you don鈥檛 get the VIP, I highly recommend paying $20 for the key. It鈥檚 good peace of mind), beach towels, small bottle of rum, use of bathrobes during the stay, eating at all the restaurants for nothing and an included meal at one of the 2 gourmet restaurants which would be about $30 each plus tax. There is also included a motorized water sport, 20 min massage, upper shelf liquor, and 3 cigars, and some internet time. If you don鈥檛 have the VIP package, you have to pay $8 per person for the other restaurants 鈥?Mexican, Italian, Chinese, Brazilian and Dominican. We chose the fish one for our gourmet one and really liked it. The other option was a steak restaurant. The buffet really gets old very quickly. It is okay for breakfast as they do 鈥渙melets鈥?and there鈥檚 cereal, toast, peanut butter, etc. For lunches, there are several little places having lunch or the buffet is there as well. We avoided it for dinner. We learned that if you don鈥檛 get to reserve your restaurant in time, you can go and if someone doesn鈥檛 show, they will seat you. Every time we went there were empty seats, so this is really worth a try, given the option of the buffet! We were able to reserve all but one night. If you are going on an excursion, they will let you reserve a night ahead.As far as not getting sick, I don鈥檛 have any suggestions. My husband and I avoided salads and tap water (hint here, as soon as you are in your room, put a water bottle next to the faucet to remind you to NOT drink or brush your teeth with the water). We both got sick. His was gone in 2 days, mine longer. I really felt badly just one day. You just need to be aware of where the bathrooms are!! However, it did cut into my beer consumption!! The El Presidente beer was really good. The people next to me on the way home had been sick as well. We got Hepatitis A immunization, but didn鈥檛 take malaria pills. Got some small bites but never felt the need to use bug spray. Really didn鈥檛 see many bugs. Some things to be sure to take: 50+ single dollars for tipping, sunscreen, a hat, imodium, pepto bismol tablets, Tylenol, bug spray with deet. You don鈥檛 need to change any money into Dominican pesos. Everyone takes US $$. In tourist places along the way on the excursions, they do the exchanging right there. We have verizon cell phones, and they worked fine, but you will pay roaming fees. We left the maid a couple of dollars every day. Never saw her, so don鈥檛 know if it made a difference. We always had towels and what we needed. Now that I鈥檝e gone, I'm not sure if I鈥檇 go back. Ask me in a year!! Good weather would have made it more enjoyable, and my husband and I just aren鈥檛 lay in the sun and do nothing people! We like beer and wine, but really aren鈥檛 into the hard liquor. Reserving a chair and umbrella really wasn鈥檛 a problem for us, as we aren鈥檛 sun worshipers! We鈥檇 get our sun walking on the beach or just being outside. This particular trip, getting too much sun wasn鈥檛 a real problem! It was nice getting away and spending time together and seeing a different culture, and I highly recommend the Caribe Club Princess and TNT vacations. The Dominicans are a very friendly, happy people. They try very hard to deal with all the people and I was very impressed with them as a whole. Not speaking Spanish was somewhat of a barrier, but nothing serious. Someone who spoke English was usually nearby. Go, enjoy and have fun.

<Content>Beautiful Beach My husband and I and two other couples arrived at this resort April 2nd and stayed for one week. The check in counter was a bit busy. We waited in line for about ten minutes and then we were on our way to the room. The other two couples had great rooms, one of them had a suite. Our room was lacking. We had requested a king size, ocean view room. Our room had two queen beds and a view of the kiddie play area (opposite end of the ocean.)The room looked as though it had not been cleaned that day and could have used some basic maintenance. Luckily the next day we spoke with our Air Canada Vacations rep who was able to get us a new room that was much better with a view of the pool. The Good: The beach was absolutely beautiful. The sand was a soft white and the ocean was a refreshing turqoise blue. The hotel grounds were a joy to walk through. Lot's of beautiful plants, trees, and flowers. I loved all the critters walking around, frogs, peacocks, ducks, turtles, fish.The staff were very friendly and always willing to say hola! The So-So: The food at the buffet was pretty good there was usually something for everyone. We found that sometime's the food wasn't cooked all the way through so be careful. We ate at the Mexican restaurant twice and we all loved it. We ate at the Italian restaurant once and wished we stayed away. The service was very slow compared to the Mexican restaurant. The pasta was under-cooked and cold. I shared my meal with my husband. He had one bite of his risotto and refused to eat the rest. Three others ordered the lasagna and none of them got through half of it. The Bad: Houskeeping. We noticed a stain on two of the bed sheets. One sheet that covered the mattress and one that was used as a blanket. We figured that we would let it go and figured that we would have new sheets that evening after the maids cleaned the room. I was wrong. We returned to our newly cleaned room that evening and turned back the sheets. Both stains were still there in the same spot. We called the front desk to complain. They had a maid arrive ten minutes later with new sheets. After speaking to others at the resort we found out that the maids only make the bed and rinse out the shower when they clean the room. How long had those sheets been on the bed?? Who else had slept in them??Overall we found the Caribe Club a nice resort with just a few problems. The weather was hot and sunny the entire week and we able to have a great relaxing time! We will not return to the Caribe. We don't like to go to the same place twice but we would not recommend it to other either. There are better one's out there.

<Content>Can't wait to go back Very clean, awesome beach, wonderful food! We walked up and down the beach past the other resorts and soon realized that we had by far the best beach. It was cleaner and bigger than most. There were always people cleaning the pool, or sweeping the sidewalks, but they were never in your way. They do a great job of keeping kids occupied, because I never really knew that they were even there. The rooms were nice, roomy, and very clean. I have multiple food allergies and found an abundance of wonderful food to choose from. My picky husband even loved the food. Our favorite was the fresh made to order omelets every morning. The staff were very friendly, we got our pictures taken with several of them. The activity directors would let you know what activity was coming up, but if you didn't want to participate, they would leave you alone. There is no way to be bored here. We want to go back!

<Content>what a beautiful beach We just came back on april 7 from punta cana, staying at the Caribe club princess. There was 6 of us, 3 couples. We had a great time. The resort was really beautiful and the beach was by far the best I have seen, and we have been to alot of beaches. The food was good, the buffet was good, but the Italian rest. was the best. The service at the resort was excellent. We had nothing but friendlyness, smiles and good service. After reading some of the reports made at trip advisor, we were a little aprehensive about coming to punta cana. But the people were sooooo friendly and helpful. Yes the rooms we had were o.k. just basic, but some of the people had suites and they didn't pay any extra. I guess it was just how they fell. As far as people trying to get in your room, alot of people arrive in the middle of the night and it is hard to see the room numbers. They do not have any order to them. A couple of times people tried to come in our rooms, mistaken identy of rooms. Our rooms were directly across from the buffet and the rest. I think on the older side, but we loved the area we were in. We had sliders out so that we could all sit together and have drinks or what ever. We had absolutely no problem with any body as far as the language. A couple of us had some spanish, and if you try they love it. I have to say we did have to brush our teeth with bottled water which I found a little annoying. But they give you plenty of water. We did sometimes have to ask for towels, soap, water etc. but they always brought it right up. You have to remember where you are, it is not America. Thankfully none of us got sick, but we did hear of people getting sick, whether they brought it with them or not I don't know. One women that stayed at the Bavaro Princess said she used the tap for brushing her teeth and did not get sick. That would be my only concern especially with children. Would we go back, I really don't know. The beach was astonishingly beautiful, long and wide and tropical. We did have a day of rain, and it rained mostly every night. We had fun, sort of a crash vacation. The casino was a ways away but they had little shuttles to take us there and back. The people are really friendly and pleasant.

<Content>P-A-R-A-D-I-S-E My husband and I haven't had a vacation alone since our honeymoon eight years ago---and that was only to a resort here in the U.S. This was our very first experience traveling out of the country. Needless to say we were nervous about everything from customs to ending up in a cruddy place. The whole customs thing in and out of U.S and Dominican Republic was a breeze and the place we stayed---FABULOUS!We went through Apple Vacations which was the best thing ever and I will always use them from now on and highly recommend it!! We arrived in the DR and were directed right where to go by an Apple Rep. The bus ride to the hotel was about 30 minutes on a large air conditioned bus. When we arrived at the Caribe Club Princess our mouths dropped open. It was absolutely beautiful. We arrived at 10 AM, too early to check-in, but no worries, we packed our beach stuff in our carry on so we changed and hit the beach. The beach was unbelieveable! Cute little huts and chairs lined the beach on the gorgeous water! (We are frequent Jersy Shore visitors--this was no Atlantic Ocean)We never had a problem getting a chair on the beach. When it was time to check-in we did so, upgraded to VIP, then hit the pool--the pool bar was just too convenient and cool. **VIP package: beware if you are only staying a few days as we did. In only 3 days we did not have enough time to fully appreciate the VIP perks. You get a dinner at one of the not included restauants--but we skipped it b/c the menu was a little too fancy for me. 2 motorized sports--the time we booked for that it rained.A 20 min massage--a definate MUST!! and premium alcohol--if you are a beer drinker you must go VIP. El Presidente-the local beer--is not very good but with VIP you can get Miller, Corona--whatever!The shows each night were amateur at best but still entertaining! My husband was in the Mr Caribe Prince contest on the last night--what a riot!! After the show the lobby turns into a mini disco until midnight!! Plenty of fun and dancing but still ending early enough to get a good rest. They also have a real disco on the grounds open from 11p-5a, we tried it once and felt very out of place--we didnt intend to stay up that late anyway!!Horseback riding on the beach is also a must. The hotel and apple do not endorse it b/c some ranches use very skinny, sickly horses that are upsetting to Americans. Rais Ranch approached us at the hotel and we signed up anyway ($80). The horses were smaller than your average American raised horse but very heatlhy and strong. Riding on the beach, along the water was amazing! I never rode before and was a little afraid to go too fast, but my husband wasn't and it was up to us how fast we wanted to go!! We got a bottle of rum with our picture on the horses as the label, along with a CD of Dominican music.($25)We also took the snorkeling excursion($140). We snorkled right along sharks and rays!! I was expecting little sharkfish or something and was totally terrified when I actually came face-to-face with an 18 foot long nurse shark!! They stay along the bottom while you float on top but those suckers were huge and I totally flipped the first time i saw them but eventually calmed down! After a 1/2 hour of snorkeling we got back on the boat, had a little lunch, and then went out to a natural swimming pool about a 1/2 mile off shore. It was only 4-5 foot deep and we just jumped right off the boat into it. While we enjoyed this magnificent swimming area, a man came around with a floating tray of drinks!! Rum and the caribbean--a perfect match!! After the swim it was meringue time on the boat! It was like a big party and the most fun we had on the whole trip!! If you go Apple you must take this excursion!! The food at the buffet was what you would expect of a buffet. A little bit of everything--nothing amazing but it was ok and you could just show up whenever which was nice! The italian restaurant was really nice.The service we received from every member of the staff from house keeping to gardener to front desk and bartenders was incredible! They totally bend over backwards to say hello and do anything they can to make you happy.The amount of American tourists was the minority and we found it hard to find anyone to actually chit-chat with but that wasn't why we went there anyway. All activities, shows, tours, instructions everything was done in spanish, french,english and dutch! We were the minority but never left out!!All in all our vacation was almost too good to be true! It was over too fast but we will never forget it! **we did use disposable cameras and did not come away with many good photos I would recommend using your own good camera--but we were too afraid of losing or damaging it.If I could have hugged every person at that hotel including the awesome Apple people I would have! It could have turned out to be the worst vaca. ever since it was our first and we planned it alone but it was the exact opposite!!TOTAL relaxation, beauty, paradise, and fun, fun, fun!**I did miss my kids and talked to some moms who had brought theirs--apparantely they have an awesome kids club so next year we intend to go again with the kids!!This hotel is a must stay!!Don't forget--don't dirnk the water, even when you brush your teeth--this is how you don't get sick!!

<Content>More than I expected Like the rest of you I base some of my pre-booking research on the reviews found on this and other sites - what we've realized over the years is that the same week can yield remarkably different reviews. After being at this resort (March 16-23)I recommend taking extreme reviews with a 'grain of salt'. Because we travel with chidren I'm picky about the basics, ie.food  cleanliness, both of which I found to be very good at this resort. Check in was pretty fast, but half way through I had to remind them we had the VIP package. Quickly changed our wrist bands and provided the safe key etc. Rum, cigars and vouchers for massage etc came next day.Block 34 is where you want to be. I think we got the best room in the resort 2315 - which is a corner suite with 2 balconies one facing pool and a second with an ocean view. Large and clean no complaints. Maid service twice a day, at night, she would change our bathroom towels, provide 4 beach towels, turn down beds and even leave a chocolate. We tipped her both times and she couldn't do enough always asking if we wanted anything more.FOODFood was very good, breakfast was the only routine (but how many different things can you have?) Eggs (every way),pancakes,french toast and a crepe station too. Even peanut butter and Maple Syrup - firsts for me in the Caribbean. Based on past experience ala cartes never seem to live up - but these sure did. Had our VIP dinner at El Pescador. Awesome,never thought I would say that I can't eat another bite of lobster but I swear mine was a good 2lbs. The Mexican restaurant again, I was leary about,not too famliar with Mexican and remember I have picky little kids - again I was impressed with not only the food but the amazing presentation. Same with Mamma Mia's kids loved their Pizza and I enjoyed my Lasagna (ok it's not my moms but it was good). Wine both red and white were light and very drinkable. Rest of the nights we ate at the buffet (try to go after 8pm less crowded)I was shaking my head wondering how posted reviews about bad food could actually be talking about the same place? Just some of the things we ate - roast lamb,turkey,pork, shrimp,freshly made ceasar salad, raw oyster bar, seafood and rice, every kind of cheese, prociutto, pasta bar, mussles, calamari etc etc ENTERTAINMENTBecause we had late dinners we never made it to the 8:30 mini disco at the theater, and because we had kids, waiting until 9:45pm for the show to start was also not an option so no comment here. The lobby is where to be after dinner, only open bar at night. Nice in that its far enough from rooms (good 15 min walk or you can take the trolley)so you are not disturbed if you want to sleep. Great for an end of day cappuccino and sambuca. INTERNET I only saw it working 1 night and it crashed half way through my email so I never did get to use the 2 free VIP hours.MINI CLUB - Mostly young children ie under 5, my 4 year old daughter went one day. Although they keep them busy, because none of the kids spoke english she felt a little left out and didn't want to go back. MINI GOLF big hit with my son who had to play everyday. Overll you could do as much as you wanted always something going on dance lessons, volley ball, aerobics,archery,lawn bolwling etc.BEACH - beautiful, sandy (no water shoes needed). Water was a bit too wavy for the kids to go to far, my son enjoyed using the boogie boards to 'surf'.POOL - 3 to choose from so I was happy to be able to avoid the one with the pool bar which I'm personally not fond of for hygiene reasons ('nuff said). Pool with fountains and bridge our favourite, could even park your lounger on a ledge inside the pool.DOCTOR: My otherwise healthy daughter had croup the first night we arrived. I remembered seeing the Dr's office on our way in. Dr available 24/7. Dr Karina checked her out and gave her some cough syrups etc. Wanted to see her next day to follow up. She was fine rest of the time.None of us got DR (the domenican rumble!) My daughter (and a few other kids) did get sick after the bumpy bus ride back to the airport, so if you get car sick you may want to pop a gravol (or bring a bag).OVERALL - We had a great trip, wish we could have stayed another week. I would highly recommend this resort for families with young kids.

<Content>Good Last Minute Holiday Caribe Club Princess / Tropical Princess We travelled to Punta Cana March 11 to 18th 2006 for the Ontario March Break and stayed at the Tropical Princess / Caribe Club Princess. We are 3 adults in their 30s with much travel experience in the Caribbean and with all inclusive resorts. Keep in mind we booked this holiday 3 weeks prior to departure so there was not much to choose from. We were a little concerned that there was so little reviews on the Tropical Princess but upon arrival we discovered why. The Tropical Princess / Caribe Club Princess are the same complex that share same facilities. The only difference in the 2 鈥渉otels鈥?is the type of room you receive and where it is in the complex. So if you are looking for Tropical reviews, read also the Caribe Club reviews. Furthermore the Punta Cana Princess is in the same complex, a 2 minute walk away. They have their own restaurants but shared in our trolley service, spa, etc. ( a side note I visited the Punta Cana Princess on walks daily and once at night and it is far more quiet, sedate, and smaller than the Tropical and Carib) Our flight to Punta Cana was uneventful. The drive to the hotel was an hour despite the guides saying 20 min. from airport as they stopped at 5 hotels before ours.The lobby at the Tropical/Carib is nice. The interesting concept of this resort is the lobby/nightly entertainment/disco/shops/internet/guide tours/theatre are nowhere near the rooms. In fact you have to take a trolley from the above places or walk about 7 minutes to the complex where the room buildings/restaurants/pools are. This has pros and cons. On the one hand the area between the two areas is beautifully manicured/gardened almost with a 鈥榬ainforest鈥?theme which makes for a wonderful stroll. However there are times when you need to be at the above places i.e. lobby to complain or pick up things or when it is raining that the distance is a pain. Further the trolley is on Dominican time and there are times when the wait is much longer than the 15 min. they promise. If you book at the Tropical 鈥?pay for the VIP program once you arrive. Don鈥檛 give your North American travel agent the extra commission. We bought it in the lobby upon arrival and do not regret it all! It goes into effect the next day after arrival. You get the items listed: 1 bottle rum, cigars, bathrobes, night turn down service, premium liquor (Absolut/Bacardi) 1 hour internet service, but most importantly you get a free dinner at La Cava and a free 25 minute massage in the spa!!! Well worth the $90 we spent. All the restaurants are included except La Cava and El S鈥?La Cava is $25 per person for Carib Club and $50 per person for Tropical guests. With the VIP bracelet, you get there for free and the lobster and steak dinner was definitely worth it! Further we all used the spa 2 more times after our free massage as it was at par with most North American spas. Prices were reasonable. Food: For the most part, the dinners at the specialty restaurants are good. We ate at all of them and were impressed with presentation and choices. Service was slow at most of them but what can you expect? The buffet restaurant was frustrating at breakfast and lunch. You can鈥檛 get your own pop/water/coffee so have to constantly be flagging down waiters even though the machines are accessible. Further they usually only have 1 cook for most popular items: omelets, crepes, meat, pasta etc. which generated lineups making most food warm or even cold by time you reach your table. We felt the food at the buffet was mediocre at best when compared to other resorts in Dominican and elsewhere. Where was the fresh orange juice? It was concentrated. Rooms: On arrival our door lock was broken and we refused to stay in room until it was fixed. Looked like a forced entry had been done. It was around 10:45 p.m. We got the 鈥渄on鈥檛 worry, no problem鈥?line that they would take care of it tomorrow. No way. Not with reports of thefts etc. on previous reviews plus our concerns for our own security. We had also requested a room not on the first floor which it was. Since it was Sat. night there were no other rooms available so we couldn鈥檛 leave our room for drinks etc. and had room service. They did temporarily fix it by 1:30 a.m. and promised us a new room on 2nd floor next day. This did happen by 3:00 p.m. next day and we were happy with our new room. Most rooms in the Tropical are Suites 鈥?2 rooms and 2 bathrooms. Perfect for stretching out. Our maid service was not the greatest at all despite leaving many gifts and cash but didn鈥檛 feel like complaining about it as yes, you are rarely in room anyway. Resort: We have been to countless resorts in Caribbean so have much to compare to. We swear people at this resort stayed up all night or get up at 5:00 to reserve beach chairs. This was very frustrating as we are sun-worshippers and were on the beach by 7:30 every single day and never once got seats that we wanted but further back under huts. We know pools were easier but we are not pool people. These resorts need to get more chairs to met demand, it baffles me that this is an issue at most resorts despite people complaining. There were constant chair stealers we saw and battles. Its not worth it. Invest in as many chairs as you have guests. Logic? A majority of the guests were French from France. They had their own French entertainment staff that combined with the Dominican staff who were generally Spanish only with some French and little English made interactions with the English speaking guests fairly limited. We were blatantly ignored most of the time when they were scouring the beach / pool for people for activities. It was only on the 3rd day when we realized that the guests had different wristband colours. All guests who were French had blue so staff would know the French. VIP was orange and everybody else was grey. Interesting dynamics to watch. Overall: We did not have one daylight hour of rain and clouds were minimal so how can one complain too much about a holiday? We knew going in that this was a last minute holiday at a 4* resort in Dominican. So with the exception of the broken door, mediocre food at lunch, and generally being ignored by the staff, we had a great holiday with good times in our group and the people we met. Would we go back? Almost definitely not, but that is because we never return to the same resort as we like new experiences in new places. Would we recommend Tropical/Carib? With some reservations of what to expect, to definitely buy the VIP plan, and to request a Carib room or a Tropical suite.Beach itself is beautiful and you can鈥檛 go wrong with that.

<Content>Great Honeymoon! We loved it!To be honest, we both got a bit scared after reading so many negative reviews, but we had a great time!The hotel was in great shape, the room was huge and clean.I will review everything as I remember...Food:The food was good!We had an option of different restaurants for dinner each night(chinese, mexican, italian, dominican)*Reservations did have to be made, but was not a problem and restuarants were not fullthe buffets has a great selection, and different items every day.Beach  Pools:The water was beautiful, it was very windy while we were there. There were lots of topless european women and the beaches were also fairly crowded so that was a negative.Overall I would probably go back, I live on the west coast and Hawaii is alot better price wise, but I wouldnt mind paying another visit to punta cana**the staff speaks very limited english, my wife spoke spanish which was a life saver!do your best to brush up on your spanish and it will make your trip 1000 times better!!! we wouldnt of recieved half the favors we did if she didnt speak spanish!oh yeah, they gave us a free upgrade too becuase they had a mix up with some of the paper work-Phil

<Content>Not the vacation we were expecting! We actually booked and paid for a vacation to the Iberostar in Puerto Plata, but upon arrival at the airport we found out that TNT Vacations had cancelled our entire trip! After a day of phone calls, we were rebooked to this All-inclusive in Punta Cana-it was all that was still available and we soon found out why.So this resort is a four-star. Yes it is clean, but it seemed to be quite small compared to other resorts. We were at least upgraded to VIP, but it doesn't seem to be worth paying for. The free rum we were entitled to was not given to us until the last day (and we asked EVERY day).The food was ok. There is one main buffet (which gets crowded by 7 at dinner time) and 6 restaurants, plus 2 which you must pay for, except if you are VIP. The Dominican, Brazilian, Mexican and Seafood restaurants were quite good. There are lunch buffets by the beach at the Seafood and Brazilian restaurants, so you can take the food to your chair. My favorite dishes were the fish and fried chicken by far. None of us got sick, including our 20 month old, and we ate everything except salads.The beach is of course beautiful, and there are activities going on ALL day. It is quite a walk down to the shops, but the walk is a nice diversion. There are 3 pools, one with a sunken bar. The pool was a little chilly, so we stuck to the beach.Rooms - nice enough. Full tubs in the bathroom. VIPs get a separate seating area with pull-out sofa bed. Our room had a slight ocean view.Staff- couldn't have been nicer. They were so wonderful to our son. Aside from a couple of buffet waitpersons, we received incredible service and attention. We tipped our first waitress at breakfast, and she always went to get the highchair as soon as we walked in and got the drinks we preferred without asking (Ana is her name). So all-in-all, this resort is nice, but when you have stayed at a resort like Iberostar or nicer, you have higher expectations which this resort doesn't meet. If you have never been to an all-inclusive, I think you would be quite satisfied here. It's not the worst choice, but there are nicer places to stay. We are still waiting for TNT to rectify the situation, and so far they have only offered $150 in vouchers for the inconvenience. Not good enough when you realize you have paid for a trip that you never would have chosen to book in the first place!We also went to Manati Park, which is NOT worth it, unless you have never been to a zoo or aquarium, or if you have young children, like us, who would enjoy it anyway.

<Content>my opinion of the Caribe Club Princess We arrived on a Monday, March 6,2006, weather was great. Staff friendly and personable.Our rooms were clean, nice and a beautiful view of the ocean. Food was good at the buffet, (I'm picky)but there was so many things to choose from for a picky eater as well as one who likes everything. Only complaint is the coffee, my goodness is it strong. They should cut back a little, and then they wouldn't need so much milk and it would stay hot longer. Would take the buffet over the ala carte restaurants anytime. The ala carte restaurants were ok, nothing to rave about. Had the vip package which was wonderful, the 20 min. massage was very nice. There was enough activity for everyone from just doing nothing to playing bocci ball. Language a small problem, but if you asked for English, they would find someone that could speak it and bring them to you or have them come to the telephone. Only other small issue was wash cloths, hard to get from staff. If I were to go again, I would take some wash cloths with me or someone said if you tipped them everyday, you would get washcloths. All in all we had a very good experience and would definetly stay at the Caribe Princess again. Ellen Brawdy, Finleyville, Pennsylvania

<Content>Brutally Awful!! I am not one to complain but this resort was the worst one I have ever stayed in. Both my husband and I got sick from the very first day. I have read all the reviews and can only say that the poor reviews say it all. It's exactly how we experienced this resort. It was awful and I feared for my health. We got back early yesterday and we are still suffering from diarrhea and have been to the doctors this morning.We ate at the hotel main restaurant on Sunday for breakfast and lunch - the choice was fairly limited to what we have experienced at other vacation resorts. The food was bland and all tasted the same and was not very appertizing. I started vomiting in the afternoon. On Sunday evening we both ate at the Italian restaurant. Afterwards we both felt ill and retired to our room - my husband started with diarrhea that evening and it continued thoughout the night. I started with it in the early hours of Monday morning. We both lay in our room for most of the day - feeling terrible. We did not eat anything that day but went down on Tuesday morning for breakfast hoping to get some cereal and toast, both of which were awful, the line for toast was quite long, I wonder why ?? On Tuesday evening we went to the Dominican Restaurant but had to walk out before the meal was served as we both felt sick. By Wednesday we were both suffering continually from diarhea and had sworn that we would not eat anything more from that main restaurant. We made a trip to the store and bought chips to eat as we knew they were made in USA and would be safe! I asked for orange juice at one of the bars and got a glass of lukewarm water with orange food colouring in it! None of the drinks were cold except that the beer was a little colder - iced water just never seemed available - we survived the week on warm bottled water, Imodium, Gravol and Heineken (we knew that this was safe to drink, even though our stomachs told us that beer wasn't the best thing to drink in our condition!) Thursday was one of the best days for me - I had not eaten at all and felt very weak but at least I did not have diarrhea that day. My husband still continued with it though. Thursday I managed to eat a small amount of mashed potato at the Italian Restaurant - my husband took one look of his dinner and left. On Friday I was so ill I did not leave the room - I won't bore you with the details - it would make you sick! We managed to survive on Saturday with a bag of chips and bottled water on the beach (we had a late flight) - we refused to eat anything more from that hotel! While we were waiting for the bus to return to the airport we discovered that others on the trip had experienced the same kind of problems. I would not advise anyone to go to this hotel. It would have been a great holiday had it not been for the food - the beach was lovely and the room had a lovely view and was mainly clean - I found most of the staff fairly unexcited about their jobs and really felt that if we asked for something (like a knife and fork to eat with!!!) that we were asking for the world from them! I was really glad to get back home.

<Content>Absolutely beautiful!! Stayed at the resort from Jan.29-Feb.5, 2006.We went to the resort for our honeymoon, and reading some of the reviews, it made us sceptical of where we were going. I dont know what people were complaining about, because we had absolutely NO problems with ANYTHING there! We went to the steak house (La Cava) and it was great! The presentation was awesome and you get large portion meals there. Only I would recommend eating INSIDE the restaurant, instead of eating outside...I got bitten by some flies/bugs out there (about 30 bites on my legs, which were VERY itchy). We also tried the Mexican and Italian restaurants. My husband and I both didnt much care for the Italian food, however many others seemed to enjoy it. Our favorite was the Mexican restaurant, in fact we ended up going there twice during our stay!! The buffet was quite well...we really enjoyed the omlettes in the mornings!! There was a LARGE variety of foods to choose from at the buffet and they all had good flavor.I would HIGHLY recommend getting the VIP package....its worth the few extra bucks! With this you recieve a VERY relaxing massasge, premium brand drinks, and lots of other little extras. However, you have to mention to the bartenders that you are VIP and tell them that you want 'Brugal' rum (the better rum), and the more expensive vodka...otherwise they might mistake you for NOT being VIP and not receiving the better alcohol.Our room service from our maids was great, but it also helps if you tip them. We had brought them alot of gifts from home (ex. shampoos, soaps, books, paper, pens, clothes...) We have no complaints about our room AT ALL!!! It was amazing, LARGE bathroom, and a sunk-in living room....it had everything we needed.We spent half of our stay sun-tanning on the beach, and NEVER had trouble finding a hut or chairs to sit on...dont know what other guests were complaing that they couldnt find a place to sit by the beach. The other half of the time we tanned by the pool (the one with the swim up bar). There we had to wake up a bit earlier to find chairs to sit on. The sun seemed hotter by the pool, but then again you dont have the ocean breeze blowing and cooling you down....which was nice, because we both got bad wind/sun burns sitting by the beach one afternoon. The main bars that we went to were the swim-up bar during the day and the lobby bar during the evening. The lobby bar is quite beautiful and relaxing. We had booked a tour with Turinter (Air Canada affiliated) for the Sanoa Island tour, however that morning the bus that was suppose to pick us up, along with 8 others from our resort, accidentaly missed our resort and left without us all. It was no problem at all dealing with them about this issue. They were more than willing to either re-book us, or return our money back IN FULL. We decided not to re-book seeing it was one of our last days there, and heard from others that went on the tour that it actually wasnt worth the $80 american/person. They didnt have entertainment on the boat ride at all and never saw ANY fish on their whole tour. Overall, my husband and I would definately recommend the resort though. It was absolutely gorgeous and the staff there was amazing. We did ALOT of walking along the beach everyday there, and thought that our resort had the best part of the beach BY FAR!! It was clean and had the most huts and chairs!We would definately go back, and to those of you who are going you'll have a blast!!

<Content>Look for another hotel I read the reviews and believed that you alone can make or break a vacation. I went with an opened mind, and was sadly disappointed. Even the little things I wanted to overlook kept accumulating. I was glad to leave.Hotel: beautiful grounds, but many unsafe spots, potholes, loose tiling, mats that trip, cords, etc. Food:-buffet was the same every morning, lunch and night-tables weren't cleaned fast enough, dirty things left for awhile-forget about getting a good hot cup of coffee, just dream about Tim Hortons-my husband and I both got sick and another woman we spoke to had food poisoning (this was just eating at the hotel)-a-la-carts were easy to book and they were okayRooms:-we upgraded to a suite, which as nothing special- a little run down, but okay-cleaning service was horrible! I only had my room cleaned once before 2pm, the rest of the time they cleaned the room by 5-6:30pm (forget about relaxing before dinner)-Maids just enter the rooms whenever they wanted, they would knock 2 times quickly and open. I started putting the safety lock on whenever in the room-towels were stiff and they didn't give you enough, had to go look for a maid for more towels, water or soap- drain was very slow, but it was nice that shower had a hand-held faucet, great for childrenVIP Package (good idea to get this):-24 hr room service-premium drinks (Heinekens, but some bars ran out)- 1hr motorized water sport (banana boat, or speed boat tour of Bavaro beach, etc)- La Cava or another seafood restaurant (seafood restaurant was under renovation)-charge for the TV remote and safety lock key, unless you upgrade to VIP- Swedish massage Pool:- hard to get a chair, everyone reserved their chairs early morning-cold water-Main pool was loud with the entertainment crew, and it did get a little annoying, but you can always go to the other poolsOcean/Beach:To die for, very beautiful...good luck getting a chair!-beach towels in short supply, ran out of clean towels several times and had to come back-Very crowded, people everywhere-many European women were topless, got used to it in the endStaff:THIS IS WHAT MADE THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE HORRIBLE:-At times had difficulty getting what you wanted due to the language barrier, but to be expected when travelling to the Dominican Republic. What I didn't expect was that 75% of hotel staff went out of their way to help make your stay pleasant, while others really didn't care-Front desk staff I found rude, and sorry to say...lazy. Some came across like it was an inconvenience to help you, or just wouldn't give you the right information-We had an experience that I will not publish, but it was horrible and I felt we were treated unfairly and unjustly....We were threatened by the hotel manager and was told we could not check out with our two small children unless they got their way...meaning they wanted $$$$. Don't make your Dominican experience a bad one, don't go here, look elsewhere. FIRST TIME AND LAST IN PUNTA CANA

<Content>Not Impressed Well having stayed at a few very nice AI's I will say CCP is not top of my list and won't be returning.First the good news. The beach is to die for. Soft white sandy running for ever. Busy but nothing you can't handle, always an open area availble. Our VIP suite was as close to the beach as I have ever been...perfect?? Yes but we had big problems with the room inside. I needed a knife and fork to open the patio door everytime. The knife to slit it open as the lock was broken, then the fork to pry it the rest of the way. Our TV buzzed a horrid noise constantly and our coffee maker would only stay on for 10 seconds then shut off. We had requested 2 double beds but got a king. No problem they would switch the bed........a small single mattress, looked like it had been used for toilet training. arrived and was place in the middle of our sitting area, defeating the porpuse of having a suite. Just take it away and we will sleep in the king. The mattress remained up against our wall all week. Every time we called they just rushed us off the phone and said ok we come. We had no problems with the air or the hot water both worked great.My biggest problem of the week by far was the food. The buffet is just horrid. I am not picky but I really stuggled to find an item or two that looked or tasted nice. We ate at La Cava 3 times and found it wonderful...everytime. The chicken at the beach was also very good. The other issue I had with the buffet was that the tables were not cleaned, plates were removed but no clean place mats were set out, if you were not first at a table you were eating with someone elses mess left.The grounds are lovely, well maintained and worth a trip on the bus to see them all.The pool was cooler than the ocean but very nice.We had a lovely vacation, enjoyed ourselves but having just returned from Puerto Plata in January found the CCP just not up to scratch. As for the VIP package we had, well lets just say we did save the price of atleast one meal at La Cava but other than that was nothing special.

<Content>Second Honeymoon!! My husband and I just returned from a 5 day, 4 night vacation to Caribe Club in the Dominican Republic. We decided at the last minute to take a vacation (first time without kids) and we a little nervous about flying out of the country. Left Philadlephia airport the day a blizzard was to hit and arrived in 85 degree weather!! Beautiful! The airport at Punta Cana was very easy to maneuver through. Filling out tourist cards was easy (they just want your $10). The ride to the resort was interesting watching and seeing all the countryside. When we arrived at our resort, the front desk people were wonderful. They told us we had the best room in the place (yeah, right we thought, they tell that to everyone), actually we did, the honeymoon suite!!! Complete with a loft and sunken tub. Room was clean, organized and very, very nice. Our maid service was very good. We tipped every day and it paid off, we had fresh towels every day and room was picked up before late morning every day. At night the bed was turned down and chocolates on our pillows. One night we needed washcloths. After tracking the maid down she didn't understand but we wrote down what we needed and were taken care of immediately. The food was great! We didn't try any of the other restaurants. Ate at the buffet every day, which satisfied us completely. Beach restaurant wasn't the greatest. My husband ordered hamburgers twice and each time they weren't cooked long enough. We tried to make them understand, but didn't get through. The beach is beautiful, got a little crowded at the beginning of the week, but other than that was beautiful. Have to be up early to reserve a chair or a shade booth, but was worth it. The beach vendors were great! We caught onto the bartering and was pleased with our purchases and the prices. Nightly entertainment was pretty good, not professional but nice. Drinks were great, Coco Locos were the best!Would definitely return again, maybe bring kids the next time (or maybe not!) No complaints whatsoever.

<Content>Caribe Club Princess - loved it I have never written a reveiw before, so please bear with me. Just spent a week as a VIP at the CCP - what can I say awesome had a great time.Dinning/Food - was okay. Went to each of the restaurants for dinner. Mexican was the best. La Cava food wise was better than great, but the wait was way too long. It was my b-day when I ate there and a cake was delivered and the staff sang happy b-day - very memorableRoom - had a suite that over looked the VIP pool and had a side view of the beach. The view was great. Spent many a morn w/ coffee on my 3rd floor balcony; very relaxing.Entertainment - from what I hear was great. I entered a couple of dart tournaments and was a spectator for the rest of the activities. I did not make it to one of the nightly shows. Though I heard they were great as well. I could hear the shows and see glimpses of them while at the Lobby bar area.Beach - the water was gorgeous. The beach bar was great; service was great.Pool - the water was quite cold, but towards the end of the week it warmed up considerably and I then enjoyed a couple of beers at the pool bar.Lobby bar was very nice. Went there to hang out each night. Casino - fabulous. Quiet and clean. I went there at about 10pm and stayed until close 545am and took the train back. I was alone and felt quite safe. Shopping on the resort - only needed to p/u a pair of sunglasses and they were $11 - not a bad price at all.I did not tip the bartenders and was treated very well. No complaints. That could be because I had the VIP braclet, but we'll never know.Room service was great - my husband had pizza and beer delivered nightly. I ordered coffee in the early evening.Language barrier - not many of the employees speak english and I don't speak another language - I could, for the most part, understand. however, my husband could not understand them.I would definitely recommend this hotel and advise you to upgrade to VIP the extras you get are well worth it; massages (20 minute swedish upper body), bottled premium beer and premium alcohol, et al., 1 hour each of motorized water sports (did not use it though), 1 hour each of free internet service which I waited too long to use. Was booked up by the time I went to log on...

<Content>A very good resort I just came back from a one week vacation at the Caribe Club Princess in Punta Cana. It is a sure value. The beach is gorgeous, the complex is just big enough, the pools are clean and beautiful, staff is friendly and always eager to give you good service. The Caribe is on the same complex as the Tropical Princess so you get to enjoy the infrastructure of two hotels. There are three pools, 7 (if I remember correctly) 脿 la carte restaurants, a big buffet restaurant, a long beach etc. Food was very good, even at the buffet. There was a wide selection of food. We didn't enjoy the El Pilon, a dominican 脿 la carte restaurant but it's just a matter of our taste. The rooms were ok. A little too much of little ants and we had the surprise to discover what seemed to be a big cockroach in our bathroom. It seemed it had crawled through the bathroom drain. A stinky smell was always present at the entrance of the building. Don't know where it came from but it was gross. So all in all, it was a great resort apart from these little problems. Grounds were beautiful, beach is more than fabulous, staff was great, pools were excellent, food was very good. Go take a drink at the pool bar and talk with Francisco, he's a real great guy.

<Content>Pretty good I was satisfied with my vacation in Caribe Club. Beach was beautiful, weather was pleasant, grounds are well maintained, there was plenty of food. If you are too picky probably you will find lots of problems - life is slow there, nobody is in a hurry. If you want to sit on the table and have your coffee/beer immediately give them 5 bucks in the beginning and then 2 after each meal and they'll run like crazy but it's unnecessary expence for me. The locals don't know a lot of English but it's even funnier to try to explain them something and my English is not perfect too so I don't care.We had VIP package and I was happy about that. There's a good kids club and they take care of the children, the only problem was that not a lot of the other kids spoke English.Lots of activities - archery, darts, tennis, volleyball, dancing so if you are there for 1 week you can stay at the resort, if you are there for 2 weeks you can go for some trip.They cleaned the rooms 3 times per day, water was hot from the shower and I had no problems with my stomach - I drank mamajuana and beer so you have to be concerned only if you drink 10 cocktails per day. Thats the answer to the main concerns of the others.

<Content>Best Holiday Yet We stayed for two weeks with our two grown children and new grandson along with my sister and husband. We found it just wonderful. Food was great,ample drinks and activities to do. Know one would get bored if they stayed at this resort. The grounds b/c they are older are just perfect. It is not hard to get around the grounds. The only thing we feel could be updated is the internet service we had the vip package and were allowed 1 hr free per person per stay and you had to sign on and stay for 1 hr. watch your time as the guy who runs it will try to kick you off b/f your time is up as there is not many computors. They do need update that service. The resort was clean and well maintained. Service people could be a little friendler but we would go back again in a minute.

<Content>The truth from a vertern May I start by saying the my wife and myself have been to Punta Cana a half a dozen different times. We find good in everything and hate to read reviews from people that you sense would not be happy with anything. With that said, here we go. Five years ago we traveled to the same location by the name of Hodelpa Caribe. The Beaches and the water are the best in the world. Service then was excellent and made us come back for more. Three years ago the Caribe Club Princess took over and all has changed. The Beach and the ocean are the same, but that is where everything changes. There are a few people that go out of thier way to see that you are enjoying yourself. Yet unfortunately a large number of our hosts made you feel that you were bothering them for any request from the smallest to the lack of hot water. We go to the DR because of the cultural differnces, not to be slighted and looked down on. We will continue to travel to the DR hopefully for years to come. If you have reservations, cancel them. If you are debating this hotel, run for your life!

<Content>Looks Are Deceiving... In terms of all-inclusive resorts, this was - on the surface - as fine as any I've been to -- decent rooms, decent (though repetitive) food, great staff, nice beaches, etc.My main problem here was that I contracted cryptosporidium - most likely from the swimming pool water, back in May '05. For those who don't know, crypto is a water-borne parasite much like giardia, with many of the same symptoms. Unlike giardia, there's nothing you can take to get rid of it, you just have to let it work through your system. Most people suffer for two weeks, but some - like me - suffer longer (I really didn't kick it until 3 months after the trip). Chlorine doesn't kill it, which is why pool water is such an easy infection route. I can't say for sure I got it that way (you can also catch it through food, etc.), but my traveling companion didn't get sick, and she ate/drank all the same stuff I did. But she didn't swim.The resort wasn't dirty at all - I actually had a great time until I fell ill, and found the staff friendly and very hospitable. However - and this probably goes for all resorts in developing nations - just be extra careful with everything, including pool water.We also had a lot of rain while down there (May is the start of the rainy season) - and one night the water that was collecting outside of our room actually seeped in under the door by morning. No big deal, but I wouldn't want to be there in a tropical storm...

<Content>The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly Our family just returned from a one week all-inclusive vactation at the Caribe Club Princess Resort in Punta Cana. We spent the week with about 40 family and friends and overall everyone had an excellent holiday. I would definitely recommend the resort, especially for the price we paid ($1500 Canadian, taxes included) and I would not hesitate to return for that price. I do, however, recommend the VIP package for an additional weekly fee (at least for one person in the booking group) because it gives you access to 24 hour free room service and the food is definitely better ordered through room service than in the restuarants.The Good: beautiful grounds, unbelieveable weather, very comfortable rooms, beautiful beaches, lobby, and poolsThe Bad: the food, the drinks (except for the local rum and local beer), the limited number of staff that speak English (especially the front desk and the secrity staff)The Ugly: housekeeping staff stealing money, clothing, and personal items from guest rooms and Juan Carlos (who promises the world and delivers 'nada')

<Content>why you should stay here.. Let's face it, almost all 4+star level resorts who operate with a reputable tour company will meet a basic standard. This one fits within that range. Tour companies go through great lengths to ensure appropriate ratings. Any discrepancies are a matter of personal taste. That being said, none of these reviews will really make a difference to you and your vacation if you don't have the right attitude. (This is speaking from experience of going to various resorts in Santo Domingo, Varadero and Cancun)One exceptional thing about booking a vacation to Punta Cana in general is the PRICE. You can get this resort at a far lesser cost than a comparable resort in another city/country (which we managed to do last minute). Not only that, we had booked the Tropical Princess (sister resort) for a far lesser price, and got a complimentary UPGRADE to the Club Caribe Princess. (Tip: if you want an upgrade, be friendly to the front desk staff. it may take a couple visits, but you may have to build a rapport. you don't need to speak spanish to do it either -- i don't)If you're wondering what's the difference b/w all the Princess resorts, here's what I know. The Bavaro Princess sits entirely on it's own, in a separate location, however, the Punta Cana, Club Caribe and Tropical Princesses all occupy the same area (ordered from highest rating to lowest). If you stay at the PC, all rooms are deluxe suites, with a sunken living area; you get access to 10 a la carte (specialty) restaurants (dinner only, but how can you eat 10 dinners anyway?). At CC, you could be in a 'superior room' or suite ; with access to 5 a la cartes. At TC, standard room or family suite; access to 3 a la cartes.Important things to note... FOOD: like most people have said, the buffet food isn't great.. but reality is, you don't want to be pigging out all day anyway. the a la cartes are great. be sure to get up b/w 8am-8:30am to get the time you're interested in, otherwise risk getting a bad time, or not getting any reservation. BEACH: there were plenty of palapas and chairs to go around. even if we got out in the late morning or earlier afternoon, it wasn't impossible to find a spot, which is sooo amazing and surprising. the beach itself was beautiful!POOL: good quality if you're a 'pool' person.STAFF: for me, the staff was hit or miss, but i know this is just my subjective experience, so you may find it to be different. For example, the person who helped us at the front desk, and the animation team were incredibly friendly. Our cleaning lady and the beach bartender, not so much. But, they should not be what makes/breaks your experience anyway.ROOMS: everything worked. no complaints.ENTERTAINMENT: Everything is as expected as any other resort: animation team has several daily activies (ie, darts, water aerobics, ping pong, bocce ball, stretching, dance and spanish lessons, etc.), as well as nightly shows (worth watching if you've never seen them before). There's a disco at the front entrance of the resort, which we never got a chance to check out. Be aware of the night you want to go there because, if they have a 'featured performer' they may actually charge $20-30USD cover, while usually it's free. Finally, there's a free shuttle to the bavaro princess casino.BUGS: I brought bug spray, just in case, but after no signs of insects the first day I didn't bother. Beware, if you walk to the lobby from the resort you will pass 'natural gardens/groves' where bugs thrive (I learned this the hard way). Even if you don't notice them, if you're prone to getting bitten in Canada, during the summer, make sure you protect yourself. There are little gnats and mosquitos. I, of course came back with several bites from both bugs on my back, arms and neck. My partner (who is not prone to insect bites here) did not have one single bite.Last thoughts..wherever you stay, remember you're on vacation.. try not to dwell on the little things, and enjoy your time away.

<Content>Great Resort, Beach  My best friend and I went to Punta Cana to celebrate both of our 40th birthdays. We were very pleased with The Caribe Club Princess. The beach was breathtaking!!! Worth it just to lay on that stretch of white powder!!! The pools were also very, very nice. The rooms were decent and clean (and I'm picky!), but definitely not luxurious in anyway. I found the bed and pillows to be very comfortable! We thought the staff were wonderful, especially Robert at the front desk who on several occassions went out of his way to help us. The recreation employees at our pool who were trying to create a fun atmosphere for everyone were a bit loud and annoying after a few days, but the other pools had no activity and were very peaceful. The food was just OK. The Shaghay (Chinese/Japanese) restaurant was good and so was the Italian. The buffet was just ok, but at least there was an abundance of choices, so everyone should find a few things they'd like. The french fries were great! The last review I read on this site mentioned that the fruit was terrible. The fruit was the one thing my friend and I ate everyday, we found it awesome!! The atmosphere is very laid back, so don't expect service to be fast, that's just their way of life. We did swim with the dolphins at Manati Park, which was great! You're only in the pool with them for maybe 10 minutes, but it is unbelievable how these powerful creatures allowed us to pet them and honestly seemed to want to play with us. Well worth it!!!! The Outback Safari was fun too, a little long of a ride and the beach they took us to had a lot of trash on it, but worth doing to get a true feeling of Dominican life. My only true complaint at the resort was that there was no waiters/waitresses to bring me a drink as I soaked up the sun on the beach. I actually had to get up and walk about 50 feet to the bar!!!! We had a GREAT time and would definitely go back! Can't beat the price!GLLCleveland, Ohio

<Content>Amazing I will start by saying I am amazed by the comments I have just read before beginning to write this review. Did I stay in a different hotel to these people or what? As i travel agent, i have stayed in many hotels in my time  this tops the whole lot. Where do I start, I had originally booked into the Punta Cana Princess (same group of hotels but next door), however, when we arrived at the transfer coach, we had been moved to the Caribe Club Princess, which i wasnt too happy about until we arrived at the lobby/reception of the hotel, what a great move. We even had a ride over on the free shuttle bus to the other hotel  was actually pleased we'd been moved as this hotel was way too quiet for us. I'll begin by telling you about the staff, because overall, it was these people that made our holiday. The staff are fantastic, talk about go out of your way to make you feel welcome is an understatement. The whole animation team need a medal. I cannot believe that such young human beings can put on shows  activities EVERYDAY  EVERY EVENING to keep us entertained  to say multilingual... wow, half of the staff spoke better English than myself!! I read that somebody said the entertainment was the same thing every night... well i suggest when you go you see for yourself because this was far from true. Infact, I have never seen so many smoothly run  professional shows in all of my life  you can actually see the genuine enjoyment on these guys faces no matter how many times they've done the same one of the past year. As for the food, what a great choice. This is what i dreaded most about going to the Dom Republic as i'm not a great eater but what a buffet it was, I've never seen so much choice in all of my life, I have stayed in 5 star hotels  to say this was a 4 star, i couldn't believe it, a variety of different cooking stations where they make you omelettes, your own choice of spaghetti bolognase.. you name it, it was there  you could eat it. There are also a variety of speciality restaurants that you don't have to pay for... Mexican, Chinese, A la Carte, Italian, Tex Mex Steakhouse  many many more these were all great as well. Anyway, I better go because I could go on about this property all year. But please, please trust me when i say, you will not find a single fault with this property!! The Best Yet!! Oh  say a big Hola to Carlos  Rodolfo from us!! :D

<Content>Excellent choice! We (my parents, fiance and I) ended up at this resort after our trip was rerouted from Cozumel because of the hurricane. Other than a few slight details, we all loved the resort. The beach was beautiful, the three pools were great and the staff was wonderful. The rooms weren't anything spectacular (we didn't have a suite, or anything, but just a simple room) but were always clean and attended to. We ate at the buffet, Chinese, Mexican, Dominican and Brazilian restaurants, as well as the Crepeire for lunch. While sometimes the food wasn't amazing, there was always something we could find any enjoy. I believe we all throughly enjoyed the short walk from the pool/hotel room area to the lobby, as it was beautiful and peaceful with lots of foliage and birds, fish, and turtles to look at. For those who didn't want to walk or couldn't, a bus would take you back and forth. I agree with other postings that the drinks didn't always turn out right: sometimes we would get drinks with all alcohol, with no alcohol or just the wrong drinks. I recommend going with beer or Cuba Libres (rum and cokes) if you like either. They seemed to always get those right. While many of the staff didn't know too much English, I don't go to foreign countries expecting the locals to speak my language. The shopping area wasn't too far from the resort, and there were plenty of souvenirs to buy and two bar/restaurant areas if you wanted to get out of the all-inclusive for a while. I would highly recommend this resort to anyone traveling to Punta Cana.

<Content>What you see in the brochure is different from what you experience there We have purchased an all inclusive package at this particulr hotel which comes highly recommended by Air Canada Vacations. Upon arriving in the hotel the whole group had to wait 30-40 minutes as the 2 receptionists on duty were very busy talking to somebody else, instead of paying attention to the guests and start the check in.Rooms were not ready until 3PM, we got ours after many interventions, meanwhile my daughter who was sick and had temperature had to wait for the housekeeping to finish as well. Our room was right opposite the housekeeping headquarters, there was noise all the time, one afternoon I was trying to take a nap and the chambermaid came to make up the rooms at 4PM that was the usual time that my room would have been done and the head housekeeper came in the room (and with no respect for me whatsoever that was trying to rest), starting to shout and talk loud to the chambermaid, so I had to invite her politely to take her issues outside of my room.Kidsclub - my son went there 2 times, last time left his swimming trunk on the table in front of him on a supervised facility and they were gone.Food - in the main restauarant was terrible, I was getting sick only when I was seeing the same type of food and leftovers from lunch recooked and served for dinner or the next day.One day there was a barbecue grill, (which was delicious compared to the day to day food) and people were ready and eager to have a bite, only to discover that meat was kept outside with no ice or any other culinary precautions taken when you are cooking, hundreds of meat slices turning brown or black in the Carribean sun, have these people ever heard of ice packed coolers?I went on an early morning to make restaurant reservations for the other specialty restaurants and was told by the customer service that he can not find me a decent restaurant seat as he is only a hotel employee, to which I told him that people like me fill this hotel and other the same and that the hotel will stay in business, if we as Travel agents will advise that this is a property well worth while (obviuosly not).Towards the end being pretty fed up with lack of services got my Travel Agent card out and solicited a meeting with the General Manager in regards to this particular resort and advised him about the way the hotel is ran. We couldn't wait for the week to finish and get back to Canada. There was a total lack of services at this property, people waiting to be tipped when the property is all inclusive with gratuities and taxes and tips included.My son was sick upon returning to Canada for 1 week with fever and Salmonela aquired while there and so was I.The beach was nice, the room decorations were very artistic and the weather was decent, however I had my worst vacation in the last 20 years.I have advised the Manager of that hotel that will be turning people away from Dominican Republic, which I did recently. Advised one of my clients to go to Jamaica to one of the RIU HOTELS in Negril, which she did and came back and had only praises for me and for sending her to that particular hotel in Jamaica. So, if you go to Dominican Republic and in particular to this hotel, you enter at your own risk, hope that you will get out of it OK, though..M.N. - Travel AgentAmerican Express Toronto, Canada

<Content>Ok stay, beautiful resort, bad Food! My wife and I just got back from a 1 week stay (Nov. 20th-27th) at the Caribe princess. Overall it was a lousy place to stay, but very beautiful as well. We arrived at 5:30 pm, way past the 3 pm check in time so we got our room promptly. The put us on the shuttle bus to take us with our luggage to our room because they are too far to walk with bags in tow. The room was simple, clean, but basic. Fridge had 4 bottles of pop and a large bottle of water, restocked everyday. Good AC, safe costs $20 per week extra, TV had decent channel selection (including HBO, showtime), but need top request the remote from the reception. We are easy to please, so no problem with the room. The beach was beautiful, clean, with white sand and blue water. Some waves but remember all these hotels are on the Atlantic side of the island, so waves are expected, even though they get broken down significantly by the barrier reef infront of the beach. Many topless women from europe which were heavily represented by the spanish tourists. The activities staff worked long hours and tried hard to keep the atmosphere funlike. The 3 swiming pools were beautiful, eventhough sometimes they had some tree leaves blown into by the wind. The bars were ok, typical of the all inclusive, in general the tropical drinks had plenty of alcohol, too much for our tatse, so often we asked for little alcohol. Try the Banana mama, great taste! The beer was below ok, but again no big complains.They had a show everynight at 9:45 pm, which was very boting, mostly spoked in spanish with little translations, and repetitive music, dancing, basically a waste of time.We went to the disco one night after the show, around 11:15 pm. They were playing merenge music, and had free drinks only until midnight. We waited for them to vary the music, and finally gave up at 12:40 am, so we left, not worth paying for drinks to listen to the same music.The biggest problem was the food, it was horrible, the worst of any all inclusive we had in as many as 7 other resorts from previous trips. The buffet food had weird taste, looked ok, but smelled and tasted bland or funny. The fuits were a disastor, the water melon were practically white in color, often cut p into small pieces as if for a fruit salad. The meloon was tasteless, so was the pinaple. The bana were ok. After the first night at the buffet we decided we will only eat the specialty resturants. Well, the next 5 nights we tried them all (1 per night, as we had to reserve every morning starting at 8:30 am). 1- The chinese (Shanghai) resturant: Was overall the best of the bunch, nice seating, somewhat attentive staff. when you sit down they bring you plate of 3 sushi pieces, which my wife loved (I gave her mine). Next they bring a tasty appetiser of egg rolls, chicken and meet on skewers, very good. We ordered siup which was bad, basically soy sauce with pieces of chicken and other stuff. The main dishes selection were below average to average, nothing fancy. The desert was fried icecream which was good.2- The Brazilian (Rodizio) resturant:. Was terribe fake, an abomination of a brazilian food. My wife is Brazilian and I have been to Brazil 8 times, love the Churasco food from there. We went with big anticipation and walked out angry , disappointed, and my wife embarressed for all brazilians to have anyone think that food was brazilian. It turns out they have a Dominican cook making his version of he he thought was Brazilian food, so the result was a disastor. AVOID!3- The Mexican (Sombrero) resturant: This one was ok, the slasa and chips were bad, the food was below average but ok. The service was very slow here, unorganized, as the staff are over worked. My wife's chicken Fahita was small bits of fatty chicked, came cold (not to mention no sizzle in the skillet). My steak was lukework, rather thin, but ok. 4- The Italian (Mama mia) resturant: THis one was ok to good, the salad bar was well presented , tried hard to look like italian, but tasted somewhat lacking, yet good enough (considering our expectations were lowered in the last 3 days already). Go eat there, your best choice anyway.5- The Dominican resturant: SIMPLY Gross, horrible food, came cold, propably was taken from the buffet section that was having a Domincan night. Please don't go there, my wife almost vomited on the table. We walked out hungry and ate some fruit and desert from the buffet.Take a bike (a clunker ) from the hotel and ride to the Bavaro shopping (5 minutes away) where you can get some souvenirs, bargain hard, and start walking out to see the prices drop 50-75%.The resort had good tennis courts and decent rackets!We took a tour to Marinarium, snorkel with the Nurse sharks and sting rays, don't be afraid, those sharks are well fed and not interested in people. For scuba divers, don't waste ur money diving on the atlantic side, very rough, bad visibility, little sea life. I took instead a dive tour to Catalina Island, well worth it, and by the way, walk to the Paradisius hotel beach to the right and get the much better price for that 2 dive tour to Catalina (Certified only ) for $130 total instead of the $176 at the Caribe dive shop.Finally, the Manati park tour was ok, cost 25 with out dolphine swim, or $75 with Dolphine swim. I opted for no swim, but wife did it, it was an 8 minute encounter with 3 dolphines, good for those who love this stuff.Hope I was able to help you all decide.

<Content>Mexico is better My husband and I just returned from Punta Cana staying at the Caribe Princess. This was our anniversary present to each other. We found the hotel accomodations average, the food was terrible, and the service poor. The hotel was all inclusive, however, you had to make reservations to eat and if you wanted a brand name alcohol, i.e. Absolute, Heineken, etc., you had to pay extra. We were never told that men had to wear long pants in order to have dinner at the restaurants. Note, that we never go to places that require dressing up on vacation. I must admit, that the beaches were beautiful as well as the weather. I was just expecting a little more since my vacation last year was an all inclusive in Mexico. We upgraded our room so that the refrigerator would be stocked with beer and soda, however, unless we begged everyday for the beer and soda, it was not there. Next year we are heading back to Mexico. Another note, unless you speak Spanish, French or German, you will not understand or be understood.

<Content>Stay Away from this one Let's begin by saying that although there were some good things about this resort, everyone in our transfer bus who stayed at Caribe Club Princess felt like they have wasted their vacation. THE GOOD: Spacious, well air conditioned rooms with king size beds. Soda mini bar restocked generously with every service. Three huge gorgeous swimming pools. Great beach. Even better TV channel line-up (HBO, Stars, USA, FX, TNT, TBS, ESPN, CNN HN, etc.) THE BAD: The rooms are a walk from the lobby and the theater (there's a shuttle running all the time), which makes for a hectic check-out and is an inconvenience. The swimming pools are poorly cleaned. The towels, beach towels, and the linens are in desperate shape, with stains and holes. Our sheets covered only about 80% of the king-size mattress, exposing what lies beneath. The evening shows ---- (what did you exect? you have to wait for every phrase to be poorly translated into four languages). You have to pay for your drinks at the disco after midnight. No waiters around the pools. Maids forget to service your room some days (one out of seven for us). NOBODY speaks English - a whole lot worse than at the other resorts we've been to, it creats a lot of frustration when you want a drink, when you order your meal at the restaurant, when you need something repaired, when you ask something out of the ordinary from the front desk, etc. etc. The restaurants are understaffed making for a super slow service. Ok, enough bad. Now...THE UGLY: Two words: the food. Both me and my fiancee got food poisoning. Mine lasted for three days, after which I only consumed rice for the rest of the vacation. Hers started after I was healed and is still with her five days later. At the buffet, the selection is miserable and repetitive. 8 choices of dishes for every meal, plus a pasta guy, some sort of a grill or paella guy, sandwich stand, french fries and hot dogs. Everything is undercooked, greasy, exposed to heat and humidity all day long in an open structure. Not much better at the restaurants. Some dishes simply tasted awful. Others were taken from the buffet. I can't say enough horrible things about the food at this resort, and for an all-inclusive that's a huge deal. One more word of advice: if you take a late shuttle flight, you will still be kicked out at 12pm on your last day, and then offerred a filthy courtesy room to change and shower before your flight. I was fine with it, but it's not for the more squeemish.

<Content>Wavy waters. My fiance茅 and I just returned from Club Caribe staying Oct 30th to Nov 6th. We had a wonderful time. But before you go, determine if you are a beach person or a water person. The sandy beaches stretch for miles. This is great if you enjoy long walks along the shore. The water however is constantly moving with waves above 4 feet. The undertoe is very strong so I advise parents to keep a close eye on their young ones.Swimming: The booey marks the boundries which a swimmer should remain in. Otherwise the motorboats that frequent outside these boundries will run you over with very little regards to your safety. Snorkeling: There are none within resort beaches since the booey usually stays within coral regions. You can however take 1 hour trips outside these boundries to snorkel costing you 20$ us per person.Sunbathing: There are more than enough parasol (beach huts) to go around for everyone. The sand is gorgeous and I reccomend the walk along the beaches at night.Excursions: Please take the time to do Marinarium. This is a 4 hour excursion provided by your travel agency. The fun includes swimming out in the BEST coral reefs in Punta Cana (by the way,... bring your flippers,... even if you have to rent them out of your resort, and if you are a good swimmer, ditch the floating device). Bring bread and stuff them in an empty bottle. Bring this with you and you will see all types of fishes dance around you for food. You also get to swim with Nurse Sharks and Sting rays. This happens in the enclosed area for about an hour. There are about 4 sharks and 3 Stingrays. It was really cool to see them up close. Finally this trip ends with a dip into the natural pool. This is the clearest, freashest and the most calmest water you will see in a natural environment. I thought this was heavenly. When you dip into this pool, most people just stand around and drink,... please please please,... ignore the booze for just a moment,.. I reccomend that you dip your head in and open your eyes,... you will be transformed into another place. Parasailing. Do this. Tip the captain an extra 3$ and he will take you out where you can see Bull Sharks, Sturgeons, Finned Fish, and Turtles from above. We saw them all. All in all,.. food was average, room service was good. It's a wonderful place to take your kids as well.So go there and bring lots of US $. The Machines only spit out pesos.

<Content>Great resort!!! I stayed at the Caribe Club Princess from Oct. 22 to Oct 29 and loved every minute of it. I reccomend anyone who wants to travel to the Dominican Rep. to pick this resort. Although I have seen some bad reviews on this hotel, I really don't understand where they came from. The staff, the beach, the disco, the food, the room.. all wonderful.I had a problem with a lost item, and Ricardo, the hotel night manager went out of his way to give me his personal camera to take my pictures for a whole day. That is just one example of how wonderful all of the staff was. I plan to go back there as soon as I get some more $. Loved the disco, the music is amazing, I bought the cds and i'm still lisening to the music.I miss everyone very much..Kisses to Ricardo, Eduardo, Kelvin and Alejandro!!! Thank you for making my stay so wonderful!! -Keep in touch-P.S. With all of the hurricane warnings, the weather there was amazing! I am darker than some of the locals... :PLuv Laura

<Content>Loved the Caribe Club Princess! We were at the Caribe Club Princess ( 2 women in their mid-thirties) October 9 to the 16th and we just loved it! The room, the food, the drinks, the beach and pools, all were quite nice, the weather was not great but we made the best of it. What makes this hotel is the staff. We have been to several hotels in Punta Cana, and the staff at the Caribe Club Princess go out of their way to make you happy. The disco was fun (too bad you must pay your drinks after 12:00) we partied until dawn a few nights. Room service is included with VIP package, and yes, the VIP package is worth it. Massage on the beach, La Cava restaurant was excellent, Budweiser beer, Heineken, etc. is available at the lobby bar. We had such a good time that we shall return to this hotel in the near future. Thanks Caribe Club Princess, we felts like royalty!

<Content>Beautiful, friendly people We stayed at the Caribe Club Princess and we had such a good time.  There was a language barrier but remember you're in an entirely different country! My cousins and I brought our spanish dictionary and when the staff saw that we were making an effort to speak their language they kept smiling! The staff were so friendly that it made the trip even more fun! Every day we met up with my cousins at the buffet and the waiters would always have our tables ready and set up for us! It seemed like they were so ready to make sure we had such a good time! We took the day trip to Santo Domingo and Saona Island pn a catamaran.. You have to do this when you visit DR! The only problem was that the guys we went with got sick off of the food... That was their problem!All of them were lactose intolerant and ate ice cream and any milky food item every day! Overall the people are tremendously friendly, the grounds gorgeous, and the sites were great!

<Content>U feel like a Princess My friend, Jouana and I, Marcela stayed there last week and believe me when it comes to beach and resort,i'm really picky.That was the best vacation ever. Everything was perfect, i've been twice to Punta Cana and the beach is fabolous, especially in Bavaro. Our hotel was the greatest in town because it was a combination of excellent customer service, fantastic animation, ultra clean rooms.They have professionals dancers and their shows are just wonderful.You have to try their beer Presidente, it's real beer, so tasty. Food was excellent and presentation was WOW! U feel that you are a princess when u stay in this hotel. The best of all, Club Caribe Princess has the best disco in town called Areito, it'a mix of rap, hip hop, '80 and Latin music. Also, this hotel is located in the heart of the happening Punta Cana. Walking distance to everything, clubs ( Mangu which is the best club in Punta Cana and Areito which is just amazing), markets, coffee shops, casinos... My friend and I had a blast staying there: Animation was fantastic, they really make you feel comfortable and you just feel that you are one of them...They used to chill with us at every moment of the day and returning to Canada ----.... If you really wants to have the best time in the island you have to go to Club Caribe Princess and we are totally down to go again in January. Believe us, it is worth it. No one will treat you like a princess unless you book at Princess... ( By the way, girls: Dominican guys are just... AMAZING)-----

<Content>Not worth the Money Just returned from Punta Cana. We reserved a room for 4 nights/5 days. The language barrier was quite frustrating, no one spoke English. We purchased the VIP which entitles you to top-shelf liquor, a 20 minute massage, three cigars, a small bottle of rum, a dinner at either the lobster or steak house, which are not included in the all-inclusive, use of bathrobes, beach towels brought nightly to room, and nightly bedding turn-down. Never saw any top-shelf liquor. Whenever we tried to order a drink, the bartender could not understand us, so we got whatever he made us. Asked for a rum  coke and got a frozen banana drink??? The massage was the best! We had dinner at the lobster house which was very nice. Never received beach towels. Only one night our beds were turned down. When I tried to get a remote control, they told me the office was closed and one would be brought to me the next day, never happened. When I called room service to have beer put in the mini bar, it never came. The first time we left our room, when we returned, our key wouldn't work. Come to find out, you must remove the key out of the slot inside the room which controls the electricity or your door key will not function. Waited over an hour for someone to come and let us in. The food was poor, definitely make sure to bring Imodium! I purchased little gifts to give room service along with a tip. Didn't make a difference. One night, we returned to our room at 8:00 to find out that our room had not been cleaned. When we called (only because we needed fresh towels for showers), they never came. We had to track down a maid on our own and ask for towels. Yes, the ladies go topless on the beach. I was glad I didn't bring my teenage boys; they would have never left the beach! Overall, I would not return to DR mainly because of the language barrier. When you need something, it is very difficult to communicate. I believe sometimes even ignored because of it.

I went to the caribe club princess with my boyfriend in september 2005. we are in our mid-20's and we absolutely loved it ! if you are planning to go to this hotel, here are some suggestions:-food: italian and mexican: excellent. dominican: AMAZING (we went twice in 1 week) chinese: ok, we had to re-order two other plates because the lobster was discusting, the beef chow ming was good. buffet: was very good, breakfast and lunch was excellent-beach: amazing !!!!-shopping: you HAVE to bargain, they tell you ridiculous prices, and they hassle you ALOT !!! you'll hear LOOKY LOOKY alot while shopping-staff: if you are nice to them, they are nice to you, and you don't have to give tip to get service, although they apreciate tip at the bars and especially at the club.-discotheque: not very busy but the animators make it fun, the alcoohol is only free until midnight, so drink up !-animation/activities: loved the poolside animations, did the banana boat (fun but your legs and arms are gonna hurt), and the snorkling was fun.we would definitely go back to this resort, this hotel was everything we were expecting, good food, nice beach and relaxing !!!

<Content>Great place to vacation My boyfriend travelled to Punta Cana from September 24 to October 1 to the Caribe Club Princess on an all inclusive vacation. I have to rate it as an above average vacation due to a many factors I will list.1. We went at low season so the place was not busy during the week which gave us the opportunity to eat in the nice restaurants each night; at high season it is almost impossible to eat in the restaurants because of limited seating2. the beach. We always got a chair under the palm trees now matter what time of day3. the pool. we always got a chair under the palm trees now matter what time of day.4. very peaceful due to the lack of alot of people; there were alot of people but not overcrowded5. we got prompt and good service from the bars and restaurants 6. The only down part of the whole trip was the buffet; they are feeding alot of people so the food is not always the greatest but most of it is ok; if you can get into the restaurants at night you're doing better and will have a much nicer stay7. the shopping was unlike Canadian shopping; barter barter barter; start by knocking 50% off there asking price and then barter down from thereBring lots of sunscreen; you're going to need it; it's very expensive to buy more in the stores; about three times as much in CanadaAll in all a very enjoyable week; I would definately go back and would recommend Punta Cana to my friends; I got back here today about 2 p.m. and I'm ready to go back

<Content>Beautiful Resort We booked the Tropical Princess VIP package for Aug. 28 - Sept. 4/05. However, when we arrived at the resort we were provided with Caribe Club Princess bands as they were the ones that gave us the VIP status. First of all I must say depending on when you travel to Punta Cana will determine whether or not you should purchase the VIP status. Since we went during a non-peak season we found the VIP very useful. VIP included premium drinks (e.g. Johnny Walker Black and Red Label, Heineken, Miller Genuine Draft, amaretto), two twenty minute massages, one a'la carte restaurant either at the La Cava (steakhouse) or El Pescador (seafood) - 25 USD if purchased at the resort, two scuba dives if certified (would cost 49 USD/dive or discounted 2 USD for each additional dive you plan to do if you don't have this package), for each member you travel with you get one hour of internet for free (5 USD for 30 minutes if you have to pay at the hotel), but the best part of the VIP status was the fact that you can go to ALL of the restaurants on the hotel grounds for FREE (e.g. Shangai (chinese), Mexican, Mama Mia (Italian). Without the VIP it will cost you 8 USD / person to dine in those restaurants. Just a side note if you choose just a standard room, you will get to dine in the buffet, and two a'la carte restaurants which are the Brazillian and the El Pilon (Dominican). We did not enjoy the Brazillian restaurant - should have listened to the other reviews on this site as I found we wasted our evening dinner dining there. I was advised by one of the bartenders that the VIP is a good purchase right now since there were maybe 500 people at this resort and we were able to use all the services without any problems, however, during their peak season (approx 2500 people at the resort) it may be difficult to book restaurants, massages, diving, etc since they are limited on space. For example in the restaurants excluding the buffet you may be able to seat between 20 - 30 people every hour. And since there are only three different times to choose from - the reservations will fill up quickly. Therefore, watch the timing when you plan to book the VIP status. Our room was good it had a king sized bed, couch, table and fridge which was always stocked up with a large container of water, two cokes and two sprite bottles. Our TV worked and the water pressure was okay in the washroom. Just a note on the last day at the resort, we think they turned off the hot water in the shower as everyone who decided to take a shower before home time got a cold shower. In addition, the phone lines were cut off so you are unable to make calls out to your friends to wake them up so make sure you ask the front desk for a wake up call.The diving was alright. Maximum dive was about 14 metres. They offered various dive sites including caves and wreck dives. We went to the disco one night but found it played a lot of Rap music. In general, the service was very good there. The food was good, especially the El Pescador restaurant. If you can you should request to have them serve you the El Pescador menu inside the La Cava restaurant (as this is air conditioned and the other is outside by the beach). Just a side note- the meal is worth the 25 USD if you have to pay for it. We had the grilled lobster (it was HUGE) dinner, and seafood salad which was absolutely delicious!!!! The Shangai restaurant was also good.. you must try the deep fried ice cream!! Mama mia was alright, El Pilon (Domincian is good.. must try the steak but stay away from the crab with cream sauce unless you like to eat the shell pieces, never got to try the Mexican so I can't comment on that one. For those of you who want to buy souveniors, you must go into town. If you wish to take a cab it will costs you 5 USD one way. Go to hut number 14 first as you will meet a guy there named Frank. He speaks English and used to live in Scarborough, Ontario. He also does not give you the run around on prices and will give you an honest price on all this items in his store. Make sure you check him out first so you don't end up paying something outrageous for an item you could have got for a heck of a lot cheaper.Overall I would rate this as an above average resort. The beach is white sand and just amazing!!!

<Content>out of this world trip my husband and two kids travelled to punta cana and stayed at the caribe clubfrom aug 14-21aug2005. we had the most amazing time of our life. Therewere lots of activities. The food at the buffet was almost the same everyday but what you do i try something different everyday because you cannot all thatfood in one day. The line up for the a la carte was long but if you got there early before 8:30 a.m. that was not a problem. The best a la carte restaurant was the pilon which was the local dominican food. the hotel room was clean,no problems with the washroom or airconditioning. I do not know what people expect when they go on a trip and stay in a hotel. The pressure in the showerwas a little bit slow at times but remember how many people are showeringat the same time. The air canada rep was kind of helpful. He was mainly trying to get us to buy one of the tours that he was on. I think he works on a commission. The staff was always friendly greeting you with hola. The animation staff was amazing and the all spoke many different languages. The chairs at the beach was not a problem. You get up early usually we sat the same spot so our chairs were always available. Then we would go havebreakfast and back to the beach to either bathe or suntan. I participated inmost of the actitivities daily and was very sad to go. The shows at night were awesome. They would always have audience participation in a game show before the actual show started and that was funny to look at. Theirtheme song on the pool and at the closing of every show is to die for. i would recommend this hotel and trip to anyone of my friends and family. i had a great time and would go back next week if i could. There is a gift shop on the compound but i woud not recommend buying there, it is really overpriced. we went to the local flea market where you can bargain but i hate how the locals hustle you in their stores and even on the streets walking back to the hotel.

<Content>Caribe Club was amazing! We stayed at Caribe Club Princess for one week from August 21st-August 28th/05. My boyfriend and myself (both in our 20s) think that this resort deserves at least 4 stars, if not 4.5. Flight was great. We flew with Air Canada vacations and they put us in first class both ways which was awesome.Resort is beautiful. Lots of plantation and beautiful scenery. You have to walk or take the shuttle bus to get around but we enjoyed the leisurely walks and found the shuttle to run quite frequently.Rooms were great. We had a huge room and bed. Had a coffee table, desk, couch and dining table. Maids kept the room very clean. One criticism - mini bar was not always stocked.Buffet was not amazing, but I always found something to eat..and I am quite a picky eater. A la carte restaurants were really, really good. We ate at them every night. Two favorites were Shanghia and Mama Mia. Fried ice cream at shanghai is to die for! We had to line up to make reservations, but it was worth it. We are not big drinkers so I can't really critique the bars, but the wait staff always refilled drinks before you were finished.Service was great. Most staff spoke English..and French..and Italian..and Dutch. Everyone was very helpful, especially restaurant staff. Animation and entertainment were amazing. We went to three shows and they were all great. Daytime activities included archery, ping pong, water aerobics, spanish dancing, water polo and many more.We never had a problem getting a chair at the beach or at the pool, regardless of what time we went. I was a bit disappointed with the beach though....I expected clear waters but there were a lot of waves and the water was murky. We opted to stay at the pool for the majority of our stay.We didn't go to the night club at all so can't comment on it. Went to the casino once...not many people there. We one $4.Try not to buy anything on the resort, everthing is overpriced (as with any resort). Be sure to bargain (a lot!) if you buy souveniers off the resort. Overall, we had an amazing vacation. I would go back there in a second. If you have specific questions, feel free to email.

<Content>Wow, wow, wow!!!!!!!!!! My family and I just came back from this resort. We loved it. Our three teenagers just had a blast. While they were involved in many activities, my husband and I sat by the pool or just sat under a palapa on the beach with a nice cold drink in our hands. I will have to say, that this has been one of the best vacations ever. Other than not getting two adjoining rooms as we had requested, everything was just great.The food, service, entertainment, drinks, rooms, and the entire resort were all great. No complaints.The beach is the most beautiful beach I have ever seen. it is very clean and clear. I loved the beech so much that I would get up at 5:00am every morning to walk along the beach and see the sunrise. It was just beautiful. Our Apple Vacation rep was just great; very informative. Thank you TONY!This is the place to go. We have decided to go back to Caribe Club Princess next year. I can't wait!!!

<Content>Pleasant, Enjoyable, Relaxing Vacation My husband and I stayed here from the 3rd through the 7th and we will return here before going anywhere else in the Caribbean. From check-in to check-out the service was excellent. There's a tram which transports you from the reception area to the rooms/villas.....but if you're impatient, I can see you walking. The entire resort is very inviting with a large reception area where you can enjoy your drinks before the show. The landscaping is well kept and well lit for nightly walks.If you're an active person, their staff keeps you busy with daily activities and tours. They even approach you so you can participate and are very informative. Just the same, if you just want to be a couch potatoe, they get the hint and leave you alone.The ocean, the best I've seen on the East Coast. Not Cancun, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Florida can compare. THIS IS A BEACH. It is clean, clear, sandy in/out; no shells/rocks; kinda like Florida eight years ago.Food/water, no complaints. My husband has a sensitive stomach and the Pepto came back to the states sealed. The repellent spray also came back sealed. Amazingly with all their woody-beautiful landscaping, not one mosquito bit me. What we did use was the Advils after the nights of drinking. And yes they do know how to make american drinks. They might be weak but if you communicate they'll make it stronger. If you're nice to them they're NICER.....no problems anywhere. Highly recommend the Buffet at all times. They do a great job in accomodating foreigners. Even a picky eater will find something appetizing to eat.Only downfall was that my expectations of a five star hotel was going to compare with those of the states and reality is that they have their own standards. But just the same, it was very clean, great service and well stocked.Suggestion, everybody is different! You have to try it for yourself. After reading some reviews before our vacation we actually considered changing the location, but boy are we glad we didn't.All-in-all, a great vacation!

<Content>Loved it!!!! Absolutely Fantastic My friends and I went the first week of august with air transat and I can honnestly say that it was a perfect vacation from the beginning to end. I loved that resort, everything about it. First of my vacation was so unexpected I never wanted to go in the first place to Punt cana but my friends really wanted to and then why not after all a week of relaxation and beautiful beach. I had the best time and I would so go back there, it definitely is a 4 +star resort. First it's a huge resort and we were well located. When we got there, I told the guy at teh desk that I wanted to be well centered in the middle of everything and he did. We were in the third building which is perfect 2 sec from the swim up bar pool and beach and right in across the buffet. BTW, when we reserved it says that this hotel has 1 pool, nope there are 4 pools I don't know why it said that. The best pool is the one with the swim up bar because all the animation and all the fun is there. Beautiful pool perfect water and very clean. The people there are constantly working to keep everything intact and perfect.The location is beautiful with its gorgeous vegetation and amazing weather, not one day it rained. Now, I have to say that normally I never really pay attention to the animation but this rseort no wonder it is known for that, AMAZING animation. The people there are awesome super nice and there is so much animation from early the morning till late at night. I loved their theme song that played everyday at the pool and people dancing salsa to it. We would get up early tan at the pool watch the animation a little-take a drink and then afterwards to the beach since it's right there and then go back at the pool. You have the choice to have fun with them at the pool or relax at the beach. BTW Chopel Israel you rock man! I really was sad to leave I had so much fun with the people that worked over there as well as the people that come from different countries to work there such as Italie, France and others so overally there was an excellent blend of different people. I made so many new friends. Now there are many different restaurants and 1 great huge buffet. I loved the buffet there was everythingfor every taste, I'll be honest I tried only 2 restaurants, they were not bad at all. Loved the creperie amazing we would all go there during the middle of the day and order different crepes delicious. I would always try to eat well because I was scared to get stomache ache which I didn't get the whole trip fewww. Although I did eat a lot, but not eating too much meat, more salads with pizza fish rice etc. At night, there are a lot of shows and then we would go at the club. I can honnestly say that I had an amazing time with my friends and with my new friends. I so did not expect all of this; I really thought it'd be maybe boring vacation was so wrong. I relaxed while enjoying myself. If anyone wonder this hotel is really for everyone. There were families with their grown up children, young and old couples everything. Before I left i was scare that there would only be families or grown ups not at all, we were all around the age of 22- 28 and there were a lot of people around our age, it was a blast, I'll never forget this vacation. There are also a couple of shops close to the hotel, btw I would recommend this hotel because we would always walk on the beach and this hotel is really well center, some hotels are really far from everything. I will definitely go back there again very soon. For anyone who is going try to go when it's really happening probably july, august or the winter that's when it's really fun and animated. I'll never forget my vacation, FANTASTIC HOTEL , I'm not surprise all the princess hotels are amazing and I've travelled a lot!

<Content>Our Family Had A Great Time Our family of 4 stayed at the Caribe Club Princess August 3 - August 10, 2005. My husband and I are in our 30's and we have two boys ages 8 and 11. We had a wonderful time in Punta Cana and thought the Caribe Club Princess hotel was great.When we arrived at the hotel, we were able to check in immediately and went to our room. Our luggage arrived within 10 - 15 minutes. We had the Caribe Suite which had 2 double beds and a sofa that was actually a 3rd bed.The hotel grounds are beautiful. The Dominicans who work at the hotel were all very friendly and very helpful. The two pools were very big and were always clean when we were there. The only issue with the pools is you have to be out to reserve your chairs by 7:00AM, if not, you most likely would not be able to have a chair to lounge in that day.The beach is gorgeous. There were workers out raking the seaweed first thing every morning.I thought the different restaurants catered to just about everyone's wants. My children and I are picky eaters, and always managed to find something we liked to eat. The 2 restaurants we did not care for were the Mexican and the Brazillian. The main buffet always had a good selection of foods and mixed it up a little every day. We had a great time and would recommend this hotel to others.

<Content>Great stay My wife and I, and our two kids stayed a week in early July. The flight on USA 3000 was not too bad; for most airlines the days of comfort and good food are gone. We didn't expect too much, so we weren't disappointed. Arriving at the Punta Cana airport we had a wait of about 45 minutes. The officials were poker faced but not unfriendly. We had some difficulty finding our Apple guide, but once on the bus we were headed the right way. The ride was bumpy, and we had our first introduction to roads in this country - equivalent to a long ride on a stallion barely broken in. Another wait, this time a longer one, in the lobby of the Hotel Carribe Princess. We walked about in the scorching hot sun, parched  exhausted, then returned to the lobby. We did this several times, and each time learned the room was still not ready. The desk people said the problem was a late check out as if this was sufficient explanation and a complete justification. We finally got keys to our room around 5:30 pm. The keys did not fit. And that brings us to the only serious deficiency in the service -- the front desk was badly organized in every respect -- more about this later. English was minimal, and you must not expect any real fluency. A cram course in basic Spanish two weeks before we left Cleveland helped somewhat. Before jumping into the positives, which are many, I will complete my criticism of the front desk by saying that on the morning of our departure they forgot our wake-up call, throwing us into a panic and the only really unpleasant exchange I had with the staff. But that was the front desk. Now on to the good things. The grounds are gorgeous, and the beach perfect. This must be one of the most beautiful beach strips in the world. Last year we were at Cancun (Playa Maya, or something like) and this beach was even cleaner. Our hotel room was very good. Maid service was adequate, with a bit of prompting. As other tourists have remarked, a few dollar bills handed out here and there did not seem to be appreciated as much as our thanks and friendliness -- a phenomenon rare in the States, to say the least. Hotel staff were extremely accommodating, and when they discovered you had a preference for something, they brought you great quantities of it. The television channels were fascinating, especially if you enjoy foreign cultures and know a bit of other languages. Our balcony overlooked the most popular pool, and the leader of the water games, which commenced every morning, was a bit too loud, but we got used to it. We slept well at night, and noticed very few insects.  The food was excellent. A few times we were not completely sure what we were eating, but it was always delicious. The blends of fruit juices were especially appreciated. The Pescador, basically a fish restaurant but with all-around snacks, helped fill in between the three meals of the day. The largest and main restaurant (whose name I forget) was always well supplied with food of every description. To see the staff at work was amazing. The Prussian army was never better organized or harder working. Staff seemed actually to enjoy serving you and going out of their way to make you happy. I should mention a quaint shortage of spoons that seemed to recur every day, but that was a very minor occurrence. We had a meal at three of the other restaurants (Chinese, Italian, and Brazilian), but the main restaurant was the best. We missed the bus trip to Santa Domingo, but we did take the Safari bus through the Eastern part of the country. I can only say this is the most beautiful terrain I have ever seen. The plant life is a miracle, and if you have a scientific bent, you will enjoy taking in some of the marvelous ecosystems.  Finally, the people. They are universally sweet, friendly and good looking. Of course they are poor, and I wonder whether, if riches from industrialization ever come to this place, they will change. I hope not. We stayed a week, mainly because an ill-informed travel agent said there was a risk of being bored on a longer stay. I wish we could have stayed a month.

<Content>4 star is accurate We had a fabulous time 鈥?we really enjoyed it. There were a few not so great points - but if we were to do it all again - we'd book again. Price was right and we had fun. I think we may have been disappointed if we had paid what the brochure listed as full price. Don't think we'd go back for a second time to this one though. Once was great - but enough. The resort is definitely a 4 star (or maybe 3.5) - but not more. VIP was offered at an extra $100 US each. We declined and did not miss it at all - it was not necessary.  Beach was fabulous - waves were really rough though. We loved the waves - but if we had kids I might be concerned about them in the water.  Food was not so good. The buffet rarely changed and the a la cartes (when you could get in) were basically the same food on the buffet - only they brought it to you. The restaurants were very noisy and there was always a crying child at the next table. We stopped going to the al a cartes for these reasons and because you had to line up for reservations on a daily basis. We didn鈥檛 go to the restaurants that cost extra; everything seemed to come out of the same kitchen, so we didn鈥檛 feel like the extra cost would be worth it. If we were going to spend extra 鈥?we鈥檇 spend at a local restaurant off the resort. We ended up going to The Jellyfish Restaurant, and it was amazing - the food was so good! It was a beautiful place on what seemed like a deserted beach (there were resorts on either side - but you couldn't really tell from where we were sitting). We'd go back to Punta Cana just to eat there again... The resort staff was really great - with a couple exceptions everyone went out of their way to make you happy (we tipped quite a bit). The maid that did our room was really good 鈥?remembering to stock our fridge with beer and diet coke (I requested diet instead of regular on our first day). The only disappointing service we had was on check in when the man at the front desk kept on asking for my boyfriend. He didn't seem to want to deal with a woman. He gave us the keys to the room 鈥?but we had to ask repeatedly for a key to the safe and for a remote for the television. I also asked if we had a third floor room he ensured us that we did - and then flagged the person behind us up to the counter - dismissing us. He did not tell us where our room was - didn't offer any direction whatsoever. The resort is quite spread out - the walk was about 10 minutes from lobby to rooms... so it took us a quite some time to find the room, we carried our own bags.Carrying our bags was not such a big deal - we are young - but I wouldn't really think my Father would appreciate that service. We found our room on the ground floor (not the 3rd). The sliding door lock was broken... toilet ran too. I had to walk back to the lobby because the operator hung up on me every time I tried using the phone. This time, I spoke to someone different (who was great), but resort was over booked - not enough rooms to go around so there was no switching of rooms - but he sent someone over immediately to fix the door (there was a repair man there before I made it back to the room). We kept the room - didn't ask to change again. Room was clean and maids were great.... air conditioning was wonderful. The only other service issue we had was with the on site Air Canada rep 鈥?it seemed to us that their positions must be commission based. The rep didn't seem too interested in giving us any direction on anything other than the tours they were selling. We don't like tours - we like to explore on our own - just would have liked to have the guidance of a local who understood what we were looking for - not what we would pay for. Once the rep realised that 鈥?it became clear that that we were not going to get much in the advice department. We inquired about another restaurant that we heard was great and asked for advice on the best way to get there. We were told us it was quite far and we should eat at the resort restaurants that the resort charged extra for. We had no interest in that option - so the Captain Cook package was recommended. We also asked about the public busses - but the rep made it obvious we were not going to receive any help by turning away and making a cell phone call.  The rep did give good general tips at the welcoming - warning about drinking the water, and the coconut drinks... told us approximate prices of rum and cigars - and talked about bargaining with the locals on the beach. It was then suggested, if we were interested, that we visit a friend's factory - fixed prices and good jewellery. We did go there - but it was a small room with rum, some jewellery, which was a bit over priced, and one guy rolling cigars. Cigars were good quality - but the prices were in line with the established brands.  The pools were nice, but not very relaxing; the 2 main pools had loud music and constant activities and the 鈥渜uiet鈥?pool was over run with children. The pools closed at 7 for cleaning. We didn鈥檛 find that at the adult only resorts 鈥?but I suppose with that many kids in the pools, a major chemical cleaning is needed on a daily basis.The bar staff was excellent 鈥?but the drinks were very inconsistent - never tasted the same - but they did have a ton of alcohol... what more do you need? Always some place to sit at the beach and at the pool, but you did have to get up early if you wanted to reserve a lounger with shade. Animation staff was good - not too pushy - but were inviting enough if you could be swayed to join in. Never hit the casino or the club... can't stay up that long anymore.We loved our vacation ... would recommend it to some friends - but not to others... if you are looking for a great beach and a relaxing time and food is not your main concern - it's great. I would also recommend it for families. I鈥檓 glad we went, the price was right and we had a great time!

<Content>If you want this ocean, stay in the states While the resort was nice, I was very disappointed in the ocean. I had never been to the Dominican and expected a tropical paradise. What I found was a beach and ocean that looked exactly like Panama City Beach, FL! Granted, palm trees do not exist on Panama City Beach like they do in Punta Cana, but if you're going to trade ocean for ocean, Florida is more beautiful AND American! I don't care what anyone tells you, the language IS a barrier! They take a stab at Americanizing the food, but it's just plain awful (I admit, I'm a fairly picky eater and if you are too, good luck!). I tried ordering room service our last morning there and the person who answered said she did not speak English and hung up on me! I called customer service and they said they would order room service for me - but it never came. To give them credit, I did order room service several times before that with no problem and it was promptly delivered.If you don't drink beer, good luck finding a consistent drink to order. Every bartender has their own way of making a drink. I finally happened upon the Blue Caribbean which was pretty good (make sure you tell them you want rum in it and ask for mucho ice - they are very skimpy on the ice and your drink is warm before you even make it back to the beach)The grounds are wonderfully kept, our room was nice  cold, and the maid service was excellent. I've read differing views on the VIP - I think it was worth it. We had a complimentary small bottle of rum and cigars in our room. We had nice terry cloth robes to wear and slippers. We received vouchers for a free 20 minute massage, and vouchers for a free hour of a water sport. What we did was turn our 20 minute massage into an hour by paying an additional $35 - it was worth it! The massage was great! The guys got to drink Heineken, Bud  Miller Lite (the Bud  Miller where a little harder to come by though)This did look like a kid friendly place, although there is major toplessness going on. We've been to Tulum, Mexico and Cancun and the toplessness there was probably 10%. I would say the toplessness in Punta Cana is more like 50%. You certainly get an eye full but it's amazing how quickly you getted used to it.I have maybe become a little jaded now with all-inclusive resorts because they are starting to all seem the same. That's why I was hoping for breathtaking scenery because I knew the food wouldn't be so good. Don't let anyone tell you there's great bargains to be had here - there aren't. If you walk towards the ocean from the resort and go to your left about a 1/2 mile (around the bend), there is a row of vendors out to make a buck. You might find something to take home after some haggling but no great deals because everything is pretty much junk to begin with.All in all, it's a vacation and who can't have a good time on vacation? You're getting away from it all, drinking all you want for free. Chill out and enjoy it and maybe stockpile some food in your luggage from the gool 'ole US of A :)

<Content>Beautiful scenery I Have to say the scenery at this hotel was beautiful. I don't want to discourage anyone who has booked a trip there already. i only had a problem with the food. it looked good and tasted good, but i had stomach problems. the bars were ok. every drink tasted different. they do not use premium liquor, so if your looking for that....you better get VIP, and then only at the main lobby bar can you get premium. My travel agent advised against me getting VIP, and i am sorry i didint get it. The pool and the beach were very beautiful. This is a great place to bring small children, but there really isnt any thing for teens( 10-15) to do. I didint see any bugs at all. the rooms were very clean and so were the grounds. Rooms service was always prompt. Most of the people are pleasant, but some are not. you need to brush up on your spanish. When you arrive at the airport.. be prepares to fill out a green card and pay 10.00 to enter the country. the green cards are located in the center of the lobby when you get off the plane. use the bell boys at the airport, they are very helpful and make sure you tip them. they appreicate the tip, not like the pool bartenders. tip the lobby bar tenders and the food servers, they appreciate it. as far as the maids, well....i tipped them every day and didint get what i asked for, my daughters never tipped and got anything they wanted. it really was beautiful though.

<Content>SUCKED Hi Debby,We left from July 24 to July 31 to Punta Cana, and stayed at the Caribe Club Princess.The Hotel is beautiful but it is the food and the service that really really sucks.When we arrived on July 24, it took so long for them to serve us, and before we left my travel agency made sure we would get a room on the main floor because we are travelling with our daughter that is disabled. We get check in and they gave us a room on the 3rd floor, I started to pull a fit saying I cannot bring up a wheelchair on the 3rd floor you have no elevators, they kept saying I have no choice. I got so pissed off and started to scream and let everyone hear that they are the worst hotel I have seen for service, then the manager came out I explained my problem and finally after 3 hours in that heat we finally got our room on the main floor.Now for the luggage check in I noticed if you tell them bring my luggage in 10 minutes and I will tip you they fly there, that is what we did our luggages where in front of our room in 10 minutes.The thing that sucks about this is hotel is that the Reception and all the entertainment is very far from the rooms and the pool, it took us about 15 minutes to walk to the reception. It is a pain when you want to go see entertainment or shows at night to walk that distance and we got caught in the rain while walking there. There is the golf cart bus picks you up, by the time that bus comes you get there first on foot. Now the serves I would rate is Zero, I had to ask for my coffee, every morning they pretend as if they don't see you, they have no smile on there faces, it feels as if I was bothering them everytime I would ask for something. I noticed the key is to tip them, then you get good service. I feel as if I have to blackmale them for me to get served. Everytime I would ask for a towel or whatever I needed in my room I never got it.The food sucked everything did, the buffet was the same thing day in day out not alot of choice they had no hashbrown, or waffles, there fruits tasted bad ask if they were roten, the food taste as if they cook everything in one big barrel, everything I tried it had the same taste.The worst thing is that every morning you have to get up to go reserve if you want to go to A La Carte Restaurant, it is a pain to get up everymorning to go reserve they will not allow you to reserve for the week, one morning I wanted to reserve 8:00 pm for the mexican restaurant and they told me if was fully booked, I gave a her a $5 dollars US and there was room all of a sudden, I don't find that right. We went to try the brazilian restaurant guess what I told them I did not know french fries is considered brazialian the waiter gave me a dirty look, the best part they serve you the wine with an opened bottle, I told the waiter you probably fill up your bottles in the back everytime this one empty's out, and I told I am sure it is your domincan wine not Italian wine as is said on the bottle Oh yes it is Italian wine, I said really then go to the bar and get me a new bottle of wine and oped it in front of me, he started to laugh I told I am serious, so he went and get the bottle opened and poured in in my glass, the taste was 100% different from the one they pour you, I told them don't take us guest for a fool, just tell us it is Domincan wine don't lie in my face and take me for an idot, I turned around and asked the other guest that was sitting beside us to try the wine and he agreed with me it was not the same wine that he had poured from the open bottle. The other thing I find is that there is not enough bar on the resort you have to walk pretty distance to go get a drink.The have no milk in carton, when you go there it is there milk they make with powder, so if you are travelling with a child bring your own milk.The beach was nice but it was to wave for us to bring our daughter.Overall I would rate this hotel as a 2 star not 4. My best choice of hotel so far in the Domincan is Sunescape Casa Del Mar in Bayahibe, La Romana, here I feel I get treated like a queen and the ocean is to calm you can go snorling.

<Content>Great time My first trip to the Carribean and I must say it was EXCELLENT!!! I definitely recommend this resort to everyone going to Punta Cana. You won't get a better beach anywhere in Punta Cana. The food was excellent, with choices ranging from fries, burgers and pizza at the lowest to exotic seafood specialties and caribbean kitchen. Lots and lots of different refreshing drinks and don't forget to try Presidente, Dominican top beer brand (better than Heineken Coronna and Stella put together, mark my words!). Weather was excellent, sunny, not too humid and the sea was not the boring calm water. We had small fun waves all week long.Cheers,

<Content>Spend quality time with your family! HOLA! Just came back today from the resort and wanted to give my two cents worth. I traveled with my husband and three teens (17,13  13) from the 23rd till the 29th and I must say we had the best vacation ever! Sure there is going to be slight problems with the langage barrier but you will have that in any country you visit. The staff was VERY friendly (especially FABIO at the pool bar) and did their very best to accomidate our needs. The buffet was OK (go for the specialty resturants if you can, but make sure gentlemen have long pants with them because you will not be seated!). You will need to get to the concierage desk in your building by 8:00 am to wait in line to make a reservation for the speciality resturants. You will also need to get to the pool or beach by 7:00-7:30 am to reserve lounge chairs under a hut (believe me you will need that hut for the shade!) even though they say no reserving is permitted. Our suite (2 full beds and pull out couch) was clean, plently of fresh towels twice daily, 2 robes and slippers to use during the stay. The only problem with the room was the air conditioning was not cool enough. We had a problem on the second night with our door key and we called for an hour and a half before we approched management who had fixed the problem while we were at dinner. Listen if you are expecting a 5 star resort it's not. If you want a fun place to go and spend quality time with your family try it. We had the time of our life!

<Content>Leaves a lot to be desired I was here 7/20/- 7/27/05. The trip to Punta Cana was fine. We entered the hotel lobby and thats when all heck broke loose. We had the VIP package and that was our first mistake. We checked in a 1:00 p.m. The front desk said our room would be available after 3:00 p.m.. No problem or so I thought. At 3:30 we went back to hte front counter and tried to get a room. Thats when the staff looks at you kinda wierd and disappears in the back room for about 30 minutes, then return to tell you that in still not available. I came to find out that people had been there since 10:00 a.m. and still had no rooms. They were from the New York area. At approx. 6:00 p.m. there was a room available. Dont be suckered in by the superior rooms they talk about, these are just a regular room with two beds. Not much better than a cheap hotel room back here in the states. I was told that the room had a pullout couch so one of my children could sleep on that. Low and behold, we walked in and no couch. I went back to the front desk and spoke with the clerk who all of a sudden didnt understand English. It was so funny because when hear you are from the USA they start talking in Spanish not knowing that some of us spoke Spanish quite fluently. The things they said about us leaves a lot to be desired. And the faces they made when after their conversation you responded in Spanish was to die for.  I remember something my grandfather taught me and should have lsitened again to him. He said Something good aint cheap and something cheap ain't good Man was he right. Please, Please spend a few extra dollors and stay in a nicer hotel, where the staff at least speaks a little english. Everyone and I mean everyone has their hand out for a tip, good service or not. ITs a shame that to get into the fancier restaurant that you have to wait everyday at 9:00 a.m. to make the reservation. This can take at least an hour every day. I dont know about you but I want to relax on vacation, not wait in line to make a reservatio only to be told that the restaurant I want is full that night. P.S. Slip the guy a $10.00 and he will get you a reservation. This is ALL INCLUSIVE? NO money no reservation. What you have read about premium liquor in other reviews is true. This option is a joke. The only place you might, get a top shelf drink is in the lobby. Don't expect this in any other area. I was drinking whiskey and water and was told they ran out of whiskey at every bar around the pool area. Really, I dont drink that much.  One woman that came on the early flight was really upset. I felt so bad for her. She was in teas most of the time I saw her because the hotel was really sticking it to her. She got so fed up that she had gone next door to the Paradisus Hotel, paid an addtional $1400.00, yes $1400.00. to get a better hotel than this one. It was one thing after another. She understood and spoke the language. She really had em fooled. We met with the asst mgr of the hotel. his name was Ray. He kepted apologizing for his staff. Running a hotel like this is not rocket science. YOu have to have qualified staff. THIS HOTEL DOES NOT! Believe me. Thats why Im leaving my e-mail address for anyone who reads this, or for those whom I met at the hotel. Let me know how the tape turned out. You know who you are.The Apple reps on site are a joke. They couldn't answer one of our concerns or questions. The main thing they try to do is sell you these side trips. Thats how they make a commission. We woudn't buy anything unless we were compensated somehow. They just kept saying NO PROBLEM. They never did a thing.The food in the buffet was less than what I had expected. Very limited on choice of meats. Desert table was very samll with only stuff that looked like it came out of a box. YUK!. I am also adventurous when it comes to trying native dishes. Man that was a mistake. Got sick for 2 days. It seemed that the busiest table at the buffet was the one serving pasta every night. No noodles for me at these all inclusive prices. I tried to have on chef carve me a piece of smoked hame one night and he told me NO, they are serving pork on the other table. I was furious. How dare they not give you what you want. Shame Shame.  I would return to Punta Cana again, but never, never, ever recommend this hotel to anyone at this time. Maybe in a few years they might get it right. Stay away for now.  REMEMBER GRANDPA'S SAYING AS WRITTEN ABOVE.

<Content>Didn't feel like a princess I would NOT recommend this hotel. My husband and I travel each April alone without kids. The previous year we stayed at Puerto Plata and LOVED it (Viva Tangarine/Wyndham), although activities were limited there. We decided Punta Cana since thats were the activities are.We paid the extra to be upgraded to VIP. BIG BIG BIG MISTAKE....DON'T DO IT. Not worth the freebie meal.Check in - there is a line for VIP, you'll quickly realize it doesn't matterLuggage, we brought our luggage up to the check in counter, then he tells us to bring it back over to the entrance way (loved that VIP service) only for it to sit in the sea of other pieces. Waiting for the tram to take us to our rooms we realized we'd be better off to walk. So we went back for the luggage and walked it. Again, loving that VIP service.First room (yes I did say first). HORRIBLE!!!! I was crying in the room. 1. Right next to the busiest pool, loud, loud, loud.....2. Holes in the shower wall, AC unit was moldy and practically falling from the ceiling.3. TV only worked when you jiggled the electrical cord, no remote control4. Couldn't open slider door to mini balcony5. Two queen beds, we specifically asked for a KING during booking. I had it in writing!6. No lock for the safetwo hours later, we were moved to another room on the third floor (oh there are no elevators either). The room didn't have a great view but we were away from the noise and it was much cleaner. I was at least satisfied for the upcoming stay. Oh by the way, the remote control and lock for the safe....you have to get them from the front desk. Now wouldn't you think on VIP check in, those would be common items, such as a room key??? That still amazes me that we had to walk back for them. VIP service still hasn't kicked in.....the tears are still flowing.Food....it was fair, typical buffet style, the specialty restaurants were ok too. I don't go to an AI for the food.Drink....humm another so called benefit of VIP, you're entitled to premium brands....if available. Thats key...if available. We approched one of the bars and asked for a Budweiser, got two bottles then they were OUT. All of the other bars were out of BUD too. They had plenty of the local beer. It was like that for the entire stay. Never restocked. Again, VIP service....not worth it. Oh when you did get premium you'd have to sign for it. I guess my VIP braclet wasn't good enough.Specialty restuarant. We ordered a bottle of wine, price list stated $40 usd, on check out it was $45 usd. I asked why the change? He actually tried to pull off the exchange rate BS story. I quickly reminded him that the menu stated $40, I would only pay $40 and NOT a dime more. The menu did not identify an exchange ratio for wine. Nice try. They will attempt to nickle and dime you on everything.Limited english speaking employees, grounds were clean, front desk service horrible, cafeteria service horrible. Groundkeepers were the nicest and deserved the most respect. Hard workers.Activies were fun, although we had a long day trip to Catalina Island. The best times we had were the extras that we paid for.The resort is large, plenty of beach area with huts for shade, 3 pools to choose from. It would be fun for families, not very romantic but the money we paid had high expectations, they were not fulfilled. Go if you can get a budget deal, DONT PAY FOR ANYTHING UPGRADING, you'll be sorryWe paid twice the amount compared to our Puerto Plata trip and it was wasted on this crap hotel.

<Content>it was so-so me and my boyfriend travelled to punta cana this past june. one thing you need to remember is a pen....when u go to buy ur travellers card to get into the country they dont give u one...luckily we found someone nice enough to let us take theirs (its a long card to fill out). The resort was gorgeous, but it did have a nasty smell coming out of the swamp. The food however was not so good, and trust me i am not a picky eater. I was sick from it the whole week and pepto bismal is extremely expensive..$13 for a tiny bottle. Before we were able to check-in to our room we stopped at the snack bar to get a hot dog. they were on one of those heating things that you'd find in a gas station and the hot dogs were ice cold...the heater was barely on! We did eventually find some pretty good barbecue chicken by mid-week. i guess when its all-inclusive they dont really worry about the food since u already paid for it... The drinks were good but very small so we'd just order 2 or 3 at a time. and even though u don't have to tip, we did every time, its just not right not to since the staff is so nice, especially hector the pool bartender he was awesome. the staff was hard to understand but still extremely nice...everyone greeted us with an hola. it is very humid there we would put our swimsuits out to dry and they would still be soaked the next day. I would suggest the $20 snorkeling trip not the $70 from apple, it was just as nice but only an hour long as opposed to the whole day apple one, an hour was more than enough time. and the parasailing was gorgeous and not too scary coming from someone who HATES any sort of flying. we did get the VIP package but didnt even use our hour of watersports...it only included banana boats or a boat trip up and down the beach... which we basically did going to our snorkeling adventure...the water was gorgeous but hardly any waves....the free massage was very nice too... Before we left for punta cana i checked the weather forecast and it said showers and a high around 85 every day, which i thought this is great its nicer here in pittsburgh...but it only rained twice for very brief periods of time the rest of the time it was sunny and hot, perfect beach weather!! i was a little disappointed that when we talked to another couple on our plane ride home that their hotel served them fun flaming drinks and ours didnt....only being 20 we like fun stuff like that...we can drink beer out of plastic cups at home. me and the boyfriend are big gamblers so we were excited for the casino...but it was sooo small, our first night there we were the only ones in the whole place! it was kinda scary. but the later we went (it opened at 7 pm) like around 1 or 2 am the more crowded it got...we ended up coming home with what we left with so that was nice.besides that we didnt go to the club..it was only free drinks till 11 and then u had to pay and all the other bars closed at 12 which didnt leave much to do the rest of the night.. all in all we had fun, im happy just being at a beach period, and it was a very relaxing vacation but i wouldnt go back to this hotel

<Content>Check your luggages! I had a good stay, good service but they have a serious problem with the luggages managing.When we checked-in, they didn't want that we carry ourself our luggages, I waited for my luggage in my room and the luggage never came. I went back to the reception (around 1000 feet from the rooms) to see what happening and I found my luggage alone in the hall without the room tag on it, the label was tear off for I don't know why. I finally got my luggage a couple hours after.When we checked out, the luggage clerck came to the room, put the luggage in a small truck and has gone to the reception. I walked to the reception, I did my checkout at the desk and when I tried to find out my luggage, the luggage had disappeared. We tried (myself and the hotel luggages clerck) to find it but apparently my luggage has been in the wrong bus in direction of Santo Domingo.I came back home without my luggage, Princess Hotel waisted my vacations

<Content>Paradise on a budget We had the pleasure of staying here from June 9-16, 2005--Caribe Club was simply paradise on a budget....the grounds were lovely,the white sand beach  crystal blue waters were awesome  the staff were friendly and eager to make our stay a memorable one. The maids did a great job keeping up with our sandy mess  keeping our frig stocked with bottled water  beer! We did the VIP which includes unlimited room service, a massage, an hour of water sports, a half hour on the internet,  a dinner at a specialty restaurant. VIP also gives you the option of American beer (Miller Genuine Draft or Budweiser)  some top line liquors. I recommend VIP if you have it in your budget but it's certainly not necessary unless those things are important to you.Upon arrival at the Punta Cana airport you do have to purchase a tourist card ($10 US)--(they also take a festive tourist picture which you'll be able to purchase upon your departure for $8 US) The airport experience was incredible as we were whisked through customs (I think being with Apple Vacations helped here)  we were on our way to the resort by air conditioned bus within minutes after our landing!!We were greeted at the resort desk by Harry (whom we nicknamed Harry Potter)...We had a group of 9 traveling together and managed to get 3 adjacent rooms which made things easier. Don't forget to purchase your safe key at the front desk ($20 week)--I know I had read in previous reviews that you must ask for a remote for the TV at the front desk too but ours was already in our room....We had plenty of English channels (HBO  Cinnemax with plenty of great movies to choose from)  even though the majority of the staff spoke Spanish, we could convey our needs easily so the language barrier was not that big of a deal....Rooms were colorful and clean (thanx Ana)-- although one room did tend to have a musty smell (probably due to recent rains) I'm sure they would've given us a different room but we never complained... Fortunately, we didn't spend much time in the room and I had packed Bounce dryer sheets to put among our clothes to keep them smelling fresh...I had also packed citronella incense --thinking it would ward off mosquitos...we used it to cover the musty smell...I had packed insect repellent also, but honestly didn't have much of a problem with bugs all week..I recommend packing nice sized mugs to take along with you to the bars (We were celebrating PC's graduation  my friend thought to order keepsakes for us with Punta Cana 2005 engraved -Thanx C!!) The bartenders were fabulous--they'd rinse out and refill our mugs with a smile..Thanx Hector  Jaquin)...Pina Coladas were yummy!!!JC (from the activities staff) did his best to try and keep us active...although we loved the lazy days just laying on the beach. The younger crowd with us tried parasailing,kayaking,the water bike,snorkeling,pool olympics,horseshoes,ping-pong, banana boat ride  took the ATV tour through the jungle. (It tires me out just thinking about it--but I did have fun learning to dance the salsa  mu-cha-cha)  I had fun at the shopping market on the beach (a ten minute walk to the left when facing the ocean)--You must barter (offer half of what they ask)  be prepared for them to be pushy...don't back down!!Food was plentiful -even for picky eaters -My favorites were French toast  fresh fruit at the breakfast buffet, BBQ chicken  french fries at the beach bar for lunch  Mama Mias Italian lasagna for dinner--theres enough variety available for anyone but you must make reservations early each day for the restaurants unless you just want to enjoy the buffet...We were careful to only drink/use bottled water but we did have a few in our group that suffered a day or two of stomache upset (pack Immodium AD  Pepto Bismo just in case as the price at the resort is extreme). The night time entertainment was great  the activities team deserves applause for putting in some very long hours ( how they don't collapse by dancing in those colorful costumes in the heat amazes me)--There was dancing every night following the show in the open air lobby....then for those who could stay awake the disco...Although I never ventured there myself, I heard the late night disco was wild (especially Wed ? and Sat. nights when the locals are allowed in). Pack lots of sunscreen  bring lots of one dollar bills to hand out as tips throughout your stay. Tip maids, bartenders, gardeners, waiters, bellhops,desk clerks,chefs(don't forget the grill tender at the beach bar -what a hot job he has).... And the maitenance people who come out in the early morning and rake the seaweed so the Caribe has the best beach around...try to tip them all if you can as they certainly deserve it!The week went by too quickly as most vacations do but spending the week with my most favorite people made it an unforgettable trip  I would go again in a heartbeat!! Enjoy....

<Content>Nice Hotel...something missing? My husband and I just returned from the Caribe Club Princess a few days ago. We both had a great time but, couldn't help to wonder what was missing compared to other hotels we've stayed at. We went to celebrate our 1st wedding anniversay. I emailed the resort before we got there and they upgraded us to VIP for free. That was a nice surprise. With VIP we received a complimentary massage, premium drinks, room service and reservations at either the pay seafood or steak restaurant. We chose the seafood restaurant and it was one of the best meals I've ever eaten! We both had lobster...delicious! VIP does not affect the room type you were assigned. Our room was quite small compared to some others right by us. I know this because we were assigned our first room, which was quite large. While we were changing in the first room, another couple (assigned the same room) walked in on us while we were naked. To fix the problem, they moved us to another room down the hall from that one (which took an hour and half for them to do while we stood in the hallway with all of our luggage and no where to go.) The resort itself is beautiful. The food at the ala carte's is OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!! Definately get in line before 9:00 to make your reservations. At 8:30 there were atleast 20 people in line already and the line goes SLOW. Neither of us liked the buffets very much. It seemed to be a lot of the same foods daily. Once in a while something new would be put out that we enjoyed but, that only happened 2 days out of 10. The creperie was delicious. Room service was top notch and great for ordering after a late night at the disco. Try the garlic shrimp and the pizza. The pizza was so much better from room service than from the snack bars. The drinks need some improvement. I would order the same drink from each of the bars and 4 out of 5 times each bartender would give me a totally different drink. We couldn't figure that one out. The frozen drinks were never frozen, just cold syrupy drinks. They didn't use any real fruit in the drinks either. It was all from concentrate. The house white wine was very good! The caprihna (sp?) was also a great drink if you like limes. We found to be in the minority the week we were there. There were very few English speaking guests. So we didn't meet very many people which was a little disappointing. Some people were just down right rude. I was pushed around and stepped on a million times at the bar waiting in line to get drinks. One day, when we left our chairs at the beach to get lunch, we came back to find our chairs were taken over by a family of 10 and our beach bag and all of our belongings were thrown on to the sand. When we confronted them about moving our things they were rude and pretended to not speak any English at all. I can assure you I witnessed this same family speaking in English throughout the resort the rest of the week. The shows in the evening were ok. Some of the people are very talented but, they just weren't our cup of tea. There were a lot of musical type shows. This is usually something we look forward to in the evening after dinner at other hotels we've been to. Here we were lucky to have stayed for the whole show only a couple of nights. The lobby was always a good time after the show. Everyone was always dancing and having a good time. The only downside to that was there was never any live entertainment. They only had a DJ. Every other resort I've been too has always had a caribbean band playing in the evening. We did have a good time, afterall how can you not when you're in paradise?!? We both left the resort feeling that it lacked something but, can't quite put our finger on it. If you've already booked this hotel. Don't worry. You'll have a good time and there is good food to be had in the ala carte restaurants. The beach is the absolute most gorgeous beach I've ever been on! It just didn't leave me with an unforgettable feeling like some other hotels have.

<Content>Loved the People Everything about our trip was perfect. The Dominican people are so wonderful. They are fun and friendly and they made us feel very welcome to their beautiful island. The shows and Disco were so much fun. All the food was great. Especially the ribs at the grill. The beach is perfect and they do so much work on the grounds to keep it beautiful. Everyone couldn't do enough for us. We never had to wait even one minute to get a drink. Coco Loco's and Blue Carribean is the best. I can't wait to go back!

<Content>good and bad points Our specs: We are a middle-aged, well travelled couple with adult children.We stayed at the Caribe Club May 14-21, 2005. We had a few rain days but also some lovely sunshine. The resort was pretty with a well groomed landscape.The staff were very friendly and efficent. The theme restaurants were good.The resort was relatively quiet and peaceful. Food was nutritious. Pool was great. Lots of wildlife. Kds on the resort seemed to have a great time at the kids club. We did not suffer any GI illness. Our major complaint was the mold/mildew and condensation in our room. The AC system is obviously not up to par as we have never experienced this at any resort before. Mold was even found on our pillows. The buffett was very poor in choice and meats were of poorer quality than we've seen before. Overall, compared to other 4 star Caribean resorts that we have stayed at we would not consider this up to standard. We felt we paid too much for the standard of the resort. The VIP upgrade which we received free from our travel provider is silly. Paying for this is a waste of extra money. There was an abundance of mosquitos during the time of our stay. We won't return to this resort and unlikely return to the DR.

<Content>Paradise Just want to tell anyone considering going to the Caribe Club Princess that it will be a decision you will not regret. My sister and I stayed there for a week in April and even though it was our first trip down south, it certainly won't be our last. Like everyone, we had read reviews and though most were quite positive, there were always some that made us wonder if our decision was the right one. Without any hesitation, I would highly recommend this resort. The staff were absolutely wonderful and of coure you always pick out a few favorites. Israel from the annimation staff and Hector, one of the maintenance boys were our pick. Of course, the bartenders were in a category of their own. They can make a mighty fine drink. The food, the service and the beach were awsome. The rooms (although not fancy) were very clean . The grounds are spotless and please dont forget to tip or give little gifts to some of these men who do such a fine job of keeping the grounds so clean.The only complaint that I would have is that some of these tourists need to lighten up and enjoy the beauty of the resort. This is a vacation!! How about trying to crack a smile and being nice to people. Maybe I am being prejudiced but Canadians are by far the most fun and friendliest.So pack your bags, bring your sunscreen and stop worrying. You can have a fantastic vacation . The choice is yours.

<Content>Wonderful vacation spot with great animation team My sister and I visited the Caribe Club Princess in April. There were a few minor inconveniences when we arrived, but we just laughed them off. After all, you are in a different country. The rooms were clean and there was always friendly staff around if we needed anything. Although neither one of us can speak spanish, there didn't seem to be a communication problem. We looked up a few phrases in a spanish book that we brought and they appreciated that.  The food on the resort was excellent! If you can't find something that you like, you must be hard to please. Try a lobster crepe with a presidente on a hot afternoon. Delicious!!!!!Many of the tourists were unfriendly. The nicest ones were the people from Canada. The staff were so helpful and could not do enough for us.A special thanks to Israel - animation team; Raoul, Jauquin, and Sandy - bartenders; and of course, Hector. You made our trip memorable.Hopefully, we will see you again next year.

<Content>Disappointing Glorious beach, but bland food and boring buffets compared to other Caribbean island resorts (even Cuba, given its restrictions, delivers better fares), and a very annoying animation team overdoing it on the sound system. A la carte restaurants were less than average, except for the Dominican themed one which delivered succulent traditional local cuisine. Cocktail drinks were served erratically by staff who obviously did not always master the basics such as Mojitos, Daiquiris and the like.We had a junior suite which overlooked the pool and was very spacious. Some problems with the hot water, but we were there in the busiest week of the year and I imagine the resort was at full capacity. Lots of families with early rising kids.Would not return there to relax, but I imagine it must be fun for groups and families.

<Content>Great time Just returned from Caribe Club Princess April 9-16 2005.Weather : Fantastic. Pretty well 31 degrees everyday with cloudy skies at times.Beach : Beautiful. Tons of white sand. I know some people complained about it being windy all of the time. I found that it was great. It created nice waves for kids and adults to play in ( boogie boarding etc...) It also gave you the opportunity to lay around on the beach and not really feel that blistering heat which you do feel by the pools. But to each thier own !!! I loved it.Resort.: Very clean. rooms were better than the Club Med at Punta Cana which I stayed at 2 yrs earlier. We had the VIP package with superior room 3328. We had two kids (10 and 14) and there was plenty of room. 2 single beds and 2 double beds. I had my own bed for a week !!! Tons of hot water for showers and the blow dryers worked great.  Food: A huge selection at the buffet. There are also several a la carte restaurants on the grounds which you have to reserve between 9-12 each day. I thought they served excellent food in a nice arrangement. you have to dress casual,(no shorts) which isnt a bad thing. Even our kids enjoyed it.The El Pecador was very good. go for the Langostines.Check in : At the time we arrived it was very fast.Check out : It was not bad, however we needed a courtesy room to shower up before we left because we had a late flight. Get there early because they seemed overwhelmed. then to top it off the guy gives us the key card for the courtesy room and it turned out to be the wrong one !! Luckily we a custodian walking by and he just let us in.The reception area is located away from the rooms,pools and restaurants so if you have any concerns you have to wait for the shuttle of make the walk. Its only a 5 minute walk and we really didnt mind it , especially after dinner as it gave us the opportunity to 'walk off dinner' after suffing our pie holes.!!We would then go to the bar at the reception area for the customary 'after dinner' drink ( or three).As mentioned in the other reviews , the activities are pretty lame, but if you dont get up and try the dancing or something why not stay home !.( a few drinks always help things along!) n The nightly entertainment, show etc.. are again very amateurish but the staff tries real hard. There is a disco or a casino right next door but no where near close enough that yo ucan hear it because all of the rooms are closer to the beach area.There are three pools onthe grounds with bars in very close proximity. By the beach is the Pelicano Divers who take care of lending out the boogie boards, life jackets. catamarans, windsurfers etc... you get them for an hour at a time but after an hour youre pretty well beat !!We took the Pelicano dive intro and my son and I enjoyed it so much that we ended going for the certification for scuba diving. We certainly dont regret it and they were nice to deal with.I met several couples who were there for two weeks and they stated that they had been to many different resort in the Punta Cana area and they felt that this place was the best overall. Again dont expect much night life , but make the best of the days!!I would go back in a hart beat...........If you are thinking of going and need more info to make you mind up ..snd me a line.

<Author>jackyleesam
<Content>great for the Price we paid... Hi, we were a family of 4 with kids 75yrs. Our room was a suite on the second floor, and we did not do the VIP option. We had only a few minor things go on that could have been improved on... The kids liked the lizzards we saw every day at the restauraunt and the near the room. The monkey and the mcaws that went around we also a hit $7 for the photos in the front lobby. We also spotted a bull frog and many different birds right on the resort... The resort itself was tremendous, bigger than we thought. Everything we found was very clean lush and the staff always eager to say HOLA. Only spot that was gross were the public restrooms by the beach and by the restaurants (yikes!) The restaurants are located all together and pretty central to the 3 main buildings.The food was fresh and contantly refreshed. There were cold cuts out so if you did excursions you could pack a light lunch. We were able to get plastic bags for travelling home with some extra doughnuts. *** We did opt to tip our waiters and the Drink girls***... after being offered no reservations to super late ones, We did try one restauraunt La Cueva and it was suposed to be a STEAK place, however most of the items on the menu are seafood and after eating the steak I'd stick to seafood there, aps and starters were all seafood based. The presentation was fantastic there. We discovered Why it is so difficult to get EARLY reservations (I just do not want to eat at 10 pm with little kids)... for the 6 different places, it is because each restaurant only have seating for about 90 each in total seats. Not enough for 500 plus rooms. The pools were large and very clean we opted for the quieter one as 1/2 the pool was under 2ft and perfect for the kids. We did have to get up early for the pool spots with an umbrella before 7 am. I would suggest to Bring lots of SPF and block. It is over 25US$ per bottle at teh resort shop. We brought 3 bottles thinking it would do, but being in the water mostly for 8am-5pm was just not enough. Getting drinks was tricky we speak a bit of spanish and took a book of translations. We found service excellent or realy bad. If you read the name tags and called them by name I never had to wait unlike some others. ***Again we tipped all the time*** We found it difficult to get a Strawberry drink? But the pina coladas were good... The Creperie was excellent and served ice cream, The kids got a kick out of that feature and the Philliy Crepe was Delish!  We spent mornings at the beach,The waves were rolling, you could go out aways before it got deep. You could walk forever on this white POWDERY sand and see the different resorts. By far the nicest beach sand. Watersports were readily available and easy to take part in. Friendly staff and we loved the boogie boarding!The animation staff work so hard here and would keep you busy if you wanted. Or leave you alone if you wanted too. Very well done just wish the resort put the same effort into other aspects of the service.If you want hair braids they do it everywhere and very inexpensively 20-35$us takes about 45-50 mins for just below the shoulder length hair. Our Daughter loves hers! We did 2 excursions, We went to the Manati park where you could swim with the dolphins $80us for 6 mins. If you opt for this plan to do the park in the am and the swim is at 2 pm.expect to wait for this, as they do all the swims at one time 50+ at 6 mins each. Depending where you are on the list, you could wait until 4pm. The park itself was easy to get through, not terribly exciting, the igguanas are loose and very cool to see up close. the pony show was well done and there were no sharks as advertised. The staff are very apt at asking for $ for putting birds on your shoulder. I did a fishing excursion on the Marlin boat. The boat was less than stellar, I did catch a dolphin fish about 100lbs... and was pleased with myself. Well worth the 89 us$. There was a little market there where I got some little items to bring home. I also went to El Torpedo factory 1 hour long in total and got hand made cigars and Larimar silver jewlery. Well worth the apointment. All excursions were arranged thorugh my travel advisor on the site. *** beware of the 10%- 20% + they add when you use a creditcard...*** Use Cash.Here were the little glitches we had. We arrived in at 11 pm on the Sat night and were caught after a bus had just unloaded, so needless to say it took over an 1.5 hrs to check in with 2 tired little kids who just wanted to go to bed. Our luggage arrived at the room by 1: 30am and only after calling. They wont allow you to take it with you, we tried. Nothing was explained( which block we were in... so we wandered though 2 buildings 'till we found our room) We never got beach towel cards and had to go back to ask for them... Bit of a nuisance. We were told you could $55pp and Check out late. This service is really, unavailable so have your travel agent book you the extra night ahead of time to save a headache if you leave later in the day. Luggage is really left unattended, so make sure to have luggage locks for all compartments or check your luggage before you leave. They supplied a room for 45 mins that would make you loose your lunch, not cleaned and wet towels on the bathroom floor from the 20 or so before us was not pleasant. We just changed and got out of there... Realy easy fixes for this resort to make it better ...Have more staff at the front desk, and have the rooms used for courtesy, cleaned in between uses. Have at least one desk staff knowing a different language fluently to handle any problems, or questions you may have. And enlarge the resevation only restaurants so as to eliminate the frustration for guests trying to get reasonable reservations.All in all A fantastic trip, At a Bargain Price, 85deg every day and RR That is all we could ask for for the $3500 for all four of us Over Easter weekend Mar 26th-Apr 02, 2005. Hope this helps in your holiday quest!

<Content>depends on what's important to you We're 2 families with teenagers. Have been to many all inclusives over the years. Here's our impressions:Beach - Outstanding! You won't find much nicer anywhere (I'm very fussy about this). You do need to be up early to reserve a grass hut. There's really no snorkelingRooms - Nice. A little worn but clean and fairly spacious. Nice balcony.Food - The worst AI food we have ever been served. However, we all  managed, did not get sick and enjoyed our stay.Service - This isn't the USA nor is it Jamaica or Mexico. Sometimes service was good, sometimes not. You need to extend yourself by  a) being friendly b) attempting spanish c) tipping  bribing Pools - Three nice, immaculate pools. One had tons of activities, two  others were quiet.Staff - The activities staff was the best we have ever seen. They really extend themselves to interact with everyone - old and young alike. I typically avoid them and even though I didn't  participate in pool games etc. I had nice conversations with several of them every day.Spa - Nice little surprise here. Good little gym too.Outside activities: Unlike some other caribbean spots, there's very little worth doing in Punta Cana. The resort is pretty much it.Other Guests: Many Europeans  Canadiens. We met plenty of people  from usa too. VIP option: Don't leave home without it, you can't get it once you're there and it's well worth it. There's a bunch of nice  amenities but most importantly it gives you top shelf liquor.Overall: This is a very lively resort on a pretty property with a fantastic  beach. The food is awful but we had a wonderful time anyway.  You can't compare the DR to Mexico or Jamaica's service but  remember you can't compare the price either. We paid about  $2,700 for 3 people, VIP, non-stop air during easter break. This same week was 3x the price elswhere. We had a great week and would return again for that price.

<Content>Wonderful vacation! Our family of four returned from Caribe Club Princess on March 19, 2005. We spent a week there and enjoyed every minute of it. We have stayed at a lot of different resorts in the Caribbean. Caribe Club Princess was definately the nicest. The staff there is so friendly and helpful. You have plenty of choices for food at the buffet and it is all very good. The resteraunts are good as well. Make your reservations as soon as possible because they fill up quick. The pools are spectacular and very clean. We spent a lot of time in them. Our children (12 yr. old girl and 9 yr old boy) had a great time. There are plenty of activites to keep them busy. If you are taking young children I want to share something with you that you might not be prepared for. There are women on the beach AND by the pool that do go topless. They are everywhere. Our 9 year old boy did get an education that I wasn't prepared for but, I do have to admit that after a few days you do get used to it and he really could of cared a less so I got over it. The beach was great and we were in it every day. Our room was very clean as well as the whole resort. We had such a great time. We are looking forward to going back again.

<Content>Terrible Service All Around 1 Star My family and I travel every Winter break somewhere in the Carribbean and did we make a mistake with this Hotel.First when you check in make sure you ask for your V.I.P. bracelet as if you are American they will look on and place you as standard. Not that even the bracelet makes a differance they treat any Americans in a lower standard then Europeons. (Rooms, Food, overall Guest Services).We had a family Emergancy on our 2nd day my Father was admitted to the Hopital I.C.U. unit with a critical Heart condition and while the family tried calling each one of them were Hung up on by the front desk. I had just called my travel agent to inform her of the conditions of our room and the complaints I had made, and nothing was being done. When finally I was called by my brother who speaks fluent Spanish informed me that he and 2 of my other family members had been calling for days, and they just Hung up.I was furious, and called my travel agent again to make flight arrangements for the following day and to add this to my complaint.I have all the phone bills from every family member and they all match what the Hotel has listed totaling over $300.00 US dollars. it averages $4.00 a minute calling from the States, which gives you an idea of how many calls were made from January 4th- January 7th when I was finally notified.Needless to say the Hotel Manager and the staff were of no help , the following day we were to be at the front desk at 12:00 P.M. and they didn't have are tickets, the Apple Representative who we spoke with the night before had taken everything with her and could not be reached.We finally were told to go to the airport and someone would help us.We arrived home and I was able to spend a few days with my Father before he passed away. Had the communication been better I would have had more time with him.I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL

<Content>Amazing Vacation! I just got back from a 7 night stay at the Caribe Club Princess and I had an amazing time. Me and a friend opted for an alternative spring break trip this year and chose punta cana to avoid the crazyness that we've experienced in Cancun, Panama City, and other spring break hot spots. We were more than pleased. This was one of the most relaxing vacations Ive ever had and I came back with an amazing tan. The food was good, the drinks were good, and the beach was gorgeous. My only recommendations are to bring a spanish dictionary because they don't understand much english there. The crowd is very diverse with many european vacationers so its hard to find someone who knows english well. Also if you want a spot by the pool or the beach get up early and claim your chairs! Other than that our vacation was great! If you're looking for an excursion the Outback Safari is GREAT! Our tour guide Alex was hysterical so request him if possible! I can't wait to go back next year!!!

<Content>Okay Resort We just returned from this resort on Saturday. I've stayed at several all inclusive resorts, this was my third trip to Dominican. The resort was nice, it was definately a nicer 4* resort, but not a 5*. You will probably want to bring along your own snack food as I found the buffets to be very disappointing, quite disgusting actually. It works out to be a pretty good dieting tactic while vacationing. Fortunately, at this resort, you are not limited to the number of restaurant reservations during your stay. The restaurant food is good, the buffet food is not. I would recommend standing in the line every morning. Even if you can't get a reservation until 9:45 - trust me, it's worth the wait.Walking around the resort, the lobby, trails, pool, spa, theater, sound system, etc. were very nice and well maintained. The staff is fun, it's really a nice place. The main areas I think this resort need to improve on is the rooms , and the buffet. I think if the resort invested the same amount of $ into the rooms and the buffet as it did the remainder of the areas, they could come close to qualifing as a 5*.There were a number of spring breakers there, but that is to be expected this time of year. The only other complaint I had, is on Friday night, our last night, the property owner next door was burning trash. The entire resort was covered with smoke. We tried to enjoy our time outside as long as we could, but our lungs just couldn't take it any more. We ended up having to retire early.I talked to a couple that paid the extra money for the VIP. They were pretty disappointed, as their room was not upgraded and they didn't see the benefit other then getting checked into their room right away.For an all inclusive, this was the most un all inclusive. There is 24 hr room service, but you have to pay extra. Only $3 US for a pizza, so not alot, but I thought it was a bit ridiclous when staying at an all inclusive. Top shelf liquor is available, but you need to pay extra.I would have to get a pretty good deal to stay at this resort again. Overall the food and the property owner next door would keep me from booking this resort again.

<Content>favorite vacation ever, great for kids! All I can say is WOW!!! Went to Caribe club with two friends, and five boys ages 11, 10, 9, 7, and 5, from March 11-18. What a wonderful time we ALL had! Direct flight on US Air was quick and enjoyable. Once we arrived in paradise we were met by Apple Vacation representative and then driven through town to our hotel. Lots of good info given on the ride to the hotel. Hotel is beautiful!! Open air with a lovely lobby, nice breeze and refreshing drinks. Check in was easy and we waited on the beach for our room. Staff is VERY friendly and very good with children, made you feel very welcome. Felt very comfortable about letting the children roam freely. There seemed to always be someone looking out for their safety and eager to entertain them. Restaurants were great and so was the buffet with many many choices for everyone. Room service, free, was well used for snacks or very late night snacks. The excursions are all wonderful but our favorite was swimming with sharks and sting rays. Yes, we were actually in the same water with them nothing between us. Very cool. Shopping on the beach is very fun and entertaining. Great products for great prices, after bargaining of course!!!! Night life for everyone. I would recommend this vacation to evryone of all ages. We met a ton of new friends from Canada, Paris, New York, Mexico, Arizona, etc. You can eat the ice and frozen drinks but not the tap water. Bottled water was everywhere and fridge in room was restocked everyday with sodas and beer. Thigs to take with you would be sunscreen(it cost about $25 a bottle once you get there), candy for the maids and hotel workers, and Livestrong bracelets. Even the kind you buy at 7-11, the rubber kind. My children had several on and the natives were going crazy for them and our candy!!! We even got to trade these items for boat rides, products, or just plain fun!!!! We want to go back but don't think we can wait a whole year!! Weather was beautiful and the partying never stopped!!! One last thing, when they say all inclusive they mean it!!!! Once we got into the hotel we did not have to pay for ANY food, drinks, nightlife, shows, non-motorized sports etc. Take a calling card and it only cost you a service fee of $1 to use it from the Dominican. WONDERFUL WONDERFUL WONDERFUL!!!!!!

<Content>Love the Caribe Club Princess Stayed at Caribe Club Princess and it was great. The rooms were great, the food was good, 7 restaurants, something for everyone, don't be afraid to try new things. The only thing I didn't like was the lack of hot water and all the topless women on the beach and at the pool, there was just too many. The staff were nice and always greeted us in a nice way Hola.There are 3 pools, one for the people who like to party. another pool a little more relaxed and finaly the third one with no music, no activities, just a quiet place to relax with your family.The beach is beautifull, you can walk for miles.The nightly activities started at 9:45pm a little too late for us because we have little kids which needed to go to bed early. There is some nightly entertainment for kids which starts I believe at 8:45 for an hour. We attended one night but it's not much of a show and our kids said that the music was too loud for them.Go to your meeting with the rep, they give good info.

<Content>22 Americans having fun What can I say but GREAT TIME. Every time you travel, you will hear negative people complaining, as did we. I have been to Mexico several times, and thought the beach was nicer than that in Playa del Carmen. I myself am an above average cook, and thought the food was great! Anytime you change your environment or your routine you will feel the effects to some degree, if you know what I mean. I thought the Mexican Resturant was great (but it was not authentic). The Chinese and Italian were the same. The dissappointment was the steakhouse, whichyou paid for and was less desirable. The weather was beautiful, the grounds and staff were very pleasant. I would say that it is three europeans to one american among the guests, so if that is a problem for you, beware. the staff doesnt treat you any differently, but the european guests, (german, french, spanish) are definitely pushy and seem to feel like they are more important, not surprisingly.

<Content>Better than we thought it would be We left Phila on 3/21 in a snow storm and after de-icing the plane we were on our way. Arrived in Punta Cana to beautiful sunny skies with a temp of 80. Stayed from Feb 21 to Feb 28, 2005.Fortunately, since we were there last year, we were familiar with the need for a tourist card. Many people did not know this or that it cost $10.00/person. We were ready for this and whisked right through. We found the Apple rep and located the bus to our hotel without problems. Within 1/2 hour of leaving the airport, we arrived at the Caribe Princess at 11:30 AM. The Apple rep on the bus told us that check in wasn't till 3 PM but that all the rooms were ready and we could get our rooms after we checked in. Unfortunately, that was not true. We never established with the registration people if our room was ready. He kept repeating that check in was at 3 PM. That didn't bother us though as there was a bar in the lobby and we embellished a few. When we felt our thirsts were quenched, we found the buffet restaurant and had lunch. By the time we were finished lunch, we got into our rooms. Our room was a superior garden view. Well, it wasn't quite superior. It was on the first floor with a king sized bed (as requested) but it looked onto a walkway and shed. We're easy to please and we knew we would be in the room only to sleep. Well, on the third day, the ceiling in the bathroom began to leak. We found this out at 3 PM and reported it immediately. We had a 6 PM dinner reservation and the leak still hadn't been fixed. We spoke to a person at the front desk and he said he would have it fixed by the time we were finished our dinner. We came back after dinner and found there was dirt over the sink and floor were they fixed the ceiling. We called and asked that the bathroom be cleaned and was told that someone would be there immediately. Immediately after we placed the call, we realized that the ceiling was still leaking. I called the front desk and told them we needed another room. Within 40 minutes, we had a room on the second floor with a wonderful view of the pool and ocean. The remainder of our stay with the accommodations went fine.The restaurants were okay. There was a steakhouse and seafood place that was not included. It cost $35.00/person to eat there. Luckily, we did the VIP and it included one meal at either place. (I'll talk about the VIP later). We choose the seafood as we had read reviews that the steakhouse wasn't too good. Our meal at the seafood place was good. We each had lobster that was grilled to perfection. Also, there are 5 other restaurants that were Mexican, Chinese/Japanese, Italian, Dominican and Brazilian. You need to make reservations for these and the 2 pay restaurants every day with the concierge. The concierge begins taking reservations at 8:30 AM till 11:30 AM. If you are not in line by 8:15, you will not get the restaurant of your choice. There was much grumbling in line about this. We ate in the Mexican, Japanese/Chinese, and Italian. They were all good not great. Each had its pros and cons. We wanted to eat in the Brazilian, but the reservation got cancelled as the restaurant was closed the night we chose. We were told that the Dominican was terrible, so we avoided that. There is a large buffet restaurant that is open all but 3 hours a day. The food was just okay. The grounds were lovely. The lobby is separated from the room/pool/ocean area. It is about a five minute walk. The walk is very naturalistic. Lots of trees and flowers and birds. There is a tram that you can ride but we usually walked. The tram was not on any kind of schedule. You just had to wait till one came by. There was a couple of stores and a chapel on the site. The pools were nice. We were connected with the Tropical Princess which had 2 pools. The Caribe had only one but that one had the swim up bar. We only visited that pool once and only for the bar. The ocean was great. When we arrived on Monday, the weather was very windy. It was the same for Tuesday. We were wondering if that was because of the area we were in. Fortunately, by Wed., the winds stopped. If you were on the beach on those 2 days, it wasn't very relaxing. The water temp kept getting better and better each day. We are real beach bums, so we were in the water and on the beach every day. We did not feel the surf was rough as we had read. One thing we found is that there was not beach service. If you wanted a drink, you had to get it yourself. That wasn't a problem, I kept sending my husband up there. The staff was wonderful. They seemed to try to be as helpful as possible. When we had all that room trouble, the front desk never gave us a hassle about getting another room. The room services and the staff in the restaurants do not speak much English. I know a little Spanish and with the help of my Spanish dictionary, was able to ask for washcloths and small bottles of water to be in our room everyday. (They give you a gallon bottle of water in every room). I did go to the dollar store and bought the maid little things. I left them on the bed everyday with a muchas gracias. The activities staff are very outgoing. There is something going on most of the day. They try to recruit everyone to join in. The nightly shows were not very good. There did things like imitating rock stars or skits from Lion King. We avoided them after the first couple of days.VIP is the way to go. Some of the things it included were: a bottle of rum, 3 cigars, one/person complimentary dinner in the pay restaurants, one/person 20 minute massage (the spa staff was great), one/person motorized sport (we did the banana boat - had lots of fun), 2 beach towels in our room (otherwise, you had to get towels everyday from the activities desk), 2 hours of internet, and premium liquors. Those who didn't do VIP had to pay $3.00 to $4.00 for premium drinks. There is a shopping district about a 5 minute bike ride away. We rode bikes there twice. The stores sell most of the same things. Bartering was pretty easy. The Dominicans don't seem to be high pressured. If we saw something in one store we liked but didn't like the price, we went to another till we got what we wanted for the price we wanted to pay. Around this same district is a casino. We had a trams that ran from our hotel to the casino. We did go one night and won some money playing slot machines. Overall, we had a wonderful time. We stayed at Secrets last year that was a 6 golden apple and were not too sure what the Caribe would be like as it was only a 4 apple. Believe me, we were very well pleased. I would recommend this as a great place to vacation. I know this was pretty wordy, but I just want to let you know that we really enjoyed ourselves and you should put this on your list of great vacation spots.

<Content>FUN FUN FUN!!!! Overall the hotel is okay... Nothing amazing but the staff and entertainment makes up for it !!! The entertainment crew is amazing and fluent in all languages. They make sure everyone is having fun!!I want to make 1 thing clear. The staff DOES NOT favour any nationality.Most europeans are just more outgoing and have longer stays thus their popularity with the staff. However the staff threats everyone equally and makes sure that everyone is having fun! Chapel / Israel (animation crew)is a good person to get to know from the begining to make ur stay memorable and fun !

<Content>Loved It Just got back from this resort, we were originally booked for a week at the Hamaca Hilton but they over booked by 28 couples and we were deverted to the Caribe Club Princess with an upgrade to VIP. First, let me say thanks to Air Canada for their quick work and the upgrades, you did a great job given the time frame. Second this resort was just wonderfull, food was great, room fantastic and the service was quick and friendly. If you are planning a trip for your family or as a couple give this place a second look the surroundings were beautiful and so was the beach. All the staff were helpfull and friendly, bus ride from the airport (La Romana) was a little long but when we arrived we were quickly registered and on our way to our room. Third if you are someone that can't roll with the punchs when traveling, I suggest you stay at home, travellers have to be prepared to make changes quickly and sometimes may not be able to go to the location they planned on going to, its no one persons fault sometimes it just happens. So make your compaint and then be done with it. Because frankly no one wants to hear about your childish complaining all week, I make this statement to just 2 couples from our friends in the United Statesmost of which were a pleasure to be with and I'm happy to say I'm glad we met and look forward to meeting again some day.Have a great trip to CARIBE CLUB PRINCESS RESORT

<Content>Great hotel at a great price. We traveled with 2 children, 8yr old and 1yrd. and my mother. Used Apple Vacations. Direct flight out of Cleveland Feb 19-25. What a wonderful trip!!!!!Flight was fast and comfortable. USA 3000 staff very helpful with the children.Ride from airport also fast only 30 minutes if that. Nice bus with AC.Check in at hotel again easy with a little bump. We got there at noon, you can arrange your room but not check in till 3 pm. we knew this ahead of time. We had requested connecting rooms or at least on same floor ahead of time. But were given rooms in seperate bldg. not going to work. After much conversation they made a few changes. My mom was in our building but not our entrance or floor. Made for some running around but they tried.We had a Jr. Suite, two rooms and two baths. A little worn but clean and nice set up. Maid, Maria, wonderful woman. Knew VERY little english but this did not stop us from connecting. She tried very hard and worked very hard for us and the children.Activities galor. If you cant find some fun at this hotel dont bother going on vacation because something is wrong with you. The beach is close, again great when you have kids, the pool was wonderful a little cool but you got used to that. The animation staff, works their butts off. Tip them all whenever you see them they deserve it.Food -- Well depends what you expect. For an all inclusive trip that cost us less than $900 a person I cant complain. The ala carte rest. were very good. The buffet fed a lot of people and for the most part is very good. Just a little bland for my taste. But the variety is definately there. The fresh fruit I loved and the oatmeal at breakfest was to die for. No kidding you got to try it!!!!NO One in my party got even the slightest sick from the food or water. And all of us have touchy stomachs. Even the baby ate off the buffet and had no problems.To address some things I have read before.English not spoken, NOT TRUE. They try very hard to comunicate with you LEARN some spanish before you go. Its their country not ours. Be respectful.NO hot water -- NOT TRUE - yes it is better to shower after 5 pm everyday for the hotest water. Why shower before the beach anyway.Weather - was wonderful. Two days of off and on rain then clear sailing. It is windy but that adds to the beach fun and keeps you cool when the sun is out. Use lots of sunscreen. The sun is decieving.Last the staff. I NEVER met a rude person. The smiles were everywhere.My son was sick 2 days, he got it before we left I am sure, cold. When he got sick at the breakfest table I did not even have a chance to help him. The waiter scooped him up and headed to the bath before I could blink and then would not accept a tip for all her help. They are lovely people who appreciate our visit and the TIPS please tip them well they work so hard. They also love children VERY much. Fell very safe if you are traveling with children. I was worried after reading some posts and feel that it was all a waste of time.Go relax and enjoy yourself. This hotel is worth the cost and worthy of more attention.The VIP program is worth every penny get it if you can.

<Content>What a wonderful Resort! This resort is a little piece of paradise! My husband and I just got back from spending a week there, and we would both highly recommend this resort.Our check-in went smooth. Make sure to put the tags they tell you to on your bags, then after a drink at the lobby bar, your bags will be waiting for you at your room. We ate the following restaurants: Mexican (okay), Italian (would go back), Chinese (we at there twice!), and Brazilian (would go back to also). Make sure you also check out the Creperie, it's a nice break from pizza and fries for lunch. We tried the lobster, salmon, ham and cheese, spinach and a few dessert ones and they were all wonderful!We went to almost every nightly show on the main stage, and they do a good job of entertaining the variety of nationalities in the crowd. Note: the Animation staff that tries so hard to get you to do activities all day, is the same people on stage for over an hour at night. And after the lobby bar party gets done, they rehearse until 2 or 3 in the morning. They work very hard to make sure everyone is having a great time, and they are really good at remembering your name. We can't say enough great things about the animation staff.There is so much to do during the day: bocce ball, shuffle board, darts, archery, ping pong, volleyball (sand or pool), scuba lessons, dance lessons, stretching, water aerobics, water polo, mini golf, spanish lessons, or our favorite, just relaxing by the pool and soaking up the sun.If you want to do some shopping, I would recommend walking down the beach (toward the Riu), it's about a 10 minute walk, and the shop workers aren't as pushy as the ones in the shopping area.I wouldn't recommend the casino, but we would recommend the disco at least once. Drinks are only free though from 11 - 12 there.Make sure to also bring your own drink glass, as the drinks come in smaller glasses, and if you're really thirsty, you'll have it down by the time you get back to your chair.The walk through the mangroves isn't bad at all, and you get to see many different flowers and small animals.There are 3 pools, so check them all out before you give up on finding chairs, as a lot of people save them very early in the morning.I hope this helps, and enjoy your vacation in paradise!

<Content>Had a lot of fun and rum  Background:3rd AI trip. I'm 30, wife is 27. From Minnesota. Went Feb 12 - 19, 2005Check-InFast and easy. They take your luggage to your room and leave it at the door (not inside). Had a few drinks at the lobby bar before venturing to the room. It is maybe a 1/4 mile walk from the lobby to the rooms. There is a trolly, but we only took it once. The walk through the mangroves is kinda nice, especially after dinner. RoomsWe had a JR suite (#3354) which had a sitting room with a daybed and TV, and then the bedroom with 2 full size beds. Vaulted ceilings were nice. Mini fridge had 2 cokes, and 2 Sprites as well as a jug of bottled water. No beer or alcohol. Only real problem in the room has been mentioned many times here was hot water. Either was luke warm or took 30 minutes to get warm. Bars9 including the temporary one during the shows and the one in the disco. The one in the buffet by the Shanghay restaurant is 24 hours.PoolsThere are 3 pools. 2 where the Animation staff gets you involved, and one that was virtually always empty that was a quiet pool to just lounge around. Always seats and no thumping music. The main pool with the swim up bar has all the seats reserved by 8am. I wanted to play devils advocate once and gather all the towels up to see what would happen, but chickened out. FoodBuffet was OK. Not as good as RIU in Playa. After the first 2 nights, we ate at the ala carte places in this order: Italian, Chinese, Mexican, Brazillian, Chinese. They were all very good. The one place that is different is Le Creperie. Crepes and ice cream. The ham/cheese crepe is a great change for lunch. The lobster one was also good. The sweet ones are also wonderful. Seems that many people must not know about this because they don't adventure around the resort.BeachBeautiful beach. Lots of of the little shade huts to use. Maybe a 1/2 - 3/4 mile walk to the flea market (to the left if you are looking at the ocean). ShowsSome were very good, others OK. They have 14 different ones so they don't overlap for the Europeans who go for 2 weeks. After the shows they also entertain in the lobby bar until midnight. We saw the staff practicing one night. Makes you realize how hard they work. They were up until between 2 and 3 am rehearsing. WeatherVery windy the first few days. Changed to breezy after that. Two cloudy days. The sun was HOT, so the breeze actually helped out a lot. TripsWe booked the Monster Truck with Fast Eddie in the lobby. $85 each. It was well worth it. Saw a real home, a cock fight (they had protective stuff on the spurs so they didn't hurt eachother), fruit plantation, school, store, witch doctor, and more poverty than I'd like to. We read before to bring stuff to give to kids and glad we did. School supplies and candy. Other people brought clothes, shoes, baseball caps, toys. They give them to the poor Hatian kids towards the end of the trip. (Their parents make $6 a day!) Full day getting picked up at 7:15 and getting back at 6:30.StaffVery friendly. Limited English on a lot, but you can get around it. JC, and Isreal were awesome to talk to. They let us know their lifestyles, and how things worked there. CasinoSmall. Drinks are free as long as you are playing. 8 deck blackjack shoes. Weird thing was you could get insurance with a face card up on the dealer, not just an ace. Kinda goofy. OverallAll in all we had a fabulous time. Met some new friends (Sarah and Mike), and got a lot of sun. I'd recommend the VIP (we didn't). You can get bottles of beer rather than tap, and also premium drinks like Kahlua. For the $75 I hear it is per person, it is well worth it. There really isn't much to do outside the resort, as far as a city center to visit. Daily excursions are your only real choice. I would definately go back here but there are too many other places to see in the world before going back to DR anytime soon. I would recommend it though to anyone looking at going. If I never hear Welcome to the Club Man and Mueve Mueve again, that will be perfectly fine with me. People who have been there will understand, and probably laugh.

<Content>Caribe was nice We stayed at the Caribe from 1/29-2/05, It was quite lovely....The beach was absolutely beautiful!! Beware of the sun, it is extreme sunlight there and please bring your sunblock....There were a couple nights that I didn't feel well and I am sure it was because of having to much sun.....We had nice weather, when we came in (sat) it was cloudy and cool, and it rained really hard that night or the next I cannot remember, but it is always very windy there, which is nice because the sun is so hot, but when it is cloudy, it is cool....We had a poolview room, which we were very satisfied, we could have been stuck on other side and seen nothing....We also brought the maid personal items and they were nice...I realize that when you go to a foreign country you have to account for non english speaking people, but we really had a hard time sometimes, you sometimes had to point at pictures for certain drinks, they have a drink book at the bars....The flea market down the beach to the left was quite a walk, I would guesstimate it at 35-45 minutes..,,, which is ok for younger people but if you are elderly, you might want to take a cab, my mom is 70 and she did it once but she wouldn't have walked it again...We had a really good time with some on the animation staff, Papi and Juan Carlos were really fun....The food, WELL----------I would highly recomment the Mexican restaurant or any dish with Chicken.... The main Buffet that you didn't have to have reservations for well it was like a lot of the food tasted the same like they use a main spice in all their dishes and it makes a lot of it taste the same, I am not really picky, but by end of week I survived on Pizza and french fries....We also ate at the italian rest and the brazilian, and the seafood, and I don't have much to say about them in terms of goodness, we had lobster one night and it was not good.... the Brazilian restaurant was nice cause they just brought a bunch of stuff to try, you didn't order off a menu....We ended up being Vip, We didn't know it but I guess it was because we booked early, I also booked a 1 hr massage at spa in addition to our free 20 min one for being vip, but I wish I would have saved my money and had my regular girl back home do it.... I mean it was ok but she just did a hard rub, something my 9 year old could have accomplished.. I am not complaining at all but I probably would not return to this resort because of the food, I would try something on the other side like La romana....Also if you are going Apple beware, our return flight ended up being delayed like 7 hours... And since our reg apple girl at hotel was off that day, noone bothered to come and tell us and we ended up in the hotel lobby for 7.5 hours, good thing they have comfy couches..... After our bus never came and picked us up, we got the emergency apple # and called and they said oh your plane is delayed 2 hours and we were like well was anyone going to let us know that, then approx 1.5 hours later an Apple rep came to tell us that is was delayed an additional 4 hours, he was very very rude, and didn't offer us a room to go to while we waited, use of the phone or anything....It made for a very long day...., the thing that really made us mad was that when we finally got picked up that night, we went to the other resorts to pick the other people up and everyone at every one ot the resorts were informed by noon that there was a delay, and we didn't get told until 4:30pm.....I really recommend the trip to Saona Island, it was beautiful and you can find many many cool shells and coral there.....If anyone has any questions please feel free to email me....thanks Tina

<Content>Most amazing vacation ever! Me and 5 other friends went to Caribe Club on May 8 of last year. We are all 20  21 years-old from Toronto and let me tell you, we couldn't have picked a better resort. We had the most amazing experience at Caribe Club and we would definetely recommend it to anyone wanting to visit Punta Cana. Arrival: When we arrived at the resort, we knew automatically we would have a blast, just from the look of the lobby. It was big and gorgeous. We were checked-in right away and served a drink as we were checking in! Since our rooms weren't ready for another few hours, we decided to hit up the lobby bar (the staff at the lobby bar is amazing) and go swimming. A great way to start the vacation, except me and my best friend both lost our sunglasses in the ocean! Not cool. Rooms: The rooms were extremely nice. We had 3 people in each room and 2 beds, but the beds were big and we all had lots of space. Don't bring any food into your hotel room. One person did that and they attracted ants. But you won't get ants if you keep the food out of your room! The maids cleaned our rooms every day. They were really sweet, we brought them some gifts (perfume, makeup, etc.) and they were very grateful. One maid gave us chocolate one day!Food: The food was fine. I know everyone expects the worst when they go to the Caribbean, but really it was fine. The buffet was huge with lots of variety. The Pasta Bar was the best, the chef lets you choose your own noodles, sauce and toppings and makes it right in front of you. Just stay away from anything you don't think will sit right. We never went hungry, we ate like pigs! Just be careful of the eggs, someone was sick one day and we narrowed it down to possibly the eggs. The a-la-cartes were ok, the Chinese one was probably the best. We weren't too impressed with the Italian or the Mexican, but again, you never go hungry. The 24 hr bar has good food too (fries, pizza, hot dogs) if you really need something to eat.Staff: Well what is there to say about the animation staff at Caribe Club? They were probably one of the reasons we had such an amazing trip. Even though they would make us do dance lessons when we were hung over by the pool, we still loved them. They put on an amazing show every night and it's obvious they work very hard to make sure you have fun! If you are a girl between the ages of 18-25, they will love you even more. They were really funny and sweet. I miss them!Other stuff: There is one disco at the resort where locals come to party too. The disco is great, they play a variety of Dominican music and American music like Britney Spears, 50 Cent, etc. It was a blast. Watch out for the locals though, they will constantly hit on you if you're a girl but they are generally nice.The beer at Caribe is probably the best beer I've ever had. Presidente all the way!! The fruity drinks are good too. My recommedation for drinks is Tequila Sunrise and Long Island Iced Tea. The bartenders at Caribe know how to make a mean drink!The beach and pool are awesome. Don't forget there is a beach BBQ grill, right beside the 24 hr bar. We didn't notice it there until our last day! They have burgers, ribs, baked potatoes, etc.Walk up to the straw market, about a 15 minute walk down the beach to the left. Lots of vendors, and although they are sometimes hard to bargain with, we got some great stuff to bring home for good prices.The mangrove is awesome, it was always fun stumbling through it at 3am after a night at the disco. It leads from the hotel rooms to the lobby. But if you can't walk through it, there is a little train that makes stops at all the buildings. It was so much fun and dropped you right off in front of your building or the lobby.If you want to go to Punta Cana, I strongly recommend this resort. When trying to think of any negative feedback, I honestly couldn't think of any. We had the most amazing time and met some great people from around the world. The resort is gorgeous, the food is good and the staff is amazing. What more can I say?

<Content>Best vacation ever! I went with 5 other people to Caribe Club Princess in May/2004. We were in the age group of (20-21). We paid approx 1200$ canadian and I have to say it was worth every penny. I will try to be as detailed as possible:When we arrived at the hotel, the first thing we saw was the lobby, and lets just say from there we knew we had picked the right resort. The lobby is huge and beautiful with plently of comfortable couch like chairs and a big bar. We went to the front desk to get our rooms and were greated with friendly smiles and drinks were put in our hands. Our rooms weren't ready when we got there, but no big deal, we hit the bar at the lobby and were already pretty drunk within 45min of being there. I am not sure if this is because we were younger or not, but the bartenders were NOT stingy with the booze and were pouring at least 3/4 of the cup with rum or whatever booze you wanted! I would say our rooms were ready within an hour or an hour and a half, but who's counting, just sit back and relax with a drink and wait. Also if you have never traveled before, you should always bring your bathing suit and a towel with you in your carry-on bag, as there is washrooms that you can change in and you can go lay by the pool, or go to the beach just remember to bring the important stuff with you if your rooms aren't ready..such as digital cameras, money, passports..etc..and keep them in your carry-on bag and bring the bag with you to the pool or beach.Now this place is huge! The lobby is about 10min walk from the beach and your hotel room, however there is a little train (golf-cart type) that will pick you up from the lobby and take you to your hotel room (it runs about 14 hours out of the day). However the walk was nice as you walk through a man-grove which for those who don't know what that is: it is a beautiful pathway surrounded by trees, flowers...etc and it was very nice walking through it and they also played music from little speakers while you passed. But if you were too drunk, or tired to walk, just wait a few minutes for the train. Also if you started walk cause the train was taking a bit longer if the train was passing by while you walked it would stop and pick you up if you waved them down.The Hotel was very nice as were our rooms....we were 3 people in each room and had asked to be placed close together and we managed to get rooms side by side which was great. Rooms were very clean...actually I found my room cleaner then hotels here in Canada and the Maids are just wonderful! We each pitched in about 15$ (all 6 of us) and went to the dollar store before we left to get things to give the maids (we bought those little b-day bags to put the stuff in and we gavew our maid something everyday and she loved it. We did tip the bartenders quite a lot and we did get better service...also we were with 4 attractive girls so that may have helped when they went up for drinks too. Either weay I always had a drink. The middle of the hotel was open air so if it rained it would rain in the middle of the hotel into the gardens at the bottom, and it was very pretty (the hallways were very wide and well protected if it rained). Do watch out for the stairs if it rains, as they do get a little wet and slippery (no one fell that I know of)The beach was fantastic! White sand...clear water, and we did walk up and down the beach and saw other resorts and I can honestly say we had the best part of the beach. The LTI resort is beside ours..but quite a walk away and that resorts beach had quite a lot of seaweed and darker waters (little scary for my liking). The Pool was huge! and the swim-up bar was great...if you are a smoker, remember to remove your smokes before going in the water as I ruined 2 full packs that way...but then again I was drunk.Ok the food...Actually in my opinion it was great....I had no bath-room problems the entire week...a few of my friends did...nothing serious that ruined there vacation but we believe this was more do to the excessive drinking, laying in the sun, the food, and the fruity drinks (natural laxitive people - coconut). And it isn't like anyone really had the runs but they just went to the bathroom more frequently....but I guess you would when you start drinking at 10am and don't stop until about 6am then sleep for like 4 hours. I found the fresh made pasta bar to be the safest and best way to go with the food. The Chinese a la carte was excellent....we were a little nervous about that one....but it was great....stay away from the Mexican a la carte...we all hated it and had to go to the buffet right after for some proper food. And the Italian was excellent as well!There is a 24 hour bar that is by the beach and right by the hotel/your rooms and was great for drinking the rest of the night away after the DISCO! The disco was actually at another resort, that is beside us, but it is about a 3 minute walk from the lobby and completely safe as you are still on the grounds and don't have to leave the grounds to go. The disco was a hit and miss....but we made some good friends there and we owned that club! If you are looking for Cancun type place then don't bother, we made our own fun and had a blast and it was great to meet people from Canada/Toronto/Montreal. We had a Canadian theme night the we planed with the others that we met and did that at the 24 hour bar and had a blast withabout 20 people.The animation staff are great! they trying everything to get you off your --- and get involved in the activities....girls beware...they come on strong...and it seem the whiter you are the more they want you...so if you are really pasty and big chested beware!Ok this is getting a bit long...so to wrasp it up....the place is huge...great big pool, lobby is beautiful!, the beach is excellent...foood was not bad in my opinion, but if you were to ask my friend who is a picky eater she wouldn't agree, but she didn't starve either and always found something to eat. If you are young and you can get a good deal on this resort then do it!!!!! you won't regret....just make sure to have a good size group (5 or 6 people) and make your own fun..thats what we did and had the best time of our lives! And if you go here I hope you do to.

<Content>One Short Week In Paradise WOW! How time flys when you have fun. My wife and I returned from Punta Cana on the 29th of January. We were there for a week, and all we can think about is the fantastic time we had. At firsth the arrival at the airport seemed a bit overwhelming, but once we met with our Air Canada rep, we were directed on which of the many buses to go on. Hang onto your bags at the airport, the locals like to help out by loading luggage onto a cart and take it to your bus. Little did I know, the expected a $5/bag tip. The trip to the hotel was a bit longer then we expected, but the view from the bus window was well worth the trip. Once arriving to the hotel, the first thing you notice is the size of the lobby and the shiny floors, and friendly staff whom immediately offer you a non-alcoholic drink. We were at the counter almost immediately, recived our wrist bands and were whisked off to our hotel by the shuttle (with our baggage). As we have read about complaints of the distant walk from the lobby to the hotel, it is a very beautiful walk along that path, and we did not use the shuttle our entire time there for that reason. Although we were supposed to recieve an ocean/pool view, once arriving to the room, we noticed the view was a garden view. If we looked to the left, we could however see the ocean. The said they would change it the next day, but we enjoyed the peacefull view.. and needless to say, it is not every moring you can wake up, look from your bed to see a palm tree with coconuts. The staff was wonderful, helful and funny. We tiped the maid daily, and she made beautiful arrangements with the towels and real flowers each morning and evening. The room was cleaned throughout the day. Never once did we have to ask for clean towels. The food  drinks were great. We tried almost all foods and drinks. It was fantastic. We did not get sick, nor did we know of anyone that was. If anyone was not feeling well, it had to do with geting too much sunshine. (People, USE SUNSCREEN). It is nice to be tanned, but even in the shade of the grass umbrellas, you still get tanned. The sun rays are that intense. We loved it. We would go back to the Caribe Club Princess in a minute. The beaches were clean, the ocean was beautiful and warm and boogie boarding was a blast. IF you want to be busy, you can. If you want to relax you can. There is always something to do there as the staff animation crew invites you to the activities. The theatre shows are spectacular which start at 9:45pm to 11:00pm. THe disco however was a bit on the loud side for us, but we went to check it out and to our surprise, it was quite fun. If you don't try things, you'll never know what you missed. One excursion we recommend is the catamaran trip to Saona Island. For $80 US/person, it was a day trip we will never forget. THere is snorkleing, crusing for hours on a big, fun catamaran while dancing and drinking rum. You end up on one of the most beautiful secluded virgin Islands. On our way back, the speedboat dropped us off in an Ocean pool where you are chest high in crystal clear Caribbean water with starfish all around you. THere are other fun excursions, depending on the amount of time you want to be away from the resort, and how much money you want to spend. We went VIP all inclusive. One tip ... book your meals and massage early. We waited a few days to book our massage, and we only got it at noon the last day. They were kind enough to extend our last day stay by a one hour to shower up after the massage. All in all, we had the trip of a lifetime. We highly recommend it. If anyone has anything to complain about a trip to the Caribe Club Princess, get a life. A special thanks to Mylene (Air Canada Rep.), Ingrid (our maid), Eduard  Hector (Bartenders), Isabell (Shangay Restaurant), Onix (Staff Animation) and Tony from the Cigar Shop, you and many others made our stay a very enjoyable one.

<Content>Great experience !!! Hello everybodyI hope this review can give you a lot of useful information! If you like luxury, good food, delicious drinks and a tropical atmosphere, THIS IS YOUR PLACE!I stayed there together with my boyfriend (we are in our early twenties) for one week in the beginning of January 2005. This was my second time in the Dominican Republic - I was there a couple of years ago, but in another hotel! Enjoy reading my comments!Check-in was very easy, we arrived late at night, everthing was ready, the lady at the reception was friendly and did speak English! When we entered the room, we noticed immediately - WE GOT AN UPGRADE!!! We stayed in a room consisting out of two rooms and two bathrooms! One room had two sofas, a television and a bathroom with extremely large shower, a toilet and a wash basin. The other room had two double beds, a minibar and a huge bathroom with toilet, bath and wash basin! Our minibar was stocked with 7-up, coke and a big bottle of still water every day. Unfortunately we had no seaview, but I am not going to complain... we had a nice and spacious balcony with poolview!The maid service was very good - they know how to keep it clean, and I think that is very important! About the restaurants : we tried most of them! Generally very good and tasteful food. The buffet is huge which means there is something for everybody. At the buffet I especially liked the pastabar. You can choose your own pasta + ingredients and a waiter makes it for you while you are waiting! In the morning you can eat whatever you like and they have also fresh tropical juices, yes... even in an all inclusive-resort: mango, passionfruit, pine-apple,... Diner :The Mexican restaurant is the best! I really enjoyed the fajitas with chicken! You get a nice portion of chicken on a warm plate and you make them yourself! The food is nicely presented on beautiful plates, nearly a piece of art! The Brazilian restaurant is very cozy and romantic... it is near the sea! They come with huge pieces of roasted meat to the table and give you what you want from it! It is served with fresh salad and french fries.The Italian restaurant is also delicious - try as a starter the mozzarella! The plates are extremely beautiful and taste like in Italy, believe me! In general the service of the waiters couldn't be better! They are friendly, smile a lot and are helpful! The grounds and the beach couldn't be more beautiful... nice, soft, white sand and turquoise water - no seaweed or rocks! The weather was not always fine, but we didn't care... we got some rain, but after a couple of minutes, it was sunny!When you walk to the left on the beach, there are a few shops (jewellery, souvenirs,...) It is worth a visit!I hope lots of people visit this hotel in the near future, because the Dominican people deserve it! And I can assure you... when you look at the other hotels... The Caribe Club Princess looks really cosy and beautiful!

<Content>Loved It I just returned last night from the Caribe Club Princess. My Finance and I now wife got married at the resort. It was absolutely perfect. I have to admit we were scared at first, but everything was planned to a T. After some of the reviews I was really scared. The resort was so beautiful; the people were so nice and if you plan to get married there definitely go for the Honeymoon package. The room was spectacular. Be very patient if you only speak English, some people can?????????t understand you. We found that to be one of the best parts of the trip is learning some Spanish. I would recommend this Island to everyone, best trip so far.

<Content>All inclusive??? Got there after customs stole our New Years Eve meal from us at the airport. There was a 3+ hour wait for the room (expected as warned here) and we were afraid to leave the suitcase un-attended (after the kind welcome) so we spent the time in the lobby. Had to beg and advise the staff as to what is included in the VIP package. The room was nice enough and the view on the courtyard was nice. No ocean view from the balcony, but I could judge the wind speed, which was a constant 12-20 knots. The afternoons were cooled by a little drizzle every day and a healthy rain in the early am. The pool was nice and cool, a bit too cool to spend much time in as it was about 70 deg as was the jacuzzi. The beach was very nice, but festooned with plastic beach chairs, so there was a jumble of man made stuff on the sand. The shore is a windward shore so the sea is a bit rough for kids or elderly. All the food was pretty poor and there is no fresh fish to be had in this ISLAND PARADISE (hmm!!) and not much ripe fruit either. The fruity rum drinks? All powdered mixes {:-( Want a cappuccino? Go to the lobby since all the other restaurants have machines with mechanical problems (I suspect, no flavored cofee mixes supplied) so they are simply effigys to a cappuccino!! The ala carte restaurants? Don't! You can prepare a better meal from scavenging the buffet and creating your own dish. All the cuts of beef were magically a ribeye (butchered incorrectly so as to be stringy and chewy) cooked reasonably well. The service is pitiful!! A full house in a restaurant is 3-5 tables in a 12-25 table setting. 1.5-2.5 hours to get a meal served. You order a coke and it comes in 15-30 mins. I know we live in an I want it now society, but these folks would die if they worked in a Manhattan restaurant. The scene is geared to loud music and partying so if it's the sea you want to hear, go down to the waters edge. The motorized water sports are represented as a ride on a banana boat, an elongated float towed behind a boat, or a sail in a Hobie 14. I inquired about the sailing and found I needed a 15 minute test sail (as a certified racing crew of class boats I have a bit of experience) and this is included in your half hour a day. Thats 15 minutes with the guy and 15 minutes with my fiancee. I foolishly thought we might get two hours of sailing. I thought 1 hour + 1 hour equalled 2 hours. I guess that 19 years of engineering was all for naught! {:-) Ah well!!We went fishing nearshore on a 35 foot sport fisherman and the seas were running 4-7'. A bit rough for novices. Everyone but me and a kid got violently ill so we returned to shore. I went back out and spent a bit of time showing the guys how to place the baits in the wake and tie a few new knots. Decent boat and the captain and mates were pretty good for being somewhat new to this stuff. Sorry to sound a bit snobby... I simply have fished offshore for over 25 years and learned and worked with some very good captains.The resort is quite commercialized and seems geared to a theme park crowd. Not my style, but to each his/her own.Would I go back? Naah... I can do far better for the money and live among the locals, on their terms and have a culturally enriching and fun time. I love to fish and dive, so I get to learn and teach as well as experience the real deal in a place.

<Content>Four Star Resort in a Third World Country My daughter and I just returned from a week at the Caribe Club Princess resort in Punta Cana. We booked our trip through Apple Vacations and paid for the upgrade to the VIP package. A phenomenal deal for an all inclusive for two people at a cost of less than $2,000. This week in paradise was part of my daughter鈥檚 college graduation gift. Paradise it was! To leave Philadelphia鈥檚 30 degree weather and bask in the warmth of the Caribbean sun for 5 days was pure heaven. The Dominican people who work at the resort are warm, friendly and always anxious to please. The resort is abundantly staffed with these nice people; it sometimes seemed the ratio of guest to staff was 1 to 1.We truly had a wonderful time and it was hard to leave at the end of our stay. What is necessary to remember while at any resort in the Dominican Republic is the fact that it is a third world country and a country that鈥檚 been in the tourism business for a relatively short period of time. I believe I read that 80% of the resorts are less than 10 years old with half of those built in the last 5 years. If you鈥檝e never visited a third-world country and can鈥檛 imagine what it鈥檚 like, it will become abundantly clear to you on the ride from the airport to your resort. I鈥檓 going to list some of the things that can be upsetting to you in the hopes that your awareness will enable you to overcome and enjoy your stay:鈥anguage. Spanish is the primary language of Dominicans and the majority of the resort staff speak no English at all. Even the Guest Services staff and the folks behind the front desk spoke very little English. Buy a small translation book and you鈥檒l get your messages across adequately enough.鈥ater. Don鈥檛 drink the tap water and use bottled water when brushing your teeth. They told us that the water served at the tables in the restaurants had been purified; however we didn鈥檛 trust it and drank only bottled. Bottled water is abundant and available at all restaurants and bars. We had also heard not to eat fresh fruits and vegetables because they are rinsed in the water. My daughter is a vegetarian, and if she couldn鈥檛 eat salads, her diet would have been limited to fruit and cheese. We both ate the salads and fresh vegetables and did not get sick. I鈥檓 happy to report that the Imodium and nausea medicine I packed was not needed!鈥ood. If you鈥檙e adventurous and like to experience new foods, this is the place for you. There was 鈥済oat鈥?on the buffet one day and all types of sausages the likes of which I鈥檝e never seen before. However, if you鈥檙e like me and enjoy eating foods you know the origin of, there is plenty for you as well. The fruits are wonderful: guava, mango, papaya, pineapple, banana. The breads are freshly baked and come in a wide variety. The cheeses are also quite good. Don鈥檛 expect margarine as there鈥檚 only butter; don鈥檛 look for sour cream for your nachos; the coffee is adequate, not great. oAnother very important thing you need to know about dining is that it will be necessary to make dinner reservations for any of the five restaurants each morning between the hours of 8:30 and 11:30. This cannot be done by phone, but rather by standing in line to sit with the Guest Services person. Even though I said the resort was well staffed, there is a serious misallocation of resources in this area as there is only one person to take restaurant reservations for the entire resort. Be prepared to waste valuable beach time in line 鈥?it could take up to an hour to get your turn with him. Also, if you have an excursion planned in the morning and cannot be there to make the reservation, you鈥檒l eat at the buffet that night. There are three seatings at the restaurants: 6:00, 8:00 and 9:30. The 6 and 8 seatings book first, so unless you get in line early, you may have to settle for a very late dinner.鈥oom.  oThere are no washcloths provided, you must specifically ask your maid for them. I spoke with a gentleman in the reservation line one morning who had asked his maid several times for washcloths and when she finally provided them, she removed all his towels so he was left with only washcloths. The lesson here is 鈥榖e careful what you ask for.鈥?The housekeeping and facilities staff do not speak or understand a word of English. 鈥淧lease provide both towels and wash cloths. Thank you.鈥?Translated to Spanish is: 鈥淧roporcione por favor afelpan y lavan telas. Gracias.鈥?You can write this and leave it near the sink for your maid. oThere are no instructions in the rooms for anything. Most resorts provide written directions for the phone and some information about the channels on the TV as well as the restaurants and activities available at the resort, but not here. And, unless you speak fluent Spanish, calling the front desk or guest services is not much help. We finally found out the secret to voice mail is dialing ext. 7000 to set up your mailbox message and retrieve messages.  oThere is no clock in the room, and I didn鈥檛 bother to find out if a wake up service is available because I wouldn鈥檛 have trusted it anyway. When you book an excursion in the morning, you have to be in the lobby to catch a bus at 7 am. There鈥檚 also the reservation line you want to get to early as well as the specific seating times for dinner, so it鈥檚 surprising that clocks are not provided. I had my husband call us from PA to wake us; you might want to pack a small alarm clock. oElectricity box. On the wall just inside the door there is a small box that takes the same key card as the door. There are no instructions on or near this box and my daughter and I had no idea why the card was there. Since the card didn鈥檛 work in the door, I assumed it was inadvertently left by the previous guests and I returned it to the front desk. When we returned to the room there was no power. After several hours and many calls to the front desk, they finally sent a person out to check our electricity. It turns out that the key card must be in that box in order for the room electricity to be on. Who knew!@? oShower. The best shower is the 'after beach' shower. The water pressure is surprisingly great; there is a handheld shower head (great to get sand out of those hard-to-reach-places!); the temperature was not hot enough for my daughter, but I thought it was just fine. o If you get a room on the third floor, be prepared to hike up and down the stairs as there are no elevators. This might be an issue for older folks, those with young children in strollers, or for someone like myself with a bad ankle. We were originally booked on the third floor, but were able to get it changed to a first-floor room with some persistent discussion. oMaid service. I had read in these reviews that it is customary to leave your maid small gifts instead of cash. Before I left home I wrapped up a few sample size body lotions and a couple of other items and left one on my pillow each morning. I know she appreciated these because our room was the first one cleaned every morning (before we returned from breakfast) and she straightened up after us at least three times each day. Each time we returned from the beach or pool we left a trail of sand and piles of clothes; but, miraculously, when next we returned to our room, the sand was gone and the clothes were neatly folded on the corner of the bed. Wow! She even returned each evening with an offering of fresh towels and wrapped chocolates. oTV 鈥?a remote control is available at the front desk, but you can鈥檛 get one until after you鈥檝e checked into your room because they need to know what kind of TV you have. You鈥檇 think they鈥檇 know this stuff, but they don鈥檛. So, if you want the use of a remote control, it will require an extra trip to the lobby (more about lobby trips later). There are about 10 channels on the tube, CNN is one of them along with a couple of movie channels. I was never able to find a local news or weather channel; I ended up using the internet in the lobby to find out the weather for the week oLocked safe. There鈥檚 a lockable safe in the closet which requires a lock and key from the front desk at $3 day. You鈥檒l need to get it before 4:00 because the person who handles them is gone after that. Since the maids do come and go from your room several times a day, it鈥檚 not a bad idea to keep your passport and jewelry locked up. oCheck in time is 3:00, but most flights arrive in the morning. We were actually at the resort before noon, but had no place to change into our suits for a swim because they don鈥檛 provide a hospitality suite for guests. Next time we鈥檒l wear our suits under our clothes so we鈥檙e not wasting beach time.鈥each. There are waves and the water is rough which surprised me. I had thought all of the Caribbean was calm, but since this beach is toward to north side (Atlantic side), there are waves. The water is blue and very clean 鈥?no seaweed, no fish. They keep the beach clean by raking each morning. Topless sunbathing is not unusual, but not real prevalent either. The beach chairs get claimed by around 10, but you can usually get one during the lunch hour if you miss the morning rush.鈥ools. There are three, but we only used one 鈥?the one with the swim-up bar. The poolside lounge chairs get claimed early; it seems to be common practice for towels to be placed to claim a chair and then to take off for three hours selfishly making the chair unavailable to those who are actually using the pool.鈥obby. The open-air lobby is breathtaking and a great place to sit on very plush, comfortable sofas and chairs, be refreshed by a constant Caribbean breeze and enjoy a book, a drink and just relax. To get there, however, is a hike from the rooms. The walk is about 10 minutes through a rather odorous mangrove or you could catch the bus that circulates continually around the resort. The bus is basically a golf cart pulling eight rows of seats.鈥IP upgrade. Last but not least is the very mysterious VIP upgrade. Mysterious because there is much discrepancy as to exactly what is provided in the upgrade and little direction on how to receive them. The Apple Vacation brochure list one group of items, the resort web site lists another, and the brochure at the check-in desk lists yet another. Naturally, the VIP upgrade we were to receive did not include nearly as many items as I thought it should and after much discussion with the front desk manager (whose English is poor) we finally agreed on the list in the brochure they provide. The next challenge was to actually obtain those items. Two of the items, a bottle of rum and cigars, weren鈥檛 delivered to our room until the evening before we checked out 鈥?and that was due only to repeated calls to guest services. The 20-minute massage requires a wait on line to make a reservation with, you guessed it, only one guest services person between the hours of 8:30 and 11:30. This is not the same guy with whom you make your dinner reservations... that would just be too easy. Different line, different building 鈥?AND, trial and error to find all this out because it鈥檚 not told to you by anyone, it鈥檚 not written anywhere and not everyone who works there knows about it. At one point I asked the staff working at the poolside activities desk where I needed to go to make my massage reservation and he pointed to a man walking away from me. I followed him for a few minutes and when I saw him join his family on the beach I realized he was merely another guest and I had been misdirected. I was just glad I hadn鈥檛 reached him before he reached his destination because I would have asked a perfect stranger for a massage! The free massage was given not at any of the four beachside massage cabanas, but rather at an interior courtyard cabana the location of which was not mentioned by my reservationist at the time of booking, but learned the hard way, by going to the wrong place and being redirected several times. However, I can say that the free meal at the seafood restaurant 鈥?a huge lobster tail grilled to perfection (that would have cost $25) and the 20-minute massage (as difficult as it was to book) was worth the price we paid for the upgrade.Enjoy paradise and remember 鈥?this is not the USA.

<Content>Great Resort Caribe Club PrincessLinda and Dave, Maine, USADecember 11th 鈥?19th My husband and I just returned from the Caribe Club Princess, we decided to book a last minute trip to Punta Cana. We had picked the Caribe Club Princess, so I decided to read the reviews. I am so glad I did not listen to what I had read. This is our 6th trip to the Dominican Republic, and 2nd one to Punta Cana. I love the Punta Cana Airport. Leaving the plane into that Caribbean air is so great. The process from the Plane through the airport went quickly with no problems at all. From Punta Cana airport it was about 陆 hr trip to the resort. We found the lobby beautiful. Very large and very clean. The Floors were so shinny, you could almost see yourself in them. The check in was very quick and very pleasant. They tag your luggage and it was at the room before we got there. Of course we had to try the Bar in the Lobby before we set off to find our room. Richard at the reception spoke very good English and was a GREAT help to us. We took a 鈥渢rolly鈥?to the room. We were disappointed in the room, as we wanted at least a Pool View Balcony, and got a terrace room by the kiddie section. I went back to reception and talked to Richard. He told me to come back the next day and things would be changed. True to his word he had a different room for us. It was a great room, Pool/Ocean View Balcony. The room was very nice and very clean. Not sure what time the maid got there to clean daily because were on the beach or at the pool all day. I didn鈥檛 go on vacation to stay in my room, but we love to sit there in the morning and the evening and enjoy we view and warm weather. The Beach was great, always clean and always plenty of room. We had no problem getting a hut for shade every day. The Pool had plenty for room and the Pool Bar was great. The food was the best of any resort that we have been to. We never did get to the Buffet for Lunch, but we ate at the Beach Grill, the food there was great. The Ribs were the best ever, inside they had a variety of food, and hot sandwiches which you could make yourself. We tried the Italian and Chinese Ala Cart Restaurants and found them VERY GOOD. We did not get a chance to try the other two. The Buffet was so good that we ate there most nights. After reading some of the other reviews I didn鈥檛 know what to expect of the Food. If you cant find something good to eat then I am not sure what the problem is. We found the food Excellent and never once got sick. They had such a variety for all types of people. The Pasta was super, cooked to your liking, as well as the breakfast with the omelets, cooked to your liking. Of course all that food with Desserts every night, I managed to put on a few pounds. The staff was all great and very helpful. If they did not understand English they would find someone that did. I could not find anything wrong with this resort. It was a very pleasant,excellent vacation. The one day that it rained all day, the staff kept you busy. So the day was not a total loss. We walked the beach a lot and went to the 鈥渇lee market鈥?and dickered with the dominicans. We had a great time talking with them. And came home with a few treasures. As well as shirts for everyone鈥?Lots of Shirts. We already knew not to take the first price they give you, so I drove a hard bargain. But also gave them a gift from the States. I did leave a gift along with a tip for the maid every day as well as a tip for the bartenders that waited on us. They were all so nice and friendly that they deserved something. I cant say enough great things about this resort. The check in, rooms, food, beach, Pool, bars, etc all rate a 6 star with us. We did not try the Disco nor make the entertainment at night. Too much Beach and Bar made us tired after we had supper. The Disco and Entertainment was up by the lobby so you never got disturbed by the noise. We made several trips to the lobby, but always walked, we didn鈥檛 find it that far and the exercise was much needed. I would definitely go back as well as recommend this resort to anyone. Remember to ask for Richard at the reception if you have any trouble, he was a GREAT help. SUPER VACATION !!!, GREAT RESORT.

<Content>5 Stars Hotel =) Let me start saying that this is the second review I wrote and that the Hotel is classifed as a 4 * Sup but for me is a 5 Star all the way. The first time I go was on July and my second was from November 25 to November 28, 2004. Imaging how much fun I have that I allready separted my third trip in the travel agency to the last week of March. I have to admit that my first language is spanish so language no was a problem. But I look every single person in the Hotel and every employee do the best to treat them like kings and Queens. The Animation Staff work so hard from 8 Am to 12 AM with no break no rest. They are amazing and from July I have a new group of friends. I visit Dominican Republic many times and this is the only Hotel I like from the lobby to the room, two beautiful pools, the clean and sweet beach and the amazaing hospitality of their people. People need to understand that you go to a different country where people have million of problems and they do their best to get a little money. If you want to have a great vacation Caribe Club Princess is the Hotel you should visit.

<Content>Great Beach Resort was very nice and the beach was great. Been to many other places in the Carribean, and found that the staff spoke liitle or no English (even at the front desk), the food was the most bland (bring your own hot sauce or spices) and the alcoholic beverages were awful. Every drink I had was like rubbing alcohol. Even the beer was like beer flavored rubbing alcohol. I'm not a picky eater or drinker by any means. Entertainment wasn't worth while, and the same music was played day and night for the whole week. A cheap place to visit, but just bring your own booze and spices. Have fun

<Content>First class all the way Reading some reviews makes me wonder if the critical reviewers were at the same resort. Our week (Nov. 7-14) was first class all the way. Excellent and clean accomodation, good service, freindly hotel staff and great food. Fully deserving of its 4-star rating. A very tastefully decorated resort with three magnificient pools and one of the best beaches anywhere; no rocks, no weeds, in fact... no fish! We even wondered where the fauna was; no flies (during our stay), no birds picking at your food (in fact we only saw 4-5 birds all week) and I only saw one lizzard and one cat all week. Oh yes, and three dogs about one kilometer up the beach. The idea of being able to eat at full service restaurants instead of the usual buffet was refreshing and the food excellent. We particularly enjoyed the Pescatore, the Chinese, and the Italian. Apparently the best might be La Cava but we didn't get a chance to try it out. Honestly, these are the islands and visitors should not expect a replica of the USA. This resort is excellent and very clean, Dominicans smiley and friendly, the beach outstanding and you have to be unlucky not to be happy here. Three little points to watch for however:1. If you want a more quiet area ask for a room away from the main pool where all the action is.2. Exercise programs (stretching, fitness, etc...) are weak (compared to Club Med).3. Be careful with the exchange rate. The Spa within the resort has a different rate from the hotel; this is not right. They should coordinate. Otherwise enjoy this great resort. We came with Air Canada Vacations; the on-site rep was most knowledgeable and helpful. GT

<Content>Planning my 2nd trip back to this great hotel! I have been a travel agent for over 20years and have stayed in everything from budget to 5Star properties. I have to admit after reading some reviews, I was surprised at how incredibly picky some travellers are!!!!In the Caribbean, chances are you will wait a bit for you room to be ready. So drop your bags and go have a cold drink at the bar once you have recieved your bracelet! Bugs??? of course you will see some!!! It is the Caribbean!! So bring a bit of bug spray and dont leave food OR drinks in your room. When we got to our room it was clean and orderly. We met the maids early on, and like most Caribbean hotels, a small tip and greeting at the beginning of the week to the maid goes a verrrrry long way! I didn't know Spanish at the time, but the maid and I always could communicate by gesturing and a word here and there.English is limited with the serving staff, but they do try hard. Don't go to a Spanish speaking country if you expect 100% fluent English by everyone you encounter!! My non English waiter always could figure out what I was requesting.Daytime activities and nightlife at this place is wonderful! And isn't that more important than swiping a way a couple bugs?? The staff tries very hard to make sure everyone is smiling and encourages everyone to participate. The evening shows WERE AMAZING! The high energy, complex coreography, and multiple set changes were exceptional for a 4Star resort. Then at the end of the show the party moves to the huge lobby where the activity staff and the show dancers all come to get you warmed up for dancing. At 11pm, if you have the energy, you can move to Arieto disco to dance to a mix of latin and north american music.Food - the main buffet was always well stocked and had more variety than most all-inclusive buttets. The beach grill wasn't quite as varied but the food there was ok. The a la carte restaurants were all good - especially my favourite, the Brazilian. Note: to avoid tummy troubles, make sure any dairy products you consume are cold, and take it easy on Pina Colodas - too much coconut will guarantee you some time in the bathroom! One thing I was REALLLLLY IMPRESSED WITH was the layout of the property. It was very spread out.....the lobby area had a chapel, the evening theatre area, and the shops and internet cafe. Then, you either walked or were shuttled through a luscious garden/rain forest pathway  entered into the hotel room section with pools, restaurants, and activities. It was a great layout because it kept the evening noise far away from the guest rooms. There is a little fantasy island kind of shuttle that runs through the property 24hrs a day.Some GENERAL TIPS........ relax, have some patience, shed that hyper way of life we North Americans have.........a smile, and an attempt at communication goes a long way........dont let a late taxi, one rude employee, or a broken air conditioner be the first things you mention in remembering a trip - all of those things can happen right at home! I can hardly wait for April to come so I can head back to this great resort!

<Content>Not what I expected First, when we arrived at the Caribe Club Princess at 4pm, our room was not ready. We waited four additional hours. Our luggage was lost on the way there. No one at the resort cared to help. Our room did not have a working telephone. We paid for a deluxe room and ended up on the far back corner. We were without running water in our room for a day. The people were not friendly or helpful, not what I expected at all. I would not return to this resort.

<Content>Fun on a Tropical Island our visit on June 20-28, 2004 Our family (3 of us) decided in May to take this trip. I admit I did very little research because a friend, who is a travel agent said she goes here every year and every year she has a great time. So we decided to book the vacation through her. We only had her word on it. Once the vacation was booked and it was getting closer and closer to leave I got to thinking that maybe we should learn more about this resort. So I found this website and started reading the reviews. First let me say all you people that had a BAD time. You must not travel often becuase your taste in hotels are the worst. The HOTEL was the greatest, we had food anytime we wanted, drinks anytime we wanted, the pool swim up bar was the greatest. There were activities every night. We have never been outside the United States except to Canada and this trip made us not only want to come back to this Island but to the resort as well. We never got sick. When we arrived we were greated with friendly smiles, drinks and very nice people. The people there loved my son, who is half mexican but at the time didn't speak an ounce of Spanish (but is now learning it as a second language for the next time), learned that his last name (different than mine), meant Rib Bones and when we signed up for the trips we used his last name and all of the tour guides would welcome us by saying Welcome Home to your homeland.However, there was one small problem, the first day we arrived we had in our room bedspreads - the next day the bedspreads were gone - and we never got them back, but that's ok we didn't need bedspreads anyways. We did take advantage of the Apple Vacation tours, which were presented to us by our Apple Vacation Representative. We wanted to learn more about the Island Hispanola and the Dominician Republic, here are the list of tours we took:Outback Safari tour on Monday, which was the greatest. Our guide and driver were awesome and got everyone involved including the shy ones. We toured the jungles of the Dominician, Went to a Dominician Ranch and had lunch, visited a typical Dominician Family, Rum-Coffee-Cocoa farm, and went boogie boarding. 5 Stars to this trip.Sanoa Island tour on Tuesday, which was again the greatest. Our guide and crew were again awesome we partied on the boat and on the beach. We had probably the best food around. Fresh grilled fish steaks, chicken, pork chops, veggies, rice, fruit and all the drinks you can drink. After spending several hours on the beach we loaded up everyone on speedboats and went to a Natural Swimming pool out in the middle of the ocean and saw giant Star Fish (HUGE), I have never seen those big of star fish before. 5 Stars to this trip.Marinarium tour on Wednesday, which again was the greatest. Our guides were great. My male friend has Asthma and was having difficulty swimming to the Shark/Ray tank and they helped him into the tank. The Dominicians are the most friendliest people I know. We spent an hour with the Sharks, Rays and Fish and had a great time. This was my sons all time dream was to swim with Sharks and he got to do it. 5 Stars to this trip.Santo Domingo tour on Thursday, which was an okay trip. This trip was more for the History Buffs, who wanted to learn more about Christopher Columbus and the Cathloic Church. We were disappointed of the amount of time we actually got to shop, only 45 minutes and two different places, not alot of choices. 2.5 Stars to t his tirp.We were leaving on Sunday so we decided not to take anymore trips but we diffently got a cultural shock when we decided to take a taxi to Plaza Bavaro. The store keepers would literally grab your arm and try to get you to go into their stores. I understand they are trying to make a living. However my motto is If you are nice to me and don't invade my physical space, I will be glad to come into your store. But all in all it was an experience and would probably go to Plaza Bavaro again and again.We are looking on our calendar for the next time we can go to the Punta Cana, Dominician Republic and visit this hotel again and again!!!!!!

<Content>Beatiful is the Landascape, but from the resort you must Escape !! We have just returned from 3 weeks from this supposed to be a 4 superior star resort !!!Arrived at 21.30 on the 9th of August, check in was quite quick (obviously without a wellcome cocktail!), we got a single and a double room and the luggage arrived with us, so far so good !The single was ok but when we tried to get into the double room, first problem: the magnetic key didn't work.... Went back to ring reception from the single room and we were told No problems, 5 minutes(if you decide to go there you'll hear a lot this sentence, so keep it in mind!!). After 15 mins I decided to go personally to receiption (which is a long way about 10 mins walk!).Half an hour later we finally got into the room.The room was very nice and big, quite clean apart from the bedding, the fridge was stocked with water and 2 Cokes and 2 Sevenup (in the next days something was always missing!). Tried to phone the single room, but obviously the phone did not work! As it was late, we decided to leave it to the next day!Next day we got up quite early 鈥榗ause of jet lag (about seven!) , and we noticed that the beach was already completely full of towels! We wondered how that could be possible! It took some days to realize that a lot of people got up at six to take even more than a sunbed each (by the pool and on the beach!), plus the resort was overfull, about 1900 people and when we complained the first time, they told us that there were 2000 sunbeds, so we should have found some free!!We tried to forget about the incoveniences (room not properly cleaned and cleaned whenever they wanted, no telephone, no sunbeds, impossible to book restaurants without queuing for at least an hour, impossible to book the 2 catamarans, as they were always booked and so on鈥?) and enjoy ourselves, but after 10 days enough was enough.We got the solution to all the problems : THREATHEN AND DOLLARS !What a good thing for a 4 $$$$tar $uperior !!So here鈥檚 what happened next鈥?Went the 11th day to receiption, asked for a manager (in this case Mr. Louis) said I wanted my money back 鈥榗ause I wanted to move to next door resort and then I got my place on the beach booked nearly everyday (although sometimes they forgot). The phone in the afternoon was fixed and I gave a tip to the maid and the room was cleaned properly everyday.I had to become friend鈥檚 with the manager of water sport centre, luckily he was italian like me so I could get also the catamaran at leat nearly once a day.As for the bars, if you want cold water, forget it! Warmer than in the shower!Restaurants are ok but not amazing although Italians are very demanding about the standard of food. Wine is very good to use as vinegar!The beach is wonderfull, white sand and torqouise sea (that鈥檚 why we chose this resort), although unless you鈥檚tay on the first line of sunbeds, you鈥檒l not be able to see it 鈥榗ause everything and everyone is so squashed together.Apart from all this the rest is fine as a 2 star hotel, so if you really want a 4 star don鈥檛 even consider this place cause, I repeat again, it is very badly managed. Bavaro has plenty of other resorts鈥︹€?

<Content>Read this and you'll truly understand What a trip!! We left on July 31st and came back on August 7th, 2004. I thought for a long time how I would write this review. What I wanted to do was write something that addressed both the previous negatives and positives of this trip. First of all, before we had even picked this trip, we read hundreds of reviews including this one to Punta Cana Caribe Club Princess alone. We looked at all the pros and cons of the trip and took that into consideration. Just to give you a small background of us, we are Chinese born Canadians. We stood out like there was no tomorrow. We were not Europeans and we had the VIP package. The flight in was very nice. Although I agree that the check in time was rather unusual at 3:30 since we got in around noon time, we had the opportunity to leave our bags at the front, take the little bus that toured the entire resort and have a buffet lunch. We did not waste time as every minute counted. By the time we ate and finished with the tour it was already 3:30. When we checked in, there was a host named Angel Nunez (hotel PR rep). If anybody runs into this guy, please tell him that we are trying to locate him. His e-mail address did not work and we are trying to reach him to let him know what a fantastic time we had. We had 2 long hours of conversation with this gentleman and he even spent a night out with us at one of the restaurants. Deller, our AC rep was amazing. This man is one of the friendliest person in the world. We took 2 trips from the guy. Both $70 US each, one to the Marinarium excursion and the other to the Manati Park. The first was worth it, the latter maybe not. Read below.Since we had the VIP package, we had the opportunity to sample all the fine restaurants. From Italian, to Mexican, to Brazilian, to Chinese and of course Dominican, not to mention the seafood restaurant. Honestly, it beats the buffet. We would eat at those restaurants and go back to the buffet just to see what was served that night at the buffet and the restaurants far out weighed the buffet. Dominican was probably the least favorite next to Brazilian while the seafood place and Chinese were awesome!!! The lobster at the seafood place was A++++ . Someone wrote about the flies in the buffet lounge and all I have to say about that is that the place is wide open. There are no windows so therefore there will be flies. PEOPLE IT鈥橲 NOT THE END OF THE WORLD! We had flies but it was not like they were swarming around you. Treat it like an outdoor picnic. Our stomachs were fine until the very last day when it started to grumble but by then, we were going home. We couldn鈥檛 pin point it but it might had something to do with the fact that we accidentally gulped some ocean water as we were swimming in the ocean during a fairly windy day on the beach. There were many negative views on how Europeans were treated better and that the staff spoke very little English. As far as I鈥檓 concern, ignore these people. The challenge to be able to speak to the Dominicans in any language besides English is fun. I know no Spanish yet I felt I was treated equally. Everybody on the island knew I spoke no Spanish since I was Chinese and looked it of course. The staff would speak broken English to you and I would not want it any other way. That鈥檚 the beauty of a vacation especially if it's in another foreign country. To understand other people鈥檚 culture. The experience was fabulous. I learned a few new Spanish words. One bus driver, Johnny was his name, speaks perfect Spanish and okay English but he taught me a lot. The man would say good morning to me almost every morning and drive me wherever I wanted to go on the resort. If I went to Cuba, Italy or anywhere else where English is not the first language, then that is what I would want. It鈥檚 true that if you try to speak their language, that they treat you with even more respect. For all those North American tourists who complained that communication was a problem, my advice to them would be to stay home. At least, you鈥檒l be speaking perfect English there. The Dominican is just fine thank you very much.Someone else wrote in about bugs or ants in there room. I wanted to test this theory out. What on earth were these people talking about since the maids were in there cleaning our rooms non stop for about 3 times a day. One night, we snuck huge plates of food into our hotel room and left the mess on the table. The next morning, tons of ants were swarming the table. Like anywhere else in the world, if you leave scrap pieces of food lying around, there will be bugs. Enough said.As for the Marinarium, we had a blast! I know the last Torontonian who wrote, who evidently was on the same tour bus as were, said it was not the best experience. We would have to disagree. The 1 hour snorkeling trip to watch the sting rays and sharks swim was awesome. We took so many photographs. We had good underwater pictures taken with both ourselves and the sharks and sting rays in the picture at the same time. One hour was more than enough. You are so exhausted which is great. The trip afterwards around the beach and partying in the ocean with cocktails and rums was awesome. It was simply terrific. The Manati Park was a little interesting and boring at the same time. For $70 US, we swam with the dolphins and walked in the area where the iguanas were lurking. We took some nice photos and the pictures with the dolphins were awesome. The problem is that the zoo is small and there is not much to do. Although initially we thought $70US was very expensive for this trip, I found out from some American tourists that they charge $130 US to swim with the dolphins at Disney Land. As a VIP, we also had 1 hour motorized motor sports which we spent tubing, 30 minutes of horseback riding where we took this beautiful trip down by the ocean with literally nothing but sand and water in sight. No resorts, no people鈥othing. Just water and sand. As well, we also had a free 30 minute massage which helped soothed any achy muscles. We also played outdoor ping pong and tennis. For those who are super adventurous, we even encourage you to go out into the local town. Plaza Bavaro is where we went and we went there twice. Again, we spoke no Spanish but we were just fine. The locals treat you like gold as they know you are tourists. I felt fairly safe as there are policeman standing at almost every corner. All in all, we had an amazing time. We took almost 300 pictures. The place is perfect. Some people, not all, just need to get rid of their snobbish, spoon fed North American developed country attitude. For us, it was a great experience. We understand the nature of the atmosphere and that even though it is a resort, the people who work there represent their country and not Canada or the United States. If they worked and behave like we did in North America, it would be a rather boring place. If that is the case, I think I would rather stay home instead. Feel free to e-mail me whether good or bad. I speak the honest truth. I will give you as much advice as I can to make this one of your best trips ever. My last advice is take the VIP package as it would be the best extra 200 dollars you will ever spend.

<Content>Lot to be desired Arrived at the lobby at 2:30 was told check in was at 3:00 did not get into the room until after 5:00 They say the room has a completely stocked wet bar. Well that means two Pepsi and two 7 up bottles and one gallon of water - no joke. By the way your wet bar is built into your bureau which means you only have three small drawers to put your clothes in. Plan on living mostly out of your suitcases. The grounds and pools are very well kept. The place is clean and the food is O.K. Their web site will tell you they have 355 rooms. What they do not tell you is they have three buildings with 355 in each. So we were dissapointed it was so big. The beach was beautiful every dayThey are very stingy on their alcohol so just tell them to give you more if that's what you want. Frozen drinks are limited to two, Banana Mama and Pina Colata. More variety of frozen drinks would be nice.The lobby seems to be the hang out at night, very large , clean and a nice lobby type bar. You don't get towels until about 6:00 pm and might want to bring your own face cloth [ they don't believe in them ]Lastly, if you are from America you may want to re-think your vacation. This place is about 95% European and is not very American friendly.

<Content>Honeymoon Disappointment Never Again!!!!!! To Whom It May Concern:The purpose of this letter is to voice our discontent with the honeymoon package that we purchased through AGENCE DE VOYAGE SEARS and VACANCES SIGNATURE. As is plain and evident a honeymoon (Aug 16 2003) comes only once in a lifetime and can never be redone, so we try to deal with reputable companies so as to minimise the risk of things going wrong and increase the probabilities that we will be treated with 鈥淭LC鈥?especially that it is our honeymoon. With this in mind we chose SEARS and SIGNATURE to be the ones to handle our special two weeks together. I guess they can not be held responsible for the actions of the people at Caribe Club PrincessWell, let the journey begin鈥?br/>We arrive to the Dominican Republic bright eyed and as happy as two little puppies who just found a new home. We stood there in the lobby waiting for our special greeting and express check in, which of course was promised to us as part of the honeymoon package. We stood there for a good 15 min, only to realise that that was not going to happen. Well the next step was to wait in line behind the 20 or so people that ended up in front of us since we waited for the express check in. About 45 min later we get to the front desk, a little bit tired, yet still happy to be there. That quickly changed.. They dropped a bomb on us, we were told that we were not booked in the honeymoon package. After a good argument and a nice little bribe to one of the employees (50.00 USD) it was settled.. We miraculously seemed to be booked in the honeymoon suite (which was not on two floors as promised by the representative at SEARS). Ok so on to the room, the bellboy takes our luggage and leaves, we assume to bring it to our rooms. So we follow the person from the front desk. It seems that since we gave a little gift he now wanted to treat us as if we were VIP鈥檚. We arrive to the room all happy, we open the door I pick up my new bride and carry her through the customary threshold and put her on the bed. Only to realise that the bed had no sheets鈥ot to mention it did have a few stains on it 鈥it of a turn off you could say. No matter, it is our honeymoon so let it slide, we call for sheets and were told that they would be there in 5 minutes, we say ok no big deal. Ok so lets open the bottle of champagne that was supposed have been there, guess what? No champagne, and we just realised that there were no flowers as promised. What else was missing? Our luggage was still not in the room even though it was taken from us before we left the front desk, so of course we start to panic and call the front desk again. We were told it would be there in 5 minutes, ok we say. We ended up waiting an hour before we get our luggage and we never got the bed sheets until the next day. The next morning we laughed at what had transpired the night before and said we would not let it affect our honeymoon. The room was beautiful in the day light and we wanted to open the beautiful wood blinds that surrounded the Jacuzzi that faced the ocean, only to realise that they were broken. Well once again we call the front desk to get some one to come and fix them; they transfer us to another department who only spoke Spanish, which is ok because I speak Spanish. About an hour and a half later a person came to look at the blinds and told us that they can鈥檛 be fixed, we told them that that was an unacceptable answer. They told us that is was no big deal, all there was to see was the beach, nothing really interesting (hello!!! we came to this country to see exactly that...THE BEACH). As you can imagine, we stood there completely stunned at his answer. The person left and we decided to roll up the blinds ourselves and tie them up with the cords that were supposed to make them rise.(we could finally almost see the beach) When we opened them we realised that the windows were so dirty that it was hard to see the beach. Then all of a sudden some one is at the door guess who? The cleaning lady with our bed sheets... glad to see her we introduced our selves and asked her politely to please clean the windows or have the person who cleans the windows do so. She said it would be taken care of later, we thanked her, and then asked her what these strange looking things in wood were around the Jacuzzi? She said that they were candle holders and that we should have candles on them, she said she would take care of that also. We thanked her again and she left after putting the bed sheets on the bed, who by the way were absolutely amazing and very clean. Well we now decide to go to the beach and work on our tans. When we get back we are stunned to see the place was filled with cockroaches! We killed three of them and left them on the floor so as to show the people working there that we are not just complaining. They sent someone there right away he then starts to fumigate the room. We told him to hold on because our clothes were out of our bags, but he continued and for the next three days our room smelled really bad not to mention our clothes stunk. When we asked the front desk for another room we were told there were none available. A couple of days go by, all is well.... We called a few more times for them to clean the windows and bring the candles they never did so we decide to clean the windows as well as we could without any cleaning products. This, as you could imagine, angered us but we gave up trying to get things done by calling. Not surprisingly, every day we went to the front desk to speak to our SIGNATURE representative and he was never there! When we would ask where he was, we were told that he just stepped away for a few minutes. After a week of trying we realised that we were on our own and gave up leaving messages for him. A day later, after going to the beach we come back to the room around 7 pm to realise that they had left with the bed sheets again, but this time they had taken our bath robes as well. I was not going to let this happen. ESPECIALLY since there was a nice little sign in the room that states that if we decide to keep any bath robes we would be charged 50.00 USD, so I call for the sheets and the robes, we go to eat supper and around 11.30 pm we return to find that they have brought the bed sheets but not the bath robes so we call to make a complaint.The next day we met our saviour 鈥淒aniela鈥? She did as much as one person could possibly do, she got our bath robes back, she got our candles (a week later) to us. She also made us realise that we should have gotten a bottle of wine in our room, which she tried to get us for a few days before we actually did. She also tried to get us the champagne and flowers in our room but as hard as she tried she could not do everything and we were grateful just for the effort that she was doing.(an excellent employee by the way鈥? The next day, which I do believe was on the seventh day, the key to our room stopped working and we were told that we were only booked for one week, that was when I could not take it any more. I called and gave a piece of my mind to the front desk. They then told me to wait in my room until they will send some one there to fix the problem. The person showed up and told me that I had to go to the front desk to fix the problem so I sent my wife to the beach so she would not lose the sun and I went to the front desk. They apologised to me and gave me two new keys. I left from there frustrated but decided to go to the room and test the key鈥uess what? It did not work, so off to the front desk where on my way I met up with Daniela. She told me that she would take care of the problem for us again when she called she was told that I should stay in the room waiting and they would come to bring me the new keys.. So I did it took 3 hours and Daniela and I could not believe what was going on. Just to say once again, Daniela saved us鈥?Lets talk about the room service that did not exist. Not once of the 5 or so times that we ordered did they get the order correct. Not to mention, the only reason that we could use room service is because I speak Spanish, otherwise if you do not they will not understand you. To the point where once my wife called to order and they did not understand what she was saying so they left the phone off the hook with her waiting for 15 minutes until I got to the room and decided to call the front desk and complain. So the front desk tried to get through and could not because the phone was off the hook with us on the other line. The person at reception could not believe what was going on. Once again we let that slide but we were not happy at all鈥?Let鈥檚 talk about the supposed included activities. What a joke鈥?You cannot make an appointment unless you come at a certain time in the morning to do so, and you cannot make an appointment for a future date (only for the same day). For example, the horseback riding, every day we arrived at the time specified and it was already booked we did not understand how this could be. (you can not book for the next day but we show up before the girl that takes the appointments does and it was already booked). But we did realise that when we decided to pay for a ride that all of a sudden they had room and could take us for the same day, so we did because we love riding鈥?the same scenario holds true for just about all the activities when you pay or bribe you get things, when you simply ask, nothing happens鈥ad to think this occurs at a 4 star hotel I wonder who actually rates these hotels. I should not be so negative.... the hotel actually is beautiful and the food was great just the service needs serious help.Well to all....Think twice....

<Content>great time The resort was beautiful and an enjoyable place to be. Junior from the lobby is the greatest, he is very helpful and a cool person. Hope me and my boyfriend can see him again soon. The bar was great and a place where we met a lot of friends including the bartender Alejandro. Try mamijuana or cocoloco. the buffet is okay but soon you will probably want to order nuggets and fries from room service. the pools and the beaches are beautiful. The room could have been better, there were tiny bugs on the wall. there were even the same small bugs all in the ham and cheese sandwich i got from room service. watch out for that. The resort is okay but if you want to truly enjoy your vacation i would suggest you leave and see what the REAL dominican republic is like. the people are so friendly. go on the four wheeling trip and the outback safari with omar and tony the are a fun team.

<Content>What a let down On the exterior the club looks great, but we did not have a super time. For the most part the hotel caters to the European crowd..the food was abominable, my husband got food poisoning, I got sick also, and even the Dominican food wasn't cooked right. Our room was never serviced, there were no wash cloths, the rooms were dank and it was incredibly noisy. The upside was the beach and the water! We certainly enjoyed that. We are still scratching our heads at the four star rating....

<Content>Time of my life as a Caribe Princess I traveled to the Dominican Republic for the first time last July 31st and stayed in a suite at Club Caribe Princess. I was a solo vacationer who craved a last-minute escape from the stresses of work and home life. It was to be a quiet, writing holiday where I could relax and be inspired. I must say that overall, with a few minor glitches, I was exceedingly impressed by the tropical beauty and simple splendor of this Caribbean dream resort. In fact, so impressed was I by this fabulous all-inclusive, the gentle Dominican people, idyllic land and seascapes that I am going back in a month. I tried to extend my stay while I was there but the resort was full, not surprisingly. HIGHLIGHTS OF MY STAY AT THE CARIBE CLUBFirst, kudos to Air Canada Vacations 鈥?first-rate on the ground and in the air, in T.O. and Punta Cana (special mention goes to Deller, the AC destination representative in DR who did a great job listening to my concerns re the Marinarium excursion -- which I do NOT recommend for US $70. You swim with sharks and sting rays for about an hour and spend the rest of the time waiting impatiently for this group to get its act together. Ask Deller about the other, better organized tours.) The BEACH was postcard perfect. No vendors or children aggressively offering to braid your hair or otherwise beg for money. Just gorgeous white, velvety sand and turquoise waves (that may be too big and playful for laid-back beachgoers). The banana boat is a must! I rode with three French kids whose mission was to ruthlessly rock the boat during the entire ride and have us all tumble into the sea. SWIMMING POOL is aesthetic and romantic, especially at night, when they are all lit up. Once I went swimming at night because it was tranquil and devoid of daytime noise and activity. A restaurant worker passed by and told me it was not healthy for me to be doing that. (Maybe that鈥檚 why I kept having headaches all week.)I spent many a relaxing moment in the gorgeous  breezy LOBBY  atrium reading and writing whilst enjoying brightly coloured  exotic libations. You will love the open air concept, thatched, high-ceilinged roof, gleaming marble floors  warm tropical d茅cor. Be sure to look for Martha, the attractive morning bartender. She is remarkably kind, even when busy and I had run out of bills to tip her with! My last day, she made me a special rum drink in a coconut shell. The often alluded to MANGROVE PATH was one of the main reasons I chose the Caribe Club over other resorts. Here, you will find a plethora of gorgeous jungle plants and pink and purple flowers. Traveling at sluggish speed through the mangroves were the 24-hour TRAMS that circle this huge resort, taking guests from the lobby to their rooms and other areas. One tram goes to Caribe Club  Tropical Princess, the other to Punta Cana Princess - PAY ATTENTION TO THE SIGNS. Drivers are wonderfully alive and happy, adding to the fun and friendly ambience of the resort (Please tell Eduardo, one of the drivers 鈥淢aria from Toronto, Canada says 鈥淗i!鈥?I was in a lovely, meticulously clean CARIBE SUITE #2321, building Coralillo, which had an envious view of the pool and distant ocean. Because I requested and was given a room on the third floor, my room had a fantastic cathedral ceiling. And because I had paid for an upgraded Suite, I had the privilege of nightly turn down service replete with chocolate mints; two phones, one of which was in the bathroom, a coffee maker, iron and board, free use of the safety deposit box, a sunken living room, and more. Satellite TV, 24-hour room service and free mini-bar (daily restocked with pop, water and beer), are standard fare for all room types. (One astonishing discovery I made was that all the employees I met, from bartender to bellboy, had cell phones and satellite TV in their homes!) My building, CORALILLO, was strategically located. One entrance led to the El Higuero restaurant/ buffet, another to the beach, and pools were on either side. Coralillo also featured two courtyards, one with a massage hut and Jacuzzi. ROOM ATTENDANTS wore pretty uniforms to match their friendly personalities but the one grievance I had was that they consistently came late in the afternoon, if not evening, to clean. I think it was because they knew I was by myself, was very neat  tidy to begin with, and did not require major attention. Another thing: the TV repairman came by several hours after I had called, apologizing that he was busy. After identifying the problem, he never came back to fix it. I just decided that I was on vacation and could do without CNN and the world鈥檚 problems for one week. A reassuring and pleasing sight you will oft see is conscientious staff working from sunrise to sunset in order to maintain the SPIC AND SPAN CLEANLINESS of this resort. Guests will note that this sparkling environment, whose accompanying beach is protected by law, is tainted only by disrespectful tourists who thoughtlessly strew plastic bottles, cigarette butts and other litter even when there are garbage cans everywhere. I was peeved by the negative reviews written by ignorant and inexperienced travelers regarding WATER AND ELECTRICITY. These spoiled inhabitants of the so-called first world do not know that brown outs are not uncommon in developing countries such as the Dominican. If you are just such a pampered elitist with an attitude problem, better for you to vacation in Hawaii or Disneyworld. The water and electricity did give out twice during my stay but I expected this as an educated and culturally sensitive tourist. Incidentally, when the AC did work, which was 98% of the time, it worked perfectly and was the reason my room was evaded by ants and other insects. I ate a lot of late-night snacks and sometimes found myself too tired to properly dispose of the leftovers. I was amazed that I had no problems whatsoever. Even MOSQUITOS were non-existent at this resort. I suspect that Caribe invests heavily in fumigation because as soon as I went off the property to hang out at local bars and restaurants, my poor arms and legs were attacked by flying pests. RESTAURANTS 鈥?I loved the Domincan restaurant/ buffet, El Higuero and thought the food was delicious, colourful and well presented. The staff make every effort to be creative, attentive and pay attention to small details. One morning, I indulged in thick pieces of toast which concealed medium-boiled eggs inside. There should be two Italian food stations though because there was always a line-up. 鈥?After hearing rave reviews about the Italian a la carte, Mama Mia, I was disappointed with my risotto. 鈥?I abhorred the instant coffee machines at the snack shacks as I expected fresh and authentic Dominican coffee at all times. 鈥?Food at this resort is 24 hours, unlike others in the area that stop serving anything at 2 AM. 鈥?When the restaurants close for the evening, there are two beach grills and snack shacks where I got rice and chicken, slices of tasty ham, fries, pizza and hamburgers. 鈥?I took stomach medication (immodium or pepto) every blessed day except the last, which is when I got sick; Oh well. Indeed, it was agonizing and inconvenient, especially on the return flight home but I like to think that if not for my illness I would have gained 10 pounds. I had booked an aromatherapy massage and jacuzzi at the newly opened and lovely SPA but was not able to enjoy these as the clerk could not do a manual authorization on my credit card. I had run out of cash by my last day and I explained there was a problem with my stripe, which was probably demagnetized. I was disappointed because the front desk agent did a telephone authorization when I went to pay my hotel bill. Despite his inability to help me, the clerk at the spa was very polite  professional, taking care not to embarrass me in front of the other clients. OUTSIDE VENDORS 鈥?My only complaint about the resort is that on Tuesdays they allow outside vendors to come in. If you see a bespectacled man, usually seated at a table selling jewelry, or if you see a petite, slim sales lady, with shoulder-length hair, RUN. She introduced herself as Lenny and walks around engaging people in her deceitful scams. From these dishonest merchants, I had bought larrimar, amber with an insect inside, shell necklaces, cigars and rum. The next day, I discovered to my dismay that the larrimar was of poor quality (not smooth and chipped in places) and the amber was FALSE!!! The ENGLISH LANGUAGE is extremely limited by most everyone at the resort, if not in all of DR. This striking lack was not a concern for me, personally, but I witnessed other English-only guests who expected to communicate in basic English at a four star and thus became acutely frustrated with the language barrier. Many Dominicans in key service positions actually speak the fundamentals of German and even French (albeit with a crappy accent) only because they have been catering to these long-time Europeans who dominate the resorts. The DR must be given time to implement hospitality English in their school system if they want to start accommodating more lucrative (American) markets. But then, maybe they don鈥檛. After having stayed at resort hotels in the Bahamas, Cuba, Costa Rica and Mexico, I am pleased to say that my experience at the Caribe Club Princess was by far the best and most beautiful in this part of the globe. I think my only real surprise and criticism is that there were no dolphins and so few butterflies鈥?But then, Club Caribe has no control over such things. Thanks to all the staff and management for making my vacation dreams come true... Maria

<Content>Really Bad Americans should stay away from this hotel. The hotel seems as if it caters to Euorpeans not Americans. I think this is a 4 star hotel by European standards not American standards. I was assured the room I would be would have two double beds. It only had one. My friend called the front desk and they said there are no other rooms available and we would have to sleep together. The only reason we had our room changed is because a bellboy saw how upset we were. Both rooms we were in had no air conditioning. I made several calls to the front desk and personally inquired at the front desk about it and nothing was done. I had to sleep in my bathing suit. Whenever we had a problem and went to the front desk the staff acted like they did not speak English.

<Content>love / hate relationship with the Caribe Club The Caribe Club Princess has the potential to be a bargain location if management would only pay attention to some important details......mainly.....CUSTOMER SERVICE! The front desk personell set new standards for indifference and incompetence. I could not get anyone to give me basic information (ie: location of our rooms etc) and arranging for a courtesy room after the 12PM checkout for a shower before our 4:30 departure was frustrating. They just flat out don't care about helping you out or making you feel comfortable. We really don't mind putting up with mistakes, problems and inconveniences as long as everyone if FRIENDLY! The grounds, buildings and beach are terrific. Clean, well maintained and appealing. The beach has a great sand bottom, no shels, rocks or sharp object....perfect for bodysurfing or boogie boarding when there is a swell.Some of the staff are friendly and helpful (especially Poppi from Animation) but overall they lack the friendliness and interest that we found last summer at Secrets Excellence. However, everyone worked diligently and tirelessly but infortunately without smiles or casual conversation.Our room was marginally comfortable because it was underfurnished and eventually a mirror appeared but not the table and chairs we needed. Our friends had a room that was so cold and humid that the walls and doors and furniture were always wet. I had never seen anything like it before anywhere. The food ranged from unappetizing (Dominican) to good (Italian) and the buffet always had enough to satisfy our 11 year old.The signup system for dinner reservations is inefficient and a waste of valuable vacation time .....get on line at 7:45 am because the desk opens at 8:30am with no guarantee of a definite reservation.Unfortunately, our 11 year old son was usually ignored by the bartenders except for the good guys at the beach bar at the Seafood restaurant. The adult drinks are not made with premium liquors; the wines were awful.We had a very enjoyable time especially since every Canadian we met went out of their way to be friendly and engaging.....and that was very much appreciated.Our catamaran trip to Soana island was exceptional. Great staff, (the rum flows freely and the dancing starts up at 10 am) ........beautiful island with fine beaches and swimming....well worth the time and money. We heard horror stories about the free horseback riding trips offered by Apple Vacations at the neighboring resorts. Apparently they give the local hopsital a lot of business.At this point, this vacation was our 3rd trip to the D. R. in 12 months and we would recommend Secrets as the best place to stay (if you are traveling without children). We love the culture and the atmosphere of the D.R. but it is not for the traveler who is expecting the commerically sanitized world of Disney, Las Vegas or Honolulu. If you can accept and tolerate all that can (and will) go wrong (at any time or place and respond with a laugh and and a smile, then this island is for you. I sincerely hope that the Caribe Club Princess staff changes their attitude and and brings their level of service up to the standards of Secrets Excellence.

<Content>What!!! a 4+ resort with no water for two days???? I will not be that negative because the Caribe Princess is a beautiful resort with a staff that is as helpfull as any other staff in Punta Cana.But what i dont get is the boring lobby at night with no entertainment at all. Is it that hard to have a musician playing guitar or a magician doing tricks for the kids or maybe a coffee bar making irish coffees or what not. Speaking of coffee, Hey Senor, do you guys hide the cups in the morning ,i could not get a coffee cup unless i stole one the night before and please fix at least the instant coffee machine. The ride from the lobby to the hotel complex is a nice idea but dont sit in the back seats unless you wear a gas mask. The rooms are 4 stars and the cleaning staff are very concerned with your well being. The buffet is like all resorts catering to a variety of tourists, you cant please everyone all the time. The choice of a la carte restaurants are fine and most of the staff are trying very hard to give you the best service that they know,they have not been trained in the Hotelerie schools of the world or in Roco`s restaurants so be patient and enjoy yourself. The beach is I am in heaven and you wont have to get up at 5 a.m. to reserve a Palapas. Plenty of room at the 3 pools also, I`d get Mister NO smile out of the pool bar and make him pick up weeds in the morning on the beach then maybe he would appreciate working in the shade. The FUN IN THE SUN staff are great for all ages and all languages, they try hard to entertain you. Could you please tell me how they ran out of water for two days and almost no pressure for four. I was so ------ it made this resort a 2 stars. The basic needs of a guest is --------? water. Have you ever washed your hair at the pools outside shower with 30 other guests in a 4+ resort . They should maybe ad this adventure to the list of activities. Other than that,the resort is well worth the price and should be tried by all you travel adviser bargain hunters.

<Content>Beautiful resort, but... We stayed at Caribe Club Princess from July 16-23. It was really a beautiful resort, but we'll not do it again. I guess we are just not beach people. The language was really an issue. I'm fluent enough in Spanish that I could understand most of the staff, but sometimes we almost got the impression that English speakers were 2nd class citizens. I agree with the earlier post that the reception staff are surly. This morning when I went to check out, the first thing she said to me (in a curt tone) was You owe me $20 for the safe. Of course I knew I owed it, but it came across to me as extremely rude. So then the bell service didn't pick up our luggage, even after I called and then about 1/2 hour later I had the front desk call. So my husband and 9 year old son ended up carrying four suitcases down three flights of stairs (because there is no elevator) and up the quarter mile path to the lobby. But I get ahead of myself. Let's see. We were promised a kids' club. We imagined something like they do on the cruises. Well, the club that handles the English speaking kids was closed this week, so we tried the German speaking club. No one spoke English well enough to communicate with our son (who is 9, not a baby). The schedule was posted every day-- in German. We had thought to bring a Spanish dictionary, but not a German one! So, he pretty much stayed in the room and watched cable TV. The room was fine, though if you leave food out, ants WILL get it. For parts of 2 days there was no water. The activities were mostly not to our liking, and the ones that did sound fun were in the middle of the day (3-4 p.m.) and in the extreme heat with very little shade. Food was fine, we enjoyed most of the restaurants. The Mexican and Chinese didn't live up to what we're used to here, but weren't revolting. The Italian was fine. The Dominican and Brazilian, well, we don't have anything to compare them to. I think I chose the wrong entree in the Dominican (ended up with some kind of spaghetti). The Brazilian there is no menu, you just get one kind of meat after another. The fish was the best. I stopped after about 4, but I counted at least 8 kinds of meat! The phone in our room rang at sporadic intervals round the clock, so we learned to take it off the hook. The locks were very stiff in the room doors, so in order to close them you had to slam very hard. This became a problem when people were doing it all hours of the night (coming back from the disco, etc.) Literally you'd wake up thinking someone shot a gun in your ear. The pools were all beautiful. The waves were great for boogie boarding. Oh, our check-in info sheet said that horseback riding was included, but when we tried to sign up we were denied that. I was pretty sick of the resort by the last day, so we signed up for the Outback tour. It was the highlight of the trip-- a chance to see some of the (almost) real Dominican Republic. Now, I know this comes across pretty negative, really, we didn't have a bad time, though. But it was definitely different to be a minority language, especially where our son was concerned. p.s., while we enjoyed trying new foods on the buffet, he lived mostly the entire week on donuts and french fries. Oh well, it was just one week.

<Content>Love the beach, bad choice of resort Returned from Punta Cana July 4 after a week, a little mixed in our experience with the trip. We are a family of 4 with 2 teenage children 18 and 16. Read some of the reviews from trip advisor before we went, so we were aware of some issues but got to experience them first hand now. To start off, the resort is fairly decent. Rooms were clean and maid service was very good, overall I would say the service staff was accomodating and friendly. They don't look for tips when serving you and most of them smiles when you approach them. Most buildings are fairly new and well kept. The resort however does not cater to english speaking guest, most staff even though they smile at you when questioned does not have any idea of what you are asking for. The constellation was the beach on the property, it was beautiful , the only caution I would make is beware of what time of year you go. We waited for the kids to be out of school and this was a mistake. Constant 34 degree temperature and the Carabean sun was more than we could take, had to stay inside the room until about 3 o'clock in the afternoon before we dare to venture outside or else you would melt in the sun. It was so hot that I found myself sweating while standing in the pool ( the water was bath water warm ). The only place that I can say I don't like was the pathway that you have to take from the main entrance lobby to your rooms, it takes you through a heavy jungle type are that had a awful smell. I suspect there may be some storm or sewage water piped back into the jungle to recycle the water. Otherwise I would agree this is a 3-4 star resort. Our experience with the food and the other staff in the resort was not so pleasant. The buffet they serve is out doors. They make an effort to keep the place clean but there were flies on most of the food stations, and although most of the staff are pleasant, not many of them speaks english. We struggled just to get simple things such as a glass of coke or extra napkins. We also found most of the food very very salty. After the 3rd day my daughter and wife got sick. My daughter was more or less ok with Imodium but my wife could not eat for the rest of the week and only drank fluids. I would also caution about the medical care that was available at the resort, when my wife got sick we went to see the doctor on site. She seemed concerned about my wife's condition but I think she over prescribe medication. We ended up with over 8 items and spend $200 u.s. ( when we returned home and visited our family doctor. he said the medication is for malaria and not for simple diarrea ). Last and worst of all are the people at the main lobby. They had to be the worst I have experienced. They are rude and not helpful, on our second day we went on an excursion to one of the island and was told to bring beach towels. The resort supply the towels at the pool area but I was told by my Sun Holiday rep that I could get this from the lobby. The lady at the lobby scolded me for asking for a towel and told me they are only available from the pool house, she then turned and just walked away. The rest of the lobby staff are the same, they never smile and do not acknowledge you when you walk up to them, and I would agree with other reviews that they seem to cater to the spanish speaking guest. My experience have not been a positive one and for sure we will not be return to this resort. Cancun and Cuba was much more pleasant for the same or a little more money.

<Content>AAAAHHHHHHH PARADISE.. Let me tell you how much fun i had at this resort. This was my second year in Punta Cana. I went with my best friend, her sister, her parents and a friend of the family. We went on June 20th and came back june 27th.Check-in: Check-in was ok when we got out of the bus, my mouth dropped..The lobby was absolutely huge and beautiful. We were wondering where our rooms were and then we saw a tram-car that picks us up to bring us to our rooms and back to the lobby. That was cute.Rooms: The rooms were ok we had the view of the pool and the beach on the 3rd floor. Although the balcony door was busted, we still enjoyed it.Food: Do not be picky about the food, because its just ok. The buffet was good, they changed their food every night. The restaurants have bad service and they were slow, but that was the only complaint i have. The grill was also very good.Beach/Pool: The pool was nice with a bar in the middle and the animation stand next to the beach and the pool. We would play volleyball and do aerobics in the pool. At around 3 p.m., the animators would teach bachata and we would have activities. The beach was awesome. One day one of the animators took us on a boat ride and the water was absolutely gorgeous. It was turquoise and crystal clear. Activities were also available.Staff/Entertainment: This was the highlight of my week. I give props to these animators, because they worked really hard everyday. And they were absolutely hilarious!!!! We did not stop laughing, because they would get everyone pumped up. The shows varied, but the dancers amazed me. They were amazing. During the shows, they would give out diplomas and a bottle of rum to the winners of the daily activities and i was one of them! After the shows, there would be a party at our lobby since it was so big. The party would last about an hour and at midnight we headed off to the disco. The disco was very nice and accomadated the 4 hotels around us. The last night we were there, belly dancers came to perform and that was really cool. They danced with swords on their heads. But the animators and dancers made the party. It was like we knew them forever, they were like our friends. (and they were very charming....and cute!) Overall this trip was fun and exciting. I cried when we left..Last year i went to breezes. It was much bigger and nicer, but at Caribe Club Princess, i had alot more fun. Everybody is very friendly and very nice. And dont forget to take pics with the monkey and the parrots. 6$ each pic. If you want braids i suggest you go to the city, which is 5 minutes away. They charge 20$.

<Content>Great, but.......... This hotel was large and beautiful. We stayed from May 22-29, 04. It was awesome. Good things first: We stayed in a Caribe Suite, it was an average room but with a couch and coffee table, we stayed in building #2, we didn't have a great view but we didn't stay in the room much. The refrigerator was stocked daily with 7-up, Pepsi, beer and water. (Maids come 2 times per day, for turn down service.) We left the maids a little something everyday and that really seemed to help, we never ran out of drinks and always had plenty of towels.The hotel grounds were very beautiful, indeed there is a shuttle that goes around this resort 24/7 but it is worth a walk at least once a day! There are 3 huge pools, we didn't have any problem finding a chair at the beach or the pool. The beaches are full of topless women, if you like that kind of thing. Occasionally there are topless women at the pool with the swim-up bar. Our package included a free 30 minute massage, this was wonderful. There is a Spa on the premises for other things such as pedicure, manicure and such. I had a pedicure and it was great.The restaurants, were good. My favorite was probably the Chinese, the Italian was good too. The mexican restaurant was really bland. The Brazilian restaurant was OK, but I wasn't feeling too well that night. I really don't care much for Buffet's, but everyone in our group seemed to like it. Our package also included one meal at the Seafood or Steak house. We chose the Seafood, We had lobster, it was OK. The others in our group had Steak and they said it was awful. I definately would not pay the $25 for either meal. Stick with the other restaurants. We didn't have any trouble making reservations, you can make reservations in the mornings or during lunch hours at the buffet restaurant.Now the not so good:Not really a whole lot to mention here. I guess the worse thing was the language barrier, not much English spoken here. Mostly French and German tourists. Of course the native language is Spanish, but the natives don't know much English, sometimes it is really hard to communicate. We know some Spanish, but are not very fluent.There is not much going on at this resort, not many activities or things to do. Just lay by the pool all day long. The highlight of our days was eating supper. By the way, a meal at the restaurants take at least 2 hours, so don't be in a hurry. We went downtown 2 times to shop and the people here are very pushy, worst than Cancun. If you are going to relax and do absolutely nothing than this is the place for you, it does get boring after a few days. I would say in about 5 years, this place will be hopping like Cancun, as for now it is very beautiful to see but BORING.

<Content>Wonderful, Wonderful I have been to several all exclusive resorts, none compare to the Caribe Club Princess. We were treated wonderful. Everyone was very accommodating, the food was great (keep in mind if you eat in one of the restaurants, no shorts the buffet you can wear shorts) the activities were superb! Massages were to die for!!!!!!!! Our room was absolutely the ultimate, very clean and beautiful. The cleaning staff does an excellent job in keeping the resort immaculate. Beach was beautiful and clean. When I read other reviews and saw the compliants I am shocked, of course, some people will never be happy. We had a wonderful experience and will be going back to this resort. The only complaint is that Vacation Express was never on time and their representative over there was not dependable. We had to wait at every airport and had to reschedule our time with their rep because they did not show up.

<Content>Best Vacation, But A Problem with the Maids Stealing Hey:  We got back from a wonderful stay in The Caribe Club Princess in Punta Cana. Overall, it was the vacation of a lifetime. The activities staff is awesome. The shows at night were great, the food was delicious, and the beach was so beautiful. I would reccomend this resort to anyone in a heartbeat if it wasn't for the maids. THE MAIDS: On our first full day, my mother took her wallet with her down to the beach thinking that there was nothing left in her purse. She forgot, however, that she left about 200 US dollars extra cash in her purse. We came back in the room later to get some cash and noticed that 150 dollars was missing. I am 14, and love handbagas and purses so i brought 3 purses. All of the zippers and compartments were all open in my purses and 20 dolloars out of my 60 was gone. We flipped out and went to the front desk. The maid was obviously on a search for money.  Our room is on the third floor and the balcony door was locked so no one could have climbed up and robbed it. We filed a report at the front desk for missing money. They did an investigation and the only employees that used cards to get in our room was our MAID. We of course, knew it was her. However, the front desk wouldn't get us ANY compensation. The front desk took no responsibility for it either.  We loved the resort!!!! And, truth be told, we really want to go back there. I just wanted to let all know what happened and to tell u guys to get the safe. I would reccomend this resort if u are a person that is trustworthy and having money stolen wouldn't ruin your vacation. It didn't ruin ours, but we are still upset about it and i just wanted to let all know! Once again, i loved this resort and so did my family. It was the best vacation we have ever been on, even though we had money taken from us.

<Content>made me feel like a princess I Love This Place. I had a wonderful time. I arrived on Thursday, June 10th and my other 3 friends arrived the Monday before. We all enjoyed our stay in DR. The rooms were very clean, cool, and the mini bar was always well stocked. The staff was fabulous. They don't speak much English but they do try to work with Americans. There was a trolley that took you around the ground if you didnt feel like walking. The scenery was beautiful. Great for pictures. The beach was clean. The club played a variety of music for everyone. It was always something to do.The pools were always clean and the entertainment staff was great. They performed in the theatre every night and danced their assess off. I enjoyed everything. The Lobby was the fun part with staff. We danced to this step they have specifically for the hotel and it was so much fun. The food was great! The Brazillian restaurant had the best food out of them all. I have no complaints and will definitely come back. Well worth the money. I give this hotel a thumbs up!

<Content>Paradise! I don't know where to start....The Caribe Club Princess was WONDERFUL!! I went with 4 friends we had connecting rooms so it was great to have 2 bathrooms. The service was above great. I must admit that my favorite part was the FOOD! Everything was delicious. We ate from the 'Dominican Station' every day! The staff is what makes this place great. Everyone when out of their way to make us feel welcomed. I was disappointed that there weren't more Americans vacationing there, I guess Punta Cana is still a secret to most Americans. I've never gotten so much for my money. Even though everything was included we made sure we to leave a tip for our maid: Leonida and our favorite waiters at the buffet: Jacinto and Nelson!

<Content>Loved it!! The best resort and the best vacation!!!! We had the VIP package! For an extra 40$, you get a free massage, access to all a la cate restaurants (free of charge) horse back riding, 2 hours of motorized sports, free scuba lesson in the pool, and much more. Not to mention the best service!! You won't be bored and if you're not the outgoing type, you can always enjoy the beach! it's beautiful! The rooms are beautiful and the mini bar is always full. One warning: don't drink the water unless it's bottled, and DO BRUSH YOUR TEETH WITH BOTTLED WATER. I didn't listen and got sick after I came back. But it didn't spoil my vacation and I would definately go back to the same resort again!ciao ciao micky mao!! :)

<Content>I love this hotel! This is my favorite place to visit in the whole world! I have been to this hotel a total of 3x and by far is the greatest place to stay in my opinion. I was there when it first opened and again 2 more times. I am going to Punta Cana again in two weeks but my friend booked our trip so we're going to Barcelo villas.If the food , the wonderful staff , the beautiful scenery and excellent shows even equal half of how they are at Caribe then I know it will be great. When we were there they had beach bon fire parties , great drinks , funny shows and a staff I absolutely adore! I recommend this hotel to all my friends so if your planning a trip this is definately the place to go!!!

<Content>Wow. Amazing...all I can say. I went to Caribe club princess in June of 2003. All I can say about this hotel, is that it is absoloutly amazing. Im not just saying that. It really was. I will definatly be going back there soon. After we got off the plane, we arrived at the Punta Cana airport, where we had to wait a pretty long time to get our passports stamped and such. Then we hopped onto a shuttle bus which took us right to the hotel at about 45 minutes later. It was nice to see how the Dominican People live. After the ride, we were greeted at the main lobby where people got our luggage off the bus. Then we checked in, and let me tell you, the lobby is GORGEOUS. One of the nicest lobby's I have ever seen. There was a bar right there, and the stage where there was shows on at night is right behind it, and you could see all of the action going on. One of the first things I noticed was how lush the gardens were. Everything was green and full of life. After we checked in (which took about 15 minutes), we waited for the shuttle bus to come and take our luggage and oursleves to the hotel. After waiting quite a while for it to come, we were unfortunatly too late to hop on. You have to be very fast to get on it when new people are arriving. So we had to wait again and then soon enough we did hop on, and the shuttle bus takes you through this BEAUTIFUL lush path of very lush gardens. There is music playing throughout the resort, and it is nice spanish carribean music. Once we arrived at the hotel we noticed how beautiful it was inside....or you could say outside. It was open in the middle of the hotel, so there was many wild things growing. I loved it. When we got to our room, the AC was on full blast and we fell asleep almost right away. Everything in the hotel room was really neat and tidy. There is a mini fridge that gets restocked woth Pepsi and 7up all the time, and a TV for your kids which has many movies and other interesting shows to watch. One of the only things I would have to complain about would be the people next to us. It sounded like he was abusing his girfreind or wife, and there was non stop swearing and yelling at even 3 in the morning. We complained about this, and security did talk to them and it soon stopped after a few days. When it rained there, it POURED, and there was no leaks or cracks in the hotel roof, so we were fine. The food there was amazing, lots of variety, and fruit and fruit juices and omlets etc. Lunch was nice, beacuse you could go to either the beach buffet or the A la carte resturaunts, where the food was apparently delicous, (as my brother says.) There was a different theme every night for dinner at the buffet, which was fun. The beach was pretty nice, white sand and blue water. However, there were many waves, which was ok, because we ended up going boogie boarding, which was really fun once we got the hang of it. There is also kayaks, banana boats and catamarans that you can rent for an hour or 2. The pools were very nice, always clean, and there was a swim up bar where there was many assorted drinks and all the alcohol and juices you could get. There is also a hot tub, which I saw no point in going into, because it was already extremely hot. Every hour or so, the staff will come up to the front of the pool where you can dance and do the traditonal dominican dance. I had a blast watching the staff and guests dancing. They have many activities that you can sign up for, volleyball, water polo, ATV'ing, spanish lessons, etc. You can also sign up for out trips, such as horseback riding(AI), snorkeling with sharks (which let me tell you is SOO amazing, I did it and I definatly recomend it,) and safaris into the domincan jungle where you can meet the village people. The staff there were extremly nice and always greeted you with an OHLA! It was fun. You may want to bring little things for the maids like toothbrushes, gum, soap, money etc, for they will greatly appreciate it, and maybe even leave you a little something extra. I could really go on about this place forever, however I would probably keep on going. Overall Caribe Club Princess was one of the most amazing times of my life, and I will most definatly be going back there soon! I hope you will be able to enjoy this resort as much I did.

<Content>Loved it! I came back from the Caribe Club Princess VERY pleased...Bus ride: we got off the plane and all we could say was o my god this is amazing!! went right into the airport to get our things checked and we were right out. we got into a bus and it took us a little while to leave but when we were off we were OFF...they drive like maniacks! but it was ok because we got to the hotel in 45 minutes exactly.hotel: the hotel was beautiful! when we got of the bus we were surounded by beauty already... we came to a loby and it had a bar and it had couches and chairs to sit in. right when you walk up to the people to check into your room they are so friendly. they get you checked into your room right away and they have a bus to take all of your lugage to the hotel and you take a shuttle bus. when we got to the hotel it was SO beautiful. we walked inside and inside was outside if you get what im saying. there were lizards and birds in the hotel area. we walked up some stairs and into our hotel room and it was airconditioned already. we had a mini fridge and everyday the maids come in a restock it with 7up and Pepsi in these old bottles. The hotel was very clean.Grounds: the grounds were very well kept and there were trees and pretty flowers everywhere(for people who love palm trees there is tons) everything is really close together so you dont have to walk in all different places to get everywhere.Pool: there are two pools that i knew of. there was areally quiet one at the hotel that i didnt stay in and there was the one where i did stay in. This one had a swim up bar with all you can drink and a warm tub i would say. If it were any hotter you would probably roast. it was always kept clean just like everything else there. some of the staff there will bring tropical animals around so that you can get your picture taken with them. to buy the pictures is 5 dollars and they are pretty big.(you pick them up at the main loby)Restaurants: there were three restaurants there that you had to make reservations for and a buffet and a 24 hour snack bar. i never had the chance to go into the reserved ones but my brother said they were amazing. i ate mostly in the buffet restaurant and the food there was amazing! i only heard of one person getting sick and thats because they ate the sea food (i would recomend to try it). they always had a different theme to it and it was laways clean. there were so many varieties of food that you could have. the night entertainers would come around and you could get your pictures taken with them. the snack bar always had hot dogs, fries, hamburgers and pasta. and you could sit in there or bring your food to the pool.Beach: the beach had white beautiful sand, but when i went the water had lots of waves. it was ok though because we had a chance to go boogie boarding and it takes a while to get used to it but we did finally catch on. you can rent things from kayaks to wind surfing. so there is lots to do. if you want to get your hair braided i wouldnt go to the people that work at the resort. if you walk up the beach you will find a little place that sells art and things like that and the woman there and her sister braid hair. they will bargin with you for about $20 amerian. they really do need the money. the resort woman charges $50 american per head. we did have a chance to see horses get lose and run on the beach and you can always take long walks anywhere because it really never ends.Staff/Entertainment: the staff there were very nice to everyone but i would suggest learnig a bit of spainish. they always had something at the pool where they let everyone get up out of the pool and do a dance with the very funny staff to there song that they always play there. the nightly entertainment was really funny. they had a couples night where 4 couples had to get up and do crazy things.Trips: they have a meeting where you can go find a day trip to take and pay for it. they are all differents prices but i had a chance to go on two. the one was swimming with sharks and sting rays. we went out on a glass bottom boat and got to look at the underwater life. they surved us drinks and fruit. they have alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks. after that they tought us how to snorkle and told us to get out of the boat. we went to a neted area that had beatuful stingrays and fish and there were nurse sharks that had just givin birth. we came out of the neted area and brought some bananas along. we broke them up and out of no where came all these tropical fish. it was amazing!!the second trip was horseback riding. someone takes you out but you prettymuch do what you want. me being a horse lover galloped and cantered all the time. the horses are all well fed and gorgeous!the only thing wrong with this trip was going home!!i hope this helped alot!! i recomend this trip for all ages and anyone that could go! i plan to go again...

<Content>Good resort, but the beach ... I could tell by my experience, the resort, the food and the room was great. The room service was ok, the bartender were funny. For me and my girl friend the resort is absolutly beautifull and clean.But the beach, compare to Varadero Cuba, was dirty and the ocean was not what i expected ''been a little mad about it'' and in the water don't cross the rope or your life is in danger (boat boat boat and boat) be carefull. Will return to Punta Cana and at the Caribe Club Princess if the price is good for me.

<Content>Relaxing and fun Hi,My husband and I must have gone at the right time of the year, because there was just the right amount of people there, not to crowded. We were there April 29th to May 6/04. We had the time of our lives! This resort is beautiful and I have been to two other resorts that are 4 stars at the Dominiican, so I know what I am talking about. We found that the a la carte restaurants were very good, better than the buffet. The buffet was still good to though. We didn't bring our kids with us, but if you have kids, this is a great place to bring them. The kids around looked like they were having a great time. Lots for them to do. I would definetly go back. The entertainment was fun and there was lots of space to relax. The beach here was the best I have seen so far in the Dominican. My favorite restaurants at this resort was La Cava and Mama Mia. We also had a big room and nice size bathroom. There is a shopping plaza not far from the resort. My husband and I used the bicycles from the resort to bike there. It was about a 7 minute bike ride. There is also shopping along the beach, but more expensive. Keep in mind if they say $40 for the item you want, you say 20$, don't ever pay what they want. You can get them. down.

<Content>Would not go back At best the resort was fair. The beach was beautiful and well taken care of at all times. The rooms were okay however the maid service was very erratic. Sometimes we would get washcloths, sometimes not. The maid would sometimes comes at 8am before we were dressed and other times not come until 5pm when we were taking showers after the beach! My teenagers room was left dirty when the maid went in to turn down the bed. Bring your own alarm clock if you go. The electicity goes out every night so the clock will not go off if you set it. Forget trying to get a wake up call. My son asked for a wakeup call at 8am three times. Got a call only one day and then got 2 at 2 different times. The service in all areas was extremely slow- whether at the restuarants, buffet or the front desk. The bars at the beach could only make certain drinks so chices were limited there. The food at the buffet and all of the restaurants was fair at best. It would take quite a while to get a drink with dinner, sometimes 15 to 20 minutes. We did have a good time at the beach and went scuba diving which was great. I would however not go back to this resort. There are too many other places to go for the money where the service and facilities are better. We did two trips off of the resort. One was the safari outback. It was nice to see the countryside but the trip was little more than a sales trip. First stop was a school where the stopped the class for us to go in. I felt sorry for the kids having all these tourists staring at them. Then they hit us up for donations. The next stop was a coffee plantation another sales oppotunity...coffee, coco, vanilla extract. Third stop an outdoor store to buy rum and cigarettes..Last stop was a beach for boogie boarding..they had only half the amount of boogie boards for the number of people on the tour so we had to share....The beach was Filthy!!!! Garbage, plastic everywhere and the beach was also used for horseback riding and not cleaned up from that either. Not a nice beach. We did enjoy a trip called Maranarium. Snorkeling, bosting...fun and a beautiful trip. I would definitely go back to the Dominican Republic but would pick and differnet resort.

<Content>What a Great Vacation! Our Trip March 27 to April 3rd 2004One word I kept repeating while at Punta Cana, Caribe Club Princess Resort was... PARADISE! A very clean, friendly resort. Anyone who complains about this resort has to be a very hard person to please. One has to remember you are not in your homeland. Customs are different everywhere you go. RELAX AND ENJOY! The staff there are great, make you feel welcome. The evening shows surprised us as to how talented they were and how many languages they speak. Not all staff speak English but have fun with it, there are ways to get your requests across. They certainly don't snub you. Laugh it off. If your room isn't ready when you get there, nothing you can do about it just be patient, relax at the bar have a drink or two. They come get you and drvie you to your room with your luggage. We arrived at 2:40 and our room was ready at 3:40. This is a large beautiful resort! You can be shuttled around but we preferred to walk everywhere. We felt we had to walk so that we wouldn't put on the extra pounds from eating all that great food. We ate mainly at the buffet restaurant. So much to choose from. You'll never go hungry. As for the beach....WOW! the sand is white and like flour, very fine. CLEAN! The water Beautiful! Aqua green. Waves. As I mentioned earlier, can't control other nationalities. Yes there are many topless women on the beach. Its a Mans paradise for sure! Personally, the only thing I would of preferred was that the women respect other people and not go topless on the resort itself. Some resorts don't allow it but the Caribe Club Princess have alot of Europeans and they just did as they pleased. As for going back. YES, MOST DEFINATELY! We LOVED it. Word of advice...check the weather site to choose the best months to go. We had both Sun and rain.

<Content>Not Bad At All! We were at the Tropical Princess (same thing as the Caribe Club Princess in Punta Cana in April 2004. Overall the resort was amazing, great beach and pools....I've listed the pro and cons below:Pros/Cons1. Beach Towels are always in shortage, you won't always get clean towels unless you go V.I.P. (pay extra) and you will get the towels in your room every night!2. Food - Buffet -Huge selection of food, including endless shrimp (Huge Shrimps) every night. Food although plentiful was very bland, everything tasted the same, very little flavor or spices used...everything lacked salt as well. Lamb and Steak were readly available, but we all found the meats were tough and chewy. Overall the food was acceptable, with something for everyone.3. Food - Ala Cart restaurants, if you were staying at the Tropical Princess then you only got to sit in two ala cart restarurants, if you went V.I.P. you got six different restaurants. We weren't really happy with the sit down dinners, again food wasn't that great, it was nice atmosphere....the only sit down that everyone agreed was the italian restaurant mama mia. The Steak House La Cava was ok, since it was included in our package, but I wouldn't fork out $25.00 USD per person for it.4. Beach - Excellent, clean and beautiful. White powder sand, not a single rock or shell for your feet to step on. The only problem was finding a shaded area to sit in. This resort is very popular with the Germans and let me tell you, they get up early in the morning (5-6am) to reserve their chairs. Definately an issue here, same as towels.5. The resort is HUGE, the walk from the lobby to the rooms is a good 10minutes. Although they have a beautiful path of mangroves, this quickly gets tiring, especially if you are lugging kids around. A tram is available to take you between the lobby, rooms and restaurants.6. Very good entertainment, with shows and movies every night. The shows consisted of song/dance and just plain comedy with active participation from the audience.7. Make sure to brink everything with you, if you need to buy film or sunscreen, you will regret not bringing it.....very expensive! Leave your CDN Dollars, bring USD, the exchange rage is much better...you don't really have to convert your USD to pesos as everyone accepts both.8. Bottled water is readily available, fresh juices (a little watered down),

<Content>What an experience! My family (10 in all) visited the Caribe Club Princess from April 9th through the 16th. The weather was perfect the whole time with upper 80's during the day and always a great breeze blowing to keep you comfortable. We booked our vacation at the recommendation of our travel agent through Apple Vacations. The people at Apple were great!! Now for the resort. The check-in went smoothly although we arrived at noon and our rooms weren't ready yet so we had lunch and came back to check in. The girl at the desk was quite bothersome. She obviously didn't want to be bothered with us. I had requested a roll-away bed and she kept telling me it would be there and it was not in the room and it took me most of the day and many phone calls before I could get the bed. We also requested adjoining rooms (3 of them) and we were all spread out but in the same building. She just kept telling me the hotel was full. The first night we experienced a water leak from the ceiling vent in the bathroom, right over the toilet. It took me 48 hours of phone calls and visits to the desk before the leak was stopped! The buffet was great, never tried the other restaurants. No one in our party got sick from the food. Our days consisted of staying by the pool (which are beautiful) and then to the lobby for the evening!!! Being our first excursion out of the country, I think it went well. You can't beat the weather and set up of an all-inclusive resort!!!

<Content>Would not go back A group of us just got back from the Caribe Club Princess. We are in our 40's with teenagers and kids as young as 10. I read many of the reviews prior to our trip and was really concerned. As it turned out, most of the reviews were right on target. For the positives: The beach is very beautiful. The resort itself was fine. The staff is friendly and works very hard to make the hotel fun. Communication was not a problem.The food, however, was not very good. We went to the Brazilian restaurant, called the Rodizio. We named it the Spit and Chew because the meat was so tough that it would barely go down your throat. The Italian and Chinese restaurants were acceptable. The Mexican was ok if you like bones and grissle in your fajita. If your package includes the seafood restaurant, then go. If not, I would not suggest paying $25.00 per person to to there. Many people in our group got sick. Don't expect good frozen drinks at the bars. The only place to get a good drink was at the bar in the lobby. If you want to go to a beautiful beach and don't care about good food, then the Caribe Club Princess would be ok. If you expect good food while on vacation, then select another hotel. We have traveled to many all - inclusive resorts and by far, the Caribe Club Princess was the worst. I also want to mention the Disco. The hotel management allows locals to go to the Disco -- watch your teenage girls as many of them try to hit on the girls. All things considered, I would not go back to this hotel. We didn't pay enough attention to the reviews on this site. We kept thinking that some people will complain about anything. I am not that type of person but believe me when I say pick another hotel.

<Content>A hidden jewel! I must say that going to Punta Cana, I had my doubts after visiting Playa del Carmen in Mexico.... What a huge surprise!!! I HIGHLY recommend Club Caribe Princess in Punta Cana! The food at the all you can eat, was out of this world! the service was amazing! everyone was always eager to help. The beaches are gorgeous! The resort was very clean and from what I hear much better than the other 5 star hotels!It is a nice hidden jewel, and I plan to go back as soon as I am able to! Some things to keep in mind.. do wear sunscreen!!!! It is a family resort where I was surprised not to be annoyed at other kids. Everyone has something to do!

<Content>Enjoyed myself My girlfriend and I stayed at the Caribe Club Princess 4/3 - 4/10. We chose the hotel on the recommendation of our travel agent and booked the tour thru GWV. I have no complaints with GWV or our tour rep..she was great (Sophie from Montreal). We found the property and our room to be neat and clean. Check-in and check-out went smoothly depsite the language barrier. We did leave gifts for the maid along with $1.00 each day. By mid week we were getting clean beach towels every day. After reading countless reviews about this property and all the other properties in Punta Cana , I have to say I was a little concerned about what I read about the food. As it turned out, the food was fine. It was not gourment but I always had plenty to eat . Some food tasted a little different than what I was used to but for the most part it was quite good. I never got sick. I brushed my teeth with the tap water. I did not take pepto bismal before I left like some reviewers suggested. Frankly, I don't understand why so many people say they got sick from the food. The beach was great!! It was a great beach to walk. The water was clean and warm. Youd do need to get to the beach early to get a decent plalapa. One morning we got there at 7 and they were all taken. Two morinings I got there at 6:15, got a decent spot, had a cup of coffee and a crosisant from the bar on the beach and watched the sun rise. Even though you are not supposed to reserve a spot, everyone does, but you don't have to worry about someone taking your place. We left our spot for 4 hours and everything was right where we left it when we got back. We did not see any of the shows...after spending the entire day on the beach, eating dinner at 8, we were pooped and went to bed early. It was kind of noisy but I slept well and I thought the beds were quite comfortable. Early in the week we started out tipping the bartenders $1.00. They seemed surprised but thankful. I found it helpful to have a $1.00 in my hand when there were a lot of people waiting at the bar. The bartenders are not in any hurry to wait on you and there is no such thing as first come, first serve. You just need to speak up and order your drink. As far as brinigng an insulated mug with you like some reviewsrs suggest... I wouldn't. I saw one bartender roll his eyes when a woman asked him for a drink in her mug and be sure you rinse it out first. By the end of the week we weren't tipping at all. For the amount of people at the property I was amazed that there were only a few people at the bar whenever I went up for a drink.. I never had to wait long to be waited on. Speaking of the bar, this was one of my few disappointments. The alcohol had to be watered down. I watched them make the drinks, pour rum into the cup but it never tasted like there was much in there. The wine at dinner was awful..if you were lucky enough to even get any. Onc night I had 3 large glasses of wine and never felt like I was drinking any alcohol. I was disappointed that there was no beer in our mini bar...just water and soda which was always plentiful. I just assumed we would have beer, not the hotel's fault. Going back to the food and the restuarants...the buffet was fine, coffee was slow in coming...but if you can deal with that, than you have nothing to worry about. We ate at 4 of the restaurants...we did find that you needed to make reservations early...8:30AM or shortly thereafter , to get the time and place that you wanted. I was disappointed with La Cava, the steak and wine restaurant. The food was fine but we did have to pay $25.00 for this one which we knew in advance. The problem was that the lighting was so poor, you couldn't read the menu. I went thru 3 candles from different tables to use as lights so I could read the menu. The service was very slow...it took over 2 hours to eat or meal. It was warm in the restuarant and there is no bathroom. I would skip this place if I were you. I like the Brazilian the best. It was more or less outodoors, there was a lot of meat (good for you South Beach dieters) and the after dinner coffee was awesome! We did not have to pay extra for this one. The most stressful thing about the whole week is dealing with the vendors if you go shopping. You have to bargain for everything and you don't know if you are getting screwed or not. My advice is to pay in American dollars. Forget pesos and forget credit cards. I think I got screwed when I used my debit card. I was supposed to pay $18.00 for a couple of items at the market in Bavarro Plaza but when I got home I saw that I was charged $28.28. Speaking of credit cards: Notify your credit card companies that you are traveling in the Domincian Republic. Capital One would not honer my credit card purchases. It is pretty embarassing to be declined! I talked to them when I got home and they reccomended that you call their security department before traveling abroad. So, to wrap this up, this is my advice: Don't worry about any bad reviews you have read..some people expect to much and are just miserable by nature. The food is good, the rooms are nice, the beach and pools are great. Language can be a barrier but you will survive. If you want to relax, lay in the sun and play in the water this is the place for you. Do not expect gourmet food or hand and foot service. There is no reason why you should not have a good time. Feel free to eamil me if you have any questions. Sue from Maine

<Content>You'll Love it if you Want When i started to go here i had every intention of having the worst time, but then the people there just wouldn't let me. From day one i had a positively fab time. The room was good, two twin size beds, one t.v(only problem was getting a remote for the t.v.) The first day, the maid cleaned the room a little late, but then it was all good after that. The activities by the pool are amazing and they have something for everyone. The food is delicious and i absolutely suggest that you never make a reservation. There is no need to, they serve the same exact food in the buffet without the hassel. There is a little bus that goes around the resort which you can easily ride, but by the last day, the resort doesn't seem that big and you almost dont wanna by it. If you start walking to the left on the beach there is a little bazar and you can get your hair braided a lot cheaper, i highly suggest going there, also to buy suvinors, so much cheaper, remember to haggle. The shows are good, except when there is a cultural show, i almost fell asleep during that. I suggest going to the lobby after the show, because they have a mini-dance part between 11 and 12 before the disco. If your under 18 they wont allow you into the disco and there for this is the only amount of dancing you will get. As for the drinks, the menu is absolutely bare for children under 18, so all they can drink is water and soda. The thing i didn't like about the resort was that is was totally seperating different cultures. Half of it was for dutchland, and the other half was for every other country. Not only that, but the country you are from depended on the color of your braclet, i believe that is very racy. It's a four star resort, and i do suggest going there if it's the best price you can get, however, make sure you WANNA have a good time!

<Content>Lovely Resort - Bring your raingear We visited the Caribe Club Princess 3/31/04 - 4/7/04. The Resort is wonderful the staff friendly and everything is very well kept. Unfortunately it rained three full days in a row and almost every evening. The huge umbrella in our room and the floor drains should have been our first clue. Our friends room flooded. All of their activities are outside so when it rains there is nothing to do except pray it stops - we did alot of that. We did make the best of it - swimming in the rain, and trying to play the outside activities. But this gets old when you've spent a small fortune on the vacation of your dreams. The food is very different. Not bad but different. Take lots of snacks from home if you have children with you. The sand fleas are also a problem 11 bites in one day, very irritating. It is beautiful when the sun shines. The nightly entertainment is not very good, we had to leave one show it was too vulger for our teenagers. Again it is a lovely resort but we wouldn't return.

<Author>oh_gifted_one
<Content>relax and enjoy This was our first trip to an all inclusive (April 1-7), so we had no expectations other than what we read (which covered everything from terrible to wonderful). There ended up being about 30 of us from PA, CA, and Germany for a friend's wedding, and out of the 30 of us, only my girlfriend and I got sick (and only for a day and a half...Immodium is a must to bring with you!). Most of the staff (except the maids) speak limited English - but I noticed their English was far better than the Spanish spoken by most of the guests. If you know any Spanish, use it - it's a fun way to improve your language skills. Besides, you are going to a country where Spanish is the national language, not English. At least be respectful enough to learn a few phrases - a little effort on your part will go a long way. Remember - they'll understand bad Spanish better than good English. The food was decent (except for whatever made us sick). I actually think the buffet was better than the restaurants. Avoid the beef though - they have a different breed of cattle, and the meat is very tough. The goat is good though. The activities were great, and the staff made them a lot of fun with a lot of joking around. The beach was clean (except for seaweed, but that's just nature for you). We had no problem getting chairs at the pool or the beach. We didn't even bother reserving them - when we wanted a couple chairs, we just wandered a few minutes will we found them. At the pool, if we couldn't find a chair, we just put our stuff near the bar, jumped in the pool, and picked up our stuff when we got out. We never had a problem with towels - they were always changed every day, even though we purposly hung them to dry so they wouldn't have to be changed on a daily basis. Beach towels we just dried and re-used. The room was cleaned every day, which was nice, since we were constantly tracking sand into it. The only bug problem we had was when we left food out one afternoon and there were a few ants on it. Not a problem - just make sure any food goes in the refrigerator and utensils get washed immediatlely (preferably with bottle water). We left the maids small gifts when we left our room for the day. Tips are also appreciated by bartenders and such. Defintely do the outback safari. the guys are great and really funny (and they speak English, which will make most tourists happy). One last note...haggle hard with the shop merchants. I'm lousy at it, but my girlfriend isn't. They start unrealisticly high, so be prepared to start unrealisticly low, and pay less than half what they are asking (usually about a quarter the starting price). Yes there were a few annoyances, but if you relax and just tell yourself you're on Dominican time, you'll have a lot more fun!

<Content>All Inclusive Runs Guaranteed! We were a party of 6 with a 77 yr. old, 5, 10, 17 and two adults. Everyone but one adult who refrained from eating much got sick from eating the food from the buffet. This is not right when your package includes their food. They provide you with bottled water because you cannot drink the water from the taps. So why do they not provide you with food that doesn't make you sick. If you don't bring Imodium, Gravol or Pepto count on a terrible, terrible holiday with cramps, runs, fever and not enough energy to get out of bed. The 77 yr. old is still sick with the same symptons after a week back. This is absolutely unconscienable that this resort would be so lax in what comes out of the kitchen to have this routinely happen to people. Read the reports, it is like every second report contains a complaint with respect to the food and people getting sick. Plan and simple, when you make people eat your food because you are an all inclusive, your food shouldn't make people sick. Doesn't matter how nice the resort was b/c you are sick 80% of the time. What fun is that when you go for a swim and have to run to the nearest toilet. The Chef stands proudly in the buffet and adminsters the no shoes in the restaurant rule, he should be in the kitchen finding out what his staff are or are not doing with the food preparation that makes people sick. From the reports, I have just read....it almost seems like people accept this food issue as part of the deal. That is absolutely absurd and unacceptable.For all future travellers, ensure that your agent has an explaination for this or go at your own risk. If this resort was in North American, it would be closed by the public health authority!!! What makes anyone think that it is acceptable just because the hotel is in the DR. The irony is that they feed you food that makes you sick b/c there is no other alerternative in an AI resort.This is unfortunate because the rest of the staff do try hard to please.Still Sick about it all!

<Content>Not for us Our trip was booked through Apple Vacations. We were fairly defined in the type of vacation we wanted. APPLE VACATIONS TOTALLY MISSED THE MARK!We indicated we preferred smaller Resorts, they told us the Resort had 350 rooms, NOT TRUE, TRY CLOSE TO A 1000, ALL USING THE SAME RESTURANTS  BEACH AND OTHER HOTEL SERVICES!! You could walk from one end of the beach to the other, probably a 1000 ft., on the beach chairs of the hoards of people that were there. For the first 3 days beach towels were not available due to amount of guests at the Resort.We will be very leary of staying at any Resort in the Princess chain. The Resort was totally understaffed which we could assume but for no other reason but for the financial gain of the establishment. An example: at the breakfast and lunch buffet, we observed no more than 4 staff members for 100 plus tables. Most mornings we cleared and set up our table so that breakfast would not become a 3 hour ordeal! We were congratulationg ourselves in obtaining a cup of coffee while our breakfast was still warm.The rooms provided us were in need of maintanence and decorating.The Resort Spa - we had massages, facial, body scrub, hair and nail treatments, from staff obviously lacking professional training in these areas. Our massages were comperable to a back rub given by your spouse!The food was at the low end of an all inclusive resort, no frills or extra taste! Several of the resort resturants were not included in our package and a supplemental fee was charged, which Apple did not advise us of.Luckily we went for the golf. The golf course had no affiliation with the Resort. We golfed most days at Cocotal and had a wonderful time on the beautiful course and enjoyed the professional staff.If we sound a bit bitter know that we have 15 years of experience of vacationing in the high season in the Caribbean. This was hands down our worst experience ever! We won't even go into the overbooking of our flight provided by Apple through US Air!

<Content>Loved the Beach but not the Resort Our trip to Punta Cana was from March 13, 2004 through the 20th of March. When we first arrived at the Hotel Resort we were very much impressed. The resort is beautiful and very clean. The beach is fantastic. One of the best beaches on the Carribean, if you like to play with the waves. The water is a beautiful blue with white sand. The waves are just the right size. Not too big and not too small. Now for the resort. If you are a light sleeper, this resort may not be for you. There are 3 buildings. Building 1  2 are 3 stories high. No elevators. As soon as you walk into the building everything echoes. So if you are on the first floor and near the entrance of the building you will hear constant talking from your room. Not to stress on the fact that there is a disco for the young adults that is open from 11pm until 6am. This means that it is possible that you may hear someone coming back to their room all hours of the night. Which happened to us. We were on the first floor near the entrance. We complained the following morning and the only rooms they said they had available for the 6 of us would be a down grade in the other building on the 3rd floor, which may be a little quieter. We took those rooms and they were quieter except that for when it rained (every night) you could hear the rain really well on the roof top. The food was not the greatest. We've had much better at all of the other resorts we've been to. We were all a little sick from the food, if you know what I mean. There was a buffet that you could go to without making reservations and also a couple of snack bars by the beach for lunch. At night you had a choice of 7 different restaurants, but you had to make reservations daily in the lobby of your building, between 8:30am and 10:30am. You did not have the choice of what time you wanted. There were only 2 choices, like for example 6pm or 8pm. Some of the staff people that worked with the visitors could have known more english. Like for instance - the operator did not know any english. All in all Punta Cana is worth visting but I would not return to this resort.

<Content>Wish I was still there... I am a student at Denison University and a group including myself and 6 others went to Punta Cana for our spring break (March 13-20). We had an absolutely fantastic time, and we wish we could still be there. We organized the trip through Apple Vacations, and they made the trip go very smoothly.So where to begin? We arrived at the airport around 6:30 on Saturday night. The airport was very crowded, as a huge AirFrance plane had landed at the same time. However, we still got through the airport rather quickly. Just be prepared for some pushing and shoving through the crowds. From the airport, it was about a 45 minute ride to our hotel, because the bus stopped at some other resorts along the way. It was dark at this point, so we didn't really get a good view of the real people on our way in.I'm going to lay the rest of this out so you can decide what you want to read about.Check-in/Check-Out: Both of these went very quickly and smoothly. The people behind the desk could speak English well enough to understand. We requested to have the TV remote when we checked in, as suggested in another review. The bellboys took our luggage straight to our room, while we took the tram. We wouldn't have taken it if we had realized how short of a walk it was to our rooms. It's really only about 5 minutes and you get to walk through the beautiful mangroves. Our departing flight did not leave until 8:30, so we planned to stay at the resort until 5, but checkout was at noon. The front desk assured us that we could use the showers in the spa so we could go to the beach for the day. However, there was a fiasco and we went to the spa and they wouldn't let us use the showers. So, after some begging and pleading with the front desk, they were nice enough to allow us to use 2 hospitality rooms to shower in.The rooms: Among us we had 1 room with a king, 1 with 2 doubles, and 1 room with 2 double beds and a couch. The rooms were very nice, all on the first floor with views of Pool 1. 2 of us were in Building 1 and the triple was in Building 2. On the first night, we requested blankets for the couch in the triple, but they never came. The room I was in was at the end of the buiding, closest to the beach and the 24 hour bar, so we usually used the sliding door on our terrace rather than the real door. The maids were very nice and cleaned every day, sometimes they would even arrange our towels in neat patterns or leave flowers for us.The beach: Very beautiful. We found it best to wake up early and put your towels on some chairs in order to get a front-row cabana. If you didn't do this, you could still find chairs, you just weren't in the ideal spot. We never had a problem getting towels, I never used the one that I brought. Lots of topless women and men in Speedos. You could walk up and down the beach for several miles. The water was fairly clear, and not too seaweedy. We noticed that the waves by our resort were bigger than many of the others.Food: There are 5 a la carte restaurants and the buffet available. We ate at all 5 and had a different experience at each one. You need to make reservations in the morning at the concierge in your building. We usually did this fairly early, but found that the lines were much shorter in Building 2 than they were in Building 1. On our first night, we went to the Dominican restaurant and had an amazing time. We couldnt get a reservation until 9:45, so we were the last people there. The servers were incredibly friendly (especially Angel) and we all danced and took shots of Mamajuana together. It was definitely the most fun night. Foodwise, I thought the Italian restaurant was the best. We ended up eating there twice. Be sure to order the risotto- its wonderful. There were two other restaurants, but they were $25 a person extra, so we never went there. We had breakfast at the buffet... lots of wonderful bread and fruit. For lunch, we either went to the buffet again or had a hamburger from the grill at the beach. The hamburgers were really good. Great bread and even better if you put some lime juice on them. I personally had no stomach problems, although several in the group did. My advice is, if you have a weak stomach, make sure you bring the Pepto.Activities: There were several excursions offered through Apple vacations. We never went on any of them- simply because we enjoyed our beach time so much. We also decided against snorkeling because there is really no decent place to go at the resort, and you have to pay to be taken out to quality areas. Some members of the group got really into playing volleyball, and we met some other people from other countries that way. The animation team worked incredibly hard all day. There was something going on non-stop from 11:30 to 5:30. The European techno is playing at Pool 1 most of the day. They seem to have 1 CD that they just put on repeat, and you will hear the same songs over and over again. We didn't really mind this and now we miss a lot of this music, but we can see how others might find it annoying. The animation team would also wander the beach and try to make small talk. Many times, their English was not very good and it was hard to understand them. Often times they were VERY friendly to the girls on the trip, showering you with compliments.Souvenirs: There are a couple of gift shops at the resort. In my opinion, don't buy ANYTHING here if you can help it. They are very overpriced: $3 for a bag of M  Ms. On Tuesday nights, local merchants come into the resort and they sell jewelry, artwork, cigars and all sorts of things. They are fairly aggressive, and we learned that you just have to be aggressive back. If you are a woman, make sure you have a guy with you, as the vendors will often try to pull you aside and haggle with you privately. However, we found that women usually get better prices on things anyways. You should be able to get at least half of of the original price, but usually a lot more than that. My friend got a mask for $20 that was originally $250!. The vendors are very willing to take US dollars. If you walk down the beach to the left, there is a market with lots of vendors selling similar items. We bought things in both places, so just shop around and find the best price. Of course, each vendor will tell you that for you, its a special price... but they all say that. We were even told that he would give us 99% off! The vendors speak very good English as well. We also found that you can trade American merchandise for their products. My friend was wearing a $4 Wal-mart Texas visor and she traded it for a sarong! We also saw a man trade his shirt for some cigars.Nightlife: We would usually just go up to the lobby to hang out. They had a great bar, and the animation team would play music and dance for about an hour. They would occasionally have theme events like the Tequila Zombie (a coffin-shaped beer bong except with tequila!) and karaoke. This would usually shut down around 12:30, and by then we were usually exhausted and ready for bed. We would sometimes go to the 24 hour bar that's on the beach. Lots of people go to the disco that is on site, however we found this place pretty sketchy. Most of the group usually opted not to go there.Overall, we had a great time. Most everyone spoke at least a little English, although they really appreciated it when you tried to speak Spanish. It was a great, laid-back vacation for us and it could not have been more fun. I would recommend this resort to anyone who wants a great all-inclusive for a great value. We can't believe everything that we got for such a low price.I know that this review is incredibly long, but I just figured that more information is always better. If you have any questions at all about the hotel or anything, feel free to email me. I also have TONS of pictures of the grounds. Ferris2002@aol.com

<Content>Superb! Hola,  Let me begin by writing that I left for the Caribe Club with some apprehension based on some of the negative reviews I had read on this and another site. My concerns were quickly and permanently alleviated as soon as we walked into the magnificent reception area. Check-in was quick and efficient However, because we had arrived at a little past noon, our room (which had been without a request upgraded to a suite) was understandably not ready. No problem as we had prepared for this - bathing suits and towels in our carry-on bags.. We grabbed a drink, walked through the Dominican mangrove forest which separates the reception area from the rest of the resort, toured the immense, beautifully maintained property, had lunch at the buffet and went for a swim. By 2:30 pm our room was ready. Our luggage was taken to out suite and our vacation was underway.  We stayed in building two overlooking pool one close to the buffet. The room was large and comfortable. Usually, it was cleaned by 11:00 am. Clean towels were readily available and face cloths were supplied. We had brought some along but we never used them. The maids did an excellent job and were very appreciative of the gifts and tips we left. I suggest you go to the dollar store and pick up soaps, nylons, toothpastes and other personal items and leave one or two things each morning for the maid. Rooms were tidied a second time in the evening and beds were turned back. This was done by a diiferent maid, so leave something for her as well.  The food at the huge buffet and a la carte restaurants was very good. At the buffet there was always much to choose from and the home baked breads and rolls were excellent. There always was much fresh fruits and vegetables and very tasty desserts. During our stay, there were several theme nights at the buffet featuring a particular national cuisine. Service was very good even if some times we would have to wait a few moments for our table to be reset or for coffee. Keep in mind that thousands of people are served each day and the buffet does not close to allow the staff to prepare for the next meal without guests being seated. The staff work very hard and they work non-stop. They are always polite and helpful. Learn a few Spanish words and phrases. It is really appreciated by the staff and it is seen as a sign of respect. As well, tip occasionally, you'll be remembered If you prefer a less formal dinner both beach front bar and grills serve lunch from about 11:30 to 4:00 so you never have to leave the beach or pools. Reservations are required for the a la cartes. These can be easily made in the morning with your building's concierge.  There are three pools on the property which contains the Tropical Princess and the Punta Cana Princess. Why this distinction exists is not clear because it is infact one resort and everybody uses the same facilities for the most part. Pool one has a swim up bar and most of the more loud and energetic activities organised by the animators take place there. It is the noisiest of the three pools, but the one to be at if you like a lot of activity. Pool two is less noisy, but the language of animation is German. But, it is far less active than pool one. Great music, reggae, merengue, salsa, and contemporary pop, is played there. Pool three is very quiet - great for an afternoon siesta. There are a total of four bars available to guests close to pools and the beach. The bartenders are friendly and fast. They understand many languages, but learn how to order in Spanish; they really like. Again, leave a tip once in a while. There is no need to bring insulated mugs. One of the strangest sights was watching sunburnt Canadians lugging their enormous Tim Horton coffee mugs from beach to bar.  The beach is extraordinary, beautiful white coral sand as for as you can see and warm aqua marine ocean water - truly remarkable. The only criticism I would have is the disregard that some tourists have for the environment and think nothing of littering the beach the beach with butts, straws and cups. The beach is cleaned every morning and seaweed is removed.  The rules regarding the reservations of chairs at the beach and the pool is not respected. This is true for all of Punta Cana. It's not a big deal. Play the game. If you get your towels down by 7:30 you have the spot you want. It's worth being up to see the sun rise and have your first coffee on the beach anyway.  The resort is host to a very interesting international mix - English is understood! No problem! You'll have a great time

<Content>Closest thing to heaven. Closest thing to heaven. we went child free for a relaxing week together and thats exactly what we got. Very relaxing, clean, friendly and plenty of good food and drink. Something for everyone.Only negative was the evening entertainment which was very limited and the al a carte restaurant that we tried was not worth the extra supplement. Going back this year but trying Casa Del Mar at Bayahibe, hope it's as successful. Oh, Britannia planes are very cramped

<Content>Best Vacation of my Life! Our vacation was Feb 20-27 2004. My experience at the Caribe Club Princess was unforgettable I will be boring my community for quite some time. The lobby truly took my breath away. The hotel rooms were lovely and the view from our balcony was like a picture. The beach was clean and peaceful. The grounds were beautiful. I for one enjoyed the food experience and had to wait for coffee maybe twice, but it didn't matter I was there to enjoy myself and we truly left our stressful lifestyle at home. Didn't wait for the tram my husband and I and friends enjoyed our stroll through the gardens we were in no hurry. We were immediately relaxed a feeling we don't get much of. The daily pool actitivies were a blast and the young people who instructed the dancing and pool aerobics were so adorable. Especially our Cho Cho. We love you!! I don't think the people of this resort ever met a stranger they are wonderful and even if you don't speak their language they were eager show kindness. Our lady of housekeeping was terrific she had fresh towels everyday and one day the towels were late and she obviously brought them straight from the dryer still hot. No problem with bottle water or drinks. It poured rain one night and I got up to look out and the pool workers were cleaning the pool for the next day, in the rain! They are truly dedicated to making this a great resort. The Kontiki  Calypso Double decker boat excusion was one of the most enjoyable. The crew was a blast and so entertaining. As I look at my pictures I smile and laugh as I remember the best vacation of my life. Thanks, Caribe Club Princess and your many wonderful employees!! I would go back in a heartbeat!!

<Content>Excellent Vacation Spot We stayed at the Caribe Club Princess from Feb. 20-27, 2004 and had a GREAT vacation at this resort. Before we left I had read reviews on this hotel and was a little skeptical, but the people who wrote bad reviews proved to be a little dramatic in their complaints. The staff during the daily activities and entertainment are UNBELIEVABLE!!! They work very hard to please everyone. They try to get people to participate in activities, but they are certainly not annoying. The rooms were very clean. Only once did we need more towels in our room and before we even realized it, the maid knocked on the door with clean warm towels, fresh out of the dryer. Our refridgerator was stocked daily with drinks. The restaurants were nice. The food is different than what we are accustomed to, but we can't complain about that because we were in a different country, of course the food is going to taste different. There was such a variety of different types of food, I don't know how anyone could complain about the food. We always rec'd bottle water when we asked for it. There was always a supply of bottled water, never a problem. The buffet restaurant has so much to offer. The refill on coffee was only upsetting if you'd let it upset you. That certainly didn't ruin our vacation and we only had that happen to us twice out of the seven days there. They just don't seem to service one area, they walk around all over the restaurant trying to refill everyone's cups. The drinks were awesome! They had beach party - we had a great time dancing. We would certainly recommend the Kontiki Calypso Snorkeling/Party excusion. It was probably one of our best days there. The staff on the Kontiki boat are awesome!!! The gardens at the Caribe Club are just amazing. Every day we saw someone working in the landscaping adding more things. We seldom used the tram to get around because we enjoyed the walkways so much. It's worth walking. Take advantage of the spa if you stay here, it's worth the extra money. The beach is very nice. We only spent one day at the pool, but the music wasn't extra loud, and didn't bother us at all. The other days we spent at the beach, OH MY WORD, IT WAS GREAT!!! We were one of those persons who put our towels out to reserve a spot, but only until we had breakfast. We probably didn't even need to do that because we were on the beach by 8 or 8:30 every day. No vendors pestering you like in the Bahamas. For anyone who had complaints, I think they've forgotten they had CHOSEN A 4 STAR HOTEL. We (4 of us) have no complaints and are certainly looking forward to going back again.

<Content>Perfect winter get away!!!!! Sadly, we just returned home from our trip to Punta Cana. We were there from February 21 - February 28. A group of ten of us went down from NH - 7 adults and 3 teenagers. We loved it!!!!I must admit I was pleasantly surprised. I did not have really high expectations based on the reasonable price and feared mediocre food and drinks at an all-inclusive. Boy was I wrong. We arrived at night so were not able to really take in how beautiful the resort was until the next morning. We woke up and found a little bit of paradise. We basically walked out of our room right out to one of the pools - the one with the swim up bar. The pools were great - big enough so that people could lounge around at one end and have aqua aerobics or volleyball at the other. I found the pools to be kept very clean too.From there, you just had to walk to the end of the pool to find the most beautiful strecth of beach - white, white sand, blue, blue water with lots of waves to play in - just perfect. We did walk the beach for quite a distance in both directions and I truly believe that the Caribe Club Princess had the best stretch of beach - wide enough so that people did not have to feel crowded.As others have recommended, whether you want to spend your day at the pool or at the beach, make sure that someone from your group gets up early to save chairs with towels. Even more important if you are hoping to get one of the little cabanas. We really never had a problem getting great spots - someone was almost always up and about by around 8:00.I will admit I was pleasantly surprised by the food. I am not usually a big buffet person but I thought the buffet was wonderful - there was definitely something for everyone. I am not a big meat eater so I mostly went for the wonderful fresh fruits, vegetables, pastas and rices. I was pleased with everything that I ate - even doing a little experimenting with some unusual things. And happily, my stomach was not bothered at all by any of the foods. Some in our group suffered a little but not to the point of putting a damper on the trip. We did manage to get reservations at the Italian and Brazilian restaurants. I highly recommend the Italian restaurant - the food and the service were excellent!!!!! I personally did not care for the Brazilian as it was centered around various meats - though very plentiful.I worried with an all-inclusive that drinks would be watered down. I found the exact opposite to be true. Strong drinks - however, cheap liquors. Our joke of the week was - Tastes like rum - since all of the drinks seemed to have about the same taste. Can't really complain though. After experimenting, everyone found something that they liked.In general, we found the resort to be well kept and clean. We found the staff to be excellent - very friendly and accomodating. We did find that tips went a long way with the wait staff especially at the bars.Having never been on an all-inclusive vacation, again, I was pleasantly surprised. Is it the equivalent of a 5 star resort - no, but for the money, I thought it was excellent. I would recommend this resort and would consider going back myself. And you absolutely could not beat the weather - sun everyday and high in the 80's - the perfect winter escape!!!!!!

<Content>Missing the beach.... My parents (47 and 53), my sister (15) and I (17) are all very activce people who never stop when we are home. Dance lessons, drama at school, basket-ball, volley ball, squash and an important social life are all part of our everyday life, and we looked for this type of entertainement while searching for the perfect resort. On top of relaxing on the beach or by the pool, we wanted to have a good time, dance, party and stay as active as we could. Without a doubt, the Caribe Club Princess provided us with everything we could have desired. When we first got there, on Febuary 3rd, 2004, they welcomed us with cold sented towels to wash our faces after the long plane ride and banana mama drinks to refresh us! We thought right away, you gotta be kidding!! The palm trees, the long white beach that goes on for miles, 3 pools, a really fun disco and an even more amazing crew of animators that kept everyone busy and excited during the day with a variety of activities and entertained us all at night with the many shows. They were all really friendly and outgoing, and really made you feel at home. As for the room, we thought we were getting 2 seperate rooms; one for the girls and one for the parents, but it ended up being 2 room linked together with a door, 2 bathrooms and 1 balcony. We were satisfied with the room, since it was clean, we always had fresh towels and the mini-bar was always full ect... although we didn't have too much extra space, we weren't in the room often anyways. We had problems with the air conditionning, and it was fixed right away, in a couple hours, no questions asked. The staff in general keep the resort really clean and beautiful. The food was fantastic, the buffet always had diffrent items everyday and it was HUGE, with everything you can imagine. Always leave some room for the amazing deserts. We tried 3 a la carte restaurants (the italian, the mexican and the italian) and although the atmosphere and the staff were great, the food was rather dissapointing, and we could have stuck to the buffet. The drinks were always flowing, and they had a really good selection, with the friendliest bartenders. Honnestly, there's nothing we could really complain about! After reading other comments, I can agree that you will probably need immodium, but just for a couple days and we never experienced slow service at this resort but if we did, we wouldn't have minded, we were in paradise! As for the roaches... we only saw one, and a heavy shoe got rid of it. Future incounters were avoided by putting a towel under the door. I highly recommend this resort to anyone looking for an amazing time, young or not so young, you will have a blast for sure!

<Content>A week in paradise First of all, since I am french canadian, please forgive my english. We (a couple in our late thirties) were at the Caribe Club Princess from February 7th to February 13th, 2004. We arrived at the hotel at 12:30 in the middle of the night, in a rain storm and strong winds. The electricity was out so we did the check in at candle light, but it went smoothly anyway. The electricity came back before we left the lobby so we could see how beautiful the lobby was. They took us to our room, but we had to wait about 45 minutes to get our luggage. We booked a VIP suite and it was worth the money: we were on the second of three floors, we had a spacious room with a living room area, a king size bed, a nice bathroom with two sinks, but most of all, we had a breathtaking direct view of the sea: we could see the ocean even from our bed, and we could see the sunrise from our balcony (room 2211). The only thing missing was the remote control for the tv, but we did not even ask for it since we did not watch the tv at all. The safe (don?t forget to ask the key when you check in) was at no charge because of our VIP suite.We found the hotel buildings and grounds absolutely beautiful. The buildings are painted with many warm colours (yellow, orange, blue, green) and it is done with a lot of taste. The lobby area and the theatre are separated from the room buildings with a nice path in the middle of a mangrove forest which we enjoyed to walk through a lot (five to ten minutes walk depending where your room is). Since the theatre was away from the rooms, it makes it quiet at night. We saw a couple of shows at the lobby theatre, and they were ordinary, but still entertaining.The guests at this hotel is a nice mix of nationalities, mostly from Germany, France, Canada and USA. Also there were people of all ages, with no concentration of old or young. We found the staff very helpful and friendly. Most of the animation and lobby staff, and the people at the nautical activities can answer in English, and sometimes even in french. But learn a few useful Spanish words: it is fun and they appreciate the effort (at least know por favor, gracias, hola, buenos dias, buenas noches, como esta / muy bien and cerveza?) We tipped one dollar now and then, sometimes at the restaurant or at the bar, but every day for our room lady, and with a little gift for her too (they particularly appreciate makeup stuff). Our room was done every morning and kept very clean, and they even came back in the evening to change the towels and empty the bin, and sometimes left us a few mint chocolates. They kept the refrigerator filled with water bottles, beer ?El Presidente?, pepsi and 7-up.The food at the buffet was ok. When we found nothing we liked for the evening theme, there was always the pasta bar which was very good. We tried the Italian and the fish restaurants. They were both good. For the fish restaurant, you have to pay 20 $ per person, but one visit there was included in our VIP suite. You have to make reservation for the ?a la carte? restaurants in the morning, between 8:30 and 10:30 in the entrance of your room building: it is simple and we never waited in line for more than 10 minutes.The beach is absolutely gorgeous, just a few seaweeds, and nice waves. But a message to the smokers: please do not take the beach as a big ashtray !!! You better reserve your chairs and cabana in the morning if you want to be sure to get some. The three pools are very nice and clean, we particularly enjoyed the third one (the one near the Tropical Princess section): it was a calm place to read.Activities: we did the Marinarium tour (snorkelling with rays and sharks) and we enjoyed it very much. We did parasailing: very fun, but the 10 minutes go by too fast. We took nice walks along the beach in both directions. If you buy stuff at the little shops along the beach, bargain a lot. We took a diving lesson and went for a dive in the ocean and it was also very nice. If you do snorkelling, the trick is to bring peaces of bread in a plastic bottle of water. You squeeze it to give out bread to the fish, and they gather around you.Internet access: very easy, near the lobby besides the boutiques. 5 $ for half an hour: if you take only 15 minutes, ask for a credit note before you leave: they give you a coupon for a free 15 minutes the next time.If one day we go back to Punta Cana (there are so many other places to visit), we would certainly go back to the Caribe Club Princess. Enjoy your vacation !!!

<Content>Do not recommend I read reviews for months before we left for our vacation. They were certainly very mixed. My husband and I went with another couple and we had a good time, but only because we made it good. The accomodations were average, but the rooms were kept clean. Originally they booked our rooms far apart and the next day moved our friends to a room next door. The Staff was friendly and did what they could, but certainly not in a reasonable time frame. We checked in @ 3:00 and our room wasn't cleaned until 6:35pm.. So it started off badly. The food was plentiful, but very bland. If you weren't up at the crack of dawn putting a towel on a chaise lounge by the pool or the beach then you weren't getting a chair until the afternoon. We had to be up by 8 am to be in line by 8:10 at the concierge to make a reservation at the restuarants. There were only 3 times and only 10 people per time. If you didn't get 6:30 or 8 the last one was at 9:45.. Way too late so you would have to eat at the buffet.. which the service was terrible - we had to get our own drinks and wait for ever to take your dirty plate away.. The positive of the buffet is there were plenty of seats. The shows were good and the afternoon poolside entertainment was good except it was very loud. Napping was a challange until I got earplugs. The bars drinks were limited and even the frozen drinks were watery. My recommendation if you speak english, find a hotel that caters more toward the American or English cultures. This was resort definitely catered more toward the Germans and French.

<Content>Our week in Hell Where do I begin?...this place is like none other we've ever visited. The grounds are spectacular,like out of a tropical paradise movie.Before we arrived,I spent a tremendous amount of time reading these reviews.What a waste of time,I was scared to go  eat the food after what people wrote.BTW...We stayed 1/17/04-1/23/04.the food is a little different than is served in America,but very adequate if not very good.I didnt know you could prepare lobster so many ways  all were very tasty! These people love there seafood as they take great pride in its preparation.When we werent eating lobster,shrimp  steaks,the offerings were quite overwhelming--they had everything each night-so I dont understand the reviews on how poor the selection or preparation of the food comes from--maybe these people should've spent their money on psycho-therapy instead. The Beach: the sand is flour white just as soft.The water is salty,but hey,it is the ocean.As for the seaweed,yes,there was a little,but once again,this is the ocean  there wasnt enough to make a decent sized salad with...so once again,I think these people are born complainers.We usually ate breakfast about 8:00 then wondered down to the beach,back to the room  around 10:00 or so would get set for the sun  beautiful topless scenery on the beach--chairs we never a problem getting  3 of the days we chose to get a cabana hut to view the scenery from--no problems at all!!! I'm 45  most of our group was of similar ages,some younger,some older,but middle-aged at least  we all did the boogie board thing-they are a blast-highly recommended!

<Content>Time of our lives We had a fantastic time at the tropical princess resort. We were a little worried after reading some of the reviews, but we had nothing to worry about. The beach was just beautiful, the food was great and the staff were really friendly. I would definatly recommend it to anyone. If I had one complaint, it would be the length of the flight!

<Content>Meet expectations- Good international client mix Me, my wife and 5 year old son stayed at the Caribe Club in Punta Cana 22-29 Jan. and found that the hotel met our expectations for a 4 star. We had no significant problems that were not addressed reasonably promptly by the hotel. I think that many of the negative reviews of this place are not balanced and focus on minor quircks .. I could rave on about how the Muzak playing in the mangrove swamp tackily detracted from the natural enviroment but I won't ..... Food was decent and plentiful, rooms were clean, hotel security was adequate, activities for children were multillingual and generally entertaining, bartenders were busy but efficient. Maintain personal security precations around guests and at the beach though as thefts do occur ... Although some staff had difficulties with english their attempts to communicate was certainly better than my attempts in Spanish. A capability in French is helpful. Many of the staff can speak a smattering of german, french, italian, english in addition to Spanish. There was a good international mix of guests- South and North Americans, many germans, some brits, french, russians and italians- A little cross cultural pollination never hurt anyone as far as I'm concerned and may well open the eyes of those who are self centered in an english-only world... No one bugged for tips- but I know they were appreciated. The value of the peso is dropping and the hotel workers are paid a pittance and many work very long shifts......Kids clothes are appreciated too...The stores on the resort were double in price than at the little commercial district Place Bavaro -which is a 15 minute walk away. Don't forget to bargain hard as if they were all car salesman! You get your best results when you start to walk away! Don't buy anything at PC airport unless you need to - prices are close to triple than anywhere else.....I would recomend this hotel for a family oriented vacation or to a couple to relax or even get married. There were many weddings when we were there- The VIP upgrade from Signature is worth the expense if you have a child or two...larger room, better TV, minor amenities etc...

<Content>Hmm deffidently not I have to say that I did not enjoy my time spent at this hotel at all. Almost everything was for the Europeans. Even the kids club spoke french and german, and when my child got hurt there, they couldnt help him because they didnt speak any english. Also the Europeans were just plain rude. The tram was a huge hassel, and there was a group of teenaged girls who rode the tram around and around all day. The tram was sometimes to full to get on so you would have to wait for it to come around agian ( i dont know if they only had one running when we went but..) and when it would come around the girls would still be on and more people would have to wait because there wasnt enough room. I just found the vacation to be a complete waste of my money. I would not recomend the hotel to anyone looking to travel to the Dominican Republic. I had been to the DR the year before and stayed at a hotel near this one and hada a wonderful time. The name of the hotel was the Ibero Star Bavaro. I recomend that hotel to all my friends, and i recomend it to you too.

I want to come back, and I will, ah and don麓t forget the Disco Areito, you can stay all night long dancing nice music and you will never forget your holidays in Caribe Club Princess!!! About the beach, don麓t worry, the sand is really white and the sea is blue and hot... Thank Caribe Club Princess, we see us!

<Content>nice resort,but... Well...after some research.. Punta Cana was the ticket for a nice honeymoon. I chose the Princess Caribe..their were many positive reviews on Tripadvisor about the resort..and I needed a Sunday departure for Jan 18th-25th. I opted for a VIP upgrade through Signature Vac. There were some perks we hoped we could enjoy as honeymooners, including a SUITE upgrade which I paid extra $ for. ( more about this in minute)On checkin.. we waited almost 2hrs to get our room, and we were so exhausted. Also..there was absolutely no honeymoon suite offered to us..or as the 'manager' said..they 'overbooked' the hotel.This was so very upsetting...we looked forward to getting a suite! Thats why I paid for the upgrade! In the end ..what we basically got was a slightly larger hotel room with a king bed..thats it.The view was Ok... but as we soon discovered the actual building is very noisy..there are doors constantly slamming..(at all hours) echoing throughtout...Well... the actual resort is beautiful, clean and well-maintained. The reception area is HUGE and really neat in design!The beach is gorgeous..the water turqoise and warm. The sand soft and silky-white. Loved that..if you want chairs you may have to get up get up 5am in the morning to get chairs before all the Germans or French raided them with towels.Be very careful where and what you eat..The buffet was very good..with decent choices.Beware of the other restaurants..especially the Italian..my wife got really sick everytime we ate there, I got sick at the Mexican restaurant.All in all..we had nice relaxing time..got a great tan...talked to friendly locals in broken spanish/English..that work there..they make low wages..tip whenever possible.Its a very beautiful,, very active resort that just needs to improve its services..and this 3.5/4 star resort could potentially be a five star.

<Content>Unforgettable A friend and I stayed at this hotel from the 11th to the 18th of January. We weren't to happy to go to this hotel, cause we were expecting to go to another hotel. Somehow there were changes in our reservations and the Caribe Club Princess would have to be our home for this week. As soon as we saw the entrance of the hotel when we were arriving by bus, we put a huge smile on our faces. It's uncredible what you see. It's huge and beautiful. The check in was made very quickly and we were told to go to our room with the 24 hour train service of the hotel and our luggage would follow us. We got into the train and we couldn't believe our eyes. The hotel is very big and we thought we would never find our room. Fortunately things are well indicated and we found our room very quickly. We were on the third floor, the view wasn't the nicest, but the room looked good and we immediately knew that we would survive our stay with a smile on our faces. Our luggage came 15 minutes later and that's when we decided to go and take a shower. We are from Portugal, so we had had a long trip and needed to fresh up. We left our room with the intention to go to the reception and clearify some doubts and ask for a safe. Service was good. Then we decided to go back and have some dinner. Our room was in front of the buffet restaurant and most of the specialty restaurants, in front of the main swimming pool and next to the snack bar. So we were very well located. After dinner we noticed that there was a beach party going on and I think we couldn't have wished for a better welcome party. We soon got to know the entertainers and other clients and we had lots of fun. The following days were filled with beach, kayaking, tenis, dancing, aerobics, meeting people, eating and drinking, etc. There is no stop. If we thought we would get bored at one point for always being in the same hotel and seing the same people every day... in the contrary... we wished we had booked for 2 weeks instead of just 1. Every night a different show, then the party went on in the lobby and then in de disco. IT WAS GREAT! I loved the hotel's dance and did it every single time the entertainers asked us to join them. I left the hotel with pain in my heart. We met lots of new people, from all around the world, and I'm sure I will miss them a lot. The dominicans are very nice people and I don't understand why people say they only speak spanish or german. I heard lots of english and french too and there was noone complaining for not being understood. The food was great too... some things better than others, but neither of us got sick. And that's was counts. The specialties restaurants were a bit hard to reserve but we tryed all of them and it was good. I have visited many hotels, I've worked in a few of them too, and this was really one of the best hotels I have been to. CARIBE CLUB PRINCESS... PORTUGAL WISHES YOU ALL THE BEST!! We loved our stay!

<Content>Acceptable for the price - but won't do it again! My wife and I booked the CC Princess online after researching other Punta Cana hotels, and reviewing some of the testimony on TripAdvisor. Just got back, and felt the need to share some of our experiences. Overall, I would have to say that the hotel was acceptable for the price we paid, but our next vacation we will spend the extra $$ and get what we like. First the good stuff: The beach has great sand, nice small surf, and is long enough for a 2+ hour walk in each direction. The resorts grounds were very nicely kept, and the rooms clean. The three pools were all very clean, and hardly used - except for the daily water aerobics, etc. The food at the buffett was abundant, but bland - coffee was excellent. Food at the Italian restaurant was good, Mexican fair, and Chinese - poor. Our biggest complaint was that the resort was very loud! Our room looked over the main pool, and all day, every day, there was music blaring, and some guy screaming on a microphone OK OK Amigos! Needless to say, having an afternoon siesta in our room was out of the question. If you like the same tacky music every day, and enjoy group activities like this, then this won't be a problem. In order to escape the noisy pool area meant claiming a beach chair as far away as possible, but in order to do this you had to reserve your lounge chair by 7:30am every day. Making reservations at the a la carte restaurants required standing in line every morning (8:30) for at least half and hour - this was a pain, but we always seemed able to get a reservation. These two morning rituals made the vacation seem very regimented. Also, aside from the overpriced organized tours, there is nothing to do outside of the resort. We knew this before booking, but didn't think it would be an issue, because we just wanted a quiet week in the sun. We were looking at renting a car after two days - but travel time to Santo Domingo was 3 hrs. each way. So all in, we probably got what we paid for, but do yourself a favour, pony up the extra $1000 each, and go to a Sandals.

<Content>Great Trip but will not return to the hotel Just returned, Jan. 18, 2004 from the Caribe Club Princess in Punta Cana. I have to say the resort is beautiful, the pools are nice and clean, the beach was raked every morning of debris, the flowers where in full bloom. It was the first island we have been to with an open aire airport and hotel it was a bit different but very nice. The staff was very friendly. We had a beautiful room on the 3rd floor of building 1 that overlooked the pool. Our room was cleaned everyday by 12:00 and we had fresh towels delivered everyday by 4:00 along with two bottles of Presidente beer. If you are looking for somewhere to go and you do not like to partake in the watching of shows or just want to be by yourseves this is the perfect place to be. I would say 90% of the hotel is Canadians, Europeans or Germans and as we found out this hotel caters to them specifically. All the shows are in German or Spanish 80% of the staff does not speak or understand English. But we managed. The food was ok but not spectacular. The best meal we had was at the Mexican restaurant other than that it was comparable to many buffets in the states but lacking seasonings. The internet cafe was a huge help to relay messages back to the states. We met one couple from the states that used a calling card that they purchased for 3 cents a minutes back home but was charged 30 cents a minute at the hotel. Make sure when calling you call the front desk and ask for an ATT operator or calling is difficult. Would of like watch or partake in some of the shows but all where in a foreign language and ddi not make much sense. All in all we had a good time and will come back to Punta Cana but will be staying at a different resort. We where told by our Apple representative that the Sunscape and Secrets Excellence are both 95% American and cater to the Americans. Although we talked to several couples at other resorts on the plane ride home that said there resort had American Entertainment. Please email if you have any questions.

<Content>Beware - terrible Service If this review will prevent even one couple from going here, then we will have accomplished something.My husband and I stayed at the Caribe Club Princess the week of Jan 02 to Jan 09, 2004 for our honeymoon. Note to honeymooners this is NOT the resort for you. The first three days of our vacation were spent pleading and disputing with the hotel for services that a four plus star hotel should rectify immediately. We are not picky travelers and this was ridiculous. Read on for more details.TERRIBLE SERVICE This hotel is known for having the Manana Syndrome . There is actually a page in the Signature book which explains this. It means that if there is a problem, it will be fixed tomorrow or maybe never. Nobody at the hotel will do anything to help you. They know you are only there for a short period of time, so if they can brush you off, they will. The staff will tell you, that will be fixed or done in 5 minutes , really it means hours or days, or never!!! Here is an example We checked into the hotel on Jan 02, 2004 at 11:30pm. The door to our suite would not close as the lock was broken. We PLEADED with the hotel for over two hours to change our room. Finally, at 2:00am, the problem was fixed temporarily. The next morning we pleaded again with the hotel for another room. We eventually did receive another room, but not until 6pm the next day. Upon moving to the new room, we noticed that the bathtub did not drain while showering. Our tub almost overflowed several times. It took the hotel almost 48 hours to rectify the problem and this only occurred once the maid saw our tub and made an emergency call to the front desk. The requests from myself and the signature rep to get the problem fixed were ignored!FALSE ADVERTISEMENT We booked through Signature Vacations. The Signature Website advertised special offers for honeymooners. (flowers, free massages, free a la carte dinner, fruit basket and wine). We based our decision to honeymoon at the Caribe because of these offers. We arrived Jan 02, 2004 and we asked our Signature rep about the promotions on their website. We were advised that Signature WAS NOT AWARE of these promotions, but were advised that we would indeed receive all of the free gifts, which we did not. We only received the wine and fruit on our LAST night, but only because we had to constantly fight for them.NO CLEAN TOWELS It is impossible to get clean towels on the beach after 1pm as the hotel is always out. The irony is that the hotel and Signature are aware of the problem, but nothing is being done to rectify it. Also, we did get clean towels in our room every day, but only after 9pm.BEACH The water is nice and there are no rocks in the water, but the beach is dirty. There is seaweed everywhere and the hotel never rakes the beach. You will find plastic cups, cigarette buts, dirty napkins etc. on the beach every day. Kids dig holes in the beach and it takes the hotel days to fill them. Pay the extra money and go to La Romana where the beaches are spectacular.FOOD We did not get sick on the food, which was good, but there is absolutely NO variety at this hotel. If you have traveled to 5 star hotels before, you will be disappointed. The buffet had no variety. As for the a la carte restaurants We had to wait over 45 minutes after being seated to even being acknowledged by a waiter and get water and wine at the Italian restaurant. The food here is disgraceful. The other restaurants are OK, but the meat is all terribly overcooked, it is like leather.CONCLUSION If this is your first time traveling, then this hotel would be fine as you will have nothing to compare it to, however, if you are a seasoned traveler and like a nice hotel with good food and service, go elsewhere.

<Content>As nice as it needs to be My wife and I just spent a lovely week at this wonderful resort. Beautifully landscaped grounds, always kept very clean, spacious installations, great beach walking and swimming... We spent great relaxing moments at the excellent spa and enjoyed some nightly miniature golf. The restaurant/bar staff were quite friendly and always ready to accomodate our requests (they even prepared a Portuguese meal: bacalhau just for our table of six. Highly recommended for revisiting.Joe and Mary Jo

<Content>Enjoyed it but we probably won't go back. My wife, daughter and I spent December 21 to 28 at the Caribe Club Princess in Punta Cana. We were glad we went and enjoyed it for the most part. It is ranked a four star hotel and that is what it should be ranked. It is not a five or six star.Our room was nice (oversized, basically it was almost two rooms) with a king bed and two single beds. The bathroom was large with a great shower/bath. There was an outdoor patio.The beach was the cleanest, most beautiful we've ever encountered, although you need to get up at 7-8AM to get towels and place them on lounge chairs to insure you get them. There were times people didn't get towels later in the afternoon as they ran out. Many women of all shapes, ages, and sizes go topless. But we got used to it quickly.The workers were extremely friendly but many did not speak any english. It is wise to bring single dollars with you as a dollor or two tip is generous to them. You cannot get dollars in any ATM's ( the caribe does not have an ATM) and you do not want to be stuck with pesos when you leave. They will exchange only 30% to dollars upon exiting the island. Bring cash and travellers checks.The buffet and restaurants were very good. We loved the Mexican restaurant. The Chinese and Italian were also OK. The wait staff could give lessons to many american restaurants for their friendliness and promptness to your desires. You do need to make reservations in the lobby at 8:30AM each day if you want to eat in a themed restaurant. Incidentally, remember to ask for liquor if you want it in your drink. A pina colada doesn't have rum unless you ask con ron.We did take taxis into the town twice during the day (Higuey) to shop but the people there were incredibly aggressive. Plus men alone will be approached by women of the night even in the afternoon. Do not go there at night. The resorts have armed guards at the gates and beach to keep it safe.There is no real casino at the CC Princess but there is a shuttle that runs every 20 minutes to the next door resort which has a small casino after 8PM. Roulette, blackjack is a dollar minimum so if you are a Vegas afficiando then you'll think you were at the church charity casino night. They did have a great bar with free drinks and a sitting area for spouses who don't gamble.Christmas eve was fun and is the only time the help is allowed and encouraged to party with the guests. Champagne was flowing for everyone.You ask why wouldn't we return? We just like islands like Aruba, Nassau, etc. in which you are comfortable touring the landscape for various clubs, restaurants, casinos, shopping, etc. We enjoy renting a car and seeing the countryside. That is not the case in Punta Cana. There you spend the vast majority of time in your resort.Oh, by the way, we did do the Marinarium excursion. It cost $75 each person. They pick you up by bus and take you to to an area where you board a boat which trolls out into the ocean. It stops at a predetermined spot which has a fenced in area in the ocean. You get goggles and snorkles and get to swim to the fenced in area and join stingrays, fish, and sharks. That was great. The sharks are vegetarian sharks but it still is amazing to swim with them. The excursion advertised lunch and drinks. They do supply drinks (soda, rum, beer) but the lunch is a make it yourself sandwich of cheese and ham that they bring around on trays. The boat staff was very friendly and spoke english, spanish and french. The trip was an hour late getting back to the resort so we did miss our dinner reservations however.My recommendation is that if you get a good deal (and January and February are good times) then the Caribe Club Princess is great.One final note: we went with the excursion company that is three letters and starts and ends with T. We saw the rep for ten minutes and never again. Plus our shuttle to leave was an hour late and would not have come unless we made three calls. I'm sure that was unusual but it was not a pleasant way to end the trip.Hope this helps.

<Content>Above average if not excellent We were in the D.R. Dec. 27, 2003 through Jan. 3, 2004 which was probably peak season. We did not feel that the place was overcrowded, however. The one negative impact that the time of year had was in the lack of availability of lounge chairs at the pool. To get a lounge chair you have to reserve early. Unfortunately many chairs are reserved by guests and never occupied even though there are signs that dis-allow this practice. This resort has a buffet restaurant, and 7 or 8 specialty restaurants. The specialty restaurants are Seafood, Italian, Brazilian, Mexican, Dominican, Chinese, and Steak. We had 3 children with us and they could not truly enjoy the a la carte experience. The steak restaurant was wonderful, Brazilian offered more food than a person could possibly consume, and the seafood was also very good. The feedback we heard about the Chinese restaurant was not positive. The buffet restaurant offers made to order eggs and omelets daily, as well as a pasta bar for both lunch  dinner. The dishes are labeled in 3 or 4 languages. There was a problem getting beverages at the meals. We frequently had to get our own coffee or drinks. Again this was probably due to the resort being at it's peak season. Our room was located on the first floor. Clean  comfortable. No facecloths - bring your own if this is important to you. We tipped the housekeeper and several other staff members for exceptional service. We had been told by our travel rep that their monthly income is approximately $200 (US) and we felt that tipping was appreciated by the staff. The beach is very nice. No seaweed or garbage. The ocean was rough with high winds, and it rained daily for a varying amount of time on each occassion. We walked 15-20 minutes down the beach daily to shop with the local vendors. Be prepared to pay 30-50% of the initial asking price. Some of the shop keepers can be aggressive and persistant. There are three pools. They are well maintained. There may be some effort on the part of the hotel to separate the German, French and other travelers - possibly due to language barriers. There is a separate show area for the Germans. The open-air lobby was beautiful and had been decorated for the season with a tree. It has a thatched roof, comfortable furniture, and a marble floor. There are several gift shops, and an internet cafe. The guest rooms are located 10-15 minutes from the lobby, and there is a golf cart type vehicle that makes routine trips around the facility to transport guests that do not want to walk to their rooms. The walk to the rooms is through beautiful gardens, and these gardens are one of the highlights of this resort. There are mini fridges in the rooms that are stocked daily with beer, sodas and bottled water. There is a spa that offers massages and other services. A 1 hour massage is $45. Horseback riding was included in our package and was a highlight for our kids. We did not see the shows or take excursions. The excursions that were offered included an Outback Safari trip, a helicopter ride, a marinarium, Santo Domingo, and golfing to name a few. There can be a language barrier with some of the staff. Overall we enjoyed this resort and feel it deserves it's 4 star rating. Would consider a return visit.

<Content>Great Vacation Place My wife and I arrived on the 25th of Dec.03 for a one week stay. We were not disappointed the food was good, fresh and plentiful. Our room was kept clean. The staff for the most part were friendly and helpful. They have the greatest hard working animation team. This was our first trip to the Dominican Rep. and we found the majority of Dominicans to be very friendly and warm. This resort is very family oriented with a good mix of Spanish, German, British tourist which gave our vacation a unique international flavor.We took a day excursion with Outback Jungle Safari that was a worthwhile experience to see life beyond the resorts. We would certainly highly recommend this resort to anyone seeking a fun holiday. Thank You Princess

<Content>We had an EXCELLENT time!! My husband and I just got back from the Caribe Club Princess and we had a fantastic time! We are both in our 30's and even though there were many children at the resort, we still enjoyed every minute of our vacation. The hotel was beautiful and to our surprise they upgraded us to a honeymoon suite!! It was gordeous with a jacuzzi and a canopy bed and our maid was so wonderful and made sure we tipped her well!! The food was good, but we both like spicy food and we found the food to be a little bland, but it was still good with many choices. The drinks were strong, so I basically stuck to beer and water but lying in the sun all day, you really don't want to drink too much alcohol anyway. The staff were very friendly and always made an effort to say OLAH!! They were always happy and singing while they worked, which made our stay very enjoyable. The great thing about this resort was that you didn't care if you spent your entire time on the resort instead of taking day trips because there was so much to do and the beach was beautiful. We had sun every day and I TOTALLY recommend anyone to go to this resort. Thank you Caribe Club for a vacation of a life time!! GRATIUS!!!!(sorry if my spelling is wrong :) )

<Content>A Great Week! Hi Everyone, My daughter and I travelled down together for the week prior to Christmas and it was wonderful. The weather was great, even on the day it rained. There's nothing like big warm drops of tropical water to remind you you're not shoveling snow. The food was good and it was always labeled. That's great as I don't eat fish. The coffee is excellent although I do wish they were faster with the refills. Our room was always clean although if you want washclothes, take your own. Kleenix is a novelty item there as well. Next time I'll take a shower buff puff and then throw it away. We tipped most days a dollar or two as their wages are low and it was the Christmas week. Christmas day buffet was incredible. Prawns, lobster, wine flowing. Absolutely beautiful displays. We had supper with most of the Canadians who are the friendliest. The French Canadians, Germans and French pretty much keep to themselves. We didn't really encounter rudeness but it would be nice if they smiled once in a while! Our signature rep was not the most helpful. She was polite enough but certainly didn't go out of her way for us. We found out more useful information from fellow travellors. Just a tip: if you miss out on making a dinner reservation try the lady who usually stands at the entrance to the buffet restaurant. This worked for me when my rep said it was too late. (She was wrong) The evening shows were not high on our list as they weren't that professional. It was nicer sitting by the ocean with a glass of red wine and watching the waves. The 24 hour bar by the beach is wonderful. The staff were great, our room was not really fancy but clean and comfortable, the food was better than the Copacobana on the Mayan, and the beach was nice. Further up you got garbage and lots of seaweed. Be aware that when you leave the Dominican, they weigh your luggage and charge you $5.00 American for every kilo you are over. This is a bit of a scam as our home airlines let you load too heavy suitcases. If you buy things you end up paying through the nose. Two young men on departure had to pay $140.00 American to go home. Quite the surprise. We'll go back again. A nice resort.

<Content>hated it, sorry :( It was nice to be away from Ottawa and the cold weather but my girlfriend and i hated the resort.I guess we've been spoiled with other place because we didn't like this place.We had a GREAT time because we were away in the sun,, but compared to other places it just wasn't very good.I think our main problem was, it was just to big. People EVERYWHERE. This place has over 1000 rooms where most resorts have 300-400.The food stunk. I'm a big eater and not very picky, but it was awful. Sure the salads, ice cream, pasta, and breakfast was great. But the meat was terrible compared to the Hilton Marien.The beach is much nicer than purta plata, but this resort was just to big for our liking. People everwhere, very loud.The main pool has a poolbar which is nasty. I refuse to go in any pool with a bar. You see old men drinking for 6 hours and not moving...like to swim with urine?I've heard many horror stories about swim up pools....yuck.

<Content>best trip ever My wife and I went to Punta Cana from november 2 to 9, 2003 We use to go to Florida every year but anymore we loved our vacation to the Caribean We stayed at the Caribe Club Princess HotelMy '' habitacion'' ( room) were very clean and the daily maid service was excellent.Food : I personnaly work in a hotel business for many years and I can tell you that you cannot complaint.breakfast buffet : fully complete, with staff cooking in front of you : omelet or turned over eggs. etc..lunch buffet : excellent lots of choices, or you can always have hot dog, hamberger, chicken , sausages etc. near the beach. salad bar is always availabledinner : buffet excellent with an attraction every night. ( special dessert made in front of you, fresh caesar salad, always a pasta bar cooked last minute) the trick with buffets is you take one different choice every meal and not a bit of everything.a la carte restaurant : mexican beautiful atmosphere, food ok. bresilian: nice atmosphere, food excellent too much. we did not go to the italian restaurant ( pasta bar everynight at the buffet), we did not go to the chinese restaurant. Nightly shows : We went to all of them, it is fantastic they have 10 professionnal dancers + the animation team.daily activities : very well organized.overall rating : we are 50 years old and it was our best trip ever. we will surely go back to the same place next year.p.s. the beach was ok, the drinks too much ( have fun Yves Brien

<Content>Absolutely Beautiful!!! Have stayed at this resort and I can say is absolutely beautiful. I have written before on this site about the Sunscape Punta Cana Grand, (nothing Grand about this place at all). You can compare the two hotels. My wife  I stayed in the Royal Suite overlookingthe pool and the ocean, and we we amazed. We have been to some of the nicest resorts in the Caribbean, but this resort is one of the best. The room was a nice two story, two bathroom, two balcony, jacuzzi suite with all the amenities of home. We were treated like a King and Queen, I would have to say wherever we went on the resort. They were in the midst of changing when we arrived and their sister hotel was being completed and have received rave reviews so far.It amazed me at the Sunscape as I mentioned in my comment on their page, how we noticed the staff making up rules to the guests as theywent along, quite disappointing. And the tour guides blatently lying to their guests telling them the Sunscape was the only hotel in the Punta Cana area, and that the beach was Bavaro Beach.. We laughed as I read these reviews all the time and people at these hotels try to convince people who have never been to Punta Cana just where Bavaro beach is. One American wrote on her comments that this beach area is indeed Bavaro Beach and if nobody agreed with her, then they really weren't seasoned travellers to the DR Well sorry to bust anyone's bubble but, the Caribe Club Princess is indeed in the middle of Bavaro Beach and it is a safe and beautiful resort which can offer a different world of Royal Suites if your willing to pay the extra money. Trust us you won't be dissappointed. If you want to know anything else about the resort, feel free to e-mail me, we have actually directed some other people to this resprt and they have thanked us ever since!!!

<Content>Great Experience My wife and I were at the Caribe Club Princess Nov 09 16, 2003 thanks to our travel counsellor who recommended this hotel. We were very satisfied with our vacation, and will not hesitate to recommend this hotel to our friends. This is an excellent facility, very clean rooms, immaculate grounds-keeping, good food, professional animators (activity coordinators), fantastic beach, friendly and polite staff. Although it rained a lot (being the rainy season), this did not dampen the spirit of the employees and guests. The rain only falls for a few minutes then clears up. The key is to loosen up, remember you are on vacation, relax and make the best of all circumstances. The staff will ensure that you enjoy yourself as long as you are willing to participate. Beware of the vendors at the Bavaro Plaza and surrounding area. Their first prices will clean out your wallet. Negotiate and be prepared to walk away if you do not get the price you are prepared to pay.

<Content>Very nice We had a great time. We went in October/November so it was only half full. Service and food was great. Had a problem with noise in our room, but after the first night we asked and they changed our room with no problem to a nicer one. They also let us stay in our room all day since we had a late checkout at no charge.

<Content>The best ever! I can't possibly see how anyone could have a bad time a this resort. My wife and I stayed for our honeymoon from Oct.13-20 and it was AMAZING!The staff were absolutely perfect. Despite the obvious language barrier they all made an extremelty concoius effort to communicate and do ANYTHING possible to make our stay as pleasurable as possible.We met several fantastic vavcationers as well, which made the trip that more special.The food was very good, and I find it hard to believe that anyone with a CAST IRON STOMACH would have any problems. Of course the average person is going to require Immodium. It's not that the food is prepared in an unsafe manner, it is purely the fact that most people don't eat those types of foods 3 times a day, 7 days a week.I will be back! Especially so I can say hi to the pool bartender Alex!OUTSTANDINg *****

<Content>Absolutely Fabulous Resort!!! I just got back from an amazing week at the Caribe Club Princess. I knew the moment I entered the lobby that this would be a vacation of a lifetime. The resort was beautiful. The facilities were clean and very well maintained. The pools and beach were beautiful and very clean. The food and drinks were excellent. The variety of drinks available and include in the all-inclusive package was very impressive. If you asked for a drink, even something not so popular, they could make it for you. The staff was incredibly friendly and spoke many languages including english, french and spanish. The entertainment (shows) each night were very well done and lots of fun! There were tons of Canadians at this resort and it was very easy to meet lots of people, although if you are just looking for a great pool to lay beside and read a book, this resort has that too. My advice...don't hesitate...book the trip, it's well worth every penny. I can't wait to go again and maybe for two weeks next time!

<Content>Nice Family Hotel My Husband  I in our early 50's, hosted this trip with our children and grandchildren 11 in total, kids aged 9,7,2,18mths. We did plenty of research before hand and chose this for the 4 - 4+ rating it has , the kids facilities, the a la cartes (unlimited), the activities and such, and it was sufficient in that respect. We had no problem with rooms being cleaned, it was always done, use the please clean room sign on your door, ours was done early every morning except one day and restocked as required, although the towels or water may come a little later if they are awaiting supplies ( happens in any hotel). We found the food to be good in every restaurant, the a la cartes were not hard to book just go first thing in the morning, stand in line and wait your turn no problem getting in 11 people when we wanted to, tried Italien, Chinese, Mexican all good and services good. Beach towels not hard to get, we usually go right after breakfast around 9:00 a.m. and then choose chairs pool or beach, no problem. Kids club had mini disco for kids, great idea, just wrong language and so was beach sing a long for kids, but we went and hummed along anyway. Dr. services were needed by our littlest traveller, they are in a seperate little building right by the hotel rooms and are there 24hrs and speak english. An ambulance was needed and arrived in 5 min. and they were taken to Higuey hospital 30 min. away. Hospital was very nice and modern, enterpreters available and if you have travellers medical insurance they contact your physician and obtain medical information. Two nights stay was need for bronchitis, mom and dad both allowed to stay...very efficient. Some of us had minor stomach ailments, but would just chalk it up to too much drink, sun, or wrong choice of food, nobody laid up in room for any more than couple of hours. All in all good hotel and lovely beach, staff efficient and services were there as said.

<Content>WE wont be reurning I'm sorry to report I have to agree with others on here that the resort has a real health problem there. Very nice and clean resort and great beach area for entertaiment purposes. The european tourists could be very rude when they wanted to be but I was there for relaxation and wasnt about to let that bother me. My husband is still suffering from a bacteria bug he picked up there as well. We never could pinpoint the culprit he ate but even after eating nothing but bread and water for the last 3 days of our holiday he still suffers. This man has a cast iron stomach and the 2nd day just about wiped him out. IModium Imodium Imodium is a must! It saved our holiday from being ruined. The majority of tourist were constantly drinking bottle water which should have been a sure sign for us . Our maid was very good tho she understood no english at all. But the maids tend to come at all times of the day and nite for whatever reason and just walk in. With Signatures new VIP CLUB program express checkin was great but I wonder if they need to use this as a way of attracting tourist to this resort?We are seasoned travellers and have visited PPlata 3 times previously and cuba as well and will continue to travel there but this is one resort we wont return to. We are easy to please so long as we have a decent clean room , nice beach and safe food and drink. We had all( they serve bottled Dasani water) We had all but the food which could have be disasterous and I hate to think if it had been a child this happened to.

<Content>wouldn't go back if you paid me We were at the Caribe Club for our honeymoon from Nov 1, 2003 to Nov 8, 2003. The room was clean, and refreshed daily. The beach was also clean, but that is where the positives end. We were not given any of the honeymoon bonuses we were promised, despite asking numerous times. Our room was on the top, (third), floor and it rained every night and kept us awake all night due to the metal roof on the hotel. I can't begin to describe the sound of rain on metal!!!! The entertainment was poor, the activities were predominantly in German, and very badly organised. We went on one day trip which promised a historical tour of Santo Domingo during which we were rushed through a museum and a Cathedral in about 45 minutes and then deposited at a souvenir shop for the rest of the day. We were told that the food was washed in purified water, which we witnessed not happening. I am still dealing with the resulting bacteria from that, and likely will be for another while. The staff was reasonably polite, although not very helpful. I also overheard them a number of times mocking various guests, that is until I let it be known that I speak Spanish. Also of note is that the Caribe Club is located on the property with another hotel. This means that there are actually twice as many people sharing ammenities as what we initally were told. There is only one public washroom in the beach/pool areas, which was never busy, so be prepared for an excessive amount of urine in the pools.Overall we were very dissapointed in this trip, and I would not recommend it to anyone thinking about taking a trip down.

<Content>I Can't Wait to go Back!!! It was incredible!! My husband and I went in July for one week. The service was great. All the employees were very friendly. It's a very beautiful resort! A lot of activities and entertainment. Some of the food was different then what we are used to, but still very good, and lots of choices. The room was very nice, clean and comfortable. The beach was beautiful and in a nice location, although I could have done with out the topless sunbathing! Overall one of our best vacations. I can't wait to go back!!

<Content>Lookie , Lookie, castrophy My husband a I just returned from a weeks vacation at this resort on October 26th 2003Very disappointing. The room we stayed in had faced the back of the hotel right besides the lane that was being used for deliveries. The room was the worst. It leaked, floors were constantly wet and everytime I turned on the lights, I got electric shocks. The interleading door to the next room had cracks in it and we could here every conversation of the next door occupants which I eventually made out that it was one of the staff occupying it.We had to beg for clean towels in our room everyday, as the ones we used stayed wet due to the moisture in it. It leaked in the closet so all our clthes we soaked.Would I recommend it to anyone, definately no.The only consulation was that the beaches were great, despite the fact that we could never secure a spot on the beach whether we arrived at 6.30 am or after lunch. Would I go back to that resort, NO! NO! NO!

<Content>Americans beware My husband and I went to Punta Cana in April of 2003. We thought this resort was great all the employees we came across were wonderful and really enjoyed the Americans. We took the safari tour which was a Blast. It was are first time visiting Punta Cana and it did take us awhile to catch on to some things. Reservations must be made very early in the morning to go to any of the restraunts and you must rise and shine to get a beach chair. We also did have some issues with the water sports. The boat never came to take my husband out water skiing and they seemed to be a little reluctant to give our US dollars back. The one thing to remember before you go is watch out for other travelers they are not fund of the Americans going to their vacation spots and they are not afraid to let you know it.

<Content>Hodelpa Just Fantastic My husband and I spent our honeymoon there 5 years ago. On route to the hotel we were most upset, and were already planning on how to return to the airport and get the next plane out.On arrival at the hotel we were greeted in the reception by a singing band. Our room was perfect with flowers, fruit and champagne laid on compliments of the hotel.All meals were first class, drinks not watered down, facilities first class and fantastic excursions.We had a wonderful 2 weeks and could not fault the hotel or staff in any way.The only problem was of course, the Germans and we can't blame the hotel for their behaviour.

<Content>Great for the price! My family just returned from Caribe Club, now called the Tropical Princess or Caribe Club Princess, both are on the same property but if you book at the Tropical Princess you will only get to visit 2 of the a la carte restaurants, otherwise you will have to pay a supplement at the remaining 5 restaurtants. We never did visit the al a cart restaurants as the buffet restaurant El Higuero was just fine. Only a few items were repeated each day but with such a selection it didn't matter. The rooms in the Tropical Princess side were plain but clean, the drawers kept getting stuck making loud noises. There was no iron in the room so make sure you bring one with you. Next door they were building a new complex and were awakened by the heavy machinery. No bugs were incountered, but the odd lizard on the walls in the hallway. One of the theatres only presented shows in German. The shows by the lobby were entertaining, but late 21:45 each night. Canadian money had to be exchanged to pesos, not American Dollars. Mini-bar was stocked daily with glass bottles of Pepsi and 7 up, warning about the ceramic floors and glass bottles! Bottled water was plentiful and the water that was poured at the buffet restaurant was fine. The service in the buffet was slow and the tables were never set with full cutlery, SPOONS are a rare find here! The beach was clean, no rocks anywhere, but the water was a bit rough and therefore not the blue caribean water you see in the brouchures. You get one towel card per person upon arrival and if you lose it there is a $20.00 U.S. charge. The resort mainly caters to Spanish and German guests, but overall the resort was fine, great swimming pools and bar service. Great rate for last minute deals! Enjoy!

<Content>Only American's There My family just returned from a trip to Punta Cana. I was really surprised to find we were the only American's there that week. We ran into very little english and I think the employees were annoyed with us. The resort was clean, the beach needed to be raked but it was picked up of garbage. One of the pools was closed down. One pool had some green on the sides. The entertainment was good. The kids club was a little scary, there is no really check in and they have no idea how to account for all the kids. You do not sign in or out each time. Also there was very little english spoken by the kids club leaders. They had a great agenda for each day but didn't follow it everyday. The food was ok. My husband and I got the revenge. His lasted about a week, I am still on antibiotics going on week two. I really liked the Itailian Restrarant but hated the Mexican one. The buffet had lots to offer but I was afraid to eat most of it. We took two trips outside of the resort. The country is very dirty, garbage everywhere. The driving is scary. The snorkeling was in very rough water with coral very close to your body also scary. The room was clean and bug free, but sometimes the room wasn't cleaned until 5 or 6 PM. Also expect very little help if you lose a child on the beach, that is after you find someone to translate for you. This was the most scary part. I'm glad we went I just don't think I would go back with so many other places to go.

<Content>Needs Improvement for 4 star My husband, daughter  I spent the week of August 3rd - 10th inclusive.Good Points: 1)Property: beautiful and very well maintained. Lots to do, or nothing at all if you so wished. Beach: small waves  bits of seaweed, but not a problem. 3)Animacion Team: entertainers kept you busy if you chose to do so and quite aggresive with the young ladies. 4)Food:selection quite repetitive, but very edible. Bottled water readily available.Other Points: Spanish, German, French and then English is spoken by the entertainment crew, and in that order. Strong German presence. They have their own theatre, child care and dedicated entertainer staff. The staff do not speak english whatsoever, and therefore are afraid to even make eye contact with you. This comes across as being unfriendly, but once you make the effort to say Hola they will respond. However they do need more english speaking staff at the front desk. If help was needed you had to wait until they could find someone who could speak English. My high school Spanish came in handy. As in Cuba, take small gifts for the maid, and you will find that it goes a long way. They were very appreciative. The restaurant is open air, which is very uncomfortable for dining, especially at night. I believe that this is the main reason why we all got sick at different intervals. My daughter  I were sick for one day, but my husband still has lingering effects. TAKE IMODIUM !! Rooms are sparingly furnished, but there were holes in the walls where things had been moved around and not replaced/replastered/repainted. Patio lock was broken and safe not working. Didn't get it all fixed until the following morning. Free horse back ride takes 1 hour there  back and since we were not a paying customers we did not get drinks/snacks like they did. Also we had to wait an additional 2 hours till they completed their ride. TAKE REPELLANT !! My daughter loved the ride in spite of this. My husband could not ride as the truck had no shocks and he developed a bad headache from it. Shop at the beach stalls (as opposed to Plaza Bavaro or the hotel) which is to the left of the hotel (towards LTI Beach Resort) as the prices are at least half price or less. BARGAIN for everything. !! Please attend the orientation meeting from your travel operator as it will prove to be very informative.Overall it was relaxing, but I would not come back again to this resort only because we like to try different places. I do not consider myself picky as we have been to Mexico, Cuba, Cozumel, Venezuela, Acapulco, etc. I compared it to the 4 star in Cuba, and Cuba wins hands down over the Dominican. This resort deserves a 3-3.5 rating.

<Content>Amazing Well I know before I booked my trip I came to all these sites trying to find reviews and figured now I will leave my reivew for future travellers. First of all I went to the Caribe Club the second week of May 2003 with 3 of my girlfriends, just so you know we are all 20. We had the most amazing time, some reviews I read of this resort were horrible but these people must have been out of their minds because it was beautiful and the best vacation I have ever been on. I would definitly recommend this resort for people of all ages, the entertainment is awesome there are lobby dances nightly and the staff are VERY friendly (if you know what I mean). Check in and out was smooth and fast, the food was awesome and readily available, the staff were so friendly and the hotel rooms were perfect and clean. If you have any questions feel free to e-mail me but I give this resort 5 out of 5 and would give anything to go back!

<Content>Mixed review The grounds are breath-taking. The hotel management horrible. The hotel staff is very polite and always nice, but fairly inefficient. The activities (archery, catamaran, soccer, beach volley ball, etc) are on time and entertaining. Now the details: We were there from June 21st to July 5th. Upon arrival at 3:15pm after the 3:00 pm check-in time and our room was not ready until 5:00pm.. We waited in the lobby which is not air conditioned. It was hot and humid. I would have liked to change into my swimming suit and go swimming to cool off. After a 2 hour wait, they gave us the wrong room. We had asked for 2 queen size beds and instead got one queen size bed an a crib. We had to call the reception. When I asked to speak to someone who spoke english, I was transferred very politely to someone who barely spoke english. Finally we got the room we asked for. House keeping cleaned our room any time between 10 am and 7 pm. One day (out of 15 days spent there) we had no dry/clean towels by 7:00 pm as we wanted to shower before dinner. The following day arround 5:00 pm, I saw house keeping and asked for clean towels. The food service is varied and does accomodate many tastes. I never got bored with the food and the restaurants a la carte have a nice atmosphere and did make us feel as if we were going out (of the resort). At the buffet, it was always difficult to find spoons, and drinks often came with a 15-30 minute delay. Once I recieved my beer after I was done eating. The last two days of our stay more than 75 guests came that day. The buffet ran out of coffee that night and although I had requested a spoon to eat my ice cream, I never got one. I shared my seven-year old son's spoon. While at the resort I got my advanced scuba diving certification. The dive-master as well as the rest of the teachers were charming, supportive, laid back and I enjoyed every minute with them. Kayaks and other free items such as bicycles, tennis rackets, canoes, etc were readily available. I don't know whether that would hold true during the high season (since they ran out of spoons and coffee the first time they received a batch of tourists). My 7-year-old son and 4-year-old daughter went to the mini club for children. The staff spoke decent english and were extremely friendly and always smiling. They always went out of their way to greet the children and compliment them even if they happened to bump into them. The people who taught Meringue lessons, aerobic, etc... are funny and entertaining. The pools are clean and the beach is beautiful.When it was time to leave, we learned that the President of the Dominican Republic had added an exit tax that was either $10 per person or $20 per person. No one could tell us for sure at the hotel. It turned out it was $10 per person (in addition to the $10 entrance Tax) if you flew by AA (Chartered planes are $20 per person).As for health, out of a party of 8, we all got sick for at least a couple of days at different times. We all drank the bottled water, but could not find a common cause. We speculated that it could have been the fish, and after I stopped eating fish, I got better. That was not the case for my wife. My kids got sick during the last three days. I guess it's like the added tax, every body has to pay.Overall we enjoyed ourselves and wished that management had their act together.

<Content>Would not return We just spent 7 days at Hodelpa, now called Caribe Club Princess, from June 22 to June 29, and since most people who wrote were happy there, I wasn't.To begin with, some of the hotel staff, mostly the reception were rude and very impolite. I believe the first impression of any hotel is the reception. The people there barely knew a decent working knowledge of english. By mistake, I gave the wrong paper to the guy, and it was like I gave him a stick of dynamite! We asked for a safe, once again, we were told rudely to go to the other end of the counter. We paid $11.00 US for our safe, and to add to that, she didn't have any change, fortunately I had. We finally left the reception with no enjoy your stay or any kind of welcome.During our stay, the animation staff could use some improvement. Same activities, same music. Nothing really to get me going. They seem to have more interest for the German guests.The evening shows were done by people from the outside. I went only once and got bored. Most people I talked to, went once too, and never returned. The shows also very late, they start at 9:45 pm.The beach wasn't too bad. Lots of seaweeds. The water had lots of waves, which picked up the sand from the bottom, so the water near the beach wasn't too clear. I read some comments of people who wrote about the cleanliness of the beach. Since there is nothing much to do about the weeds, it's part of nature, plus the staff did their best in picking them up every morning, but it would have helped if the guests, especially the Europeans, like the Germans, and the Spanish would pick up the empty glasses, water bottles and put them in the trash cans instead of leaving them on the beach.Our suite, and the hotel gounds were very beautiful. We had a view of the swimming pool, and a decent view of the beach and ocean. We did encounter guest who had various problems with their rooms, such as roaches, bad views, once again the reception were less than interested in helping out their guests.The food wasn't too bad for me or my girlfriend. We generally ate everything, but you still have to be carefull. The staff at the buffet were very nice, especially the breakfast staff. We appreciated the friendly service of Anyi.If you must go into town, do it in the day. We went in the early evening, because we needed money, and there wasn't an ATM at the hotel. All the beggars, shopkeepers, and the prostitutes are out harassing you. We found most people prefer the US dollar or the Euro, and some get insulted when you pay them in pesos. We asked Milton at the reception to call us a cab, and he acted like we woke him out of a good dream. The cab driver was very happy when we paid in US, but the same guy was insulted when we paid in Pesos.When we were finally ready to leave, I called the reception twice for them to come and get our luggage, and we called 1 hour before check-out, and 2 hours before our bus was to pick us up. 55 minutes later, my girlfriend, the maid, and I brought our luggage down.Once again, when we checked out, the reception was less than friendly, no thank you's, no goodbyes.I would not recommend anybody to stay at that hotel. Too bad, because it is a very beautiful resort. Hopefully with the changes in Management from Hodelpa to Princess hotels, thing will change in the future. Should I go back to Punta Cana, I'll most probably stay at an Iberostar resort.

<Content>Just What I needed This resort was spectacular. Me and my girlfriend just got back last night (June7, 2003) from Punta Cana, and it still almost seems like a dream we had. We didn't expect the place to be so beautiful and elegant, but we weren't about to argue with it :) The beach was as marvellous as you could expect, and the pool was magnificent as well. I particularly enjoyed the sunken pool bar. Furthermore, we got the cheap room, or Superior as they call it, and it was plenty big, with great air conditioning, and very clean and pleasant service. The buffet was excellent, although I did get quite sick the first night (pack your immodiums people). My sickness could have been from other people on the plane, the many different types of drinks I had, or quite possibly the Mexican a la carte restaurant. We only got to try the Mexican and Italian, and the Italian was quite good. Other people also suggested the Chinese place, but we didn't want to risk more stomach problems. At lunch be sure to go the the Snack and Grill, which overlooks the ocean. They had barbeque ribs, sausage, hot dogs, burgers, fries, and other stuff that made us feel right at home. Finally, I was really worried about an overabundance of people that would make it difficult for us to find lounge chairs on the beach, as well as being outnumberred by Europeans. These fears were brought upon by reading other reviews. However, it was quite the contrary. We had plenty of usage of all the watersports, and the other facilities. Maybe we chose a less busy time of year??? The animation team was very energetic and funny as well. They were cool because they didn't really force anyone to do anything, they just tried to encourage it. Overall, spectacular trip, and I would recommend it to anyone.

<Content>wonderful experience My husband and I, from the midwest, along with another couple, from the east coast, spent 2 weeks at the Hodelpa/Caribe Club Princess in May. It was wonderful. The beach/water was perfect. Our rooms, Jr. Suites were large and extremely clean. Pools, 3 of them were fabulous. Food, well, if you have to complain about food then an all-inclusive is not for you. The food was good. Large selection every day-whatever you desired, they have. A-la carte restaurants were ok. Good for a change in ambiance. Drinks were weak, unless you are travel savvy-tip the wait staff and you are treated accordingly. I never understood the whole all-inclusive concept, those workers do not get tips. On our last morning there, all 4 of us were given un-opened bottles of rum from the bartenders. We had taken good care of them during our stay. We travel extensively, our friends have been traveling for 26 years. Punta Cana is fabulous. As far as the roaches go, the mid section of our building was all tropical flora. We did see a large roach one night coming home from dinner. HELLO!!!!!!!! It's the tropics, there are bugs. Well one night, after bragging about the lack of scoundrels around us, as I was sitting on the john, looked in the corner and there was papa cuca-racha. A good smash with my beach flip flop and a little spritz of bug spray around the door area, well, that was the only one we saw. Staff was very friendly. Our first week there, I think we were the only Americans. The staff spoke enough english to get by. After traveling for a number of years, I took 10 months of Spanish. Our attitude re: foreigners, if they are in our country, well they should speak the language. If you are intimidated about language barriers, then stay home. We tried to make the best possible impression of Americans that we could and I think we succeeded. As far as gastrointestional distress: again, be prepared. It's not home, we all suffered a little. My husband finally began taking anti-biotics. He seemed to have the worst troubleefore leaving your home country, please consult your physician. We always are prepared, it makes the difference between a bad trip/good trip. I would highly recommend this resort to anyone. People who travel out of their own country need to be more open minded. Things are different and that's exactly why I travel.

<Content>4 dissatified travelers We are 2 couples 40 something who travel quite a bit together for our vacations. upon arrival at the Caribe Club PRincess the grounds swept us away. really beautiful. Palm trees,lush green scenery and of the beach it was just breath taking. That said now for the good stuff. We had 2 rooms facing the ocean. junior suites which we suitable. At check-in the front desk did not even offer us safe locks which you MUST have. so after getting into the room we all went back to the front desk which is a 15 minute walk or u can take the go cart which goes back and froth maybe every 15 or 20 minutes to the lobby. Secured our keys to the safe then another 15 or 20 minute wait. we were hungry so over to the ala carte to grab something. The food look so good so we sat and ate and had a couple of drinks ,, coffee,soda,water, and beer. That evening was very slow,it being a Sunday we guessed. So we walk around the resort and sat by the beach till it was time to go for dinner. All the food really looks great but by MONDAY afternoon all 4 of us got sick. My problem came so fast that i only had time to make it on the toliet but i DIdn't have time to grab the trash baRREL TO VOMIT. sO EVERYTHING WENT ALL OVER THE BATHROOM FLOOR...... not a good start. And we only drank bottled water but as we figured it out was how do they cook with bottled water or they tap water, how do they wash their vegatables or meats? ok now for the really good stuff.... Getting in late 1 night to our rooms my husband opens the door and puts on the lights and there they were... cockarochers.... so off comes the shoes and we tried our most to slaM DUNK ALL OF THEM... we WERE READY TO GO HOME AND sUNDAY COULD NOT COME FAST ENOUGH..... The staff speaks only Spanish and GERman with just a few members knowing English... so you decide if this resort or any resort in this area is for you..... sign us as the 4 never to return...

<Content>Best Resort Ever_ We Will Never Forget It! Ohla! This was the trip of a lifetime. Originally, our group of 16 people were suppose to stay at Grand Paradise Bavaro - Thank God that it was overbooked!! We had so much fun that we cried and cried when we had to leave. Our two week stay was definately not long enough! Everything was perfect... and I mean EVERYTHING! Food was excellent, drinks were excellent, activities were excellent, but especially the staff and the nightlife!!!! They are the sweetest people EVER! I would recommend this resort to anyone ( more so people from ages 19-27) We are very greatful for the service that we had there! Excellent time- keep up your excellent service. - Erin Lane, Jacqueline Stone, Kim Burt, and Stephanie Samuelson

<Content>seashell We had the best trip to the Hodelpha Caribe Club (now the Caribe Club Princess) between April 20 and 27th. This all-inclusive resort was absolutely beautiful, safe, and fun. My 18 year-old had a ball between all the kids she met, the many activities, and the disco. The group of young adults that do the entertainment (organizing games, competitions, and putting on the shows) are unbelievable. All ages had a ball. There are tons of Europeans there, and they tended to not mix much, but even in spite of what is going on in the world, everyone was very cordial. Our room was gorgeous and spotless, with great maids with turn-down service and all. Our included massage was great, and we loved the little restaurants on the site, especially the Chinese, Mexican, and especially the Italian. There are also 2 gourmet restaurants that cost extra, plus the big buffet restaurant and the snack bars. The beach was beautiful with lots of water sports included. Part of the week it was a good idea to put your towels down on chaises (by 9 or so), but the rest of the week the hotel was not full, and it didn't matter. A/C was as cold as we wanted all week. We had plenty of towels, and the beach was well-stocked with them (they use a card system to keep track of how many you have, and you could get a dry one by exchanging. No one bothered anyone else's towel or belongings anywhere. The pool is unbelievable. Different price points/buildings had different colored wrist bands which determined what was included. Our wrist band was blue and we could do everythig, and I loved our buildings best (we were in building 2 right beside the pool). The part that was called Tropicale (less $$and I think a lot of Germans) had less fancy rooms and less privleges. It seems like millions of people work there in their crisp whites, and everyone was truly friendly, and seemed genuine. We especially loved Jorge in the buffet restaurant and Zacharias at the front desk, but really everyone was nice. Bring an insulated thermosr than drinking out of the little plastic cups. Tipping was included and no one hinted for tips at the resort, but we did tip when we felt people were especially nice, and it was appreciated. But don't fall for the line from the people that take you to the hotel that it is their or the driver's birthdays and tips are optional. The lobby is a social area with a bar and comfy seating and people really gathered there in the evenings before the shows (9:45). It's huge and really nice, and a good way to meet people. Employees walk the beach all day and evening, and they area felt completely safe. Photographers take pics with your permission all week with wildlife, etc, and then you can see them displayed and for sale in the lobby if you decide to buy. A 5x7is only $5, which isn't bad. We didn't drink the water except bottled (which is plentiful), but we ate whatever we wanted. We had a wonderful time, and would love to go back.

<Content>Awsome Vacation I just got back from Punta Cana two days ago and I thought it was a great vacation. I'm 18 so going there over april vacation was great because there were plenty of kids my age. I went from Sunday to Sunday and by Friday most americans had left and 90% of the people remaining spoke French and the resort seemed alot less crowded. There was a ton to do there, water sports were really great. Don't be shy if you go there, water aerobics and volleyball were a blast. The food was pretty good and there was alot of variety. My room was beautiful, service was excellent, drinks were always flowing. The beach was always clean adn it was really beautiful. If i had to give some tips I would say that definately get to the beach early to put towels down, and you have to wake up early for restuarant reservations, but if you don't, the buffet Higuero was great. The pools were clean, the employees were friendly...VERY friendly (watch out ladies) The shows were really good too. I recomend watching them and then going to the lobby to drink and dance...and then head over to the disco which was alot of fun. Overall great worry-free vacation.

<Content>Awesome place First a bit about me, 27 yr old male, I have been to many all-inclusive destinations as well lots of travelling around the world and I strongly believe in the following:  you can't have a bad time when you have hot sand beneath your feet and a cold beer in your hands!I had the opportunity to go down south twice this winter 2003, Oasis Cancun in Jan. and The Princess Tropical in early April, and my trip to the Princess Tropical was 10 times better!don' hesitate to email me for some suggestions or more info! (already I feel really chatty)The Princess Tropical (formerly the Hodelpa Tropical) is a great place to go to, one of the best I've seen, it definitely earns it's 4 star rating!we went two guys looking to relax, meet some people and have a good time, and we got all that!Warning to english speaking people, I am French speaking but my friend isn't and the majority of the people we met and the people on the resort were either French or German speaking, but everybody was so nice and we made lots of friends with other Canadians especially. (what can I say, Canadians are nice folk!!!)This is for the most part a family or couples resort so it's certainly not a huge party place, there can be lots of kids running around the pool but there is three to choose from so it's certainly not a big issue. being 2 guy friends travelling, we were worried it would a bit to quiet, although we were looking to relax, but that wasn't the case at all. in all, we met about 16 other young and/or single people and we had an awesome time hanging out and drinking at the beach, having huge dinners and drinks together, watching the shows and enjoying a drink, drinking at the lobby bar and, dancing and drinking at the disco (do you guys see a theme here!!??) as I say, you'll never have a bad time when you're willing to make your own fun and open to meeting new people.THE HOTEL: the hotel is very nice, the lobby is huge and a good hang out place in the evening. The grounds are amazing, nice stroll on a nice little paer, rooms and restaurants) are kinda far apart but I didn't mind the brisk walk between the buildings (work the alcohol out of my system) and for those who would, a trolley goes by every 15 minutes (or any staff driving a cart will gladly give you a lift in my experience). there is often aline for the shuttle at the lobby and walking may be faster (are you that lazy!!)THE ROOM: the room was nice, no complaints. I had heard about lack of face cloths but really if you're going to let that ruin your time, stay home! (jeez use a towel!!!!) We were on the first floor of one of four units of about 20 rooms each. ours was located a HUGE 10 second walk from a pool and bar, couldn't ask for anything better!!! I did see a cockroach in our bathroom, which doesn't bother me all that much, you may want to request a room on the second floor to avoid this if your squeamish about bugs.THE BEACH: amazing! not the best but certainly up there!! nice white sand. if you get up past 7h00. don't think about getting a place under a parasol! (but who goes down south to hide in the shade anyways!!??) beach chair could become scarce at times but you could always scrounge for one! there was a lot of weed floating around in the water but it wasn't to bad. mostly smaller waves.THE FOOD: not amazing but you don't go to an all-inclusing expecting a gourmet menu! (HEY! if you don't like something, try something, that's why it's a buffet!) not a lot fo variety but Tropical guests have the opportunity to book two a la carte out of six (we have to pay for the other 4). they messed up our reservation but no biggy, (relax, you're on vacation!), the food at both the Dominican and the Brasilian was very good although I got mixed reviews about the Dominican! THE SERVICE: good! one thing to remember, never be in a hurry in the Dominican! check in will take some time so don't stress, it won't help! They take your luggage to your room which takes some more time, so if you want to get going fast when you first get there, walk your own luggage t where you are) as you can't take your luggage aboard the shuttle! The bartenders were super nice, we had fun with all of them all week, the animation guys were great, although some were a bit annoying and forward with the girls at time! I barely tip anything all week (which I feel bad about since the guys worked hard and were nice!) getting a drink at the beach bar during the day may take a while but they let you order many at a time!MISC.: The disco isn't that good, girls may get harrassed if not accompanied but the girls we met were ok as long as they were with us (I got ask a dozen time if they could dance with the girls that were with us!). We got offered drugs almost everynight by guys hanging outside the disco and were propositioned frequently by prostitutes. I knew what those girls were all about as soon as I saw them but some guys we met didn't and were quite disapointed to find out that the local girls were interested in their money and not their sly wit and down to earth good looks!!! the disco IS just outside the resort and open to the public. you have to buy you drinks there but we were already in the tank by the time we got there most nights!This is one of the only resort where they let you order mutliple drinks at a time, I would acutally go and order about 12 drinks at once for my group and they would have a waiter deliver it to our spot on the beach! room service IS free! Free pop and water in room fridge and re-stocked frequently! I havent seen and all inclusive this good in a long time, food and drinks available free almost around the clock at one of the beach bars!The shows are kind of crappy but the girls seemed to enjoy them so we endured it, plus the guys had a few chuckles cracking jokes at them!lots uf stuff to do, included (sail boat, kayak, boogie board for 1 hour a day) and not included you have to do a catamaran trip, parasailing (yawn!) and scuba diving (I've been scuba diving to better spots!))The locals at the market are really agressive (as usual!) and always negotiate (sometimes all in all, this place was one of the best I've been to! I have updated pictures of the place if anybody is interested!laterz

<Content>All We Can Say is Wonderful My Boyfriend and I went for the second year in a row to The Hodelpa Caribe Club Now known as the Caribe Princess March 18 to 25th. The first year we stayed in the Caribe side and this year we stayed in the Tropical!! All we can say was that we just love this resort, the nice thing about it is that we were able to use the whole complex with the exceptions of a few Restaurants, and in our case we used them last year and we were not impressed with them. The Buffet Restaurant is Great and there are so many different foods to Choose from that you always have something yummy on your plate, and the desserts well well YUMMY, the Dominican Coffee as well was great we never craved Tim Horton's Once. Don't forget this is the Dominican it is not North America so the food is going to be different, but it is very good!!Our Room was fantastic Clean and Our View of the Pool was wonderful, We always had clean Towels and yes Face clothes some people said they had problems with that, but we never did. We always had hot Water, and plenty of Bottle water as well. If you were ever lacking anything all you have to do is ask your Cleaning Lady she is more than happy to help you, you name it and it is yours. We tipped her upon Arrival. The Beach well that is one experience and the word I use to describe that would be WONDERFUL. The sand is so white and soft, and the waves are out of this world. This part of Punta Cana Beach is great, we walk for miles and miles each way and I must say that our part of the beach was the cleanest and well maintained of all. The other thing is that the Beach Bars yes I said Beach BARS.. there are 2 of them that are also Snack Bars are with in steps of the Wonderful Waves of the Caribbean Sea. One thing was that we had to make sure we were up Early to get out Lounge Chairs, the first part of our holiday the Beach was very busy but by the 4th day it had calmed down Quite a bit. But Really your on Holidays and if you can't relax and take it easy you really should be back at home. It i a deep breath and ENJOY!!!Overall this is One Place we will keep going back to. And we Recommend it to everyone, just keep in mind you are In another Country so relax and sit back enjoy all it has to offer, do some of the excursions we did our first year and we had a Blast. God we love this place!!!!p.s. Tip your servers and Bartenders as well, they work long hours everyday of the week and they treat you very very well and always have smiles on there faces!!!Missing Dominican,Dawn and Nick

<Content>My one week Vacation Hola muchacho'sMy wife and I have just returned back from our one week trip to Punta Cana, we stayed at the Hodelpa Caribe Club. I guess I can go from good to bad in my review.The good stuff, the beach was great, the people are great, the service was a little slow but that is the Caribbean ( must be the ron ) anyway.. The Hodelpa Caribe was very nice with the choice of pools and bars to hang out at, the room was perfect we had an upgraded that was not worth the extra if you ask me, but being on the upper floors is best it kinda keeps you away from the roach's that are the size of my index finger. The bad stuff, We both seemed to have a problem with the food, after the second day we already had gotten sick of the menu. Chicken, rice and potatoes, rice, potatoes, chicken and beef...moooo..I know they told us to stay away from drinking the tap water, so we drank bottled only...Crystal mmm..mmm good. Never had a cold one always warm. We did both suffer from a little abnormal bowl movements, a little more than I have ever experienced in the Caribbean. The must have a toilet paper factory close by the hotels, my wife and I went through about 8 rolls in 7 days. Here in Canada that is enough for a month...Other than the accelerated bowl movements and gas pains, things were very good. We both got great tans, met some good people and enjoyed the whole week even if we had to pinch are butt cheeks a few times a day. I highly recommend everybody to experience Rebulica Dominicana...Just don't forget your Pepto Bismol you will need it...Con mucho gusto

<Content>Where is the Teen Club? Went there for March break with my two teenager girls (13 and 17). They were anxious to meet other teens their age through the teen club. But there was no teen club as advertised in my travel brochure. What a big dissappointment. Wanted this trip to be a great souvenir for the girls.

<Content>Get up early We were at Hodelpa for one week in mid February. My girlfriend and I loved the place. That was our second trip in the south, the first being in fabulous Riviera Maya. Some things were great and some bad. Let's start with the good stuff. The beach was realy nice, perfect warm white sand and refreshing water. Although, a lot of waves making the water unclear but that's not the end of the world. Our room was on the Tropical complex wich has the same acces to everything as the Caribe. Two stories instead of three and quieter. Upper story rooms offers cathedral ceiling. Ask for #5321 on poolside.Hodelpa's guests are mainly german. In fact they have their own theatre for the night shows wich is unusual to me. If you like to do a lot of activities in the day such as volleyball, water-polo, dart etc, you must speak german. Everything is made for them. If you want to be in the shade at the beach don't wake up past 6:30 in the morning because you'll see every chair covered by a towel. Maximum 7:00 am for the chairs on one of the three pool. But let's stop being negative, this hotel is realy beautiful with it's colors, three nice pools, good buffet and restaurant. Bring enough sunscreen or pay 30$ cdn! By the way, we did not give any money to the maid until the last day and got an excellent service. Enjoy your vacation!

<Content>Good value for the money We were in Punta Cana for the week of january 26 2003. We stayed at the Hodelpa caribe Club. On arrival at the hotel we had great service from the reception in booking 6 rooms of three and my double room. The reception staff was polite and cheerfull and theyr English or French was acceptable. The lobby is beautifull and gives you a great impression of the rest of the resort. Always clean and presentable. You have great service upon arrival to kickly get your luggage and handbags to your room. Although the rooms are very far from the lobby-reception area, you'll have a good time peacefully riding the mini-train to your room or suite. Ladies, DO NOT ride in the front with the drivers at night! That's all I'll say.... Rooms are spacious, very clean and everything worked in there. The A/C was amazingly efficient. There are no facecloths in the room. Lots of towels but bring your facecloths from home. The maids are polite and respectfull of patrons. They do a great job in making sure that you have plenty towels and whatever you need. No elevators available in both suites buildings or standard room wich I find weird, especially for older folks... The food is good at the buffet Higuero. Just good. Not amazing. I've had better selection and variety in the Dominican Republic. If you are a desert lover, wrong place. Very limited desert selection. But food is fresh and tasty. All the a la carte restaurants are AMAZING! Make sure you try all of them. The disco is very cool. Make sure you get there before 12 AM to gather-up some drinks cause after that you have to pay for them. But the prices are fair. Good variety of music. I was surprised actually by the DJ. He spinned some real cool tracks, very recent dance hits and the amazing Latin tubes were awsome! Staff in general are friendly and helpfull. Big lack in animation quality. Practically nothing in the evening for kids. Bars are all over the resort and the quality of bartenders is variable. Jairo is the master of the pool-bar. Danny and his boys at the loba smile...always. The pools are clean, well located, very close to the beach and snack-bar. The beach is nice. Not amazing, but nice. One thing I didn't like was the fact that they never cleaned the beach compared to many other destinations we visited. There was lots of leaves and debris from the ocean from the previous nights and especially when it rained practically every night.....Anyway. Good activities on the beach. Lots of longchairs for everyone. Water sports were very available and easy to reserve. Beeing a frequent traveller, I recomend Hodelpa caribe Club and Punta Cana to anyone who wants a good resort and hotel for a good price. But for people used to luxury and gourmet food and executive treatment or visiting the local area for great tourism spots go elsewhere. There is nothing besides the resorts in Punta Cana. Still, I give it my 4 stars rating

<Content>Nice place, not so nice staff. Just got back from a week at the Hodelpa. The site and resort itself were beautiful, and even the food was excellent, but even so, I won't be going back. My misadventure started when I arrived at the airport in Halifax: I was informed that due to overbooking, I was being bumped to another resort for a night, but that I would receive wine, dinner at the resort's 'haute cuisine' restaurant, free massage, etc. I was a little annoyed; having reserved my trip 6 months in advance, I didn't think I would have to deal with this kind of thing. But I was happy I about the freebies, not realizing at that point that other resorts often give out entire free week stays for such inconveniences. Anyway, because of the bumping, I ended up spending two days of my vacation waiting in lobbies for my room to be prepared (check in isn't til 3pm). But the real kicker came when I went to arrange for my free meal and was told (in quite a rude manner) that I wasn't going to get one. Finally, I did get the meal, but having to fight for it kinda ruined my day. As for the wine, it showed up 3 days later with a rotton cork. A few times I approached guest services with questions and I found their manner to be so rude that I went out of my way thereafter to avoid having to deal with them at all. Despite all this, I did have a good time, and the place is breathtaking, but I would advise anyone going to the Hodelpa not to expect stellar service or even much politeness from guest services. The customer certainly isn't always right at the Hodelpa.
