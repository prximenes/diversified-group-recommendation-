<Content>Lovely Hotel Super Hotel recently refurbished to a very high standard. Comfortable with friendly helpful staff. Walking distance to Metro and main shopping streets. Car parking and small garden which is unusual. Would be great to have breakfast in the garden in Summer. Quite and peaceful yet in the middle of Paris. Went for New Year which was great.

<Content>Beautiful hotel, Good Location We booked this hotel for a romantic weekend get away, and we were not disappointed. The renovations for the hotel were complete, and our room was gorgeous. They were nice and clean, and we got great value for our money. We booked directly on the Best Western website and found it had the cheapest rates. It's located close to a couple of metro stations, and its about a 7 minute walk from the arc d' triompe. It's not located directly at the tourist attractions, but that was fine for us because we got to experience a bit more of French culture minus the tourists.

<Content>AAA Recommendation Not my first stay and by no way my last. I arrived at the end of August and left the 26th October. Amazingly friendly staff and yes renovations were going on as they have just gone from 3 star to 4 star. During this time I did a few trips and I left the extra luggage in the hotel with no problem at all and when I arrived back it was waiting for me in the room. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Paris. Rooms great, service awesome and close to most popular sites. A fantastic experience for such a long stay. P.ISydney, Australia

<Content>Loved the Best Western Premier Regent's Garden Hotel! The Best Western Premier Regent's Garden Hotel was wonderful. We spoke very little French, but the staff all spoke English. The hotel was clean, with new bathrooms and a large shower. The staff was also terrific, making reservations for us for dinner, tours and the train. We loved Paris, and we loved the Premier Regent's Garden Hotel!

<Content>What a gorgeous Hotel! I was staying in Paris by myself, having never been there before, in between visiting 2 lots of friends in Europe. From the minute I arrived, I knew that I had made the right choice. This hotel is beautiful. There were some very minor renovations still going on, but absolutely nothing that bothered me (like some tape around room numbers while they were painting, which was there one day, gone the next). I never saw any work, or heard anything. I stayed in a standard room, but it was quite large by Paris standards from what I had read on this website. I had a lovely comfortable bed, writing desk, bed side tables, bar fridge and LCD TV. There was a little foyer with a closet in between the bathroom and bedroom. I even had a bath. On request, the hotel provided tea and coffee making which I believe is standard for the bigger rooms. I used my iphone in my room and in the garden with the free wi-fi the hotel provided. There is also a computer with free web access near the lobby. The foyer downstairs was divine, the garden immaculate and I can't rate this hotel high enough. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. What makes this hotel a stand out is the little supermarket, no more than a 20 second walk across the street. It is such a charming place. It's located in the 17th arrondissement, which is quite residential (but Parisian residences are vastly different to Australian so don't be turned off by that). It gave me a real insight into the Parisian culture being in this location. I was a little worried about the hotel being away from all the action when I booked it, but it definitely was not. A lovely short 7 minute walk or so, and you were at the Acr de Triumph, which is at the top of the shopping end of the Champs Elysees. This is a quieter part of Paris, but definitely not away from the action. I will stay at this hotel again in a heartbeat. It made my short 3 day trip to Paris memorable. When I was leaving, a couple of the larger rooms were being cleaned and I had a quick peak. If you have more than a couple of people, or you want to splurge on the bigger room, you will not be disappointed. They were individually decorated and looked spacious and very charming. I can't wait to return to this hotel again. I don't usually write reviews on things, but seeing as I found this hotel after looking at this website, I wanted everyone else to have the benefit of my experience.

<Content>Great hotel, shame about the price increase! We enjoyed a fantastic Mother-Daughter trip to Paris in August and were very impressed by the quality/cost ratio of Regent's Garden Hotel. We got a really nice, recently refurbished twin room for only 99 Euro (booked direct on the hotels website).However, rather large negative: A few weeks later, having been so impressed by the hotel that I was planning a second trip back there to stay with my husband, I was told by the hotel that it had just been upgraded from a 3* to a 4* hotel and that subsequently the price has increased from 99 Euros for a Classic room to 169 Euros! A huge increase which dramatically changes the 'value for money' aspect of the hotel. While I would agree that an increase was warranted based on the refurbishment, it does not warrant a 70 Euro increase and it's a real shame as it puts a nice little hotel in the unaffordable category for a lot of people who would previously have stayed here (a comment I made to the hotel).

<Content>Stylish and Friendly A very well located hotel within 5-10 minutes of two metro stations on different lines. Obviously recently refurbished as it was very smart and stylish. We booked a superior room which was reasonably large and had a view onto the front street,. It had a separate bathroom and toilet (unusual). The bathroom fittings were superb and the quality of the linen was very good.The breakfast room was smart and the breakfast (included in our deal) was more than adequate. Staff were very friendly and welcoming.Added bonuses were a superb patisserie opposite the hotel, a nice little cafe/restaurant next door (Cafe Pierre) if you are two lazy to go anywhere else and an excellent restaurant called 'La Galvacher' in the nearby square with wonderful beef, reasonable prices and friendly service. Thoughly recommended.

<Content>great value for paris This hotel was a fantastic place to stay in Paris, a 5-10 min walk to arc triomphe and about the same to the nearest metro Ternes. Hotel is under renovation summer 2008 but is nearing the end, the foyer was a mess but the front desk staff were happily working around it and looking after us. For the price about 110 euro it was outstanding value because it is a hotel with all the services in a good district and manages to merge the historical paris decor with the modern requirements. As far as european hotel standards go is a good 4 star. Wifi was included, tea and coffee facilities, friendly staff. As mentioned by others champion supermarket across the road along with patisserie. There is also a market which opens up in the streets on the way to ternes metro in the streets just behind, great fresh bread and fruits, etc. Note we stayed during tour de france and it was perfect for champs, close enough, not too close.I will stay again some day soon.

<Content>Brillant find in Paris-loved it! This was our 4th trip to Paris and we had always stayed on the Left Bank on previous trips. We thought we would like a change of scene and also the hotel in which we previously stayed had very small double rooms and our girls are now an age at which its nice to give them there privacy and the family room days are now gone!We booked our trip through a web site and got a rate which included breakfast. When checking in at the desk I enquired if the rooms (2 superior) were overlooking the garden as we had requested. We knew there was no guarantee on this but as soon as we mentioned we would prefer it the very helpful receptionist had it sorted out for us. One had already been a garden view and she changed ours no problem!On arrival into our rooms the four of us were delighted with the cleaniness,size of rooms-especially ours, as it was the same size as the quadruple we had in our previous hotel. It was really a special touch to have tea and coffee making facilities as Paris hotels dont usually have this little touch.The supermarket-Campion chain was very handy just across the road with a huge selection.We were concerned about the area being quieter but it was great to come back to after racing around Paris all day. It was very easy to find as we used the Air France bus from CDG which dropped us off a 5 minute walk away. We used the Ternes metro stop 5-10 minute walk to get around Paris.All in all we can highly recommend this great hotel, they were just one day away from completion of the renovation work and we will no doubt return to stay here again in the future.

<Content>Nice hotel, good location, currently under renovation This is a nice and cozy hotel located in the 17ie arrondissement. It is walking distance to Arc de Triomphe/Champs Elysee (10 minutes) and the Eiffel Tower (20 minutes) and also close to the Metro and walking distance from drop-off points for (Porte Maillot and Etoile) when using Cars AirFrance from CDG.We were a bit turned off upon our arrival due to the renovations in the common areas of the hotel. Those fears were put to rest when we got into our room which was a nice, recently refurbished superior room.Rooms in Paris are notoriously small. I would say that the room that we had was just the right size for 2 people. Bathroom was modern, albeit very narrow between the shower and toilet area.The staff was very friendly and offered good tips/advice on sites nearby.The hotel is in front os a small supermarket, a bakery and a butchery so it is also convenient to grab some food for a quick snack or breakfast. We were there four nights and picked up pastries at the boulangerie and juice/yogourt at the supermarket on all but one morning (you don't get much for the 17EUR that they are charging for breakfast at the hotel)I was very satisfied with my stay and would have probably rated the hotel as excellent if it would not currently be under renovation.Speaking of renovations, they were done during business hours and did not prove to be a disruption.

<Content>very good deal for Paris I go to this hotel for my business trips to Paris. It just got 4 stars (before 3 stars). Exceptionally quiet (except room 1 near to the front desk), very nice breakfast (bread, eggs, cheese, ham, croissants, yogurt, cereals, fruit, real and fresh orange juice...). Some of the best deals you will find in Paris taking into account price, quality and location.The Cafe Pierre, next to the hotel, is a nice place to have a drink or to have lunch or dinner.

<Content>don't be put off by the refurb The appearance of this hotel is down at heel (definitely not as good as the official photo). But don't be put off! Once inside, we found that it is being refurbished and we were to occupy a room that had already been refurbished on the first floor. The room was good, with nice bathroom fittings and decor. Cleaning was first-rate. We were told that the hotel is aiming for 4 stars. I think they may be almost there. They need more luxurious towels to complete the effort. The choice of satellite TV stations is however excellent. The reception was still awaiting the refurbishment treatment (and distinctly hang-dog) but the staff are nice and friendly and to be honest you are not likely to spend a lot of time there. Breakfast was also good and there is a charming rear courtyard where you can sit to read the free newspapers. The situation is just great, within walking distance of Place des Ternes Metro and in a quiet back street. There is a really first rate and reasonable restaurant just 200m. up the street called Maison de Campagne - be sure to book ([--])

<Content>Highly Recommend Just returned from Paris and stayed at the Regents Garden for 4 nights with my boyfriend. We got an excellent deal on the Best Western website and were very impressed with the hotel. The location is ideal, 5 minutes walk to the Arc de Triompe and metro station. The area feels very safe and there are a very good selection of restaurants nearby (recommend the Brassier around the corner where you can cook your own meat). Our deal did not include breakfast at the hotel (which is quite pricey), instead we ate breakfast at the cafe's which were much more reasonable. The hotel is going through some refurbishment at the moment but this did not disturb us in any way, our room was very nicely decorated, really liked the layout and presentation, very clean and modern. The staff were very friendly and good to recommend places to eat, etc. Overall we were very happy with our stay and would highly recommend this hotel

<Content>Gorgeous hotel We stayed here just a couple of weeks ago, and had an amazing stay. I was a little nervous about it as I've lived in Paris and know what some of the hotels are like! However, we had absolutely no complaints with this one. Our room was very spacious, and recently redecorated in a really nice, funky style. Huge bathroom with a lovely big bath, a nice view over the garden (although this was being done up so was a bit of a mess) and a lovely comfortable bed.We had breakfast included in our rate - it was a very nice continental breakfast, with lots of lovely French bread and pastries to keep you going for the morning! The breakfast also ran until 11am so if you needed a little extra sleep, you could have both. The staff were extremely helpful and polite at all times.Other reviewers are correct when they say it's a short walk to the Arc de Triomphe and Champs Elysees. The metro is also very close, and there are lots of shops etc in close proximity. The only one (small) complaint I would have is that for one night of our stay, there was a club night on in the bar next door, which meant there was lots of loud music and noise. This wasn't the case for the rest of the stay so I dont imagine it's a regular occurence.I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Paris. It's excellent value for money and I don't think you'll do much better.

<Content>Great location, recommended to All! We've stayed at the Best Western Premier Regent's Garden Hotel from 24 to 27 December. I booked via Best Western website and got an excellent rate. We had a superior non-smoking room. The room was very spacious and clean with a good size, modern bathroom. The view from the room was great, not only we enjoyed the look at the garden but the rooftops of other parisian houses were very pretty indeed. We had our 2 year old son with us and the travel cot in the room was handy. The best thing about this hotel is its location! It is about 10, 15 minutes walk from Arch de Triomphe and 25, 30 minutes from the Eiffel Tower.Also there is a bakery across the road from the hotel with fresh croissants and a supermarket few steps away. Recommended!Oh I almost forgot to add that there is a small lift in the hotel which is helpful when carrying a pram etc.Au revior

<Content>New Years in Paris. Stayed at this hotel days leading up to New Years 2008. You are actually walking distance to the Arc de Triomphe as the hotel is located on that side of town. Definitely a fantastic hotel location if you don't mind walking a little.The hotel has some historical significance as it used to be a mansion of Napoleon III. So it definitely has a charming look and feel about it. The room we stayed however, was remodeled and had a fairly modern french look about it. Very comfortable room and bed. Free in-room wireless internet and public computer in lobby a big plus. The bathroom was decent size and and had a towel warmer. No complaints there.We stayed in room 309 which seemed to be located near or over the next door restaurant/bar which stays open into late into the morning. You can hear chairs being pushed in and out and maybe shoes with heels walk across the wooden floors of the restaurant. May bother you if you are a light sleeper. We walked so much during our stay that at night, we usually slept right through it. The neighborhood in which this hotel is located is great. There is a market and p芒tisserie right across the street. Both very nice and convenient. Tons of cafes and shops in the nearby area.The hotel staff was very helpful and spoke good english. Made for a delightful experience. Definitely would stay there again and recommend if you don't mind walking a little.

<Content>Absoulutely charming hotel! I have stayed at this charming hotel twice this year, in September and November. I located it on the internet and was worried about finding the right place and location as I was traveling alone the first trip. I was thrilled to find a hotel right in the middle of everything, but on a lovely side street with a garden courtyard. I had only planned to stay a few days but because of the staff, location, comfort and feeling of the hotel, I stayed for ten days and then came back in November! The accommodations were excellent. On my first trip, I ended up staying in four different rooms as they accommodated my extra days and they were all lovely. The bathrooms are exceptional( I am very picky!) and the beds are very comfortable. The staff is seasoned and very personal. The little dining room for breakfast is adorable. You really feel like you're in Paris, but also right at home! I hope to return in May.

<Content>During the Metro/Train Strike - yaikkkkssss We just got back from our 1 week stay in Paris. We stayed at Best Western Premier Regent's Garden the whole week. The Hotel is old, but well maintained. They have a secured small parking spaces in front of the hotel. The reception stuff speaks english and are very friendly and helpful. The room we were in was small - which is a standard size for Paris. The room and bathroom are clean. Our room faces the street and across the street is a contstruction and it get really loud and noisy with all the drilling and hammering. At night time, we could here the cars on the street, the honking and motorcyle -- a bit loud. Breakfast is not included with the room fee, so you have to pay an extra 12-15 Euros per person, so we decided to walk a few meters up the mainstreet and viola . . . . we found several Boulangerie/Patisserie with excellent bread/pastries/croissants and they also offer petite dejouner. The Hotel is average, nothing spectacular . . . we were out most of the time so we only use the hotel for sleeping. There is a Grocery across the street which is very convinient to buy some drinks and snacks. There is also Boulangerie/Patisserie and Asian food take out. The location of the hotel is pretty convinient . . . the metro (if it was operating normally) is only 10 minutes walk. Etoile and Champs Ellesey are also only 10 minutes walk. We will probably stay at this Hotel again . . . mainly because of the location. The Train/Metro strike started the second day we arrived in Paris -- this was a disaster. We have been in Paris 7 times the past 8 years and we never had this strike experience before. Metro is very important to get around Paris. Ohhh .... what a catastrophe. But we decided to enjoy Paris with or without Metro and we had a great time despite of it all. The worst part was that, we purchased the 5 day Visite Paris -- unlimited Metro ride for 5 days for 鈧?27.00 per piece and we did not even use it. The Metro clerk did not even informed us of the strike when we bought the tickets -- oh, well ce'st la vie! We should have been more informed . . . our bad !

<Content>Love, Love, LOVED Paris! Best Western Regent's Garden was great. We arrived via overnight train from Venice, so we arrived early on a Sunday morning. It was too early to check in, so we went across the street to the boulangerie and sampled their croissants and pain du chocolat (YUM!). We went back to the hotel to wait to check in and had to wait only 30 minutes or so until the desk manager came over and offered us a room that WAS available--an upgraded room at no extra charge! It was a small suite with a hallway, closet, large open area in the room with desk and small, antique couch, and nice bed. The bathroom was updated and very nice. We didn't eat the food at the hotel (although they did have a breakfast available each morning and I think other meals throughout the day?), as there were many great places within walking distance. Close to the Metro and Arc du Triomphe within walking distance (also the Eiffel Tower and Champs de Elysses if you're feeling energetic). We would definitely stay there again!!

<Content>Great wedding anniversary experience My wife and I stayed at The Regent's Garden nine nights. Compared to our only other Paris hotel experience 35 years ago, this hotel provided much more luxurious surroundings and a very courteous, attentive staff. We had a quiet room that overlooked the rear garden. The carpeting, tile WC and separate tile shower/bath appeared to have been upgraded recently.  The Arc de Triomphe is only about 1/2 mile away, but it is uphill all the way! I recommend using the Ternes metro station if you want to go the the Arc de Triomphe (Charles DeGaulle Etoille Metro) or Museums beyond. On your short walk to or from Ternes Metro, you will walk by one of the best outdoor markets in Paris, where you can pick up fresh bread, cheese, pastry, smoked fish, vegetables, fruit and inexpensive wine for your evening meat in your hotel room.  We can recommend the L'Orenoc, Spoon, and Chez Georges restaurants from personal experience. These restaurants are within walking distance of the hotel or Charles DeGaulle Etoille Metro stop.  My only disappointment was that the free hotel WiFi Internet connection blocked two of my U.S. email providers, Verizon and Compuserve. Fortunately I had a third email site available that was not blocked. Also, my favorite web browser, Mozilla Firefox, did not work there. The hotel staff could not tell me if the blocking was being done locally or nationally.

<Content>Great choice for hotel in Paris Spent 6 nights at the BW Regent's Garden in September, 2007. We highly recommend the hotel. We stayed in a Queen-Garden View Room on top floor (3rd floor). The room was spacious by European standards. The bed was large....more like a King size....reasonably comfortable. Washroom was also fairly large with combination tub/shower. The room was very clean. A/C worked well and was quiet. Room comes with bar fridge and safe. Apart from the size of the room, the best thing about the hotel room was how quiet it was. In 6 nights we hardly heard a sound.Staff was courteous. Free computer/internet in the lobby (The hotel guide in the room advised that there was a charge for the lobby internet. However, we used it on several occassions and were not charged.)Two small nits: No kettle tea/coffee in room....although you could ask for a tea/coffee tray free-of-charge at the front desk. Elevator is small. But that's standard for most hotels in Europe.The hotel is located in the 17th Arr.; a 10 minute walk to the Arc de Triomphe. Three Metro stations are within a 10 minute walk: Porte Maillot; Charles de Gaulle Etoile (aka Arc de Triomphe) and Ternes. The first two stations also have access to the RER. So while there are few sights close by the hotel....you have easy access to transit.We took the Air France Bus from CDG to Charles de Gaulle Etoile....20 Euros return....took about 45 minutes....with a 10 minute walk from there to the hotel.We didn't try the breakfast in the hotel. There is a great pattiserie across the road and numerous other restaurants, cafes in the area.

<Content>Great - again! My wife and I stayed at the Regents Garden last in 1988, before Best Western purchased it. When my teenage son and I decided to take a short hop, Expedia had it listed as one of the top picks. I was a bit wary of what might have changed since BW purchased it - my concerns were completely unfounded. The rooms are spacious by European (particularly Parisian) standards, staff was friendly, and the location is fantastic. The bathroom was clearly recently upgraded, and is again quite large for a boutique hotel in Paris. I agree with all of the previous reviewers and suggest skipping the overpriced breakfast and walking 100 meters to a cafe for le petit dejeuner at half the price. I will be traveling to Paris again in a few months and will certainly stay here again.

<Content>Best choice in this price range I have travelled to Paris dozens of times and know quite a few hotels there. This was the first time I stayed at the Regent's Garden, and I will make it my favourite from now on. I had booked a Queen's Room with garden view for a little more than 100 EUR. I am not sure if I actually got an upgrade, because the room I got (on the top floor) was the spaciest I have ever seen in this city, where the standard is to be crammed into some tiny space where little else than the bed fits in. The view to the garden was not really overwhelming, but pleasant. Totally quite, except some occasional noise from what I guess was the elevator. I could easily cope with that. The decor was nice, what you might call typically Parisian, as in the rest of the hotel. The garden is a great feature, very rare in Paris. Staff was friendly and efficient, and really everybody speaks English - they not only know it, they actually speak it, which is also not typical for France. Highspeed internet for free in the lobby. I am not sure about internet in the rooms since I did not bring my notebook.The only real downside was the breakfast buffet, which at 14 EUR is wildly overpriced. Choice is rather limited, and they even charge you extra for scrambled eggs and the like. When I came in short before closing on the last morning, there was hardly anything left, but I still paid the 14 EUR. While it is certainly very nice to have your breakfast in the garden, you will get much better value outside. What I liked, however, was the fair trade tea and coffee which I have very seldom seen at any hotel.The location is OK but not exciting, in a mid- to upscale residential neighbourhood with little of interest. It is about 10-15 min walk to the Arc de Triomphe. If you want to stay close to the main tourist attractions, this is probably not the optimal choice, but anyway the metro system is so efficient it does not really matter where you are located. There are several stations on various lines within 10 min walking range.

<Content>fantastic May 9-13, Absolutely fabulous hotel. Beautiful rooms. I reserved two superior doubles but because one room was for a single person was switched to a single suite at same cost. A fantastic room. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful. 2nd time I've stayed here and will definitely return. Didn't have breakfast this time but did last time. Can get cheaper at local cafes if you're not willing to pay 14 euro pp.

<Content>Gerat Location We enjoyed our stay in this hotel. We booked the hotel via the Best Western website and got a good deal. The rooms were of a high standard and very clean. The location was excellent, it was within walking distance of some of the sights and although the area is not very lively at night, we felt safe. The boulangerie across the road is to be recommended.The only down side to our stay was the air con unit in the room which was very noisey and omitted strange noises in the night!

<Content>Not bad The hotel is good for those on a budget. The rooms are decent sized, the location is alright, its in a non-touristy area. That was something we didnt like, after spending the day in Paris, we dredding going to the hotel because the location was so blah. We wanted something more with a view and something more lively. The staff however is a big plus, they are all very helpful, kind, and fluent in english.  The metro stop is about a 10 minute walk, so is the Arc de Triomphe and the Champs Elysees. The hotel experience overall was good, but next time we'd rather stay some place more contrally located.

<Content>Our favorite Parisian hotel The Regent's Garden is our favorite hotel in Paris. We recommend it to all of our friends, and they love it, too. The location is quiet and not touristy, yet it is easy to walk to the Champs Elysees and excellent Metro stops. The hotel is near the Parc Monceau, the most beautiful park in Paris. The staff is very professional and everyone speaks English. They are glad to call you a cab and recommend restaurants in the area. Our favorite room is #1. It's enormous, overlooks the garden and has a refrigerator. We find the breakfast buffet a bit expensive and sometimes we pick up something in the neighborhood instead. For our last stay we booked well in advance on the hotel's website and got an excellent rate. I used to live in Paris, and when I'm at the Regent's Garden, I feel like I've come home.

<Content>Needs some updating We like the location which is a nice residential area. There are few tourists around which is a great plus! I've known this hotel over the past 25 years and it is in serious need of some updating. New beds and linens would be a good start. For light sleepers, ask for a room facing the garden. Definitely skip the breakfast which is awful, there are many cafes serving breakfast around the neighbourhood. Service is okay, but I would have to agree with another reviewer, it could hardly be described as award winning.

<Content>Tres Bien! Just got back from a 7 night stay at the Regents. We stayed in the standard room and I have to say, the rooms were large for European standards. I was a little nervous about staying there from reading other internet reviews, but decided to stay there anyway. The Metro is a 4 block walk and may seem far for some. But, it's Paris and if you want to SEE the real Paris you have to walk...a lot. As far as the off the beaten path remark from an earlier review. Simply not true. There are plenty of restaurants in the area, however, It's not a nightlife hot spot. Overall I enjoyed the stay. The breakfast is pretty expensive (13 euros) for boiled eggs and pastries and coffee. If you drink 4 cups of coffee it's almost the same price at a cafe. around 2.50 euros for a cup. The staff was very friendly, definitly worth the stay. If you are looking for a more livelier area, stay in the Latin Quarter. But, if you are looking for a quieter less touristy area, this hotel is an excellent choice.

<Content>Great hotel! This was a great hotel, We stayed here last week on a valentine's trip to Paris. The staff were friendly, helpful and offered help at all times. Some reviews I read before we went made me a little anxious, however they proved to be way off the mark.The room was compact, sure, but who goes to Paris and stays in their room?!?!?! There's a gorgeous Patisserie and supermarket right over the street with plenty of bars and bistros in the surrounding area. A five minute walk from the hotel led us to a quaint French market too which was a bonus!The Regents Park is a 5 min stroll from Ternes metro station which is on the handy blue line. 5 min also gets you to the Arc de Triomphe.Just goes to show that everyone has different opinions, but Im glad I booked this hotel before I read these reviews otherwise Id probably not have booked it - which would have been a real shame!!!

<Content>Just OKAY-not great I stayed with my parents and sister in this hotel over the Christmas break. This wasnt a terrible hotel, but you can without a doubt find hotels that are just as nice/better for the price. I wouldnt say the staff was pleasant, just basically accommodating. The rooms were clean, and the bathrooms were nice.All in all, it was OK but the location was a bit of a walk from all of the main attractions. I guess it's good for those who arent into the nightlife Paris has to offer.

<Content>Oui! Oui! My husband and I stayed at this hotel a few years ago. I just recently recommended it to someone, so that reminded me to post a review on Tripadvisor. We flew Ryan Air over from Dublin, so this hotel was very close  accessible to Port Maillot, where the bus from Beauvais Airport left us off (about a 5 minute walk). Our room was small, but very clean and seemed to be recently redecorated - very tasteful  lovely. The bathroom was more than adequate. The hotel is on a side street, just off Avenue Ternes and was very quiet. We were within 5 minutes walk of several Metro stations and the Arc de Triumphe. We had limited contact with the staff, just left early very morning and returned to sleep or refresh before dinner, but they were all very pleasant. I would definitely stay here again on my next visit and will recommend to anyone going to Paris.

<Content>Off the beaten path Nice, quaint hotel in a residential area slightly north and west of the Arc de Triomphe and Champs Elysees. Closest Metro stops are Charles De Gaulle/Etoile or Ternes. It's a good 1/4 mile walk to either of these stations which can be a pain when starting or ending your day. However, being in a residential area means bakeries, grocery stores and street markets are all very close by, good for travelers on a budget or when you're tired of eating in restaurants. Be sure to check out the street vendors at Ave. des Ternes and Rue Poncelet. Otherwise there are some decent restaurants on Ave des Ternes within a few blocks of the hotel.Rooms are decent sized (by Paris standards) but plan on only two per room. Bathrooms are very nice, adorned in marble and modern fixtures. Staff is friendly enough and speak decent English, but I wouldn't nominate them for any customer service awards. Pass on the breakfast; it costs 11 euros and it's not nearly as good as the fare offered for free at many american motels. Walk across the street to the bakery instead.Finally, if noise bothers you ask for a room that doesn't have a view of the street - the garbage and delivery trucks come by every morning around 7 AM and can be quite noisy.All in all, it is a decent place to stay. After fighting the crowds all day, it was nice to come back to a quieter area off the beaten path that still offered a wide array of shopping and dining.
