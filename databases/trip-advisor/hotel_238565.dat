<Content>Stay some place else if you can Stayed in this hotel for two days 18/19 Oct 2008.Pros: - Staff is friendly- breakfast is included and is quite decent- hotel lobby/reception area makes for great pictures- Breakfast area is done up very well.- very close to the central station and the other attractions in central amsterdam. 20 mins by train from airport- has a secure room to store luggage in case you check out in the morning and have a plan to catch only in the evening- safe and good for families or couplesCons:- a very congest place- rooms disappointingly small -- one person has to sit on the bed for the other person to have enough space to walk around- the loo area is waaay too small...one can't move arms in the shower..also if one sits on the throne, the knees touch the wall!!- heating didn't work well- better places out there for the same amount of moneyif possible, do a bit more research and stay some place else. we, my wife and i, regretted paying so much money for just two nights and staying in a place so congsted that we couldn't even strech our legs properly.over all a 'B-' rating only because the rooms were a big disappointment..seeing the room for the first time will make you think 'what....?!! that's it!?'...

<Content>Excellent Clean ad Friendly Just had a 1 night stay in the A Train in Amsterdam - wished it was for longer! The hotel is right across from the Central Station and ideally located. On entering you cannot miss the train memorabilia, the owners must be real enthusiasts - it was great! The Rooms were spotless we booked a double and the family room. We had a kettle and microwave in the family room which was also on two levels. Breakfast was served in the Pullman Lounge. There was a good choice of meats and cheese and plenty of coffee tea etc. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful.We will definitely stay here again at this delightful hotel.Thanks for making the visit to Amsterdam special for us.

<Content>Bedbuggs !!! I decided to stay in A-Train after reading all these good reviews.I stayed in first class room (nothing first class about it; small room, no amenities - shampoo etc available) and after the third night (they had not changed the sheets) I found a little blood in the sheets. My alarm bells did not ring then....The fouth morning the bed was covered with bedbuggs and they had eaten me all over. I complained at the Reception and all they did was only noting it down, they did not apology and the matter did not seem to suprise them. Luckily that was my last night at the A-Train.Besides this the room was on the very busy street side and there were roadworks going on during the night. Luckily I managed to purchase earplugs later.On the positive side the breakfast and the breakfastroom were very nice and the personnel was nice (untill I complaint about the bugs).

<Content>Not Far from Train Station Stayed there for 1 night before heading off to Belgium. The hotel is about 5 mins walk from the train station. Good location if you are travelling by train to your next destination. The cafe has a nice train theme. The breakfast fair was just average..nothing to fancy. I booked a triple room, the size of the room was small and the bathroom did not have a shower curtain so after a shower the entire bathroom will be wet. Overall, had a good experience.The rooms were clean and the receptionist was friendly. Would recommend it to traveller who won't be spending too much time in the room.

<Content>Great base for visiting Amsterdam We booked the A-Train hotel after reading other reviews on Tripadvisor. Some of them were not favourable but the criticisms were not about anything that would bother me so I booked anyway.We booked the Old Master suite which has its own little courtyard garden which we didn't actually use as we were out  about most of the time.The room was very clean and plenty big enough for us  had a lovely en suite shower room. Despit previous comments we didn't get the floor soaked just a little spray from the water while getting washed. The bed was comfortable  there was tea/coffee making facilities as well as a TV which had English speaking channels but we barely switched it on.The staff were friendly  helpful  as we informed them in advance of out arrival time they had the room ready for when we arrived. This is probably not possible in high season as the room will be occupied from the day before. We were allowed to leave baggage in a secure room on the day of check out too.The hotel is perfectly placed for those arriving at the train station or as we did on a coach from Rotterdam as it is very close to the drop off point. We got off the coach  looked across the road  there it was.It does have a train theme which I thought was very nice, if you don't like that sort of thing then you probably won't like it but it does after all make no attempt to disguise that it has a theme so no one should be surprised.The restaurant has railway buffet type seats  decor. The food was a usual continental style breakfast  was very nice, everything was fresh  plentiful.The problem some people have with leaving the key at reception was not a problem with us, we have had to do that in many hotel that we have visited  I actually prefer it, stops me losing it. As someone is at the reception desk all of the time there is no problem with picking up/dropping off of the key. You are given a little card to show them when collecting it.All in all I really enjoyed my stay  the only downside was that we couldn not stay longer. I would definitely return to this hotel.

<Content>Great Staff, Great Location Extremely handy location, almost opposite central station, yet tucked away from the hustle and bustle. The staff here are very friendly and helpful. You leave you key with them every time you leave and they are behind the counter 24/7. We left our bags with them after check out and they locked them in a designated room so we could pick them up later. Although its close to central station I felt very very secure. Our room was small but had a lovely window and outlook and modern TV. Very clean and breakfast was buffet style cold meats, cheeses, yoghurts, cereal, toast etc. We didn't have tea and coffee making facilities in our room but took our own portable jug. You can buy tea and coffee from a machine downstairs though and it was quite cheap.Overall I would highly recommend this place if you are looking for value for money.

<Content>Good Hotel and location. Freindly folks. I wish we would have stayed here for the 3 days we spent in Amsterdam. The hotel staff was extremely friendly and hospitable. The hotel is located almost directly across trom the train station. It is not the most beautiful place but it is very reasonable and nice. The room was quiet and comfortable. The breakfast was great and coffee too. Every other place we stayed we had to pay for everything. Here you could have two cups of cofffee without paying an arm and leg. The breakfast area was real cute with train memorabilia all over the place. If you want to save money and go plain this is a fine place. If you want to pay more and more stay elsewhere. We stayed at the Sofitel the next two nights and I was unhappy. Enough said.

<Content>Great Location, Great Price The location of this hotel was about a 5 minute walk from Central Station. While the room was small, the breakfast was included made the price of under 125 euros a night, a bargin. The hotel was clean, the staff pleasant and helpful. We would definitely recommend this 3 star gem as a great place to stay while in Amsterdam.

<Content>All Aboard! The A-Train Hotel is a nice small hotel with warm staff. The location of this hotel is close and convenient to Amsterdaam Central Train Station.The room was very clean as was the bathroom. If you are looking for a large luxurious hotel this is not for you. If you are looking for an affordable clean, comfortable spot to stay in that has a style all it's own, then you can't beat this hotel.Breakfast in the morning was nice and the front desk staff was very helpful to me.I am a woman who travelled to Amsterdam on my own and felt very safe and comfortable and even looked after at this hotel.Especially if you are coming in at night and don't want to wander the streets trying to find your hotel - this is a great place to go.This is not an american style hotel, but I found the beds to be very comfortable and got a great night's sleep.

<Content>A great location and experience This was a great location and choice for our family of two grandparents with three grandchildren. We booked the Apartment, which could sleep six. The location was very convenient to all of Amsterdam. The staff was very pleasant and helpful. Inexpensive parking for our rental car was explained by the staff. The only downside would be if the weather turned very hot as there is no air conditioning, but several fans are provided. The hotel was very clean and the breakfast was good, if not fancy. It was great for our group.Even the train themed decor was delightful.The hotel seemed very popular and was often filled. Be sure to book early, expecially for the larger family rooms.

<Content>Central and convenient Probably the last thing you want after lugging all your bags on the train from the airport is to have a big journey from the station to your hotel, so this place was nice and convenient.The train-themed decor was interesting and gave the place character. The only downside is that its pretty expensive at weekends and they make you pay extra to receive perfectly normal cable TV channels that are free to recieve anywhere else.

<Content>Great value, stay here! This is a fine hotel. It is right across from the Centraal Station so it is perfectly suited for touring around Amsterdam and for day trips elsewhere. Our room had a clean, comfortable double bed, small writing table with chair and a closet for hanging clothes. It also had a safe which was nice. The bathroom was also clean and actually spacious with lots of hot water and good water pressure. The breakfast was standard fare and tasty and served until 10 am so you could sleep in a bit. We found the hotel staff to be very friendly, multilingual and pleasant to talk with. My only minor concern was that our room faced the main road so it was a bit busy even at night which made sleeping with the window open a somewhat noisy experience. Still, it is a fine hotel which I would definately stay at again.

<Content>No complaints! After reading several reviews on TripAdvisor.com and seeing that the hotel was within walking distance of Centraal Station, we decided on A-Train. It was a bit expensive, but ithat was my fault for not booking a room sooner (it was pretty much the cheapest hotel we could find in the area tho). We flew in from London and got to Amsterdam around 11am. Check-in wasn't until 2pm, but we walked to the hotel to drop our luggage. The 2 gentlemen behind the front desk were extremely friendly and helpful (and spoke very clear english). We were thrilled when they said our room was already ready and gave us the key (we'd had to leave London a 4am so were eager to take a nap [after visiting our first coffee shop first, of course])! The hotel is small and narrow, but what building isn't in Amsterdam? The whole train motiff is cute. Our room was no bigger than the size of an average dorm room, but it was all we needed. Yeah, the fact that you have to pay extra for TV sucks, but no biggie. I was actually impressed by the selection of food they had for breakfast. They had cold cereal, hard boiled eggs, breads for toast (with an assortment of jams, honey, peanut butter and chocolate spreads), sliced cheeses and meats, orange juice and coffee (although the milk for the cereal looked more like the consistencey of yogurt). The location was perfect. All-in-all, it was a great stay and we would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Superb find! This is the fifth time we've stayed at this hotel in three years. Having been to Amsterdam approx. 12 times in the last five years.This is by far the best hotel we've stayed in. Great location, good service, great rooms. O.K., slightly pricey, but compared to some of the other places we stayed at, I think it's worth paying the extra.

<Content>If you smoke or if you like service - Give this a miss. I am a regular visitor to Amsterdam, and there really isnt much wrong with this Hotel.Its comfortable if a little small, and centrally locatted, its just their very poor service that lets the hotel down.First off the we asked the receptionist where the nearest coffee shop was, he told us then proceeded to check us in and take our payment upfront (a little strange i thought).Then once all checked in and after he had told us where our room was he informed us that we were not aloud to bring Cannabis onto the premises and if we were found to be smoking on site then the police would be called. Now he knew we were smokers and yet still took our money off us before telling us of the Hotels policies. Not being ones to rock the boat we abided by their rules, but found the staff to be rude and abrupt and it seamed as tho any question was just too much for them to answer.Overall if your part of a family and can put up with shear rudeness then you may find this hotel a good stay, else its back to the Multatuli for me which is just along the road which makes it a little quieter than the A-Train too.

<Content>Overpriced!!! We booked a suite - that normally means you get 2 rooms: 1 bedroom and some sort of lounge. At A-Train it turned out to be a normal hotelroom, with a rather long, narrow corridor leading to it. In the corridor they had put 2 uncomfortabel chairs. Breakfast is included, but not worth eating! The breakfast area resemples a fast-food place (however a well-kept one). We paid 鈧?00 for the room - I have seen both bigger and better in Amsterdam - at half the price!! The hotel is not ALL bad - it's not well-kept, but quite clean, and the location is quite good: it's just across from Centraal Station, and therefore really conveniently located, both for train-travellers and for those who fly into Sciphol, and catch the airport train into town. From C.S. you can also catch trams to anywhere worth going in town. Most of the canalcruises depart from the canal by C.S. and both the Red Light District and Chinatown (best chineese in Amsterdam), are 5 minutes away. The shoppingstreet Nieuwedijk is litterally just around the corner.

<Content>Absolute Perfect "Little" hotel What a great little hotel!!! Yes the rooms are small but lets face it all you should be doing is resting your head in the hotel. Nice breakfast, really nice staff (owner looks a bit cross at times, but is ok!). Hotel is directly across from centraal station. The one and only downfall is You have to pay 鈧?.50 for the cable channels. but if you want to watch TV you should stay at home. Oh and they say you cant smoke in the rooms but you can. i mean after all, it is amsterdam!

<Content>Wonderful welcome, great location, friendly staff. Having never been to Amsterdam before, we searched the internet and grilled friends for hours about where to stay. Having finally decided to opt for the A-Train and having read the reviews we were delighted with the Hotel. This was our anniversary weekend and the hotel provided flowers for my wife. All the staff were extremely helpful, the rooms are comfortable with modern decor. It is located 200 yards from Central Station which is far enough to avoid the noise from the traffic. I would highly recommend this hotel to those with a low to medium budget.It is within walking distance of Dam Square and the other major attractions

<Content>recommended stayed here for 1 night after a disasterous night in another hotel, when we arrived at the hotel we were given a key to check the room and it was WELL worth the price we payed,rooms are spotless and staff very helpful, literally a stones throw from all the main shops and hotspots of the city, breakfast was excellent and as much as you wanted, all in all i would recomend the Atrain to anyone who is looking for a fantastic stay in amsterdam.

<Content>Great theme and friendly staff We went here following TripAdvisor reviews and were not disappointed.The location is excellent - right opposite the train station and near the centre - and you can hire a bike just across the road. The staff were all very friendly and gave local advice and tried to help if they could. I was very pleased that the phone calls from the phone in-room were very cheap.The room was spacious and well equipped, and I loved the theme of the hotel with all the little train items. Breakfast was good, the shower was good, and the rooms were clean.The only thing we didn't really like was that we always had to hand the key in upon leaving. I understand why they do it, but we didn't know that you had to carry the little yellow card to get it back and then got in trouble after turning up late on the first night without it!Overall a very positive experience.

<Content>Good Choice Here I am very happy that i stayed at this hotel. It is conviently located near the train station for arrival/departure and tram use while in town. It is far enough away from the trains that noise is not a problem. The staff was friendly and spoke english well. Room was typically european (small, adequete). One drawback was that the room did have a cigarette smell going on. Bathroom was clean and modern. The entire city center is within walking distance, although trams are best for traveling to the Van Gogh Museum area. Breakfast was fine...and also run-of-the-mill european. Ham, turkey, cheeses, toast, cereal, and coffee/juice. I paid about 95 euros/night for a twin room (Sun-Wed). All in all a fine choice and I would stay here again.

<Content>The Best Little Place in Amsterdam! One of the huge bonuses of this place is its handy location. You just hop on a train from the airport, and the hotel is visible from the train station. You can get there within 2 minutes! It is also located right in the heart of Amsterdam, within walking distance of everything a tourist would want to see. The staff were helpful and friendly, allowing us to stow our luggage until our room was ready (we arrived at 7.30am Sunday morning due to our flight!). Despite jetlag we went straight to the Anne Frank Huis and were first in the queue for when it opened at 9am! The rest of Amsterdam was clearly still sleepy from revelry the night before!The room was very small but quite adequate for a short stay. The bath room was modern although strangely designed in that the shower water went everywhere and almost out onto the carpet. The first shower I took almost flooded the bathroom (due to a block in the drain) but help was sought and the problem speedily handled by the management. I wouldn't advise elderly or disabled people staying here, however. The stairs were very narrow and very steep (much like the rest of Amsterdam) and we had to climb up them to our bedroom. It was very warm when we stayed so we just turned the fan on and opened the windows. There was no street noise at all and we slept very well. The breakfast was very good and prepared us well for our busy days. I think people who criticise the breakfast would do well to recall that it is complimentary and that in most other countries this would not have been complimentary.Overall, it was a great stay and I would definitely stay there again without hesitation!

<Content>Great location and value..... Ideal for a short break, great location across from the central station, walking distance to everywhere or near trams if you prefer. The Old Dutch Suite has small patio with table and chairs and best of all the en suite was spotless, with energy saving toilet flush and fabulous shower.

<Content>Train enthusiasts will love it Thoroughly enjoyed a few days at this hotel. Very conveniently, it is 2 mins walk away from the station, and everything else. The room wasn't fancy or large, but clean and sufficient, and reasonable. Staff friendly and helpful. Breakfast was self-serve, normal choice of food. The seating area had a very interesting 'train' theme. I will definately stay there again.

<Content>Glad we booked the A train I spent hours on the internet trying to find somewhere central in Amsterdam that had an ensuite and did not blow the budget. I finally decided on the A-train because of the reviews and it was also one of the cheaper hotels that met our requirements. We took the train in from the airport and had our instructions on how to get to the hotel, but we didn't need them as you could see the hotel straight away - brilliant! Once we were inside we were once again pleasantly suprised - we had expected it to be a little dark and dingy (from photos etc) but it was lovely. I was preparing myself for the difficult climb up stairs but there was a lift! Although I would say that the room is small we were pleasantly suprised again as we had expected smaller and the ensuite was lovely, clean and modern. We thought it was going to be difficult to sleep because of the location but our room was not on the street. There was a little noise from tenants in neighbouring buildings (because buildings are so close) but nothing major. Breakfast was lovely and the staff were very friendly. We would definitely recommend the A-train.

<Content>Great value --excellent location Great location, close to all the action. We got off the train and rolled our luggage across the bridge to the hotel Nice room at a great price. The place is kept clean and the desk people do a great job of maintaining security. Everything is included, in the price, no surprises. The staff is first rate, especially the woman who runs the breakfast room. I recommend choosing a First Class room. This room is bigger and has a view of the canal and the Central Station. The fridge in the room is great for storing drinks and food. Don't concern yourself about the shower set up, the water won't reach the room. The elevator is quite big for this type hotel. Just look out for the high thresholds on the doorways. Remember to lift your feet or you'll go on a trip of a different type.

<Content>wouldn't go back My experience with the owner and a manager of this hotel was horrible. They were both insensitive, cold and rude. Especially considering my reservation had been accidentally deleted on their end. The manager in particular was so rude that if I would've had an option to stay elsewhere, I'd have taken it. The room itself had zero charm and in fact, I had to open the window and prop the door open to air it out from the previous tenants. For almost 150 euros a night, your vacation money is best spent elsewhere. Try the Hotel New Amsterdam which is a mere 5 minute walk west. All the people who worked there were completely amicable, the rooms were charming and my stay was peaceful. If you can help it, vacations should be full of good memories, not bad ones.

<Content>Great Hotel Wonderful hotel with great location near Central Station and Dam Square. Hotel was clean with friendly staff eager to assist. We booked a triple room that had pleanty of room and most importantly was clean and smelled fresh! This hotel provides a safe environment with friendly staff available 24hrs. They also offer a variety of items in the vending machine including Heineken so we were happy! Also enjoyed sitting in the Pullman Lounge area each evening. Breakfast was the only aspect that may have room for improvement- it was good however a variety of cereal would add the extra touch! (I recall only cornflakes being available). While looking for hotels prior to arriving in Amsterdam, I am pleased I chose the ATrain as I was able to see all the other hotels in person once I arrived a did they ever appeatr filthy! The Atrain is wonderful and I cannot wait to return! KS in Arizona

<Content>Nice Hotel, Convenient Location This hotel is located right by the central station, which is very convenient for getting from/to the airport and for traveling throughout Holland and other countries by train. The Dam square is 10-15 minute walk away and the whole city can be easily explored by walking 鈥?we never had to take trams/metro. The area around the hotel is quite busy and some of the streets nearby house outgrowth of the red light district (so keep that in mind if you are with children), but we felt quite safe around the hotel. The staff was quite nice, but not too friendly.Getting suitcases up and down the floors is easy since the hotel has quite modern elevator. The (standard) double room we had was very small to the point that we did not have enough room to put our suitcases. However, the bathroom was very nice, large, and clean. The room had a safe, which was convenient. There were no ironing boards, etc. in the room as well as no tea/coffee making facilities and no fridge.. There was a TV with a number of Dutch and German channels as well as several BBC ones. The rooms do not have air conditioning, so they might be uncomfortable during hot weather periods. Wireless internet was available for a surchargeOne of the best things about the hotel was the breakfast, which was included in the room price. Although coffee for some reason is not free, you have a choice of several juices, tea, meats and cheeses, cereal, toast and jam (no fruit, though).Keep in mind that you must pay for your stay upon check-in. They accept credit cards, so this is not a problem. The hotel itself is not very cheap, but it will be hard to find a better value in Amsterdam considering the hotel鈥檚 location. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone and would stay there again myself.

<Content>Straight A for the A-Train We stayed at the A-Train from 31st July to 4th August and can definitely recommend it for value, comfort and central location. Because we would be arriving late evening I wanted somewhere near the Central Station and the hotel is literally only 2 minutes walk from the station entrance. We had a double room rated as 'first-class' which meant it had a fridge and a bit more space and a good view out over the main road to the station, so great for people watching. Continental breakfast til 10.0 am. Traditional pub almost next door, really handy for trams and canal trips. There was no air con in the room (but there was a fan) which could have been a problem a week or so earlier when the European heatwave was on, but it had cooled down when we were there. Would definitely consider staying there again and would recommend it to others. Straight A for the A-Train.

<Content>Perfect Location I travelled to Europe for 19 days and my first and last days were spent in Amsterdam. we stayed at the A Train Hotel both days and it was perfect. Great location, good breakfast, and clean rooms. Our room did not have any type of shower curtain so the water went everywhere and there is no AC, but it is still a good place to stay.

<Content>Great hotel in great location This was my first time in Amsterdam and I stayed at the A-train hotel. The airport provides a shuttle to the various hotels in the city. A round trip is 19 euros, one way is 12 euros. The best part about the hotel was its location. Central station is right across the street, the infamous Red light district is a five-ten minute walk, lots of souvenir shops and cafes nearby, the Anne Frank house is a ten minute walk (there麓s a LONG line, but it麓s worth it). There麓s also an internet cafe right around the corner. It costs about 2 euros for an hour. The hotel charges 5 euros for a 30 minutes. The other great thing about the hotel is the staff. They speak English very well and are genuinely kind and helpful. I overslept and was late to the airport for my flight, but they were nice enough to have the shuttle make a special trip for me.My room was just the right size for me. It was very clean. There is no air-conditioning so it got hot at night. They do provide fans which makes the temperature a little better. If you can deal with no A/C you麓ll be fine. The shower pressure is great too!I would definitely stay here again, probably with a friend or two. Amsterdam is lots of fun if you麓re with your friends or family (:

<Content>An Amsterdam Diamond! Never mind the Amsterdam diamonds - the A-Train Hotel is a little diamond in itself. Having read reviews about the hotel before we travelled (indeed was swayed by them when booking) we were delighted with what we found when we got there. Within a stones throw of Central Station it couldn't have been easier to get there from the Airport and we found a warm and friendly welcome on a cold, wet Amsterdam evening. Yes, it was unusual to be asked to pay on arrival but wasn't a huge problem, and having to hand in the key each time we left the hotel was no problem at all. After all, there is a master key for the maid service so if anyone wanted to sniff around while we were out (see comment from Los Angeles traveller) there is always the opportunity, as in any hotel. We stayed in the triple room which was plenty big enough for the three of us and everything was spotless and nicely decorated and furnished. Crisp white sheets on the beds always get a thumbs up from me. The only down side was that this was a 'smoking' room and personally I think it's time all such rooms were banned in all hotels. There was a faint hint of stale smoke in the air, particularly when the room had been closed up for the day! The bathroom with the 'wet room' type shower was also spotless with soft white towels - you just had to remember to move everything to the far side of the bathroom before showering. The power shower was excellent and one of the best we've found in any hotel, anywhere. Breakfast was very good and relaxed. A typical 'Continental' breakfast with cereals, hams, cheeses, a selection of breads, boiled eggs, toast, juices, tea  coffee etc. from a free vending machine, and everything fresh. Nothing wrong with that! Much better than the so-called continental breakfast we had recently in a London hotel (why am I not surprised!). The surroundings of the Pullman Lounge was interesting and full of character. In the absence of tea/coffee making facilities in the bedroom, it was also good to be able to get a hot drink from the vending machine any time during the day or evening, at a small cost.For location the A-Train would take some beating. All the major attractions of Amsterdam are within walking distance, and unless you are on a very short break and don't have time to stroll the streets and canals, there really is no need to use the trams or canal boats at all, although both are easily accessible straight across the road outside the Central Station if you do need them. There is a wide choice of restaurants in the vicinity, of all cuisines, so no need to go hungry! In conclusion all I can say is that we look forward to catching the A-Train again some time. Highly recommended unless you want Hilton standards, in which case I would say pay Hilton prices!!!

<Content>A-Train great for a short trip Stayed at the A-Train for 1 night in the 4 bed room as I had my 2 children and mother with me. The kids loved their mezzanine floor room and the toy box with various toys. The stairs to this room are extremely steep (more like a ladder) but there is a gate at the top of the stairs. Beware if you have very young children though. The room was clean, reasonably spacious and had everything we needed (including the much appreciated kettle, tea and coffee-also had microwave). Location was great. Opposite the Centraal train station and the departure point for canal cruises and trams. Price included breakfast which was good (we're cereal and toast people so were well catered for). I would recommend the A-Train due to location and facilities as long as you're not looking for something lavish. It served us well.

<Content>Decent quaint hotel Just came back from a two night stay at the A-Train hotel and only have one criticism with this quaint little centrally located BB. I was reluctant to book it at first, but was swayed by the price. The fact that they insist you turn in your key each time you leave the hotel (and pay upfront) gives you that uneasy feeling that you are not to be trusted and you in turn don't feel comfortable leaving important items such as jewelry and passports -- even though they have a safe. Trust goes both ways, and I resent the obvious fact that my movements are monitored and that anyone can pop into my room and have a sniff around. I don't buy the owners comments (fire etc) as other bigger hotels have log books which they rely on to know which rooms are occupied. If you don't trust your customers they in turn will not trust you. Aside from that, it is a clean and quiet and cheap. I was little peeved at first as I requested a room with a view, but got thrown into one without, but after returning to the front desk it was rectified.Overall, it is a decent hotel for a VERY short period -- rooms are really TINY (can't swing a cat!) and breakfast is very basic (cheese, ham, bread, cereal) no hot breakie, but it is a cheap and cheerful hotel. You get what you pay for. Staff are not overtly friendly, not helpful with directions -- more subdued and serious. I won't stay again only because there are zillions of other hotels in A鈥檇am all also centrally located and as a serious traveler, I firmly believe in never going to the same place twice -- not unless the service (or food) is exceptional and at the A-Train it isn't, but I would certainly recommend a traveler on a budget to stay a couple of nights here.

<Content>Loved the train memorabilia We stayed for four nights at the beginning of February and were delighted with this hotel. Location is great just a couple of minutes walk from Central Station. We found the staff extremely helpful and although our room was small and a little chilly it was clean and adequate with a great wet room type bathroom. Breakfast pretty good and varied with toast cooked to order. Nothing is very far away in Amsterdam although as it was so cold we took advantage of the 3 day tram ticket - one payment and you can use it on all trams and some of the buses so we explored all over the place!

<Content>Brilliant location I have just returned from a stay in the A-train Hotel, Amsterdam, having read the reviews on TripAdvisor. I agree with a lot that has been said regarding the convenience of the location. It really could not be better. Our room was small, quiet, clean and warm and the TV had a nice range of free channels including BBC. The shower was great and the bathroom was spotless.The one problem I had with the hotel, however, was the breakfast. Curly-edged stale cheese on bread that has been out for hours is not very appetising. Although we went down for breakfast before the 10am cut-off point, there was often very little food left so it was obviously not being replaced.The staff were okay but not very forthcoming. Nevertheless I would recommend the hotel if you get a cheap deal, as we did. It was a pleasure to return to it after a cold night out in Amsterdam.

<Content>Good Deal, Great Location! We just got back from a weekend in Amsterdam and since I had used TripAdvisor to determine which hotel to stay at, I wanted to add my 2 cents. The A Train hotel had great reviews and offered the best deal for us; it was also one of the few hotels in the city where a room for 4 people was available.Our experience at the A-Train was excellent, and I would definitely recommend it. It was ideally located right across the street from Central Station, 15min from the airport. The easiest way to get from the airport to the hotel was by train, especially since it only cost 3.60 euros per person. Most places we wanted to visit in the city were within walking distance or just a short tram ride away. The staff at the hotel was very friendly, and the room was clean. The only negative side was the bathroom...it was very small with no shower curtain installed; everything would get soaked when someone took a shower. Breakfast was included, the buffet was pretty simple, yet enough for what we were looking for.I would go back to the A-Train during my next stay in Amsterdam.

<Content>Excellent Location and Friendly Staff We flew from US to Amsterdam, with one night planned in Amsterdam. We chose the A-Train hotel based on price, amenities and location. You cannot beat the location if you are on the train the next day, or if you are going to take a lot of day trips using the train or bus system. The location is close to many sites, as well (we walk a lot - the distances were not formidable from the hotel).The desk staff were all friendly and helpful. I thought the breakfast was good, as I don't expect anything more than coffee and bread/butter when in Europe. Anything more than that a bonus to me!We stayed in the Old Dutch Masters Room, which has a private patio. The rooms are small, but no more than what is usual in Europe. I wasn't a fan of the bathroom - unheated and water everywhere when you shower due to the setup. Our biggest issue was the camera on the patio, which we didn't notice until 20 minutes before leaving - and I'll admit in advance that was unnerving only because as US citizens, we are a bit zealous in our expectation of privacy. At least we know now, and it wasn't a huge issue - we just didn't know about it or expected it. Inroom (through ethernet cable) or lobby internet access was not free - I'd like to suggest making the in-room internet either free or reduce the price a little. Every other hotel we stayed at in the Benelux on this trip had free WiFi. A-Train was the only place using Ethernet and that charged for in-room access for laptops.We would definitely go back if if were winter. The patio wouldn't be so private in warm weather (other rooms look down onto the private patio), and I can see how the rooms might be quite stuffy in the summer, so I would have to take that into consideration in other seasons before booking at the A-Train.

<Content>What a jewel We (a family of 4 adults and 1 child) stayed here from Friday 11th November until Monday 14th November and absolutely loved this hotel. We were probably lucky in that we stayed in their family apartment at the top floor at the back of the hotel and it really felt like we were staying in a Dutch House more so than a hotel. We had a 3 year old child with us and when the A-Train mentioned in their advertisment that they had a 'toy-box' we expected it to have a few old broken toys but that was not the case. There was a fantastic 'complete' train track with train and some other toys that our little boy just loved.The room was very spacious and quirky with a lovely bathroom and a kitchenette (microwave, kettle, fridge, tea, coffee etc), a little sitting room with table, a lovely little kiddies bed, 2 beds downstairs and then a little attic balcony with a further 3 beds.The hotel staff were lovely and always gave our little boy sweets every day. The breakfast was fine and as all the other reviews mentioned - the location was fantastic.I would DEFINITELY stay here again and loved the fact that it didn't have the impersonal atmosphere of most hotels.

<Content>Ideal place to stay Have just arrived back from a three-night stay in the A-Train Hotel in Amsterdam. Since I often use tripadvisor to weigh up options when travelling I thought I'd contribute something back with my first review here.The A-Train Hotel is very conveniently located, being on the opposite side of a road and small canal basin from Amsterdam Centraal railway station. Thus it is also a short walk from Dam Square and other central attractions.Most of Amsterdam's tram services start from outside Centraal Station (and many buses), and the canal basin mentioned is home to a couple of the companies offering a variety of canal cruises. It is thus easy to get to much of Amsterdam and the rest of the Netherlands quickly and easily from the A-Train hotel on the public transport system. Centraal Station is just a 20 minute train ride from Schiphol Airport - we landed at Schiphol at 2035 and were at the A-Train hotel by 2130.The A-Train is a family-run hotel whose owners are clearly dedicated to ensuring your stay with them is a pleasant one. All the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful. We were asked to pay on arrival (even though we had reserved with a credit card), and this might not be every customer's ideal way of doing business but with hindsight, at the A-Train at least, I'm sure of their will to address any justifiable problems quickly. Our room (described as a 'first class' room on their web site) was compact but clean and comfortable and featured a walk-in shower, wc, refridgerator, comfortable arm chair and tea and coffee-making facilities. Heating (radiators) and hot water supply to the bathroom were good. Although our room was situated on the front of the building the windows (when closed) ensured we were not unduly disturbed by traffic or other noise from outside. There is a lift to take you to the upper floors. Internet access is available for those who need it. The breakfast buffet featured fresh white, brown and fruit breads (and toast too), hard-boiled eggs, ham, cheese, honey and jams along with several breakfast cereals and also tea, coffee and hot chocolate drinks. The hot drinks were dispensed from a machine but this didn't detract from their quality.Breakfast was taken in the lounge area (no-smoking at breakfast time) which, along with the rest of the hotel, has a railway theme. No meals are served at the A-Train (other than breakfast) but there is a vending machine between the reception area and the lounge area selling cans of Heineken beer and soft drinks, along with crisps and chocolate. Obviously there is a very wide choice of restaurants in the City - for a lucky-dip selection I'd recommend catching the Tram to Leidseplein (No.5 from the hotel will certainly get you there). Joselito's Tapas bar around the corner from the A-Train (turn left when leaving the hotel and keep walking along and round the block until you find it) is ideal if you want somewhere close to the hotel. I've visited Amsterdam many times over the years and have never found a hotel there that I'd like to return to - until now. Any future visits we make to Amsterdam I'll be staying at the A-Train. I look forward to the next trip.

<Content>Chuggin' Along The rooms are small, but that is the norm for Europe. That said - location, location, location ! Very near the Central station, the main shopping artery, the canal boat tour offices and the grown up fun side of Amsterdam, this little gem is a treasure. Breakfast is included. Nothing fancy, but substantial and you can eat your fill. The management and staff are terrific and eager to pass on hints, helps and every courtesy possible. Loved the train decor. All in all, it is a terrific place to hang ones' luggage ( or backpack ) and start exploring Amsterdam. Oh, there is internet access - either using their pc or your own.

<Content>Great place to stay We saw a very good review of the A Train hotel on Tripadvisor and we endorse it. This is a great place to stay in Amsterdam. Very well positioned opposite Central Station. The rates are very reasonable for a 3*** hotel with all the facilities in the room. The room was very small but comfortable, clean and well maintained with ensuite. The hotel has a railway theme and this is well presented in the very pleasant breakast room. The hotel rates include a good breakfast and there is the bonus of an elevator. The staff are very friendly and helpful

<Content>A-first class hotel Your search for a hotel in Amsterdam is over. After rejecting similar priced hotels outside the city centre because of bus/tram/taxi costs, and the travelling time, which would eat into out two day break, we found the A-Train hotel. Located right in the heart of everything this is your ideal base for a visit to Amsterdam. Myself, my wife and two friends stayed in the apartment, right up in the roof you have two floors, six beds, a living area, a kitchen and a bathroom. Facilities were first class, very clean and spacious. Very quiet too, I'm a light sleeper and always hear people outside the door. With a good breakfast, served in the train themed lounge included in the price, and the staff friendly and very helpful, this hotel made our trip to Amsterdam a cracker! We will return again. For longer next time!!

<Content>Clean , friendly staff and good location The good things about the hotel. Very friendly and helpful front desk. The was a small problem in our room and management took care of it very quickly. The location is excelent just accross the train station and walking distance to center of city. Rooms: The rooms were very clean, however, even for european standards they were extremly small. When I say small I mean very small. The beds were confortable, but rather low and small.

<Content>Taken advantage of A- Train hotel management was entirely unsympathetic to our travel emergency. Even though our two rooms were re rented and we gave 36 hour notice we were charged full amount for unused rooms. Be very careful before giving this unethical hotel your credit card information.

<Content>ideal location/ clean hotel have just returned from a two night city break to Amsterdam. The A-Train hotel is in a great location virtually opposite the Central Station and a minutes walk from the Damrak where you can either begin a walking tour of the city, jump on a canal cruise of the city or even pick up a coach and tour slightly further afield to the fishing villages of Volendam and markem.The hotel was clean. the bathroom was small but had a walk in shower with lovely hot water. The breakfast was simple but the bread etc was very fresh. The staff were friendly and helpful. As two people who had never visited the city before I would have no hestitation in recommending this hotel to friends. We were allocated a room on the third floor and it was very quite , clean and comfortable.

<Content>Great Family Hotel Had a lovely time in the A Train. We booked the family room, it was a very generous size and on two floors. 2 Twins, kitchen, dining table, cot bed and a lovely shower (no bath) on the first floor. Above in the attic are 3 more twin beds. They also provided a large amount of childrens toys. Could easily accommodate a family of 5, was more like an apartment. As it's at the very top of the building theres lots of stairs (not unusual for Amsterdam) though there is a lift you still have to negotiate a few stairs to your 'Nest'. It can also get quite hot up there. Just open the windows if need be. Room and Hotel was clean, full of character, staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast was adequate, some fresh fruit would have been nice, and perhaps the coffee from a vending machine was not ideal, but I'm fussy like that. Would heartily recommend this great little independant family run hotel to any families wanting a comfortable hassle free stay in Amsterdam.

<Content>Excellent value  I stayed for two nights with a friend in this hotel at the end of August, and then one night by myself. The rooms are small but the place is clean and the staff is very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was ok. The best thing was that the hotel is REALLY close to the train station...this was a relief since when we got to Amsterdam it was pouring rain. The single I stayed in was tiny but comfortable. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Loved the A-Train Hotel! The A Train is an adorable little choo-choo train decorated hotel. It's very clean and offers a nice big breakfast each morning with the price of the room. The staff are wonderfully fun, friendly and helpful. It's located directly across the street from the Centraal Train Station. I literally pulled into town on the TGV train from Paris, rolled my luggage across the street, checked in and walked around the corner, directly behind the hotel to dine on wonderful tapas at Joselito's Tapas Bar. You cannot beat the location if you need to travel in or out of the Centraal station, especially on early or very late arrivals. It's a great place to stay with lots to do  see in the immediate area!

<Content>3-star room with 1 star management and breakfast My wife and I are both in our fifties, and have visited Amsterdam many times over the years. We visited for the New Year celebrations in December 2004, but the Rho Hotel we normally stay at was full, so we booked the A-Train, which was also 3 stars. On arrival, the manager was extremely rude, insisting we pay 596 Euros (for four nights) in advance, even though he had our credit card number to secure the booking. Paying in advance like this has never before happened in Amsterdam, and of course it means you have no bargaining chips if services or facilities are poor. It also displays a remarkable lack of trust in the hotel guests - ok in a flop house, maybe, but not in a three-star hotel. The room was pleasant and clean, but the breakfast was really very basic, and not of 3-star quality at all - very poor quality plastic bread, which you had to constantly ask to get toasted, cereals, and drinks from a vending machine. No fresh fruit, and the only 'cooked' item was boiled eggs. It is hard to see how they could offer much less and call it 'bed and breakfast' at all, and it was certainly not three-star quality. If you're paying three star prices, look elsewhere - customer service and quality is much better in other 3-star hotels. We certainly won't be going there again unless we're desperate for somewhere to stay.

<Content>Love the A-Train Stayed for a week in the loft apartment with four of us. Love the A-Train. Friendly staff, clean rooms and hotel - great breakfast included every morning. The price was more than reasonable. The location was also great, right across from the train station, but somehow not in the heart of all the chaos. Going back to Amsterdam again and already have my reservation at the A-Train.

<Content>Brilliant value for money, lovely decor. Wonderful cosy little hotel, friendly staff, lovely old-fashioned decor with modern bathroom, great atmosphere. In the heart of the city for a very low rate. Forget about your big chains, independent hotels like this offer so much more value and a unique experience.

<Content>Just OK Stayed at A-Train end of October. Nothing special, rooms small but OK (bathroom was best feature in ours). Did feel like we were 'policed' coming in and out. Have NEVER stayed in a hotel where management clock you in and out 24/7. Made you feel like you were a teenager living at home. Maybe it's because it's only small-we usually come and go anonymously in big hotels. Location was excellent and rooms were clean although there was a 'funny' smell when we got out of the lift on our floor-that nursing home/fish dinners type smell.

<Content>Fantastic Value for Money Just returned last week. Excellent friendly family run hotel only 5 minutes walk from Central Station. The rooms were clean (ours was a bit on the small side but not in room much so didn't bother us!) Hotel was clean and excellent value for money. Would definately return in the near future. 10/10

<Content>Good location; reasonably clean and quiet; fantastic value! When I arrive in Amsterdam it is generally at the end of a 14-hour plane and rail journey, and I appreciate nothing more than the quiet and comfort of the A-Train.Location: As you might gather from its name, the A-Train is just a few blocks from the train station. It is within easy walking distance of Dam Square (2 blocks to Damrak and 3 blocks up to Dam Square), a big shopping center and the city hall (for both: follow the Singel canal to Radhuisstraat).Facilities: There are at four storeys of guest rooms on two unconnected sides of the hotel. The hotel's buildings are a historic landmark. I say buildings because it looks to me the inside of the hotel was once two adjacent buildings that were joined together sometime in the past 200 years. Because of this, the A-Train's layout is rather random. Some rooms are very spacious while some are cramped; bathroom facilities and furniture can very widely from room to room.Decor: The rooms are decorated plainly, but well. Some rooms' bathrooms are wet, i.e. there is no divider between the shower and toilet/sink, and the entire bathroom is designed to get wet.Amenities: The linens are clean and the room is free of dust. No coffee maker, iron, television, etc. AND -- the biggest disadvantage to the A-Train -- no air conditioning, due to their historic landmark status. There is a fan in every room, but does no good on a warm day. Get out of your room and enjoy the sights!Extras: The free continental breakfast is well done, with all-you-can-eat: ham, cheese, croissants, rolls, cereal, yogurt, milk, juices, and coffees/teas. Get down to the lobby before they stop serving or you'll have to fend for yourself on the expensive streets of Amsterdam.

<Content>Loved the view I recently stayed at the A-Train with my wife and we loved it. As soon as we got off the train and left the train station we could see the hotel. The location is perfect and central to everything. Our room raced the canal and we could see the train station. What a beautiful building to see all lit up at night. The staff were very pleasant and helpful. We will definitly be coming back to the A-Train. 2 thumbs up from me.

<Content>Great Location I have just returned from a visit to Amsterdam. Stayed at the A Train for 3 nights. Perfect location for all the amenities. Close to the tram and train stations. The hotel was spotlessly clean and the staff were friendly and helpful. Continental style breakfast and as much as you wanted. Would definately recommend this hotel and I hope to make a return visit.
