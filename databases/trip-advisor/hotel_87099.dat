<Content>OK hotel, if a little noisy This Hotel is great for a one night visit prior to going on a cruise, I would not want to stay there for an extended period because of the noise, try and get a high room to the front overlooking the bay.Wehad a room to the rear overlooking the construction work, but it was weekend so was not a problem, it is not the cheapest place for a beer but there are bars nearby.All in all a good pre cruise hotel.Better than the RED ROOF last year, avoid that place like the plague

<Content>Marriott rarely disappoints! I booked a last minute one night stay at the Courtyard Miami Downtown two days before a cruise from the Port of Miami. My rate included buffet breakfast and transportation to the Port. When I arrived at the hotel I was upgraded to a one-bdrm suite as I'm a Silver Elite Marriott rewards member. That was very unexpected and definitely appreciated. The lobby looked like most other Courtyard properties I've stayed in, open and spacious with an eating area at the far end. The internet cafe was to the right of the dining area which included four terminals (free.. always a plus..) but there were some problems with the connections. My room was nice, a spacious suite with separate living and sleeping areas. The bed was Marriott comfy however I could tell the hotel itself is old, but renovated, as the pipes in my bathroom were LOUD and the airconditioners were also loud. The room had that 'hotel smell' but for one night it was fine. I ate at the restaurant in the evening and again in the morning and was very pleased with both the food and the service. I caught the shuttle to the Port in the morning and though there was an initial mix up with the time, the staff at the hotel were quite accomodating and called me to let me know the time had changed. As well, when the shuttle came I was at the internet cafe. Someone actually came over to get me to ensure I was not left behind. All in all, this property reminded me of why I remain a loyal Marriott rewards member. It's not always because of the physical hotel itself as the last few I've stayed in can do with some updating and remodelling. What keeps me loyal is Marriott's service standard which is high and consistent, no matter what property you are in. The Miami Courtyard downtown provided the level of service I have come to expect and appreciate.

<Content>Loved this hotel! We arrived at the Courtyard Downtown after a very very long day of flying from Nevada. The lobby was gorgeous! We walked up to the desk to check in. I had booked the hotel through EasyClick.com and they immediately charged my card. However, they failed to make a reservation with the hotel. The lady at the front desk, Cedelia, was wonderful. She said that this had happened with EasyClick a lot. Luckily (due to numerous cancellations from looming Hurricane Ike) she had a room for us. It was a beautiful king room overlooking the pool and downtown. She even gave us complimentary breakfast buffet coupons for the next morning for our trouble checking in. Loved the room! We were too tired at that point to explore downtown or go to Bayside so we ate at the hotel's restaurant. It was good and reasonably priced. The breakfast buffet the next morning was also good. Checkout was a a breeze. We caught the shuttle to the Port of Miami at 10:30 the next morning for $5.00 per person which was also reasonable. I will stay again the next time we are in Miami.

<Content>Great Staff! We used this hotel for a night before a cruise. It was booked using loyalty points, so we didn't pay anything for the room. My daughter and I arrived around 11:45am on check-in day and found the lobby crowded with guests who were obviously leaving for their cruise that morning. I approached the check-in desk about possibly getting into our room early and they said they would do what they could. About 12:20 they were able to get us into our room. It was located on the 11th floor with a small balcony overlooking the Port area. The room itself was on the small side, but was nicely appointed and clean. The TV (which had obviously been recently replaced) was not hooked up fully, resulting in a fuzzy picture (we notified them about that on check out so hopefully it's been fixed). My daughter and I enjoyed the roof top pool located on the 7th floor. We had it to ourselves! Later that night we went to Bayside and wandered around and had dinner at the Tradewinds restaurant that overlooked the harbor. The food was very good and slightly on the expensive side. The following morning we had breakfast at the hotel prior to leaving for our cruise. The food was fairly good, standard buffet fare. Checkout was painless and quick. Quick note, parking is $15 per day and is charged to your room.

<Content>Great staff, but Checked out 2 hours after arriving The hotel is in an OK location, and the staff was great. the construction site across the street didn't bother me. The rippled carpets and worn furniture didn't drive me out the door. What did was the smell. The room smelled bad. Really bad. And while I was unpacking and thinking about how bad the room smelled I turned the AC on and found out why. It emitted what I am sure was a toxic plume of gas into the room. I booked a room in another hotel, packed my stuff and left.

<Content>Hotel sucks This was one of the worst large hotels I have stayed at for a business trip in a long time--constant loud noises from highrises going up nearby, perpetual traffic with a major freeway entrance a block away---yes--lots of horns honking, and even a very busy fire station a few blocks away---with no apparent noise insulation in the hotel. To make matters worse, they put me near the elevator and ice machine (constant noise). I am not that picky, and don't normally write reviews like this---but this hotel sucked!---rdh

<Content>Nice, clean hotel I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights while in Miami for on business. The hotel is located close to Biscaynne Bay, about 2 blocks from the cruise ship area and within walking distance to Bayside (an outdoor mall / shopping area). Good location. My hotel room was spacious and clean, and the complimentary bottled waters and snacks were a nice touch. Breakfast was buffet style (a nice selection of fresh fruit, cereal, bagels, eggs, etc) and service was speedy and friendly. Overall, I'd classify this hotel as great for business travel...definitely met expectations.

<Content>Great cruise meeting point My family used this hotel as a launch point for cruise. It has a great location near the port. Downtown Miami is confusing to navigate at first. So finding the hotel was easy. Getting to the hotel was fun with Miami's one way streets.Warning this hotel can be busy with the bus loads of travelers that stay here courtesy of the cruise lines.

<Content>Great Service! The room was definitely very big and clean, we were very happy with what we recieved. We stayed on the top floor and had a great view of the water. It should be noted that dowtown miami is pretty quiet so if you are looking to stay in the middle of things, this is not the place. The staff was great and gave us passes to a popular club in South Beach that is hard to get into. The passes also allowed us to bypass the line; hotel offered passes to a couple of different clubs. Pretty convenient to access the busy parts of the city.

<Content>Nice Pre-cruise We booked a suite. It was decently appointed. The bedroom and living room was spacious. There was a small kitchen area and I think the couch was a pull out. It even had two balconies. Our room faced the light rail station but it didn鈥檛 disturb us. (I鈥檓 a light sleeper.) The service was excellent. There is a breakfast bar  restaurant in hotel. The staff was friendly. Check-in and everything was easy. One caveat is that store close around 6pm in the immediate area. Biscayne Bay is a short taxi ride away @ $7. There is a shopping area and some restaurants like Bubba Gumps and an all you can eat Argetinian steak house 鈥淭he Knife.鈥?The ride was about 20 minutes from the airport (with no traffic/non-rush hour). It was about 20 minutes from Port of Miami.

<Content>Mixed review: not perfect but problems were solved fast... Everyone is very nice and helpful. The hotel is well located, walking distance to Bayside Park, just next to the People Mover...Best to get a room in the upper floors, as there is some noise from the street. Rooms with odd numbers are smaller, but are quiet. Just take care of not getting room ending with -13, as it is next to the housekeeping room and the wall and bed jump each time that door is used.Rooms with even numbers are larger, you can see the ocean and the river. But they are a bit noisy (nothing to really bother you!)Had a few problems, but all of them were solved immediately with a smile and even with a little bag of treats asking for forgivenes...

<Content>Nice Exterior and Lobby - The Rooms Stink I've been in and out of Miami on business and stayed in the Courtyard 3 times this month. I had rooms 1128, 1028 and 218. Each of these rooms had the same stink, like these used to be smoking rooms and they could never get the smell out. The rooms are rundown and years overdue for a remodel. The carpet in room 218 is loose and bunched up. The sliding closet door fell on top of me when I opened it. The bedside lamp didn't work. The toilet water was constantly running. When I showed the toilet to maintenance the man said it was supposed to run so the water in the bowl would be fresh. They have a breakfast buffet and everything was cold except the orange juice. The waitress never came back after she brought my coffee and warm orange juice.

<Content>Good Hotel for Business Traveller I just got back from my 7th stay at this hotel (it is literally 1 block from a customer's office) and had my typically good stay. I was on the 14th floor with a large, king-size bed room which was quite clean and nice. In fact, I have always had spotless rooms at this property. It is ideal for a business traveller needing to be in the downtown area. It was cheap in the off-season at $119 per night.The hotel has the usual small, but functional gym that most Courtyards have, plus a decent outdoor pool. The restaurant/bar area is adequate when you need a quick meal and don't have time to get out.In terms of the area, it is obvious that lots of folks reviewing this hotel are not used to being in large, metropolitan areas. This area is no worse than any sizable city's downtown district. Yes, there are a few homeless folks and loiterers hanging around, but I've never had anyone approach me panhandling, etc. During the day, the streets are bustling with office workers, it's only after 7 PM that many local stores and cafes close up. That is probably my only complaint about the area, you do need to walk a few blocks to get to any place in the evening to eat. However, Bayfront Marketplace has numerous choices, plus in the direction of Brickell Ave. there are several upscale choices such as the Capital Grille and Azul in the Mandarin Oriental Hotel (great places to take customers!)If you are looking for a good jog/walk in the morning, head over the bridge to Brickell Key and do a couple laps around. Beautiful water views on a nice walkway that is very conducive for exercising.

<Content>Convenient location for pre-cruise My husband and I stayed here for one night before our cruise. We weren't sure what to expect, given the previous reviews on this site. We were pleasantly surprised! We did not see any construction - either they are finished with the project, or they hid it well. The lobby is very nice and the front desk staff are quite helpful. They recommended stores and restaurants to us upon request, and were very friendly in general. Only two elevators - mildly annoying but no big deal. The room was an average size. Clean bathroom (with Bath  Body Works shampoo and conditioner!) In fact, the entire room was very clean - we did not have a dirty carpet or bugs or anything like that. The only problem we had with the entire hotel was that our room overlooked the swimming pool, which was full of screaming, splashing teenagers until it closed at 10pm or 11pm, I can't remember which. Not exactly the fault of the hotel, just a nuisance. I don't believe that there is normally a free breakfast, but we happened to stay there during a breakfast promotion. Their breakfast buffet is fabulous! Hot food, including an omlette station, and a wide assortment of cold food as well. The front desk can arrange a shuttle to the port of Miami if you are going on a cruise. I can't remember how much it was, but check the other reviews on this site - I know they are accurate about the price. Overall, this hotel has very good customer service and the rooms were much better than I expected after reading some reviews on this site! We didn't run into any homeless people sleeping on the sidewalk outside the hotel, but we did notice that almost all shops were closed when we arrived at 7:00PM on a Friday. I got the impression that this area is a typical downtown area - thriving with business during the weekdays but completely dead any other time. It was a bit shady - I will admit that I held my purse tightly while walking around, even in the daylight. But if you just need a bed for the night before you cruise, I highly recommend this hotel!

<Content>Good base for Business Traveler This is a great option for an overnight for a cruise or for the business traveler. This is not a vacationee type hotel. The only bad part of my stay was that the business center seems to always have problems with it's computers and printers. Very close to I-95, so you can get to anywhere from here. It's pretty close to cruise ports and Bayside Marketplace. Excellent breakfast buffet.

<Content>Not a vacation hotel ... As a Marriott Rewards customer, I try to use Marriott hotels for most of my travels. Booking this Hotel (and paying for it and not using rewards) was a mistake. While the downtown location was nice, the area is somewhat scary.. two blocks west there were many street people lying under the I-95  Metrorail underpasses. One morning I went downstairs and there was a person sleeping on the bench in front of the hotel ! I got panhandled twice while walking in the immediate neighborhood. The worst thing as far as I was concerned was the swimming pool. Located on the 7th floor ... NOT on the roof where the sun could reach it ... it was between numerous high rises. This pool was COLD... not refreshing cool, but COLD... and NO jacuzzi to at least sit in the sun. (Due to the neighboring highrises, the sun on the pool is available from perhaps 10:30 to 3:00 ... ) . The first night we arrived, I read the advertising brochure for the bar ... 2 for 1 drinks and free snacks... when we went to the bar for this, the drinks were VERY weak - I'm convinced it was less than a normal shot and the snacks were chips and salsa. When I asked about the hot snacks as advertised, the man in the bar/restaurant area said that they don't have any demand for snacks during the week and only serve them on Friday night! The staff was ok, not overly friendly - professional but cool . I will say that one person really stood out as a very helpful and caring person - Chef Roland at the breakfast bar was one person that should get praise ! Room cleaning was done quickly and very well ... Parking was $15 per day with in and out availability... OVERALL, a mistake for myself and family. Will not consider this hotel again and think that anyone who doesn't have business downtown should carefully consider their decision to book here (This is not a vacation/leisure hotel!) ...

<Content>Super friendly staff We stayed at the Courtyard downtown Miami for 1 night pre-cruise. I don't think I have ever encountered a friendlier staff at any hotel. Everyone you encounter not only says hello, they offer some conversation. The room was clean. We had a view of the pool, which was between highrises, so not much for sunning. The bed wasn't the best, wasn't the worst. Great pillows though! It was a little bit of a walk to the Bayside Marketplace, which I highly recommend for the evening. The breakfast buffet was pretty good, but a bit pricey. They did arrange for a $10 shuttle to the Port of Miami. Downside was we had to sit in the lobby with our bags for 1-1/2 hours between check out time  time to leave for the port. I'm not sure if it was worth the price, but kudos to the staff! I think next time I will try the Holiday Inn for it's location.

<Content>Average hotel... Got this for a god deal on Priceline, we only needed to stay one night prior to our departing for our cruise out of the port of Miami. Catching a cab at the airport was not a problem, and a reasonable fare to this location. The room was average, the hotel lobby was nice, the location was a bit shady. There were 4 of us, and we walked to the Bayside Marketplace (only a few blocks), but I wouldn't have done that if we hadn't had my husband and the other larger man with us. The conceirge also got us a deal on a van to the port the next morning. The breakfast buffet in the lobby was OK, if slightly high priced. Would stay here again, but wouldn't pay the rack rate for it, that's for sure.

<Content>Loved the fish... Beautiful Salt Water aquarium in the lobby set the town for the trip...relaxing. Stayed downtown to avoid beach insanity. Easy trip over the causeway to enjoy southbeach but none of the price headaches and $30.00 valets that dent your car. Courtyard was great. Clean, comfortable, good food and good service. And the rooftop pool was neat. Would definately stay again.

<Content>Had a great time Stayed here on my trip the first weekend in April. The place was exceptionately clean and the people were very friendly. Restaurant had the best burger I've had in a long time.My only complaint is having to pay for parking at a courtyard, but then again where else can you stay in downtown miami without having to pay for parking.Good place overall and friendlier then some of my stays at other miami hotels.
