<Content>Great Service Having been disappointed with a room offered at a nearby hotel we came here by chance. To cut a long story short, and as it was my wif's birthday, we were upgraded to the bridal suite and had a most enjoyable stay! The reception staff were friendly and efficient, and suggested a couple of great restaurants. Thank you so much!

<Content>nice! i stayed here, last year, i'd been meaning to write a review because i had such a great time here. The hotel from the outside isnt the most spectacular, inside it's standard looking with an old feel to it, not ugly at all, it worked. when we arrived, the staff were extremely nice, so helpful and always smiling. they even upgraded us to a canal view room which had amazing views, it definitely made our stay better. the breakfast buffet was delicious, a variety of breads, croissants, cheese, meats, bacon, eggs, sausages, marvelous! it was so tastey i made my boyfriend wake up early to eat with me! (he hates waking up early!) the room was clean, if not a little bit dusty and on the small side, but its perfect for two really considering you're only there to sleep. the bathroom was clean, they provide a few products which was nice. overall it was pleasant, the staff wonderfull and helpful and great food! will definitely come here again next time im in amsterdam!

<Content>Got Ripped Off Our plans changed, so we tried to change our internet reservation and we're told we'd be charged for one night as a cancellation charge, even though it was 3 weeks before the arrival date. We e-mailed back and forth over this, pointing out there was no such notice on the internet site and the reservation, although confusingly worded said, If you should cancel your reservation before 6:PM of your arrival day, you will not be charged any fees鈥?They were adamant and charged our credit card $222 for the cancellation.Now we're fighting through the Credit Card.My advice is be very careful with the NH Hotel chain and their policies and make sure your reservation is cancellable without penalty.

<Content>Mixed feelings We switched to this hotel on the fly while we were already in Amsterdam and disappointed with the nearby hotel we booked from home. We spotted the fascinating building and were attracted to the baroque, impressive lobby. We may have reconsidered our booking if we would have seen the room first. We went for the upgraded, canal view room. We also bought the package that includes the buffet breakfast which is excellent. The first room that was assigned to us at fifth floor made us turn around and ask for a different one. Not only that it was unacceptably small but also had small, cheap looking sliding windows. The second room was still quite worn out and in dire need of a facelift but at least had the old world flavour and class we desired. The bathroom was really basic and the shower malfunctioning and was not fixed throughout our stay.To the good parts. The hotel itself is beautiful and the dining hall above the canal is just perfect. Breakfast itself is well presented and tasty. The location is ideal away from main street tumult but still central. The front desk staff was absolutely fabulous! Throughout my many years in hotels all over the world I never run into a team so friendly and helpful. It was a pleasure. I think that the rooms' condition is known to the administration and well reflected in the relatively affordable fare. For this reason I consider that despite the drawbacks, the value for the money is good indeed. Overall we had a pleasant experience and would return to this hotel without hesitation.

<Content>NH Doelen, Amsterdam The NH Doelen in Amsterdam is in an excellent position, away from busy Dam Square and Central Station, yet within easy reach by foot of many of the main attractions. For example, Dam Square less than 10 minutes, Waterlooplein, Rembrandtplein, flower market, cruise boats - a couple of minutes. It's also in an attractive spot, and is fairly quiet. The hotel advertises itself as four-star, according to the hotel rating system in the Netherlands. I suspect it's similar to the star rating in the UK. It offers good value for money. The staff were excellent and friendly, and very eager to help. However, The Doelen is now looking rather tired and shabby. Our room, though of a reasonable size for a tourist city room, looked very 'nineties' in its furnishings and decor. It needed a makeover and, more importantly, a thorough clean. The net curtains had lost their whiteness some time ago; the upholstery on the easy chair was grubby; nooks and crannies were dusty; some of the wallpaper was peeling. The bathroom, on the other hand, had clearly been renovated, and was pleasant and well-stocked with good quality toiletries. The bedroom itself was well equipped.The pleasant dining room affords an attractive view over the canal. The lounge, with free internet access, was miserable. The reception lobby could be made to look fabulous in its Baroque-style decorations. But again, it really needs a facelift.All in all, we feel that The Doelen is a good quality 3-star hotel, so don't expect 4-star luxury.

<Content>Nice Hotel NH Doelen is a quaint hotel located near Amsterdam University in City Centre. Everything was within walking distance of the hotel. The rooms were small but clean and comfortable. The Hotel staff was extremely helpful with directions, what to see in the immdediate area and general information. We did not use the on site restaurant as it appeared rather pricey. There was considerable night noise with the windows open on the street side of the hotel. The canal view rooms might be wuiter, though more costly. We did get a very favorable, week-end rate below the average cost of many lower rated hotels.

<Content>Good location Just got back from a weekend spent at the Doelen, it's ideally located to walk to the Centraal station in 10 mins, or most places in the centre of town in a short time. Plenty of tram connections nearby, so could not fault it for visiting all the sights. Cons: Could be noisy from the streetSmall room, very difficult to move around the bed, table and chairs were in the way of the bathroom doorNo shower curtain for the in bath shower, resulted in slippery floor.Hotel breakfast not worth 17 euros- avoid!Bed could be bigger, but not in those rooms!Pros: Clean bathroomSheets  towels replaced daily, despite other reviewsHelpful reception staff who changed a room to a twin for us with no fuss at allBreakfast overlooking canalCoffee chain (not coffeeshop) downstairsI admit that the decor is a little tired looking and could use an update, but as long as you get a good price, the location is central and all you're doing there is sleeping so why worry! The canal rooms have a nice view of the Amstel, but beware the shared balcony with sudden drop! Be prepared for small rooms in Amsterdam everywhere.

<Content>Rooms could do with some TLC (tender loving care) I just got back from a recent weekend stay at this hotel. I had read the previous reviews but wanted to give it a try. First impressions on entering the reception area was wow, this looks lovely and looked very elegant. They had obviously spent money on the reception area and this made us look forward to seeing our rooms (there were four of us).Upon entering the room (twin 3rd Floor) we thought it was bright but the decor was very tired and could do with painting/touching up. I understand that they may want to keep the hotel's original features as it is definately not a modern hotel as the furniture looked tatty/cheap and I'm sure it would benefit from even better quality reproduction furniture. The bathroom didnt seem to match the room and we had a shower over the bath with no shower curtain, so of course water went everywhere. We mentioned this to reception did send someone up who told us that some bathrooms were not meant to have a shower curtain (which we thought was odd as there was a shower, so why no curtain?). We ended up using towels on the floor to mop up the water.I had read in previous reviews that some guests experienced noise and we did too at night time (our room was overlooking the canal) but I guess you can't control noise from the outside. On the last night there was also a sound like a loud humming noise but we couldn't quite work out where it was coming from.Whoever was meant to service our room during our stay on the 3rd floor didnt replace/fill any of the toiletries so we at one point had no hand soap and ran out of toilet roll. We also had to ask for more tea/milk as this wasnt restocked either. Having to ask repeatedly for things to be restocked/replaced for a four star hotel isnt acceptable. I think management should at least ensure that when things are running low in guest rooms they are replaced so guests dont have to keep asking for things - it just makes for a more relaxing stay. Upon returning to our room one day we saw one of the housekeeping ladies sat on the end of a bed in another room at the end of the corridor (the door was open) and as soon as she saw us she jumped up. This just made us wonder if they actually did any cleaning to our rooms at all whilst we are out.The other 2 in our party had a twin room on the 5th floor which was very small and warm (a fan was already provided).On the whole, Amsterdam was great, the location itself was great but I would not stay at this particular hotel again.

<Content>liked de doelen I stayed for business and liked the hotel. The room was nice and overlooking the Amstel river. A bit old fashioned furniture and decoration, but that has its charm. Service is good and friendly. Better value for money for me than their five star-neighboor.

<Content>Good experience in general, but noisy We stayed at NH Doelen for a long weekend. In general, we enjoyed our stay. It is a pretty hotel. The building is impressive with a nice view to the canal. The location is GREAT. The bed was nice and we had no problem with cleanliness in the sleeping area.However, hotel staff did not clean up the bathroom thoroughly after the first day. I almost thought if we had stayed at an aparthotel where bathroom cleaning is optional. Also as everybody else mentioned, it could be noisy in the morning. At first, I did not believe the reviews that I read before making the reservation but I finally experienced it myself.I was awaken very early in the morning (about 3-4 am) almost every day during our stay due to a loud engine noise from a big truck stopping in front of the building. The other day, a garbage truck also woke me up. I am wondering whether this inconvenience was caused by Hotel Europe  Cafe de Jaren that used this small street as their access to get their food/stock delivery. It is too bad that such a nice hotel has to loose its good reputation just because of the noise coming from this delivery truck. Well, anyway, the room rate is considerably low for any other hotel in the Rokin area.

<Content>Mini Bar Check Hotel has a great location, within walking distance to most places and the area also felt safe.The room was just meeting ok, could have done with new carpets and a good clean. Most annoyingly was the early morning knock on the door for ' mini bar check'. Even with a do not disturb on the door. We stayed for 4 days and it happened every morning, could this not be checked by housekeeping when we had left the room for the day? or after our 4 days, they had our credit card details. Good points about this hotel is its location, also it's worth asking for a room with a canal view . Bad Points- Cafe, disturbance and facilities

<Content>Nice Location We stayed there with our two kids in June, 2007 last Summer. I really liked the location being near Muntplein. It is a good location from which to walk in different directions and explore. We walked to Rembrandtplein and also up Kalverstradt to Dam Square, etc. I did not like the Central Station area. I like to walk and walk but my kids' legs got tired so we couldn't walk and explore Amsterdam as much as I would've liked to. We also liked the food area in Vroom and Dreesman (VD) Dept. store and the Hema store which are only a few mins. walk from the Doelen on Kalverstradt.The manager Monika (if I remember correctly) was very helpful and friendly. Yes, there was some dust under the bed, but overall the hotel was very nice. The hot water was too hot and the bathroom floor slippery when wet but no other problems. (The water was too hot also in the Ibis Amsterdam airport hotel). I think our room was room 510 ,looking northwest; we could see Dam Square and its blue flags from our balcony. I would stay at the Doelen again.

<Content>Liked the Doelen We have just stayed at the NH Doelen and to be honest after reading some of the reviews we were quite relieved to find it was actually ok.The room was clean, not too small,with all the usual bits, minibar tv, hairdrier, toiletries,safe. The bath had seen better days, and it helped if you had an athletic bent as it wasnt the easiest to get in and out of!( A bit of mould and mildew spray round the tiles wouldnt have gone amiss either), but it was a decent size and at least it did have a bath rather than just a shower. Clean towels daily. We had a 'ladies room' which had extra toiletries and new magazines, nicely decorated , maybe a little tired. round the edges The reception staff were all very pleasant.The location is great, and the area is lovely and close to just about everything,We would stay there again. The canal facing rooms are an extra 30euro.We would happily stay again.

<Content>A Good Stay We enjoyed our week's stay at the NH Doelen. It was a great location in the heart of Amsterdam and the staff was very friendly and accomodating. Breakfast was enjoyable and the rooms were small, but clean! I really enjoyed their line of bath products---good smelling body wash!

<Content>Well located but needs urgent refurm Stayed here one night and checked out the very next day. The room was of a descent size but had old cheap furniture, it was not particularly tidy, the television did not work and the bed was saggy. To make things worse they stop room service completely at 11pm and I was forced to go out to a nearby burger bar. All in all I was very unhappy and checked out in the morning. Unless you get a very cheap room rate - there are much much better hotels in Amsterdam to choose from. Indeed there are better NH hotels to choose from.The only thing I can say in its favour is that it is well located.

<Content>V Good if you get a good rate This hotel is well located, has good front of house staff, small rooms with big beds, interesting furniture, good bathrooms, and some good restaurants closeby. I found no problems with cleanliness. The bathroom in room 210 was bright and spotless but access to and from the bath/shower was awkward and would not suit an elderly person. I've stayed before and will again if I get a good price through Tripadvisor.

<Content>Not bad but expect better for the money Staff were very helpful and could reccommend some great restaurants, especially if you want something romantic or a decent seafood place. Rooms were small for the money and decorated fairly old, but still the bed was comfy. The bath was very difficult to get in and out of with 3/4 of it been shielded by a wall, glad i'm young and agile or this would have been a problem had i been a pensioner!! Location was fairly decent, been no more than a 10-15 minute walk from the major attractions.

<Content>dirty on our arrival we were assigned a room with a balcony; once entered in our room, I discovered that we had a common balcony with other clients who stayed in the first floor rooms; no privacy and no safety at all. so called french balcony doors had just a tiny lock on them. I called right away to the reception and ask to have an another room without this problem. they said it was no problem and a cleaning lady came very soon to show us way in our new room; same floor, same problem however there was no balcony access just a huge window with the same safety and privacy problems. this felt like they would have been just kidding with us. both of the rooms were extremely dusty and very old fashioned. i run a hotel business myself and i am very familiar with these things. only good thing in this hotel is its location and the quality of toiletries that were in the bathroom; however we received just a small bottle of shower gel and shampoo that were not replaced after the first night. actually it felt like somebody just redid our bed but did not do the necessary daily cleaning in the room because even empty shower gel/shampoo/water bottless were not even removed. well i was not supriced of this after having wiped off almoust a 1 cm layer of dust away from the side boards. while checking out i heard a conversation between a spanish client and a lady working in the reception; this poor client wanted to change his room, but the receptionist refused to hear this and was just repeating that the hotel manager is on vacation. shouldn't there be somebody that replaces him/her? i think that the hassle had something to do with the noise coming from the street side and the receptionist pretended that this client should had been intelligent enough to ask a room on the other side when he made his booking; well, if you are planning to book this hotel be sure that you ask for cleaning as well. the only one who felt honest with a truly honest smile was the darked hair guy who worked in the evening shift.

<Content>Tired and tatty My husband and I stayed at the Doelen for 3 nights in April. It is a very long story but I really thought I had booked the Hotel d'Europe (the hotel next door and in a different class although it looks similar from the outside). Silly me!The hotel (Doelen) is without a doubt tired and in need of some TLC. All areas are slightly shabby and in some instances would not require a massive expenditure to bring them up to scratch. For instance, the floor of the lift (elevator) is really tatty and for a small financial outlay this could be remedied. The lift is one of the first things you see.Our bedroom was, to say the least, compact and I can't see that any great improvements could be made without the hotel losing some occupancy. Ideally three rooms should be made into two. Due to lack of space we could not open our minibar 鈥?not a good idea from a profit point of view. Trying to make a cup of tea in such a tiny room was a visual comedy. It did, though, have a kettle which is a nice touch but they could have been a little more generous with the tea, milk etc.On the plus side it is in a great location - very convenient, friendly and helpful staff, the bathroom was not bad, the toiletries above average and we weren't disturbed by any noise.One morning we sampled the hotel's breakfast (鈧?17) and I have to say it is typical of most hotels鈥?fare. At first sight it looked fine but on closer inspection there was not a lot there. Uninspiring food and we struggled to scrape together a breakfast. As I said previously this seems to be the norm at most hotels and we have nicknamed it 鈥渢he corporate croissant鈥?From our previous experience of Amsterdam hotels I would suggest either the Renaissance (Club level) which is great for winter visits or the Putitzer. The extra cash is well worth it. Both do very good deals.

<Content>great hotel We stayed at the nh doelen, booked through lastminute.com which was the cheapest price around. it was a last minute trip booked a week in advance, thoroughly enjoyed the hotel staff, the room was very nice, maid service every day, chocolates on the pillow! all very smart and helpful staff. Great location only 5 mins walk from dam square, great little bar/cafe on the corner of the street which was great value whilst watching the world go by, by the river flowing just by it. The only thing we were suprised to notice when we left was that the hotel charges 5.99 euros per night per room of your stay as a hotel room charge which is a dutch thing apparantely so beware. other than great hotel, very smart and really quite posh!

<Content>Decent, Fantastic Location and Charming Suite I had a grand view, a lovely balcony, decent d茅cor and an overall pleasant stay. The location is a perfect starting point for making your way around to the most interesting parts of town. I hear that the rooms are small but the suite is ideal value for the money. Most often you get a lot more satisfaction out a 4 star suite than a 5 star superior room. I expect this to be true of most 4 star rated hotels and in this case this logic applies well. You get a Jacuzzi and a great bed, charming historic surroundings and the staff is obliging. Granted there is no ultra modern d茅cor but you would not want it to be, the tame, non imposing traditional feel is what makes for a place of character. My partner an I aim to go again the first weekend of August, we will report if our feelings about this place are in any way changed.So to conclude, when you consider the other options available in the city, the suite at this hotel makes great value for the money you pay and an excellent alternative to a 5 star superior room.

<Content>NH Doelen - good location NH Doelen from the outside is lovely. The room was small and compact and we barely had room to move around. My boyfriend  stayed there for 3 nights. I did not think the room was clean at all, finding hairs in the towels and in the bed on arrival.I personally would not recommend staying at this hotel until the cleaning policy has been reviewed. The decor in the communal areas are dated. The only good thing going for it was the location, you can walk to most places without getting on the tram or any other public transport.

<Content>Slightly Above Average Hotel NH Doelen from the outside is breathtakingly beautiful. It sits nicely right on the Amstel ... My boyfriend  stayed there for 6 nights and although our room was small (it was necessary for us to unpack because there was no where for us to put our suitcases) ... Although the room was small, the bathroom was quiet spacious ... The room and hotel was extremly clean and all in all, we enjoyed our stay! I'd suggest asking for a room at the back of the hotel so you have a nice view of the river ...

<Content>Great Hotel in Great location Just back from a 2 night stay at this hotel and was a liitle worried about staying after some of the reviews that were posted.Our room was at the front of the hotel and was very spacious with a lovely modern bathroom.The staff were very nice and friendly.A good hotel to stay in as you are within walking distance of Dam Square Anne Frank's house etc.Well worth a visit and will certainly stay again on our next visit to Amsterdam.

<Content>The absoulte worst hotel in Amsterdam! This is probably the worst hotel in the entire city of Amsterdam. Although a good location the actual hotel is appauling. The room size is no bigger than a rabbit hutch. The hotel blub states its old world charm and elegance - to those in the real world it just means dirty and old fashioned. Wallpaper hanging off, a small amount of scribble around the lift plates, chipped laminate flooring in the lift, threadbare carpet. Lets move onto breakfast - cold and miserable, thats just the staff! The food was bland and tasteless which might explain my upset stomach later in the day and subsequent evening. If I could reccommend a hotel to be closed down, fumigated and started again this would be it. Avoid this hotel at all costs!

<Content>Terrible hotel. This february we stayed at the NH Doelen hotel in Amsterdam. On the NH website the hotel is described as a wonderful four star hotel. Because of this and some good reviews we read on tripadvisor we decided to stay at this hotel. When we arrived at the hotel we were immedaitely dissapointed. The lobby is extremely small and there is just one (very small) elevator. When you arrive with a couple of suitcases you might have a problem taking them all up to your room at once. The staff was overall friendly, but not very proffesional. They couldn't even be bothered to greet you in the morning. The room was plain awful. It was an extremely small room (don't go there if you suffer from claustrofobia). There was a spiderweb (with a spider) in the corner of our room. The wallpaper was peeling of off the walls, the bathroom (with mildew at no extra charge) dated from back in the eighties. The minibar was covered with a layer of dust. I probably missed the wonderful breakfast other people wrote about on tripadvisor, because the breakfast I went to didn't impress me at all. The breakfast starts at 7 AM. We arrived at 715 AM. By that time the eggs and pancakes were already cold (how is this possible). Two bowls of yoghurt, a couple of dutch boterhammen and cold eggs next to a bottle of cheap champagne just don't do it for me. Just as everything else in this hotel the roomservice was very poor as well. I ordered an overpriced lasagna (16 euro's or $21) which was served lukewarm (pretty disgusting). Yet another big disappointment. The only positive note is that there are ear plugs available in the room which you will need because the rooms are very noisy. You can hear the TV and conversations of your neighbours and the constant slamming of doors in the hotel.If this is considered a four star hotel in The Netherlands then I do not want to know what a 3 or 2 star hotels in The Netherlands might look like. This is an absolute disgrace. My advice: if you visit Amsterdam avoid this hotel.

<Content>Excellent Hotel Stayed at this hotel in November 2006, the hotel is in a superb location overlooking the canals away from the noisier parts of Amsteradam. There is a nice selection of shops and bars, a short stroll from the hotel. All the staff here were very helpfull, rooms were cleaned every day, breakfast although a bit pricy was very nice. Although the hotel is starting to look a bit tired and could do with updating a little bit, I would thoroughly recomend staying here.

<Content>Fantastic hotel in an ideal location! I stayed at this hotel in January 2005 for a 4 night city break with my boyfriend and we couldn't have enjoyed our stay enough!The hotel is located overlooking the canel down a quiet backstreet in the centre of the city. We had a room overlooking the road on the otherside of the canal which was fine and I didn't notice any noise like other tripadvisors did.The room itself was a little bit small but the decor and furniture were all to the standard of what you would expect from a 4* hotel!Breakfast was exceptional with everything you could want from cereals, yoghurt, fruit, cooked, continental etc and there was even champagne and classical music playing in the elegant dining room while you ate!It is situated about an hours drive from the airport but the easiest thing to do is to head to the train station at the airport and head straight to the city centre and its about a 15 minute walk to the hotel or you can simply hop in a cab or on a tram and it will drop you right outside!Amsterdam is a fab city and everything is best explored on foot with the red light district, city centre and Ann Franks house all with easy walking distance. The arts quarter is about a 15/20 minute walk away however but its a lovely stroll so we didn't mind!I thoroughly recommend the canal boat rides and Ann Franks house for things to do but I did find the Van Gogh museum a bit overpriced (but thats my opinion!)Overall this hotel is great if you want to see the sights and sounds that the city has to offer!

<Content>Great Hotel The locality of the hotel is excellent overlooking the canal on one side. We stayed in room 218 for two nights and had our own double balcony which was superb. Room was very acceptable as we only paid 拢110 per night including breakfast, which I must say was good value. As far as cleanliness is concerned we did not find the hotel dusty as the previous review stated. Room was cleaned and towels and bedding changed daily. Breakfast was excellent value and a superb view over the canal whilst you are tucking into a hot or cold breakfast. Reception was very accommodating and helpful as we had booked a non smoking and they had allocated us a smoking room, they changed this without too much effort, which is a bonus. I would definately stay at this hotel again mainly due to the locality as the other hotels around Dam Square are noisy from traffic and also they are putting a new metro line in so the cranes and diggers are working all the time.

<Content>Doelen Fading? Judging by the other reviews (most recent May 06), the Doelen may be having some difficulties. I stayed there for 3 nights with my family in two delux twin rooms over the first weekend in August. It was the Gay Pride Carnival weekend and we expected lots of noise, but with two canal side rooms, (2nd floor and 5th floor) it wasn't too bad and the noise moderated somewhat after midnight. The Hotel seems to have had better times, and the lack of a bar or a restaurant, (though the in-room information still says there is!), means no atmosphere. The rooms are probably 3 Star quality and despite what some other reveiwers have said, the level of cleanliness was barely acceptable, but certainly not 4 star standard. The rooms and corridors were dingy and dust and cobwebs were in evidence throughout. All the extras were expensive, and overall I got the feeling of Faded elegance. Compares badly with the excellent Banks Mansion. One bright point was the superb breakfast in what must have been at one time, an impressive restaurant/dining room.

<Content>Enjoyed my stay Nice hotel. Rooms as in all Dutch hotels are small, but mine was very nice. I really liked the location and general ambience of the hotel. No language problems and staff was very helpful and friendly. I was a little put off with the 25 Euro per day for internet access, but you can walk to the American bookstore and get it for free. Mini bar well stocked but pricey as well.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Location From the minute we got there we knew we';d picked a good one! The lobby is gorgeous all white marble and very well kept. Our room was small, and I would suggest you request a room with a canal view, but other than that it was really clean, comfortable and a lovely escape for when you need to relax away from the city. The only other thing that was slightly negative was that we didn't even realise there was a restaurant until we checked out. Its very hidden and even though room service menus were in the room it not very well advertised. We had an absolutly wonderful five days in amsterdam and this hotel was definitly a big part of that, mainly because of its brilliant location. You can literally walk to everything and we didn't use public transport once. I would definitely stay there again and would recommend it to anyone. (Its also very reasonable for central Amsterdam).

<Content>Slightly above average Not a 4 star by any stretch but certainly more than a 3. Room had some nice pieces of furniture but was slightly tatty around the edges. We had a nice balcony but was a bit too cold to stay out there for too long... And certainly wouldn't recommend going there in the height of summer as their idea of air conditioning is a fan on top of the TV... Bed was also very soft and the towels were not 100% clean. On a more positive note, the room had large windows and high ceilings which was quite impressive on entry. We found the staff to be friendly too and didn't have any real complaints about our stay. Location was good as all major attractions were accesible by foot and we only used the tram to get to the station and back with our bags. All in all, hotel was fine for what we wanted but you can get better value for your money than this.

<Content>Loved the Doelen Seeing as we passed plenty of hotels from arrival at Schipol airport to the City of Amsterdam, ranging from boutique to small BB's, we were hoping that our hotel would impress.... and it did just that. Situated next to the luxury Europa Hotel on the canal the hotel is rather pleasing on the eye. The interior did not fail to please either. Our room wasn't large, but it was very welcoming and cosy and had everything that we needed for our four day stay. Location-wise we couldn't have asked for more. Only a very short walk from Munt Plein and the trams stops everything was within a short distance in either direction. The staff were friendly and only too pleased to accommodate us when we requested taxis and information. The only downside to this hotel is that is does not have a bar - the only bar in the mini one in your room. However, it does have a wonderful contemporary coffee shop adjoining at the reception which does every latte and cappuccino in the book.If you are looking for a good location, friendly staff, clean rooms and lots of character, then the Doelen has it all. A bonus for us was that we had a canal view room and I must say what a view.We were a short walk from various restaurants, shops and the main attractions, so everywhere was in walking distance.We would not hesitate in staying here again as it made our stay in Amsterdam's wonderful city a very pleasant one. Thank you to the Doelen.

<Content>Quaint n' Cozy If you're looking for a good BB-type of place in a central location, then this is it. Size is all relative depending on what you're interested in...You don't need much room if you're just sleeping in bed and taking a shower with your loved one. The hotel is very historic-looking with authentic furniture, decor and tapestry. It gives the overall appeal of an early-1900s hotel and doesn't need any special bells n' whistles. I do agree, the walls are thin and noise from the hallways is often heard - but we weren't in the room that often. The breakfast, although a bit pricey, is overall very good - especially the home-made multi-grain bread! It's more than a typical European breakfast; they serve scrambled eggs, mini-pancakes, fresh fruit, cereal, everything. The hotel really is a short walk from many key districts such as Bloemenmarkt (flower mkt), Leidsplein (clubs/bars/nightlife), Rembrandtplein (restaurant row) and the infamous Red Light district. We didn't have to use the tram at all since everything was so close by. The hotel staff was very helpful giving us directions, accomodating our early check-in, and suggesting good restaurants. One tip to suggest though, if you stay here, be sure to put the Do not disturb sign on the door, or else an unexpected maid may enter. Overall, had a great time at this hotel and would stay here again. The canal view is lovely. It's a great 3star hotel if that's what you're interested in.

<Content>NH Doelen is Great, but Watch out for Canal Mosquitos! Overall, I was pleased with the Doelen. However, I would recommend NOT getting a room with a canal view in the warm months when the window needs to be open. The room gets a bit stuffy, so we kept our window open, and as a result we were attacked by canal mosquitos that left giant bug bites unlike any mosquito bites I've ever gotten in the US! The more you scratched, the bigger they got, to the size of about US quarters. And boy did they itch!! Regardless, there is a great coffee shop attached to the Doelen that came in handy quite a bit. The staff were fantastic - real friendly, and the location is great too.

<Content>Doelen, Amsterdam Goodish location, scrupulouslly clean , helpful, competent staff . No language problems. Dull atmosphere, no bar, no animation, no evening 'socialising' and the room was, overall, SMALL and cramped. The furniture was space-consuming, there were no in-built wardrobe areas as such, so the furniture intruded into the walk-about area. There was no air-conditioning, only an efficient but inadequate fan system, and the TV was ill-positioned such as to be only viewable from a very limited area. The hotel had the general ambience of a commercial rather than a tourist one.

<Content>Just So-So I have to say I was disappointed. We stayed for a week in mid-May. Our room was shabby, not as nice as the pictures. The biggest problem, though: the paper-thin walls. I realize this is an historic hotel, but the reality is, if you plan to sleep past 7 am, this is not the hotel for you. Every morning I awoke (much earlier than I wanted since I was on vacation) to the banging of all the doors up and down the hall and you could literally hear, word for word, what was being said in the room next door at a conversational tone. I am a heavy sleeper and usually have no complaints about noise in hotels, but this place really takes the cake. Also, the last night of our stay the weather warmed up and without air-conditioning we had to open the window (reasonable except that there are no screens) and I got eaten alive by mosquitos. Even with the little fan the room was still stifling hot. The location is ideal, though, so that did work out well. I would not, however, stay here again.

<Content>No respect for tradition I stayed at the Doelen at least a dozen times between 2000 and 2004, but I will never stay there again. They had a bar/restaurant, the Balmoral, that was an architectural and artistic treasure (in addition to having wonderful food). The new owners, to save a little money, destroyed the Balmoral and all of its lovely details and replaced it with a Coffee Company. No hotel that has so little respect for tradition should be patronized. The Doelen is a hotel to avoid.

<Content>OK hotel We stayed in a non-smoking room at the NH Doelen in late April 2005 and had booked through Lastminute.com, so for Amsterdam the price was reasonable. Desk staff were friendly and spoke good English. Our rate did not include breakfast and we were offered this at 16 Euros per person for a full English breakfast. The room was not one of their better ones (I presume), it was a bit tired and jaded. The room was small and a bit claustrophobic but perfectly adequate if just used for sleeping. The bathroom had once been well presented but now needed refurbishing. It had a large bath with a decent shower attachment as well as a good wash basin area. The room contained a double bed, a small table and two chairs, a mini-bar, a tv and a safe. The wardrobe was a reasonable size but two shelves were taken up by what we first thought was a welcoming half bottle of red wine. Fortunately we discovered the price list hidden behind it before sampling it. There were two small bottles of water on the side table - each labelled with the price of 2.5 Euros. Room service was available with a small menu of food and drink at reasonable prices. The position of the hotel was fine, having plenty of restaurants in the close vicinity and just a twenty minute walk from the station. We stayed for 5 days and the general impression of Amsterdam was that we would return at some stage in the future. It seemed to be a very expensive city (more so than London). As non-smokers it was surprising to find that the smell of marijuana being smoked was quite pleasant when compared with tobacco.
