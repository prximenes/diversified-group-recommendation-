<Content>Great place, great location! My husband and i came to florence for an early anniversary trip. this hotel was great! we stayed in room #1- the fresco room and it was beautiful. it was huge and the bathroom was much bigger than i was expecting. It is basically at the foot of the duomo and a great home base. it feels more like a bed and breakfast than a hotel so it is very charming.

<Content>Some disappointments First the good part: Location was fantastic. Our windows literally looked directly at the Duomo. We walked to almost all the major sights on our list. Beautiful decor and appointments throughout. Our room very contemporary, the salon-breakfast room traditional. Buffet breakfast well stocked with coffee, tea, chocolate, pastries, breads, cheeses, yogurt, juices. Extra charge for eggs, etc. with which we did not bother. Notebook computer available in salon for guest use. All that was great, but given the challenges and disappointments we encountered, we would have been better off going elsewhere and saving quite a few Euros a night. My daughter and I were traveling together and wanted a two room suite so that each of us would have our own space. We were told that the Dome suite would work very nicely. The price of 500 Euros was steep, but we thought sharing the same suite and viewing the Dome from our suite would be great fun. To our surprise and disappointment, the two rooms were actually separated only by a curtain -- not our idea of a two room suite. Before booking we explained that I have a problem with stairs and were told that access to the suite from the elevator landing was up only 8 stairs. There were actually 15 stairs which doesn't sound like a big difference, but definitely was for me. The room got very warm, but when we asked that the air conditioning be turned on, we were told that only heat was available this time of year. When I suggested that at 500 Euros a night air conditioning should be possible, arrangements were finally made. There were ongoing communication problems with reception staff. We were told that two massages could not be scheduled simultaneously and so agreed to two separate massage times. When two therapists arrived with no prior notice to us that simultaneous massages were possible after all, my daughter had already left to assure privacy to me. Lesson learned: confirm all arrangements at least twice.

<Content>A gem in the centre of Florence This is a wonderful gem of a hotel right in the middle of Florence across the road from the Duomo and easy walking distance to most attractions.My husband and I stayed in the fresco room which was beautiful. We were there for five nights.The staff could not have been nicer and were so helpful not only when booking but ensuring that tickets were reserved for us at the major museums we had selected.The only problem was being so central, we ended up with very sore feet at the end of the day but it was so nice to return to the Palazzo. You leave the bustle of the outside and enter a calm courtyard.I cannot recommend this hotel enough and would certainly stay there again on our next visit to Florence..

<Content>Luxurious stay at Niccolini al Duomo The Palazzo Niccolini al Duomo was a wonderful base from which to explore Florence. It is an atmospheric palazzo situated right next to the Cathedral you are in the centre of the historic town. There is a private door from the street leading into a courtyard and a staircase or lift up to the reception area of the hotel.The rooms were very comfortable, with ample storage space. My room was well decorated and had plenty of natural light, as it looked onto an internal courtyard. The bathroom was huge. Everything was spotlessly clean.The reception were helpful and booked all our museum tickets for us so we didn't have to queue up. They also offered to organise various tours. There was a very generous breakfast in the beautiful drawing room of the palace. The large room is full of antique furniture and paintings and had a very luxurious, historic feel. On a practical note, there was a computer with internet access for guests in the drawing room. The staff were all very courteous and helpful.This place comes highly recommended to enjoy the historic city centre.

<Content>Location, spacious, elegant -- worth it! Overall, a truly excellent experience and worth the price (indeed, we could not have gotten rooms like this for the money in any of the high-end Florence hotels, yet we felt surrounded by elegance here). We had asked for the fresco room, but apparently it had been given to someone else, and we were put in a room on the main level. We had a large bedroom, as well as a good sized living room with sofa bed, and a nice bathroom (athough the shower stall leaked and the hair dryer had some issues). The ceilings were perhaps 15 feet. It was spacious and gracious -- we never missed the fresco (although perhaps they ought not to promise it if they aren't going to keep the promise). The location is utterly fantastic (unless you want to be on the river). Not even half a block from the duomo, yet everything is quiet inside the palazzo. Breakfast was great -- a good range of things, many of them very yummy, and all in the sitting room with its painted walls and more high ceilings. What a great place to come back to after a day playing tourist in the heat of a Florence summer. We were happy not to be in a hotel with lots of people after spending most of the day in crowds. The people at the desk were pleasant, but we were not thrilled with the restaurant recommendations (still, our experience was that it is actually somewhat difficult to find very good food in Florence at less than expensive restaurants unless you really do your homework or have a friend in the know -- but for a great traditional and inexpensive lunch try Mario's in the central market area and for a great traditional Florentine dinner, try Sostanza).

<Content>Wonderful location This property couldn't ask to be better situated. When we checked in we were upgraded at no cost, which was a pleasant surprise. The room we were given was huge and amazing - vaulted ceilings, views of the duomo, original fresco, antique furniture, and a huge floor plan. The owner/manager were frequently on site and they were very helpful. Some of the other staff wasn't spectacular, but no real problems. A nice sitting room for breakfast, no complaints!

<Content>Fabulous accommodations, location  Only twenty paces from the Duomo - very quiet yet in the heart of Florence, with wonderful classy, very clean rooms, great staff  a tasty breakfast buffet in a gorgeous drawing room. One could not ask for more. This is the place to stay in Florence. The Palazzo Niccolini al Duomo's owners put a lot of thought and money into restoring this renaissance palace to provide a first class accommodations; sumptuous, well appointed rooms, modern baths, beautiful decor. Nothing is left to chance and all was wonderfully memorable, including generous help with museum reservations, restaurants, airport transfers etc. Stay there, you will not regret it.

<Content>Great experience The Palazzo Niccolini apparently was once a palace. SInce our room had a 20 foot ceiling, I believe it. The building is probably a few hundred years old; however our room and the common areas were all beautiful and included all modern amenities. They have a large salon where they serve breakfast and drinks at night. It actually felt more like a BB than a hotel. They also offer free internet access in the salon, and I saw people using WIFI. The location of the hotel is amazing - about 20 yards from the Duomo. Be aware that is you are driving, parking in the hotel's courtyard is 30 euros per day. Overall, a great experience at a very reasonable price.

<Content>Great Location, homey setting Our family of 4 (parents and two children) stayed at this hotel from August 2 - 6, 2007. We were booked into Suite #10, which included the following:One Bedroom with King BedOne Bedroom with 2 twin beds2 bathrooms1 Sitting roomThis suite is very large and furnished with antiques, although not as nice as some of the pictures on the hotel's website (this suite is not featured). The sitting room has no windows, so it is a bit dark.The staff is very friendly and helpful and the breakfast buffet (which is included in the room rate) is nice, but not extensive. Overall, we were pleased with the property - the location is fabulous - literally steps from the Duomo. However, there were a few things that were mildly disappointing:Because my husband was on business for part of our stay, I was very specific in stating our need for wireless internet in the room. I was assured in multiple e-mails from the hotel that the suite was equipped with wireless internet. Unfortunately, our suite, which was on the top floor of the hotel was out of range for the hotel's wireless system (which is installed on the 2nd floor). As a result, my husband spent several hours a day in the hotel living room conducting business.Also, the management does not tell you that in addition to the 10 hotel rooms in the Palazzo, the owners rent out several units as housing. On our floor, there were at least 3 apartments that were rented out and used the common entrance. The unit next door was occupied by a family with small children and the vestibule was crowded with strollers, etc. making it difficult to get in and out of our suite. The family also entertained a large group (7-8 people) late one night, which was a bit disruptive. Because there is no hotel staff on duty after 8:30, there was no one to contact about this problem.I am not sure that we would stay here again. The location is fabulous, but for nearly 500 euros a night I expected a more professional environment.

<Content>Private Palazzo This is a perfect spot in Central Florence literally steps from the Duomo. It is a real Palazzo! The staff were top-notch with the best dinner recommendations. We loved every restaurant! We had a family suite - 3 bedrooms and 3 baths with our own TV sitting room. It was beautiful and very Italian! Breakfast was great - very comfortable. Have already recommended this place to friends and they have already booked a stay!

<Content>Nice Property, Somewhat Noisy The Palazzo Niccolini is a lovely, small property with personal service and beautiful rooms. The only issue we had with the Palazzo was the street noise. The property is VERY centrally located (right at the Duomo) which is both a great advantage and a huge disadvantage as street partiers can be heard until the very wee hours of the morning. Opening your window for fresh air is not a possibility due to the noise. Otherwise, we loved the hotel.

<Content>Wonderful Gem The Palazzo Niccolini al Duomo is a wonderful, small inn in the heart of Florence. We greatly enjoyed our 3-night there, and will undoubtedly return. My wife and I were in the Empire Suite, complete with a beautiful fresco on the 20-foot high ceiling, a view of the Duomo, a huge amount of space, and a luxurious bath. A very nice breakfast was delivered to our room each morning. The common living room was beautiful, and there was free internet service. The front desk staff, and Mrs. Niccolini, were very helpful. The Palazzo only has nine rooms, so it is an intimate place to stay. It is the heart of the historic district, however, so you should be aware that there are quieter places to stay. We loved it, and look forward to our return.

<Content>carefull with your creditcard number!!! On April 3rd 2007 I had planed a one night stay in Palazzo Niccolini. I booked the hotel by telephone 5 days in advance. one day later I got a confirmation via e-mail. Due to a personal problem I had to cancel my trip to Italy - that was still 2 days before the planed arrival. The hotel cashed in the whole amount of 650,-éˆ§?for the 2 rooms for that one night from my credit card, pointing out that the hotels cancellation policy require a 7 days cancellation in advance.

<Content>Unique opportunity! The Palazzo Niccolini is a lovely place to spend time in Florence. It is not the usual big hotel but rather 10 fabulous rooms in the family's palazzo. The setting is worthy of a Merchant Ivory production; everything is restored and modern, but evocative of a much earlier time. The staff made all our reservations for dinners and tours and tourguides- all of which were exceptional. We would give it the highest rating for a vacation in Florence. Tom and Kathy Stokes

<Content>Loved It, best hotel i stayed at in Europe we stayed in the suite from the website with the frescos and it was great. After having very small standard european rooms we were booked into one of their standard rooms. I saw it and it was nice, but I asked if they had a suite available. The lady showed me all of the different rooms and I asked to stay at the one with the frescos and luckily it was open that evening. We only stayed one night, but I loved it. The location is great, Our taxi was able to get quite close and it was awesome. I would recommend anyone stay here.

<Content>Absolutely ideal A few steps from the Duomo, this hotel is gorgeous, with a friendly, helpful staff. We stayed with our extended family in one large suite, a connecting room, and two smaller (but lovely) rooms, and couldn't have been more pleased. Breakfast was delicious and served in a spacious, bright, beautifully painted and furnished room; the rooms featured elegant furnishings and in some cases wonderful painted ceilings. The hotel is ideally located in the center of Florence and yet is surprisingly quiet. Between the lovely rooms, the wonderful staff, and the fantastic location, this is the place to stay in Florence - we'll definitely be back.

<Content>magical My husband and I stayed here and it was just what we needed after all the hustle and bustle of Rome. We Stayed in a 5 star in Rome. But, this hotel was by far our favorite. We loved the personal service and extra touchs . They helped us make reservations at a muesum and at a wonderful steak house. They do leave around 8:30 pm but, we just left a note on the desk for a wake up call. Liked the quitness . Everyone spoke good English with a wonderful welcoming smile. The breakfast was excellent. The rooms very clean and fresh. Our suite had a beautiful claw foot tub. There is no better location. There is a good resturant right below the hotel .If you want lots of action and a stuffy hotel with a doorman and such. This is not your hotel.IF you want a special place to stay after a busy day of siteseeing and shopping. This is it.I can't think of a negative thing to say. We just wished we could have stayed longer .

<Content>Fantastic We saved this hotel for the last night of our honeymoon and booked the dome suite (got 200 euros off as it was last minute booking) It was great - such fun - you have your own jacuzzi in the lounge - overlooking the duomo. If you don't like jacuzzi's - then don't book this room - as the actual bedroom is standard. A lovely place - no big signs outside - just a small sign on the big wooden doors that lead there. Boutique and beautiful. Free internet access. You have your breakfast in the main lounge - amongst all the gorgeous decor. Some of the other rooms seemed great too -the receptionist showed us around.

<Content>Wonderful! We stayed at the Palazzo for our honeymoon, with a recommendation from Rick Steves in his Italy 2006 book. We stayed in a suite which had its own living room complete with miniature plasma TV. If the closed off doors had entered upon a kitchen, we could've sworn we had our own Italian apartment in the heart of Florence, esp. since one of the keys opened the automatic gate from the street, making it feel like it your own place in the city.The Duomo is visible from the hotel room (30 second walk) and if you have a chance try the deliciously affordable pizzerias just around the corner. Only quirks...hot water was a bit difficult to get right; turned it a cm and it was scalding, the other way freezing.We drove there from Venice and you can park your car for 30 euros/ night in the hotel's own courtyard. Also, they have delicious breakfast, plentiful books/resources for you to lounge about and read in the gorgeous drawing room and FREE internet access on a discreet laptop appropriately tucked away in the corner.

<Content>Very relaxing Very relaxing atmosphere right in the centre of the historic centre of Florence. Our room overlooked the Duomo and all the important museums; churches, sights are within easy walking distance.The staff were extremely helpful and pleasant without being obtrusive in any way. They will book restaurants, museum tickets etc. In fact it's a good idea to book tickets for the Uffizi and Accademia in advance so you avoid the queues. Palazzo Niccolini is in fact a luxury bed and breakfast. There's no restaurant. Breakfast is served in the drawing room and is very good.Highly recommended

<Content>Living in style.. We stayed for a week and thoroughly enjoyed our stay - great room, great breakfasts, very helpful staff, and what a setting...close to the Duomo in a historic palazzo! The warm swirled pastries for breakfast with the vanilla custard were mouthwatering (stop, stop, don't drool on the keyboard..). Its pricey, but you will undoubtedly enjoy your stay.

<Content>Perfect...Everything We just returned from a 12 day trip to italy. We began our stay at the Palazzo Niccolini al Duomo. What a perfect introduction! The hotel is a hidden gem. It is within sight of the Duomo and in a perfect location for getting around the city. The staff, decor, and breakfast were above and beyond. I would highly recommend this treasure. I can't wait to go back.

<Content>Magnificent My wife and I stayed in the Dome Suite, and our children had a double superior (Room 1). This hotel offers no amenities other than an attentive staff and a beautifully decorated common room, which is where they serve a decent breakfast (cereal, yogurt, fresh fruit, bread, croissants, fresh juice, coffee, etc). Wifi is provided free of charge in this room. Room 1 was right by the front door, and the kids complained a little about the noise from the door opening and shutting. The room was just big enough, but its bathroom was fabulous - in fact it was larger than the bathroom in the suite. The Dome Suite was excellent. Its two highlights are windows that provide stunning views - mainly of the Duomo, but also of the surrounding hills, and a platform jacuzzi in the living room. This is the perfect room to splurge on. The location is central - it is literally across the street from the Duomo - and the staff made great meal recommedations. La Giostra was one of the best dinners we have had anywhere in the world. All in all this was a great choice for us.

<Content>A Home Away From Home I'd like to call the Palazzo Niccolini Florence's hidden gem. For our honeymoon in October, 2003, we stayed at the Palazzo Niccolini for 7 nights. Our travel agent told us it was a newly restored mansion, but I couldn't find any reviews on it, so I was a bit hesitant. We decided to go for it and it was the BEST thing we could have done! From the moment we arrived, the staff was so helpful and friendly. We were amazed how much character the hotel had. I highly recommend staying in the Junior Suite (approx. 300 EU at the time). It has frescoe walls all around the room. Can't beat artwork in your own room. Fresh fruit and flowers were waiting for us on the table. You're not limited to only staying in your room, they allow you to relax in the dining/lounge area as well, which we found to be very peaceful and quiet. Once again, the service was excellent. Maura, the front desk person was a joy. She offered great advice on local places to eat, helped us book several tours, and she met our every need. Breakfast was waiting for us every morniing. The location was great! The Duomo was right across the street. Everything was within walking distance. This hotel is too good to be true. Since the amount of rooms are limited (they only rent out 6 rooms or so), it has a very warm feel to it. It's more private. What really made our trip so special was the fact that you're not treated just like a regular guest at the Palazzo Niccolini, you're treated more like family, so you feel very comfortable and at home. So if you're looking for a more quiet, friendly, family oriented place to stay, I highly recommend staying there. It's reasonably priced for the quality of service and amount of space you get. It's a home away from home.Hope this review helps.
